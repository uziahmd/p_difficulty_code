He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure of the snowflake.\n\nFrom the description:\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those leaves) are connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So the process is like building layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's consider the steps.\n\nLet me model this. Let's say the initial step is level 0: 1 node.\n\nThen, level 1: add k nodes connected to the root. Now total nodes is 1 + k.\n\nThen, for each subsequent step, all the leaves (which are the nodes added in the previous step) get k new children. Each such node adds k new nodes. So for each level, the number of new nodes added is (number of leaves from previous level) * k.\n\nBut what's the pattern here?\n\nLet me think for a few steps. Suppose we have m levels. Let's see:\n\nLevel 0: 1 node. (root)\nLevel 1: add k nodes. Total nodes: 1 + k. These k nodes are leaves.\nLevel 2: each of the k leaves gets k new nodes. So adding k*k nodes. Total nodes: 1 + k + k^2. Now the leaves are the ones added in level 2, which are k^2 in number.\nLevel 3: each of these leaves gets k new nodes. Adding k^3 nodes. Total nodes: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on.\n\nBut the process requires that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two levels: the initial step (level 0 and level 1) and then adding level 2. Because the step of adding new nodes to leaves (the first step) must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes to the root. Then, the next step is adding to each leaf (those k nodes) their own k children. So that's at least one step. So the minimal snowflake would have 1 + k + k^2 nodes. For example, when k=4, the minimal snowflake has 1+4+16=21 nodes? But the example says that for n=6, the answer is NO, but for n=13 it's YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait the example input includes 6 as a test case and output is NO. Let me check. For example, let's see possible n's.\n\nLet me think for k=2. Let's see:\n\nIf we have 1 level (only the initial step), but according to the problem statement, the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal is two steps. So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. For k=2, that's 1+2+4=7. So for n=6, it's not possible. Which matches the sample input where n=6 outputs NO.\n\nAnother example: n=13. Let's see. Let's see if there exists a k where 1 + k + k^2 =13. Let's solve k² +k +1=13 → k² +k -12=0. The roots are [-1 ± sqrt(1 +48)]/2 → sqrt(49)=7. So ( -1 +7)/2 = 3. So k=3. So 1+3+9=13. So yes. Hence the answer is YES.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once), and k>1. Also, note that m can be any integer ≥1. Wait, but the initial step (adding k nodes) is part of the process. Let me re-express the formula.\n\nLet me think again. The initial step is adding k nodes. Then, each time, we add another layer. So the total number of nodes is:\n\nFor m layers (after the initial step?), or m steps?\n\nLet me think of the construction steps:\n\nStart with 1 node.\n\nStep 1: add k nodes connected to the root. Now total is 1 + k.\n\nStep 2: add k * k nodes (each of the k leaves gets k new nodes). Now total is 1 + k + k².\n\nStep 3: add k³ nodes. Total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nAnd so on. So the total number of nodes after m steps (where m ≥ 1) is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, but wait:\n\nWait, sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But in our case, the steps are:\n\nAfter 0 steps (just the root): 1 node.\n\nAfter step 1: 1 +k.\n\nAfter step 2: 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the total number of nodes after m steps (where m ≥ 1) is S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. However, according to the problem statement, the step of adding new nodes to leaves (the step that creates new layers) must be done at least once. Which means that m must be at least 1. So the total nodes S can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥1 and k ≥2.\n\nWait, no. Let me check. For example, for m=1 steps (step 1), the sum is 1 +k. Which is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Yes. For m=2 steps, sum is 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So yes, the general formula is S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥1, and k ≥2. But since m can be any integer ≥1, and k ≥2.\n\nBut the problem is to check whether for given n, there exists some k ≥2 and m ≥1 such that S =n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and m ≥1.\n\nAlternatively, since m ≥1, then m+1 ≥2. Let me denote t = m+1. So t ≥2. Then S = (k^t -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nSo for given n, we need to check if there exists integers k ≥2 and t ≥2 such that n equals this sum.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for given n, does there exist k ≥2 and t ≥2 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n?\n\nNow, how can we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, note that for each possible t ≥2, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nBut since t can be up to log_2(n), because for k=2, the sum for t steps is 2^t -1. For example, for t=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, so t can be up to around 60 for n up to 1e18.\n\nSo for each possible t from 2 up to log_2(n) +1, we can check if there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nBut how to find k for each t?\n\nThe equation is (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n → k^{t} -1 = n (k-1) → k^t - n k + (n -1) = 0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is challenging. However, for fixed t, we can perform a binary search on k. Since for fixed t, the function f(k) = (k^t -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing in k. Because for k ≥2, as k increases, the sum increases. So for each t, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there's a value that gives exactly n.\n\nBut how do we find the range for binary search?\n\nFor fixed t, the minimal possible value of the sum is when k=2. So for each t, the minimal sum is 2^t -1 (since (2^t -1)/(2-1) = 2^t -1). The maximum possible sum for a given t would be when k is such that the sum is equal to n. But since we're trying to find if there exists a k for this t, we can binary search between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given t?\n\nWell, since (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n → the sum is equal to n. Let's think for k ≥2, t ≥2. For example, for t=2, the sum is 1 +k. So 1 +k =n → k =n-1. So the upper bound for k for t=2 is n-1. But for higher t, the upper bound for k would be smaller. For example, for t=3, the sum is 1 +k +k² =n. For k^2 +k +1 =n → k^2 < n → k < sqrt(n). So for each t, the upper bound can be found as something like n^(1/(t-1)), since for t steps, the sum is dominated by the term k^{t-1}.\n\nBut for binary search, perhaps we can set the upper bound as n. Because for t ≥2, the sum (k^t -1)/(k-1) is at least 1 +k. For k ≥2, 1 +k ≤ n → k ≤ n-1. So for any t, the upper bound for k can be up to n-1. However, for larger t, the upper bound can be much smaller, but using n as the upper bound for binary search is acceptable, even if it's a bit loose.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n can be expressed as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some k≥2 and t≥2.\n\nHow to do this efficiently?\n\nFirst, handle the edge cases. For example, n=1. The minimal possible sum is 1 +k (for t=2, but k must be ≥2. So 1 +2=3. So n=1 can't be formed. So the answer is NO. Similarly, for n=2, 3, etc.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check for all possible t (from 2 up to max_t), and for each t, perform a binary search on k.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, how many t's are possible? Let's think.\n\nThe minimal sum for a given t is when k=2. So for t, 2^t -1 <=n → t can be up to log2(n+1). For example, for n=1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So t can be up to 60. So for each n, we can iterate t from 2 to 60, and for each t, perform a binary search on k.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is 1 → output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nLoop t from 2 to 60 (or until 2^t -1 >n):\n\n   For each t, check if there exists k >=2 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nHow to check this for a given t?\n\nWe can binary search k between 2 and some upper limit (like n).\n\nBut for a given t and k, how do we compute (k^t -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nBut for large t and k, this could be computationally expensive. However, since t is up to 60, and k is up to 1e18, even for t=60, k^t could be very big. So during the binary search, we need to compute the sum and compare with n. However, we need to avoid overflow, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.\n\nBut calculating the sum directly for large k and t may be computationally intensive. However, for binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally, and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nAlternatively, for a given k and t, the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nWhich can be computed as:\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to t-1:\n\n   sum += k^i\n\nBut for large t, this could be O(t) time. However, since t is up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum using the formula (k^t -1)//(k-1), but we have to be careful with division. However, since for k >=2 and t >=2, the sum is an integer.\n\nBut when computing k^t, it might be very big. However, in Python, it's manageable.\n\nBut during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n. For example, during the calculation of the sum, if at any step it exceeds n, we can break early and return that the sum is too big.\n\nSo, for a given k and t, compute the sum as follows:\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to t-1:\n\n   current_sum += k^i\n\n   if current_sum >n:\n\n       return something larger than n\n\nBut how to compute k^i? Well, for each i, multiply by k. So:\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (for i=0)\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n   current_sum += current_term\n\n   if current_sum >n:\n\n       return something larger than n\n\n   current_term *=k\n\nBut this would be O(t) per check, which is acceptable since t is small.\n\nSo during the binary search for a given t, for a candidate k, we can compute the sum as above, and check if it equals n.\n\nSo, the steps for a given t:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = some upper bound (like n, but maybe we can find a better upper bound).\n\nBut for the binary search, the upper bound can be found as follows: for the sum 1 +k + ... +k^{t-1} =n. Since each term is positive, the sum is at least 1 +k. So for k, 1 +k <=n → k <=n-1. So the upper bound can be n-1. However, for larger t, the upper bound can be smaller. For example, when t=2, the sum is 1 +k =n → k =n-1. For t=3, the sum is 1 +k +k² =n. The maximum possible k for this is when k² ≈n → k ~ sqrt(n). So for each t, the upper bound can be set to n^(1/(t-1)) ), but perhaps for simplicity, we can just use high = n.\n\nSo for each t, perform binary search between low=2 and high = n.\n\nBut for some t, the high can be very large, but since t is small (like up to 60), the binary search steps would be manageable.\n\nSo for each t in 2 to max_t:\n\n   perform binary search on k in [2, ... ] to see if sum equals n.\n\nNow, let's think about how to find the max_t. For t steps, the minimal sum is 2^t -1. So for a given n, the maximum possible t is such that 2^t -1 <=n. So t_max can be up to log2(n+1). For n up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60, so t_max can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each n, loop t from 2 to 60. For each t, check if there exists a k.\n\nOnce any such (k,t) pair is found, return YES.\n\nIf after checking all t, nothing is found, return NO.\n\nNow, let's think about some examples.\n\nSample Input 1: n=1 → output NO.\n\nSample Input 2: n=2 → possible t's?\n\nt=2: sum is 1 +k. So 1 +k =2 →k=1. But k must be ≥2. So no.\n\nt=2: no solution. For other t's, the minimal sum is 2^t-1. For t=2, 3. So n=2 is less than 3. So no. Hence output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: n=3. For t=2: 1 +k =3 →k=2. Which is valid. So answer is YES? But according to the sample input, the third test case is n=3, output is NO. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the sample input, the third case is n=3, output is NO. But according to this reasoning, for t=2 and k=2, sum is 1 +2=3. So why is the output NO?\n\nAh! Oh wait, the problem statement says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. Let me recheck the construction rules.\n\nThe initial step is adding k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k nodes (so the first step). Then, the second step (adding to leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal number of steps is two steps. Which would correspond to t=2 (since t = m+1, where m is the number of steps after the initial step). Wait, earlier analysis may have been incorrect.\n\nLet me re-examine the structure.\n\nOriginal process:\n\nStarts with one node.\n\nThen, add k nodes connected to the root. (this is step 1).\n\nThen, each leaf (the k nodes) is connected to k new nodes. (step 2). This step must be done at least once. So the minimal is two steps.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k (after step 1) plus k*k (after step 2) → 1 +k +k². So the sum is for t=3 steps? Or what is the relation between t and the steps?\n\nEarlier, I thought that the sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1), but perhaps that's not correct.\n\nLet me re-express the construction steps:\n\nThe process starts with one node. Then, each time you add a new layer. The first layer (step 1) adds k nodes. The second layer (step 2) adds k^2 nodes. The third layer (step 3) adds k^3 nodes, etc. The number of layers is m, where m ≥ 1 (because the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once). So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. Where m ≥1.\n\nSo for m=1, the total is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. Which is the case when m=1. Because the step after the initial addition is done once. Wait, the initial step is adding the first k nodes. Then, the second step (adding to leaves) is done once. So m=1 refers to the number of times the step is done. So the total number of layers is m+1? Or m?\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nThe initial step is adding the first k nodes (so the first layer). Then, the step of adding new nodes to leaves is done once (so adding a second layer). So the total number of layers is 2. So the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo for m being the number of times the step is done (at least once), then the total number of layers is m+1? Or m?\n\nWait, the initial step is adding the first layer (the k nodes). Then, the step of adding new nodes to leaves is done once (so adding the second layer). So m is 1 (the number of times the step is done). So the total number of layers is 1 (initial) + m (steps done) = 2 layers. The total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo the formula for the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i ? No, for m steps done after the initial step. Wait, the initial step is the first layer (k^1 nodes). Then, each step adds a new layer. So for m steps done, the total layers are m+1 (the initial step plus m steps). So the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, that can't be. Let's think again.\n\nInitial state: 1 node.\n\nAfter step 1 (adding k nodes to root): total nodes is 1 +k.\n\nThen, step 2 (adding k nodes to each of the k leaves): adds k *k =k^2 nodes. Total nodes 1 +k +k².\n\nThen step 3 (adding k nodes to each of the k² leaves): adds k^3 nodes. Total nodes 1 +k +k² +k^3.\n\nSo for m steps (after the initial step), the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. Wait, no. Because the initial step is the first step (adding k nodes). Then, the next steps are m steps. For example, m=1 step (adding the second layer). So the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo the number of steps (m) is the number of times the step is done. The problem says that this step must be done at least once. So m ≥1. Thus, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i? No, sum_{i=0}^{m+1} would be 1 +k + ... +k^{m+1}, but the steps are m steps after the initial. Let me think again.\n\nLet me define m as the number of steps done after the initial step. The initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, m steps are done. Each step adds a new layer. So for m steps, the number of layers is 1 (initial) + m steps. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No. For example, when m=1, the layers are initial (1 node) and step 1 (k nodes), and then step 2 (adding k^2 nodes). So the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So the exponent is m+1 + 0? Or m+1? Let me think:\n\nsum_{i=0}^s k^i = (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the example where s=2 (i runs from 0 to 2), sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So in this case, the number of steps after the initial step is m=1 (since we did one step of adding to leaves). The s is m+1 = 2. So the formula is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i = (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). But that would imply that for m steps after the initial, the total is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). But this contradicts the earlier example where m=1, and the sum is 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Which is indeed (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) where m=1.\n\nSo the formula for the total nodes is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nNo, that can't be. Because when m=0 steps after the initial step (which is invalid, because the problem says that the step must be done at least once), then the sum would be 1 +k = (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which is correct. But m=0 is invalid.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the step must be done at least once. So m ≥1. So the total nodes is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, for m steps, adding layers. So for m steps, the total number of layers is 1 (initial) + m steps. Each step adds a layer. So the layers are:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node.\n\nLayer 1: k nodes.\n\nLayer 2: k^2 nodes.\n\n...\n\nLayer m+1: k^{m+1} nodes.\n\nThus, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i = (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut this would require that for m ≥1 steps, the total nodes is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). However, for m=1 steps, this is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2, which matches the example.\n\nBut this suggests that for the problem, the formula for the total nodes is (k^{t} -1)/(k-1), where t = m+2 ≥ 3? No, because m ≥1 → t ≥ m+2 = 3? Or perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model it as follows. The total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^s, where s ≥ 1. Because the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. For example, when s=1, the sum is 1 +k. But that would correspond to having done only the initial step and not done any additional steps. Which is invalid. So the problem requires that the step of adding new nodes to leaves is done at least once. So the minimal is s=2 (so the sum is 1 +k +k^2). Which would mean that the formula is sum_{i=0}^s k^i where s ≥ 2. Because s=2 corresponds to adding the initial step and one more step.\n\nSo the formula for the total nodes is (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1), where s ≥2.\n\nSo for s ≥2, and k ≥2.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to checking whether there exists integers k ≥2 and s ≥2 such that (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut s can be any integer ≥2. So for example, for s=2, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k^2 +k +1.\n\nSo for the earlier example where n=3, can we find k and s?\n\nFor s=2, the equation is k^2 +k +1 =3 →k² +k -2=0 →k=1 or -2. Not valid. So no solution. For s=2, no solution.\n\nFor s=3, the equation is (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =n. For n=3, this would be k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =3 →k=1, which is invalid. So no solution.\n\nThus, n=3 can't be expressed as such. Hence the sample input's third case (n=3) outputs NO.\n\nAh! This explains why the sample input for n=3 outputs NO. Earlier mistake was in the initial analysis of the formula. So the correct formula is that the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^s k^i = (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1), where s ≥2. So for the problem, we need to check for s ≥2 and k ≥2.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor given n, check if there exists s ≥2 and k ≥2 such that (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nThus, the earlier approach needs to be adjusted. Now, for each possible s ≥2, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nNow, for the same example of n=13:\n\nCheck for s=2: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1 =13. Solving k² +k +1=13 →k² +k -12=0 →k=(−1±√(1+48))/2 →sqrt(49)=7 →k=(−1+7)/2=3. Which is valid. So yes, for s=2, k=3. Hence answer is YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample input where n=13 outputs YES.\n\nSo the correct approach is to check for s ≥2, and for each s, find k ≥2 such that the sum is n.\n\nNow, the question is how to find s and k.\n\nThe maximum possible s for a given n is log_2(n). Because for k=2 and s≥2, the sum is (2^{s+1} -1)/(2-1) = 2^{s+1} -1. For this to be ≤n, s+1 ≤ log2(n+1). So s can be up to log2(n) -1. For example, for n=1e18, log2(n) is about 60, so s can be up to 59.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate s from 2 up to 60 (or until 2^{s+1} -1 >n).\n\nFor each s, perform a binary search on k to see if there's a solution.\n\nSo for each s in 2 to max_s:\n\n   compute the minimal possible sum for this s, which is when k=2: (2^{s+1} -1) / (2-1) = 2^{s+1} -1. If this is larger than n, then no need to check higher s.\n\n   else, perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound to see if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nNow, the binary search for a given s and k is similar to before, but with the sum being sum_{i=0}^s k^i.\n\nSo for each candidate k and s, compute the sum and compare to n.\n\nNow, the code structure would be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = input\n\n    if n ==1:\n\n        print NO\n\n    else:\n\n        found = False\n\n        for s in 2 to max_s:\n\n            if 2^{s+1} -1 >n:\n\n                break (since for higher s, the minimal sum is larger)\n\n            else:\n\n                perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (like n) to see if sum equals n.\n\n                if found, set found = True and break\n\n        if found:\n\n            print YES\n\n        else:\n\n            print NO\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given s?\n\nFor the sum sum_{i=0}^s k^i =n. The sum is at least 1 +k (when s=2, sum is 1 +k +k²). For fixed s, the sum increases with k. So for a given s, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^s =n. Since for k=2, sum is 2^{s+1} -1. For larger k, the sum increases rapidly. So for a given s, the upper bound for k can be found as follows:\n\nThe sum is greater than k^s. So k^s < n → k < n^{1/s}.\n\nThus, for binary search, the upper bound can be set as n^(1/s) +1. However, calculating n^(1/s) for large n and s may be tricky, but in Python, we can compute it via binary search or using math.pow, but for the purposes of binary search, perhaps setting the upper bound as n is acceptable, even though it's a bit loose.\n\nBut for binary search, even if the upper bound is large, the number of steps is logarithmic.\n\nSo the code for checking for a given s and k:\n\ndef check(s, n):\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = some_upper_bound (like n)\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        # compute sum_{i=0}^s mid^i and compare to n\n\n        current_sum = 0\n\n        term = 1\n\n        for _ in range(s+1):\n\n            current_sum += term\n\n            if current_sum >n:\n\n                break\n\n            term *= mid\n\n        if current_sum ==n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif current_sum <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut for large s and mid, this loop may take O(s) time. However, since s is up to 60, and t is up to 1e4, this should be manageable.\n\nBut for very large s and mid, the term can be very big. However, the code breaks early if current_sum exceeds n.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample input n=13:\n\nCheck for s=2:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k². We need to find k where this equals 13. As discussed, k=3. So during binary search for s=2, the code should find it.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. Let's see:\n\nCheck s=2:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² =6 →k² +k +1 =6 →k² +k -5=0 → discriminant is 1+20=21 → sqrt(21) is ~4.58. So k is (-1 +4.58)/2 ≈ 1.79. Not integer. So no solution for s=2.\n\nCheck s=3: sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3 =n=6.\n\nTry k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>6. So no. So for s=3, the minimal sum is 15>6. So no solution.\n\nHence, no solution. Output is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample case: n=255.\n\nWhat's 255? Let's think. 2^8 -1 =255. So for s+1=8 → s=7. So the sum for s=7 and k=2 is (2^8 -1)/(2-1) =255. So yes. So the answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=1000000000000000000 (1e18). The sample output is NO. Let's see why. Let's think if there exists any s and k for this.\n\nBut for example, for s=2, we need k² +k +1 =1e18. Solving for k, it's roughly sqrt(1e18) =1e9. So k≈1e9. Let's check if that's possible. But the code would find it if it exists. However, according to the sample output, the answer is NO for this case. So perhaps there is no such k and s for this n.\n\nBut why? Let's think. For example, if n is 1e18, perhaps there is no solution. So the code would check all possible s and k and find none.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these possibilities.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all possible s values up to log2(n) +1. Let's think about how to compute max_s.\n\nFor each test case, we can iterate s starting from 2 upwards until 2^{s+1} -1 >n. For example, for n=1e18:\n\nThe maximum possible s is such that 2^{s+1} -1 <=n. Let's find s+1:\n\ns+1 can be up to floor(log2(n+1)).\n\nFor n=1e18, log2(1e18) is approximately",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single vertex and adding layers of vertices connected in a specific manner. The challenge is to check if there exists a valid configuration of layers and connections that results in exactly `n` vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and then adds layers of vertices. Each layer after the initial one must be added at least once. The total number of vertices after `s` layers (where `s ≥ 2`) can be represented as a geometric series sum: $ \\frac{k^{s+1} - 1}{k - 1} $, where `k` is the number of new vertices added per layer and `s` is the number of layers.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Layers**: For each possible number of layers `s` starting from 2 up to a maximum value determined by the logarithm of `n`, we check if there exists an integer `k` such that the geometric series sum equals `n`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each `s`, perform a binary search on possible values of `k` to check if the geometric series sum equals `n`. This ensures efficient checking even for very large values of `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_s = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18, and s+1 can be up to 60\n    for s in range(2, max_s + 1):\n        # Check if the minimal possible sum for this s is <=n\n        # minimal sum is when k=2: (2^(s+1) - 1)\n        min_sum = (1 << (s + 1)) - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Binary search for k in [2, ...]\n        low = 2\n        high = n  # upper bound can be n, but may be adjusted later\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            current_sum = 0\n            term = 1\n            overflow = False\n            for _ in range(s + 1):\n                current_sum += term\n                if current_sum > n:\n                    overflow = True\n                    break\n                term *= mid\n            if overflow:\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                if current_sum == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                elif current_sum < n:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Checking for Validity**: The function `is_possible` checks if `n` can be represented as a geometric series sum for any valid `s` and `k`.\n- **Binary Search**: For each possible number of layers `s`, a binary search is performed on possible values of `k` to check if the sum of the geometric series matches `n`.\n- **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently limits the range of `s` and uses binary search for each `s`, ensuring the solution handles very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$ efficiently.",
