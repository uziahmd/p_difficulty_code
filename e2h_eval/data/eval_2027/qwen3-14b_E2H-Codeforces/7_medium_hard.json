The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the construction rules again.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, that initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) are each connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So, the process is like building layers. \n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's model the number of vertices after each step. Let's consider how the snowflake grows.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as a tree. Because each step adds new nodes connected to existing ones. But since it's an undirected graph, maybe it's a tree structure. Let me think about the steps:\n\nInitial step: 1 node.\n\nFirst expansion: connect the initial node to k new nodes. Now total nodes is 1 + k. These k nodes are leaves (each connected to only one node).\n\nSecond expansion: each of these leaves is connected to k new nodes. So each of the k leaves adds k new nodes. So the total nodes now is 1 + k + k*k. But wait, the original leaves are still there. So after second expansion, the total is 1 + k + k^2. But then, the leaves in the second expansion are the new nodes added in the second step. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the step where you add k new nodes to each leaf must be done at least once. So, the minimal case would be when we have two expansions: the first expansion (adding k nodes), and the second expansion (adding k^2 nodes). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. Wait, but the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the second step is adding k * k nodes. But the problem says that the second step (adding to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have two steps: initial step (adding k nodes) and then adding k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k². \n\nBut wait, what if there are more steps? Like, after the second expansion, there are leaves again. For example, after the second expansion, each of the nodes added in the second expansion is a leaf. So we can perform another expansion step. Each of those would add k nodes. So for example, if we do three expansions, the total would be 1 + k + k² + k³. But the problem says that the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal is two steps. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"the initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the first expansion (connecting the initial node to k nodes) is required. Then, the step of connecting all leaves (those with degree 1) to k new nodes must be done at least once. So the minimal number of expansions is two steps: the initial step, then one more step. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. However, perhaps the process can be done more than once. So for example, after the second expansion, there are k² leaves. Then, another expansion would add k³ nodes. So the total becomes 1 + k + k² + k³. But this is allowed. \n\nSo the snowflake can have any number of expansions as long as there are at least two steps. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 2. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nLet me model the number of nodes. Let's say that the process is done for m levels. The first level is the initial node. Then, each expansion step adds a new level. \n\nLet me think of the snowflake as a tree. The root is the initial node. Each node in level 1 (children of the root) have k children. Each node in level 2 (children of level 1 nodes) have k children. And so on. But the process requires that after the initial step (level 1), the step of adding children to leaves (level 1 nodes) is done at least once. So the minimum depth is 2 (so level 1 and level 2). So the total number of nodes would be sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m is the number of levels minus 1. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe initial node is level 0. Then, level 1 has k nodes. Then, each node in level 1 has k children, which are level 2. So level 2 has k * k = k² nodes. Then, each node in level 2 has k children, which are level 3. So level 3 has k^3 nodes. \n\nSo the total number of nodes after m levels is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. But the problem says that the step of adding to the leaves (after the initial step) must be done at least once. So the minimum number of levels is 2. So the sum is 1 + k + k². But if we have more steps, then the sum is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 2. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) is done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes to the root) is the first step. Then, the second step is adding k new nodes to each of the leaves (which are the nodes in level 1). So the second step is required. So the minimal snowflake is when the process stops after two steps. That gives the total of 1 + k + k². However, if there are more steps, then the process continues. For example, after the second step, the leaves are the nodes in level 2. Then, adding k nodes to each of them (third step) would add k^3 nodes. So the total becomes 1 + k + k² + k³. \n\nTherefore, for a given n, we need to check if there exists some integer k>1 and some integer m ≥ 2 such that n is equal to the sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. \n\nWait, but the sum S can also be written as (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). Because the sum of a geometric series from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). So for example, when m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be expressed as (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and m≥2. \n\nBut wait, m is the number of levels minus 1. Let me recheck. For example, m=2: sum from i=0 to 2, which is 3 terms. So m is the highest exponent. So the formula is correct. \n\nSo the problem is equivalent to checking if there exists integers k>1 and m≥2 such that n = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). \n\nBut note that for m ≥ 2, the exponents are m+1. For example, m=2 gives exponent 3. \n\nAlternatively, the sum S can be written as (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). But the original problem requires that the step of expanding the leaves is done at least once. Which corresponds to m ≥ 1? Wait, let me re-express. \n\nThe initial step is creating the first level (k nodes). Then, the step of expanding the leaves (the first level nodes) is done once. That would be adding the second level (k² nodes). So the sum is 1 +k +k². Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m+1 is 3, so m is 2. So m is the number of steps after the initial step? Not sure. But regardless, the formula is that n must be equal to (k^{d} - 1)/(k-1), where d is at least 3 (since m+1 ≥ 3 when m ≥ 2). \n\nWait, because m is the number of steps. Let me think again. Let me define d as the number of terms in the sum. For example, the minimal case is d=3 (terms 1, k, k²). So the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for the general case, n must be equal to (k^d -1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 3. \n\nSo our problem reduces to checking if there exists integers k>1 and d≥3 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) equals n. \n\nBut how can we check this efficiently, especially given that n can be up to 1e18?\n\nSo for each test case n, we need to check whether there exists some k>1 and d≥3 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nBut how to approach this? Let's think of possible values of d and k. Since d can be up to log_2(n) (since for k=2, the minimal value for d=3 is 1+2+4=7, and for larger d, the value increases exponentially). So for each possible d, we can try to find if there exists a k>1 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible d is limited. For example, for d=60, even k=2 gives 2^60-1/(2-1) = 2^60-1 ~ 1e18. So d can't be larger than around 60. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n, check for all possible d from 3 up to log2(n)+1 (since for d=60, k=2 gives 2^60 ~ 1e18). For each d, check if there's a k>1 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\nBut how to find k for a given d?\n\nLet's think about the equation:\n\n(k^d -1)/(k-1) = n → sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i =n.\n\nThis is a function of k, which increases with k. For fixed d, the function is strictly increasing in k. So for each d, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut for each d, we can compute the possible k. Let's think for example, for d=3:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² =n. So solving k² +k +1 =n → k² +k + (1 -n) =0. The solution is k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 -4*(1-n))]/2 → sqrt(4n -3) must be integer. So for d=3, the possible k is floor(sqrt(4n-3) -1)/2 or something like that. But perhaps for general d, we can perform a binary search on k for each d.\n\nBut for each d, the possible k is between 2 and some upper bound. For example, for d, the minimal possible sum is when k=2, which is 2^d-1/(2-1) = 2^d -1. So for n to be possible for a given d, it must be at least 2^d -1. Also, the maximum possible k for a given d is such that 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} ≤n. Since for k=1, the sum is d, but k must be >1. So for each d, the possible k is in [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≤n. \n\nBut for binary search, given d, we can find the possible k. Let's think of the function f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i. For fixed d, this is strictly increasing with k. So for each d, we can binary search k in [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound can be determined as follows: since f(k) >= k^{d-1} (since all terms are positive), so k^{d-1} <=n → k <=n^(1/(d-1)). So the upper bound for k is n^(1/(d-1)), which can be calculated using binary search. \n\nSo the steps for the problem are:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nIf n is 1, output NO (since the minimal sum for d=3 is 1+2+4=7, but for d=2, sum is 1 +k. But d must be at least 3. So for n=1, no.)\n\nElse, check for all possible d from 3 up to log2(n) + 1 (since for d= log2(n) +1, k=2 would give sum 2^d -1, which is larger than n). For each d, perform a binary search on k to see if there's a k>1 such that sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i =n. \n\nIf for any d and k, this holds, return YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nNow, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut considering that for each n, the maximum possible d is around 60 (since for d=60, k=2 gives sum 2^60-1, which is about 1e18). So for each n, we can loop d from 3 to 60, and for each d, perform a binary search on k.\n\nNow, for each d, how to compute the sum for a given k? Well, for k and d, the sum is (k^d -1)/(k-1). However, calculating this directly may lead to overflow, but since Python handles big integers, perhaps it's manageable. However, for large d and k, even computing k^d could be expensive. But since for each d, the binary search is limited (for example, for d=60, the upper bound for k is n^(1/(d-1)) which for n=1e18 and d=60 is 1e18^(1/59) ≈ 10^(18/59) ~ 10^0.3 ~ 2, so upper bound is small. So for each d, the binary search for k is feasible.\n\nBut for each candidate k during the binary search, we need to compute the sum and compare to n. However, for large exponents, even computing k^d could be expensive. But perhaps we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n. For example, for a given k and d, compute the sum s = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}. We can compute this as a loop, adding each term, and if during the addition the sum exceeds n, we can break and return that it's too big. \n\nThis is important because for large k and d, the sum can be very big, but for the binary search, we can avoid computing it as a single term (which could be a huge number) by checking incrementally. \n\nSo here's the plan for checking for a given d and k:\n\nCompute the sum s = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}. If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, we can return early. \n\nFor example, for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So for a given k, compute term by term:\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to d-1:\n\n    current_sum += k^i\n\nBut even better, we can compute it iteratively, and if at any step the current_sum exceeds n, we can break and return that the sum is larger than n.\n\nThis approach avoids dealing with very large numbers directly, and allows us to compute whether the sum equals n.\n\nSo, the steps for each d:\n\nLoop over d from 3 to max_d (like 60):\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = upper_bound (could be found via binary search, but perhaps we can use something like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1)\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n       compute the sum for mid and d. If sum ==n → return YES.\n\n       if sum <n → need to increase k → set low = mid +1.\n\n       else → set high = mid -1.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for mid and d?\n\nImplementing that function correctly is crucial.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, for each test case n:\n\nif n is 1 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for d in 3 to max_d:\n\n       compute possible k via binary search.\n\nSo, what is the maximum d? Let's find for the minimal k=2. The sum for d is (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1. For this to be <=n, we have 2^d -1 <=n → d <= log2(n+1). So for n up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So max_d can be up to 60.\n\nSo, for each n, loop d from 3 to 60.\n\nBut for some d, the minimal sum (with k=2) is 2^d -1. For example, if n is smaller than that, then for that d, there is no possible k. So in that case, we can skip that d.\n\nSo, for each d, we can first check if 2^d -1 >n. If yes, then no need to check for this d. Otherwise, proceed with binary search.\n\nBut how to compute 2^d? Well, for d up to 60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nBut even better, for each d, we can compute the lower bound (k=2) and upper bound (k_max) as follows:\n\nThe minimal sum for d is when k=2: sum = 2^d -1.\n\nIf this is greater than n, then no solution for this d.\n\nOtherwise, the maximum possible k can be found as follows. The sum for k is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{d-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}. So the upper bound for k can be floor(n^(1/(d-1))) + 1. \n\nBut calculating n^(1/(d-1)) can be done with binary search or using math.pow, but since we need integer values, perhaps we can compute it with binary search. However, for the purpose of binary search, perhaps we can just start with high as 2 and keep doubling until the sum exceeds n. But for the binary search steps, perhaps it's easier to set the high to something like 2e5 or even 1e18. But since for each d, the binary search for k is O(log (upper_bound)), and upper_bound is small, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps we can set the initial high for binary search as n, but that might be too slow. However, since for each d, the maximum possible k is n^(1/(d-1)), which for d=3 is n^(1/2) (sqrt(n)), which for n=1e18 is 1e9. For d=3, binary search from 2 to 1e9 would take about 30 steps. For d=60, the upper bound is n^(1/(59)) which is about 1e18^(1/59) ≈ 2, so the binary search is trivial.\n\nSo, for code, for each d, we can perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound, where upper_bound can be computed as something like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1. However, in practice, perhaps we can just set the upper bound as n, and during the binary search, check if the sum exceeds n and adjust accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and d?\n\nLet me write a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current_term = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')  # or some value larger than n\n\n        current_term *= k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for d steps, the loop runs d times. For example, d=3: 1, k, k^2. So the loop adds 1, then k, then k^2. So yes.\n\nBut in code, for each k and d, we can compute the sum incrementally, and if during the addition it exceeds n, return early.\n\nSo, in code, during the binary search for a given d and mid, we compute the sum as above. If it equals n, return True. Else, adjust the binary search accordingly.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given in the problem.\n\nSample input:\n\nTest case 5: 13 → output YES.\n\nLet me see. For d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k² =13 →k² +k +1 =13 →k² +k -12 =0 → solutions k=(-1 ± sqrt(1 +48))/2 → sqrt(49)=7 → ( -1 +7 ) /2 = 3. So k=3. So sum is 1+3+9=13. So yes. So for d=3, k=3, which is valid. Hence output YES.\n\nAnother sample input: 6. Output is NO. Let's see:\n\nCheck for d=3: 1 +k +k² =6 →k² +k +1=6 →k² +k -5=0 → sqrt(1+20)=sqrt(21) is irrational. So no solution. For d=4, sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =6. Let's try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>6. So no. So no solution. Hence output NO.\n\nAnother sample input: 15. Output is YES. Let's see. For d=3: 1 +k +k² =15 →k² +k -14=0 → sqrt(1+56)=sqrt(57) is not integer. For d=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =15. Try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes. So for d=4, k=2. Hence YES.\n\nSo the code needs to find this case.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n ==1 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for d in 3 to 60:\n\n       check if 2^d -1 <=n. If not, skip.\n\n       else:\n\n           perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound.\n\n           during binary search, for mid, compute sum and check.\n\n           if any of the binary searches finds a sum equal to n → return YES.\n\n   after checking all d, if none found → return NO.\n\nBut how to handle the upper bound for k in the binary search?\n\nWell, for binary search, we can set low=2, high=2. Then, while the sum for high is less than n, multiply high by 2. Once we have a high where sum is >=n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut for code, perhaps for each d, the upper bound can be found as follows:\n\nInitialize low=2, high=2.\n\nWhile compute_sum(high, d) <n:\n\n   high *=2\n\nOnce we have high where compute_sum(high, d) >=n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut compute_sum(high, d) can be very large, but since we are checking if it's less than n, and for large high, it will quickly exceed n.\n\nBut for cases where the sum is exactly n, this will find it.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum for k is increasing, we can find the upper bound for k in this way.\n\nNow, code-wise, for each d, the steps are:\n\nCheck if 2^d -1 >n → if so, skip.\n\nElse:\n\n   find upper bound for k via doubling.\n\n   perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut how to compute 2^d -1? For d up to 60, 2^d can be calculated as 1 <<d, but for d=60, 2^60 is manageable in Python.\n\nBut for d up to 60, even if n is 1e18, 2^60 is about 1e18, so for d=60, 2^d -1 is 1e18, which is acceptable.\n\nSo for each d, first check if 2^d -1 >n. If yes, then skip.\n\nElse:\n\nproceed to binary search.\n\nSo, putting this into code:\n\nIn Python, for each test case n:\n\nif n ==1:\n\n   print 'NO'\n\nelse:\n\n   found = False\n\n   for d in range(3, 61):\n\n       # check if for this d, possible\n\n       # compute 2^d -1. if it's >n, then skip.\n\n       min_sum = (2**d -1)\n\n       if min_sum >n:\n\n           continue\n\n       # else, proceed to find k.\n\n       # find upper bound for k.\n\n       low = 2\n\n       high = 2\n\n       # find high such that compute_sum(high, d) >=n\n\n       while True:\n\n           s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n\n           if s >=n:\n\n               break\n\n           high *=2\n\n       # now binary search between low and high.\n\n       # perform binary search.\n\n       left = 2\n\n       right = high\n\n       while left <= right:\n\n           mid = (left + right) //2\n\n           s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n           if s ==n:\n\n               found = True\n\n               break\n\n           elif s <n:\n\n               left = mid +1\n\n           else:\n\n               right = mid -1\n\n       if found:\n\n           break\n\n   if found:\n\n       print(\"YES\")\n\n   else:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\nBut the compute_sum function needs to compute the sum for k and d, and return early if it exceeds n.\n\nImplementing compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n +1  # return something larger than n\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for d steps, the loop adds k^0, k^1, ..., k^{d-1} ?\n\nYes. For example, d=3: loop runs 3 times. First iteration adds 1 (k^0). Second adds k^1. Third adds k^2. So sum is 1 +k +k^2. Correct.\n\nBut in code, for each test case, we need to pass n to compute_sum to check if it's exceeding.\n\nNow, let's test for the sample input:\n\nFor n=13, d=3.\n\nmin_sum is 2^3 -1 =7 ≤13.\n\nThen find high. Initially high=2. compute_sum(2,3,13) is 1+2+4=7 <13. So high *=2 →4. compute_sum(4,3,13) is 1+4+16=21>13. So binary search between 2 and4.\n\nbinary search steps:\n\nleft=2, right=4.\n\nmid=(2+4)//2=3. compute_sum(3,3,13) is 1+3+9=13 → equal. So found.\n\nHence returns YES.\n\nAnother example: n=6. For d=3, min_sum=7>6 → skip. So for d=3, no. For d=4, min_sum=2^4-1=15>6 → skip. So all higher d's are skipped. So returns NO.\n\nAnother example: n=15. For d=4, min_sum=2^4-1=15. So compute_sum(2,4,15) is 1+2+4+8=15 → yes. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 255. Let's see:\n\nWhat's 255?\n\nFor example, 2^8 -1 =255. But 8 is d. So for d=8, sum is 2^8-1/(2-1) = 255. But d must be ≥3. So yes. So for d=8, k=2. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000 (1e18). The sample output is NO. Let's see why. Let's see if there exists a k and d such that sum equals 1e18.\n\nBut for example, for d=3: 1 +k +k² =1e18 →k² +k +1 =1e18. Solving for k, approx sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. Let's see, k is about 1e9. Let's compute k² = 1e18 → k=1e9. Then 1e9^2 +1e9 +1 = 1e18 +1e9 +1. Which is larger than 1e18. So for k=1e9-1, perhaps the sum is 1e18? Not sure. But regardless, the code would check for all possible d and k.\n\nBut according to the sample input, for 1e18 the answer is NO. So perhaps there's no such k and d.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these possibilities.\n\nBut what about the case where n is 7 (d=3, k=2). 1+2+4=7. So answer is YES. For example, input 7 would return YES.\n\nNow, code considerations:\n\nBut for very large d, say d=60, and k=2, the sum is (2^60 -1)/(2-1) = 2^60 -1. Which is 1,152,921,504,606,846,975. Which is about 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, which is less than that, the code would check for d=60, and see that the minimal sum (2^60-1) is larger than 1e18. So for d=60, it skips. For smaller d, like d=59, the minimal sum is 2^59-1, which is 5.7e17. So for d=59, the code would check if there's a k such that sum equals 1e18.\n\nBut for that, during binary search, perhaps the code would find that no k exists.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase n=7 → YES (d=3, k=2).\n\nCase n=1 → NO.\n\nCase n=2: no. Because for d=3, the minimal sum is 7. So no.\n\nCase n=3: same, no.\n\nCase n=6: no.\n\nCase n=13: yes.\n\nAnother case: n=1 +k +k^2 +k^3. For example, k=2, d=4. Sum is 1+2+4+8=15. So for n=15, yes.\n\nNow, code needs to handle all these.\n\nNow, the code can be written in Python. Let's think about the code structure.\n\nBut first, the code must read t test cases. For each n, process as per above.\n\nBut for very large n (up to 1e18), and t up to 1e4, the code must be efficient. However, since for each test case, the loop runs up to 60 iterations (for d from 3 to 60), and each binary search for a d is O(log (upper bound)), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, implement the compute_sum function as a helper inside the code.\n\nBut in Python, functions inside loops can be slow. So perhaps it's better to inline the code for compute_sum.\n\nBut for code clarity, perhaps we can write it as a helper function.\n\nBut for the purposes of code, here's the plan:\n\nRead t.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   read n.\n\n   if n ==1: print NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      flag = False\n\n      for d in 3 to 60:\n\n          min_sum = 2^d -1\n\n          if min_sum >n:\n\n              continue\n\n          # else, find k for this d.\n\n          # find upper bound for k.\n\n          low = 2\n\n          high = 2\n\n          while compute_sum(high, d, n) <n:\n\n              high *=2\n\n          # now binary search between low and high.\n\n          left = 2\n\n          right = high\n\n          while left <= right:\n\n              mid = (left + right) //2\n\n              s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n              if s ==n:\n\n                  flag = True\n\n                  break\n\n              elif s <n:\n\n                  left = mid +1\n\n              else:\n\n                  right = mid -1\n\n          if flag:\n\n              break\n\n      print YES or NO accordingly.\n\nBut in code, the compute_sum function is needed. Let's implement it as a helper function inside the loop.\n\nBut in Python, for large exponents, even with 1e18, the code can handle it.\n\nBut for the compute_sum function, the code must calculate the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nNow, implementing compute_sum:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n + 1\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, this is straightforward.\n\nBut for the case where d is 60, and k is 2, this would compute 1 +2 +4 + ... +2^59 = 2^60 -1, which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    t = int(input[0])\n\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n\n    for n in cases:\n\n        if n ==1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        found = False\n\n        for d in range(3, 61):\n\n            # compute min_sum = 2^d -1\n\n            # check if it's <=n\n\n            # but for d up to 60, 2^d can be very big, but Python handles big integers.\n\n            min_sum = (1 << d) -1\n\n            if min_sum > n:\n\n                continue\n\n            # Now find k for this d.\n\n            # find upper bound for k.\n\n            low_k = 2\n\n            high_k = 2\n\n            # find high_k such that compute_sum(high_k, d, n) >=n\n\n            while True:\n\n                s = 0\n\n                current = 1\n\n                for _ in range(d):\n\n                    s += current\n\n                    if s > n:\n\n                        break\n\n                    current *= high_k\n\n                if s >=n:\n\n                    break\n\n                high_k *=2\n\n            # Now binary search between low_k and high_k\n\n            left = 2\n\n            right = high_k\n\n            while left <= right:\n\n                mid = (left + right) //2\n\n                # compute sum for mid and d\n\n                s = 0\n\n                current = 1\n\n                overflow = False\n\n                for _ in range(d):\n\n                    s += current\n\n                    if s > n:\n\n                        overflow = True\n\n                        break\n\n                    current *= mid\n\n                if overflow:\n\n                    s = n +1\n\n                if s ==n:\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                elif s <n:\n\n                    left = mid +1\n\n                else:\n\n                    right = mid -1\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nBut wait, this code has a problem. The code for finding the upper bound for high_k uses a loop that computes the sum each time. But that's redundant. It's better to write a helper function. However, in the code above,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed based on specific rules. The snowflake graph is built in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding each layer by connecting each leaf node to `k` new vertices. The challenge is to check if there exists a valid configuration of layers and branching factor `k` that results in exactly `n` vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands in layers. The number of vertices after `d` layers can be represented as a geometric series sum: $ S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{d-1} $, which simplifies to $ S = \\frac{k^d - 1}{k - 1} $.\n\n2. **Constraints on Parameters**: For a valid snowflake, the number of layers `d` must be at least 3 (since the expansion step must be done at least once). The branching factor `k` must be greater than 1.\n\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each possible number of layers `d` (from 3 to 60, considering practical limits for large `n`), we perform a binary search on possible values of `k` to check if the geometric series sum equals `n`.\n\n4. **Binary Search for `k`**: For each `d`, we use binary search to find if there exists a `k` such that the geometric series sum equals `n`.
