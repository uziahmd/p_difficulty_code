The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take the perimeter of that rectangle. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width w and height h is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each side contributes (w) and (h), but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Wait, for example, a rectangle of 3x3. The perimeter would be 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. The perimeter in terms of cells: for a rectangle of width w and height h, the number of cells in the perimeter (the outer ring) is 2*w + 2*(h-2). Because the top and bottom rows have w cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the top and bottom) have (h-2) each. So total is 2w + 2(h-2) = 2(w + h -2). Alternatively, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because each side has m or n cells, but subtracting 4 for the four corners that are counted twice. So yeah, 2*(m + n - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i, the rectangle is of size (w' × h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1) and h' = h - 4*(i-1). Wait, but wait. For the first ring, i=1, so w' = w - 0 = w, h' = h. Then the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). But then for the second ring, i=2, the rectangle is (w - 4*(1)) × (h - 4*(1)), which is (w-4) × (h-4). Then the perimeter of that rectangle is 2*( (w-4) + (h-4) - 2 ) = 2*(w + h - 10). Wait, but that's the perimeter for that inner rectangle. But each ring is adding that perimeter. However, we need to make sure that the rings are valid. For example, if the rectangle is too small, then there can't be a ring.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) is 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3, you can only have one ring. For a 7x7, min is 7, (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So for two rings, the first is 7x7, then 7-4=3, so 3x3. Which is valid.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle at that level, and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the perimeter for each ring? Let's think for the i-th ring. Let me index from 1 to k.\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nBut wait, the perimeter formula is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). Because for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter is 2*(m + n - 2). Because each of the four sides contributes (m) and (n) but subtracting overlaps.\n\nSo the total number of cells is the sum over i=1 to k of 2*(current_w + current_h - 2).\n\nBut wait, let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. So current_w = 3, current_h = 3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4",
