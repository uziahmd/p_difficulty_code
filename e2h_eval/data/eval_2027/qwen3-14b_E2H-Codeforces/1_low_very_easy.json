The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, the second is two cells in, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but for each ring, how do we compute the number of cells?\n\nLet me think. For a single ring, like the first one, the perimeter of the rectangle. But wait, how is the perimeter calculated here? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in terms of cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but the corners are counted twice. So subtracting 4 (since each corner is counted once too many). Wait, let me think again. For example, a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter would be the outermost cells. Let's count them: the top row has 3 cells, the bottom row has 3, and the left and right columns have 1 each (excluding the top and bottom). So total is 3+3+1+1 = 8. Which matches the first example input where the output is 8. So the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle of width W and height H is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because 2*(W + H) counts each side, but subtracts 4 because each corner is counted twice. Alternatively, it's 2*(W-2) + 2*(H-2) + 4? No, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the perimeter of a rectangle (in terms of cells) is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because for a rectangle with width W and height H, the perimeter is the sum of all the cells on the edges. For example, W=3, H=3: 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8, which is correct. Another example: if W=7, H=9. Then the perimeter would be 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the second example input where output is 28. So yes, that formula seems correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and then sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the third example. Input is 7 9 2. So the first ring is 7x9, perimeter 2*(7+9) -4 = 28. The second ring is (7 -4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1) = 5. So 3x5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40, which matches the sample output. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle at that level, and sum them all.\n\nBut how to compute the perimeter for each ring? For each i from 1 to k, compute the current width and height. Let's denote:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nBut wait, for each i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But for that rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4. So sum all these for i=1 to k.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Because the problem says that the input k is such that it's allowed. Because the constraints for k are 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. So when i=1, current_w and current_h are w and h. For i=2, they would be w-4, h-4. But since k is chosen such that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the input k is valid. So we don't need",
