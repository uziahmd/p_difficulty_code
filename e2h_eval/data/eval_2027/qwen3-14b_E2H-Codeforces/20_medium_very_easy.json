    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. The task is to count the number of ways to assign values c_s for each binary string s (of lengths from 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, what's a beautiful multiset? For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. So, our goal is to find all possible assignments of c_s values such that when you choose the c_s's, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the c_s values. For the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f, there must be some way to select a multiset of size f that satisfies all the constraints, and also no way to select a larger multiset (so that the maximum is exactly f).\n\nBut how does the choice of c_s affect the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset?\n\nI think this problem relates to some kind of tree structure. Each binary string can be considered as a node in a trie. For example, the root is the empty string, but since our strings are of lengths 1 to n, maybe we can think of it as a trie where each level corresponds to the length of the string. Each node represents a binary string, and its children are the extensions by adding a 0 or 1.\n\nNow, the constraints for the beautiful multiset are that for each node (string s), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. But since the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n, each such string contributes to all prefixes of itself. For example, the string \"01\" of length 2 contributes to the prefixes \"0\" (length 1), \"01\" (length 2).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing c_s values such that the maximum number of strings in the multiset (which is equivalent to the sum over all leaves of the trie, but with constraints on the counts per node) is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how do the c_s's affect this maximum?\n\nThis feels like a problem where the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum constraints along the paths. For example, if we have a tree structure, then each path from the root to a leaf (i.e., each full binary string of length n) contributes 1 to each of its prefixes. The constraints are that for each node, the total number of paths passing through it (i.e., the number of strings in the multiset that have that node as a prefix) is at most c_s.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum over all nodes of (the sum of the capacities of the nodes along their paths). Wait, no. Wait, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the maximum number of strings that can be selected such that for each node, the number of selected strings that pass through it is ≤ c_s. This seems similar to a flow problem, where each node has a capacity, and we want to select as many paths as possible (each path being a string of length n) without exceeding the capacities.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a problem where the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimum of the capacities along certain paths. Alternatively, considering that the constraints are hierarchical. For example, the capacity of a parent node must be at least as large as the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, no. Because for a node s of length l, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. Each such string is a longer string (since s is a prefix). So, for example, if s is a string of length l, then the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that start with s, which is the sum of the counts of the children of s (if s is not of length n). If s is of length n, then it's either 0 or 1 (depending on whether the string is in the multiset).\n\nBut when building the maximum possible multiset, the constraints are that for each node s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. Let's denote this number as x_s. Then, for the root node (which is the empty string?), but since our strings are of length 1 to n, perhaps the root is not considered here. Wait, the problem says that the strings in the multiset are of length exactly n. So, the root would be the empty string, but the problem's constraints include all strings of length 1 to n. However, the multiset is of length exactly n. So for each string s of length l (from 1 to n), the count x_s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. For example, for a string of length n, x_s is 1 if it's in the multiset, else 0. For a string of length l < n, x_s is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. For example, if s is a prefix of length l, then the number of such strings is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. Since each such string is of length n, the number is equal to the number of possible extensions of s to length n that are in the multiset.\n\nBut how do the x_s relate to each other? For example, the x_s for a node s must be less than or equal to c_s. Also, for any node s, the x_s is equal to the sum of x_{s0} and x_{s1}, where s0 and s1 are the children of s (i.e., s followed by 0 and 1 respectively). Because any string in the multiset that starts with s must start with either s0 or s1. Therefore, for the maximum possible x (the size of the multiset), we have that x_root (which is the total number of strings in the multiset) is equal to the sum of x_{root0} and x_{root1}, which in turn are sums of their children, etc. So, the maximum possible x is the maximum value such that for all nodes s, x_s ≤ c_s, and x_s = sum of x_{children} for non-leaf nodes (since the leaves are of length n, and their x_s is the count of strings in the multiset that are exactly s, which can be 0 or 1, but in the maximum case, it's 1 if allowed by the constraints).\n\nWait, but how do we maximize x? The maximum x is determined by the constraints. For each node s, the x_s can't exceed c_s. Also, for non-leaf nodes, x_s must be equal to the sum of the x of its children. Because the x_s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix, which is the same as the sum of the x of the children (each child is a string of length l+1, and the number of strings that start with s is the sum of those that start with s0 and s1). Therefore, the constraints for the maximum x are:\n\nFor all nodes s (except leaves), x_s = sum of x_children. For leaves (strings of length n), x_s can be 0 or 1, but subject to x_s ≤ c_s. However, the maximum x is achieved when for all leaves, x_s is 1 (if allowed by their c_s and the constraints from their ancestors). But how?\n\nThis seems like a problem where the maximum x is determined by the minimum of the c_s values along the paths from the root to the leaves. For example, if you imagine that each path from the root to a leaf is a binary string of length n. For each such path, the maximum number of strings that can be chosen along that path is limited by the minimum c_s along the path. However, since each string in the multiset contributes to all prefixes along its path, the maximum x is the sum over all paths of the minimum c_s along the path. But that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Because if you have multiple paths, their constraints might overlap.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum x is the minimum over all nodes s of (the sum of capacities of s's descendants in a certain way). Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think of it as a tree. Each node has a capacity c_s. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the constraints that for each node, the number of strings passing through it (x_s) is ≤ c_s. Also, for non-leaf nodes, x_s is the sum of the x of their children. For leaves, x_s can be 0 or 1, but the sum of x of their children is zero (since they are leaves). Wait, no. For leaves (strings of length n), their x_s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Since s is of length n, the only way a string can have s as a prefix is if it's exactly s. So x_s can be 0 or 1, but in order to maximize x, we want to set x_s as 1 if possible. However, the constraint is that x_s ≤ c_s. So for each leaf, if c_s ≥ 1, then x_s can be 1. But the problem is that the x_s of the parent nodes must be the sum of their children's x_s. For example, if a parent node has two children, and both are set to 1, then the parent's x_s is 2, which must be ≤ c_parent. So the maximum possible x is determined by the constraints that for each node, the sum of x of its children is ≤ c_s. And for leaves, x_s can be 0 or 1, but in the maximum case, we set them to 1 if possible.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: given the capacities c_s for each node, what is the maximum x (number of strings in the multiset) that satisfies the constraints. And we need to find the number of c_s assignments where this maximum x is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum x given the c_s's?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming on the trie. For each node, the maximum x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum x of its children. Wait, but since x_s must be the sum of the x of its children, because for non-leaf nodes, x_s is the sum of the children's x. So, for each node, the maximum possible x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum x of the children. Wait, but for leaves, the maximum x is 1 if c_s ≥ 1, else 0. So the maximum x for the entire tree is the value computed recursively as follows:\n\nFor a leaf node s (length n), max_x(s) = min(c_s, 1).\n\nFor a non-leaf node s, max_x(s) = min(c_s, max_x(s0) + max_x(s1)).\n\nWait, but why? Because the sum of the children's max_x is the maximum number of strings that can be added under the constraints of the children. However, the node's capacity c_s may limit that sum. So, the maximum x for the node s is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the children's maximum x.\n\nBut then, the maximum x for the root (which is the empty string?) Well, the root would be a node of length 0, but our problem considers strings of length 1 to n. Wait, perhaps the root is not part of the problem. Wait, the problem includes all strings of length from 1 to n. So, for example, the root would be the empty string, but in our problem, the constraints for the empty string are not considered? No, the problem says that for every string s with length from 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. The empty string is not included here. So the root is not considered in the constraints. Wait, but the empty string is a prefix of all strings. However, according to the problem statement, the constraints are for strings of length from 1 to n. Therefore, the empty string is not part of the constraints. So the root (empty string) is not part of the problem's constraints. So, the root is not part of the c_s's.\n\nWait, the problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, we have to choose c_s. So the root (empty string) is not part of the constraints. Therefore, the maximum x is determined by the constraints on the nodes of lengths 1 to n. However, the maximum x is the sum of the x of the root's children (since the root's children are the strings of length 1). But since the root is not part of the constraints, the maximum x is determined by the constraints of the nodes of length 1 to n. However, the root's x would be the total number of strings in the multiset, which is the sum of the x of its children. But since the root is not constrained, we can take that sum as the maximum x.\n\nBut how does this fit into the recursive formula?\n\nLet me think again. Let's imagine that the trie is built for all binary strings of length up to n. Each node is a binary string of length l, for l from 1 to n. For each node, the maximum x_s (the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix) is determined as follows:\n\nIf s is a leaf node (length n), then x_s can be 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0. So max_x(s) = min(1, c_s).\n\nIf s is not a leaf node (length l < n), then the maximum x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum x of its children. Because the x_s is the sum of the x of its children, and this sum can't exceed c_s.\n\nThus, the maximum possible x (the size of the beautiful multiset) is the sum of the maximum x of the root's children (i.e., the strings of length 1). But since the root is not part of the constraints, the maximum x is the sum of the max_x of the two children (for the root's children, which are \"0\" and \"1\").\n\nBut wait, the root's children are the strings of length 1. Their max_x is determined by their own constraints and their children. So the maximum x is the sum of the max_x of the two children of the root (the \"0\" and \"1\" strings of length 1). Which would be the same as the max_x of the root, if the root were considered. But since the root is not constrained, the maximum x is indeed that sum.\n\nSo, the maximum x is determined by this recursive formula. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of assignments of c_s for each node (strings of length 1 to n) such that the maximum x computed as above is exactly f.\n\nNow, the problem is to count the number of such assignments.\n\nBut how do we model this? For each node, c_s can be between 0 and k, inclusive. However, the constraints on the c_s's must be such that the computed maximum x is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet's think recursively. For each node, the max_x depends on the c_s and the max_x of its children. But since the nodes form a tree (each node has two children, except leaves), perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, considering the nodes in a bottom-up manner.\n\nHowever, the problem requires us to count the number of assignments of c_s's such that the resulting maximum x is exactly f. So, for each node, we need to know how the choice of c_s affects the max_x of that node, and how that propagates up the tree.\n\nBut since the tree is a binary tree of depth n, with each node having two children (except leaves), perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, where for each node and for each possible value of max_x, we compute the number of ways to assign c_s's for that subtree such that the max_x of the node is a certain value.\n\nWait, but the nodes are structured as a trie. So, for a node of depth l (length l), its children are at depth l+1. The leaves are at depth n.\n\nLet me consider that for each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s for that node and its subtree (i.e., all descendants) such that the max_x for that node is exactly a certain value. Then, combining these for the entire tree will give the answer.\n\nBut how to model this for the entire tree?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a tree. For each node, we can compute the number of ways to choose c_s (for that node) and the choices for its children, such that the max_x of this node is m. Then, for the root (the first level, length 1), the total max_x is the sum of the max_x of the two children. But since the root's max_x is not constrained, but the max_x of the entire tree is the sum of the max_x of the root's children.\n\nWait, no. The root's children are the nodes of length 1. The maximum x for the entire tree is the sum of the max_x of the root's children. But the root's children are the nodes of length 1. For each of them, their max_x is min(c_s, sum of children's max_x). So, for the entire tree, the maximum x is the sum of the max_x of the root's children (the two nodes of length 1).\n\nBut since the root is not part of the constraints, the maximum x is the sum of the max_x of the two children of the root.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: compute the number of assignments of c_s's to all nodes (of lengths 1 to n) such that the sum of the max_x of the two root children (nodes of length 1) is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nWe can model this with dynamic programming. Let's think recursively. For a node at depth l (length l), the max_x for this node is determined by its c_s and the max_x of its children. Let's denote for a node, the possible values of max_x, and for each possible value, the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's assignments to achieve that.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's define dp[l][m] as the number of ways to assign c_s to all nodes in the subtree rooted at a node of depth l (i.e., the node's string has length l) such that the max_x for this node is m.\n\nFor leaves (l = n), the max_x is min(c_s, 1). Since the node is a leaf, it has no children. So, for a leaf node, the max_x is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0. However, the c_s can be chosen from 0 to k. For each possible m (which can be 0 or 1), we need to count the number of c_s that lead to m.\n\nFor a leaf node:\n\n- If m=0: c_s must be 0. So there is 1 way.\n- If m=1: c_s can be any from 1 to k. So there are k ways.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that for each node, c_s can be chosen from 0 to k. So for a leaf node, the number of ways to get max_x = 0 is 1 (c_s=0), and the number of ways to get max_x = 1 is (k) (c_s can be 1, 2, ..., k).\n\nSo for l = n, dp[n][0] = 1, dp[n][1] = k.\n\nFor non-leaf nodes (l < n), the max_x is min(c_s, left_child_max + right_child_max). Let's denote left and right as the children of this node (depth l+1). For each possible value of left_max and right_max, their sum is s = left_max + right_max. Then, for the current node's max_x, it can be min(c_s, s). But the choice of c_s must be such that min(c_s, s) = m. How?\n\nLet me think. For a given node, once we have determined the sum s of the children's max_x, the max_x for the current node is m = min(c_s, s). So, for the current node's max_x to be m, c_s must be >= m (so that min(c_s, s) = m) and also:\n\nif s >= m: then c_s can be in [m, ... , min(k, s)] ?\n\nWait, no. For the min(c_s, s) to be equal to m, two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: s >= m and c_s = m. Because then min(m, s) = m.\n\nOr:\n\nCase 2: c_s >= s and m = s.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. The value of min(c_s, s) is m. So:\n\nIf m <= s, then c_s must be >= m (so that min(c_s, s) is m if c_s is exactly m, or higher than m but s is larger. Wait, no. Suppose s is fixed. For example, suppose s is fixed. Then min(c_s, s) is equal to m. So:\n\nIf m <= s, then c_s must be >= m and m <= s. But how can min(c_s, s) be m?\n\nWell, if c_s >= m and s >= m, then min(c_s, s) could be m only if m is the minimum between c_s and s. Which requires that m = min(c_s, s). So:\n\nEither:\n\n- c_s = m and s >= m → min(c_s, s) = m.\n\nOR\n\n- s = m and c_s >= m → min(c_s, s) = m.\n\nBut in this case, the value of m is determined by the sum of the children's max_x (s) and the choice of c_s. So for the current node's max_x to be m, given that the sum of children's max_x is s, we have:\n\nIf m <= s: then c_s can be any value between m and k, but also, m must be the min(c_s, s). So:\n\nIf m <= s, then min(c_s, s) = m implies that c_s >= m and s >= m, and that m is the minimum. Which can happen in two ways:\n\nEither:\n\n- c_s = m (so min(m, s) = m, since s >= m)\n\nOR\n\n- s = m and c_s >= m (so min(c_s, m) = m).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again. For a given s (sum of children's max_x), what are the possible c_s values that would make min(c_s, s) = m?\n\nLet me consider that for the current node, after determining the children's max_x (sum s), the current node's max_x is m = min(c_s, s). So for this to be m, we have:\n\nm must be ≤ s (since min(c_s, s) can't exceed s).\n\nThen, for m to be exactly the value, we have two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\n- c_s = m (so that min(m, s) = m, which is true since s ≥ m).\n\nOR\n\n- c_s ≥ s, and m = s. So min(c_s, s) = s = m.\n\nSo, combining these possibilities, the set of valid c_s values for a given s and desired m is:\n\nIf m < s: then c_s must be exactly m. Because if c_s is larger than m, then min(c_s, s) would be min(s, c_s) which is s (since s ≥ m and c_s ≥ m, but if c_s is larger than m, but less than s, then min(c_s, s) would be c_s, which is larger than m. So in that case, m would not be the result. Hence, for m < s, the only way to get min(c_s, s) = m is to have c_s = m.\n\nIf m = s: then c_s can be any value ≥ s. Because then min(c_s, s) = s = m.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nFor a given s (sum of children's max_x), the number of ways to choose c_s such that the current node's max_x is m is:\n\nif m < s: 1 way (c_s = m) if m is between 0 and k.\n\nif m == s: (k - s + 1) ways (since c_s can be from s to k, inclusive) provided that s ≤ k.\n\nOtherwise, 0.\n\nBut wait, this is only if the current node's max_x is m. So, for a non-leaf node, given that the sum of children's max_x is s, the number of ways to choose c_s for this node to have max_x m is:\n\nif m < s: 1 if 0 ≤ m ≤ k.\n\nif m == s: (k - s + 1) if 0 ≤ s ≤ k.\n\nelse 0.\n\nBut this is only for a single node. However, the sum s is determined by the children's max_x. So, for a non-leaf node, the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's assignments such that the current node's max_x is m is:\n\nsum over all possible pairs of left_max and right_max, where left_max + right_max = s, and then for each such s, multiply the number of ways to get left_max and right_max (from their subtrees) by the number of ways to choose c_s for this node (based on s and m).\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet me think recursively. For a node at depth l (non-leaf), the number of ways to get a max_x of m is:\n\nsum_{s} [ (number of ways for children to have sum s) * (number of ways to choose c_s for this node to have m given s) ]\n\nBut how do we compute the sum over s?\n\nWait, for a node with two children (left and right), the sum s is left_max + right_max. So for each possible left_max and right_max, their sum is s. For each possible m, we need to compute the number of (left_max, right_max) pairs where left_max + right_max = s, multiplied by the number of ways for the children to have those values, multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s for this node given s and m.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy, especially since for each node, we need to track all possible m values.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, the maximum depth is 15, and for each node, the possible max_x values can be up to the sum of the possible max_x of the children. However, for a node at depth l, the maximum possible sum of children's max_x is 2^{n - l} * 1, since each child can contribute up to 1 (for leaves) or more for higher nodes. Wait, no. Actually, the maximum possible sum for the children can be up to something. For example, for a node at depth l, the sum of the children's max_x can be up to 2^{n - l} * something. However, since n is small (up to 15), perhaps the numbers are manageable.\n\nBut even with n=15, the maximum possible m for a node is 2^{n} (since each of the 2^n leaves contributes 1 if possible). However, since k can be up to 2e5, but for the purposes of the DP, perhaps we need to track the possible m up to min(2^{n}, k) ?\n\nBut let's think about the DP approach. Let's define for each node, a function that returns a dictionary (or array) where for each possible m, the value is the number of ways to assign the c_s's in the subtree rooted at this node such that the max_x of this node is m.\n\nFor leaves (depth n), the possible m is 0 or 1, as discussed.\n\nFor non-leaf nodes (depth l < n), the possible m is up to the sum of the max_x of their children. However, since the children are nodes at depth l+1, which themselves can have varying max_x values, the sum can be up to 2^{n - l} ?\n\nBut for the DP, we can process the nodes in a bottom-up manner. Starting from the leaves (depth n), moving up to depth 1.\n\nAt each step, for a node of depth l, we compute the possible m values based on the possible combinations of its children's m values.\n\nSo, for a node at depth l, the children are at depth l+1. For each child, we have their DP tables. For the current node, the possible m values depend on the sum of the left and right children's m values, and the choice of c_s for this node.\n\nSo, for each node, we can compute its DP table as follows:\n\nInitialize a dictionary (or array) for this node's DP.\n\nFor all possible left_m and right_m (from the left and right children's DP tables), compute s = left_m + right_m. Then, for this s, compute the contribution to the current node's DP for each possible m.\n\nFor each possible m, the contribution is:\n\ncount_left[left_m] * count_right[right_m] * ways_to_choose_c_s_for_this_node_given_s_and_m.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each node:\n\n   if it's a leaf:\n\n      compute dp_leaf[0] = 1 (when c_s is 0)\n\n      dp_leaf[1] = k (when c_s >=1)\n\n   else:\n\n      for all possible left_m and right_m:\n\n          compute s = left_m + right_m\n\n          for each possible m:\n\n              if m < s:\n\n                  if m is between 0 and k:\n\n                      add (count_left[left_m] * count_right[right_m]) * 1 to dp_current[m]\n\n              elif m == s:\n\n                  if s <=k:\n\n                      add (count_left[left_m] * count_right[right_m]) * (k - s + 1) to dp_current[m]\n\n              else:\n\n                  nothing\n\nBut since the left and right children are identical in structure (each is a subtree of depth l+1), perhaps we can compute their DP tables and then combine them.\n\nBut for each node, the left and right children are separate, so their DP tables are independent. Thus, for each node, the DP is computed as the convolution of the left and right children's DP tables, multiplied by the possible ways to choose c_s for the current node.\n\nBut how to compute this convolution efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For a non-leaf node, the left and right children are both subtrees of depth l+1. Let's assume that their DP tables are already computed. Then, for each possible left_m and right_m, we can compute s = left_m + right_m, and then for each possible m, accumulate the count.\n\nBut for each node, the DP table can be represented as an array where index m represents the number of ways to achieve that m.\n\nThe problem is that for each node, the possible m values can be up to the maximum sum of the children's m values. For example, for a node at depth l, the maximum possible sum s is 2^{n - l} (since each of the 2^{n - l} leaves contributes 1). However, for n=15, the maximum possible m for the root node (depth 1) would be 2^{14} = 16384. For n=15 and k up to 2e5, this is manageable.\n\nSo, for each node, during the DP computation, we can precompute all possible m values up to the maximum possible sum for that node's children.\n\nBut how do we compute the maximum possible sum for the children? For a node at depth l, the maximum possible sum of the children's max_x is 2^{n - l} * 1 (since each child can contribute up to 1, and there are two children, but each of their subtrees can contribute up to 2^{n - (l+1)} } ? Wait, no. For example, for a node at depth l, each child is a node of depth l+1. The maximum sum of their max_x is the sum of the maximum possible values for each child. For each child, the maximum possible max_x is 2^{n - (l+1)} }, because each of their subtrees can contribute up to 2^{n - (l+1)} }, but that's not necessarily correct. Wait, for example, for a node at depth l, the maximum possible sum of its children's max_x is 2 * (max possible for a node of depth l+1). But for a node of depth l+1, the maximum possible max_x is the maximum number of strings that can be selected under their constraints. Which for a node of depth l+1, the maximum would be 2^{n - (l+1)} }, assuming that all c_s are sufficiently large (k >= ...). But this is not directly relevant here.\n\nBut regardless, for the DP computation, the maximum possible m for a node at depth l is the sum of the maximum possible m for each child, which for a node at depth l is 2 * (max for depth l+1). Since n is up to 15, the maximum possible m for the root (depth 1) is 2^{n-1} = 2^14 = 16384. Which is manageable.\n\nThus, for each node, during the DP computation, we can compute all possible m values up to 2^{n - l} (but perhaps even more, depending on the k value).\n\nBut since k can be up to 2e5, which is larger than 2^15 (32768), for n=15, the maximum possible m for the root is 2^14 = 16384, which is less than 2e5. So, for the cases where k is larger than the maximum possible m, the term (k - s + 1) would be (k - s + 1) when m = s.\n\nThus, the DP tables for each node can be represented as arrays of size up to 2^{n} (since for depth 1, the maximum is 2^{n-1}).\n\nBut with n up to 15, 2^15 is 32768, which is manageable. For each node, the DP array can be up to size 2^{n}.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each node (starting from leaves and moving up) the DP array, which for each possible m, holds the number of ways to assign c_s's in the subtree such that the max_x for this node is m.\n\n- Once the root's DP is computed (the root is the node of depth 1?), no, wait the root is the node of depth 1? Or perhaps the root is the node of depth 1, but the root has two children (depth 2). Wait, the root is the first level. For example, for n=2, the root is the node of depth 1 (strings of length 1), and their children are depth 2 (strings of length 2, the leaves).\n\nBut for the entire problem, the maximum x is the sum of the max_x of the root's children (the two nodes of depth 1). Wait, no. The root's children are the nodes of depth 1. The max_x for the root's children is computed as per their own DP. The maximum x for the entire tree is the sum of the max_x of the two children of the root (the two nodes of depth 1). Because the root is not constrained, and the total number of strings in the multiset is the sum of the max_x of the root's children.\n\nWait, let's think again. The root is not part of the constraints. The maximum x is the number of strings in the multiset, which is the sum of the max_x of the root's children (the two nodes of depth 1). Because each of those nodes is a string of length 1, and their max_x is the number of strings in the multiset that have them as a prefix. Since the multiset consists of strings of length n, each such string has exactly one prefix of length 1. Therefore, the total number of strings in the multiset is the sum of the max_x of the root's children.\n\nSo, the problem requires that this sum is exactly f. Therefore, after computing the DP for the root's children (the two nodes of depth 1), we need to find the number of ways where the sum of their max_x is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nActually, the root is not a node in the tree. The nodes are the strings of lengths 1 to n. The root's children (the nodes of depth 1) are two nodes. Each of these nodes has their own DP tables. Let me think of the entire tree as starting from the nodes of depth 1 (the first level). For example, for n=1, the nodes are of depth 1 (the leaves). Then, the maximum x is the sum of the max_x",
