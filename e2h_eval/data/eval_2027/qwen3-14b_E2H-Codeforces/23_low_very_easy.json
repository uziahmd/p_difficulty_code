In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimum number of tiles required.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible cases. The initial hand has three tiles. So, for each case, we need to check if there's already a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut how do we check for possible mentsu?\n\nLet me break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to consider adding tiles. But since the problem allows adding any number of tiles (but we want the minimum), we need to find the minimal steps required.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nFor example, in the third sample input: 3p, 9m, 2p. The answer is 1. Because by adding 1p, you can have 2p, 3p, 1p (sorted as 1p, 2p, 3p) which is a sequence. Alternatively, adding 4p would make 2p, 3p, 4p. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the problem is to find whether the current tiles can form a mentsu with adding some tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about all possibilities.\n\nFirst, check if the existing three tiles already form a mentsu. For that, check if they are all same (triplet) or form a sequence (shuntsu).\n\nIf that's the case, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut what's the minimal possible? Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Can form a triplet by adding one tile. For example, if two of the same tiles exist. Like if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding another 1m would make a triplet. So that would require 1 tile. Or maybe there's a way to form a sequence with adding one tile?\n\nWait, but the existing three tiles may not form a triplet or sequence. So we need to check all possibilities.\n\nBut how to approach this? Let's think about all possible ways to form a mentsu with the existing tiles plus some added ones.\n\nThe minimal number of tiles needed could be 0 (if already exists), 1, 2, or even 3?\n\nWait, for example, if the three tiles are all different suits and numbers. Like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two more tiles of same type. But that would take two steps. But maybe there's a better way. Wait, no. To form a triplet, you need three same tiles. So if you have one, you need two more. But if you have two, you need one more. So for example, if the initial three are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding one 1m gives triplet. So 1 tile.\n\nAlternatively, maybe forming a sequence. For example, if you have 1m, 2m, 3m, then you have a sequence. But if you have 1m, 2m, 4m. Then you can add 3m to make a sequence. That's 1 tile.\n\nSo the minimal is 1 in that case.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add to get either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nNow, the question is how to check for all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n\nFor the given three tiles, check if there's already a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check for all possibilities of adding tiles to reach a mentsu. Find the minimal steps.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios for forming a triplet or sequence.\n\nFirst, for triplet:\n\nWe need three same tiles. So, for example, if the current tiles have two of the same, then adding one more. If there's one, then adding two. Or if none, then adding three.\n\nBut maybe in some cases, adding two tiles can form a triplet. For example, if the current tiles are [1m, 2m, 3m], then to form a triplet, you need to add two more of any tile. But that's not optimal. But perhaps there's a better way. However, the problem is to find the minimal steps. So for example, if the current tiles can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw in order to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) with her current hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current three tiles already form a valid mentsu. If they do, no extra tiles are needed.\n2. **Check for Triplet Potential**: If the current tiles can form a triplet by adding one or two more tiles, calculate the required number.\n3. **Check for Sequence Potential**: If the current tiles can form a sequence by adding one or two more tiles, calculate the required number.\n4. **Determine Minimum**: Compare the minimum number of tiles needed for both triplet and sequence possibilities and return the smallest value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_triplet(tiles):\n    return tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]\n\ndef is_sequence(tiles):\n    #

For [1,2,5], need to add 3 and 4 (2 tiles)\n        # For [1,4,5], need to add 2 or 3 (but not sure)\n        # Let's think of all possible combinations\n        \n        # Generate all possible sequences that can be formed with the existing numbers plus added ones\n        # The possible sequences can be of length 3, so we need to check all possible sequences that can be formed\n        # Since there are only 3 numbers, let's consider all possible ways to extend them\n        # For example, if the numbers are a, b, c (sorted), we can check if any of the following is possible:\n        \n        # Check if adding 1 tile can complete a sequence\n        # For example, check if there exists a sequence where two of the numbers are consecutive and the third is one step away\n        # Or check if there's a gap of 1 between two numbers and the third is at least two steps away\n        # Alternatively, we can generate all possible sequences that include at least two of the current numbers and see how many more are needed\n        \n        # Another approach is to consider all possible sequences that could contain the existing numbers and compute the minimal additions required.\n        \n        # Let's try to find the minimal number of tiles to add for this suit\n        #

For each possible start s, check if the numbers in the current list can form part of s, s+1, s+2\n        # Then compute how many tiles are needed to complete the sequence\n        \n        # For example, for current numbers a, b, c:\n        # For each s in 1..7, check how many of s, s+1, s+2 are already present\n        # The required is 3 - count of existing numbers in the sequence\n        \n        # Find the minimal required across all possible s\n        min_add_for_suit = float('inf')\n        for s in range(1, 8):\n            seq = {s, s+1, s+2}\n            current_in_seq = 0\n            for num in nums_sorted:\n                if num in seq:\n                    current_in_seq += 1\n            required = 3 - current_in_seq\n            if required < min_add_for_suit:\n                min_add_for_suit = required\n        #

So the minimal is 1\n        # But in the code above, the triplet check was done earlier\n        # However, in the code, after checking if the initial tiles are already a mentsu, we check for triplet possibility\n        # So maybe the code should also consider the possibility of forming a triplet by adding tiles\n        # However, the code above for triplet was handled earlier\n        # So perhaps the code needs to compare the possible triplet and sequence options\n        # Let me re-express this part\n        # After checking for existing mentsu, we check for triplet and sequence possibilities\n        # So, the code for triplet is handled earlier, and here we handle sequence\n        # So the minimal between triplet and sequence would be considered\n        # But in the code above, the triplet part is handled first, and the sequence part is handled here\n        # So the minimal is the minimum between the triplet required and the sequence required\n        # So in the code, after checking the triplet, we check the sequence and take the minimum\n        # However, in the current code, the triplet part is handled first, and the sequence part is handled here\n        # So the code should compare the two options\n        # Therefore, after calculating the possible sequence additions, we need to compare it with the triplet option\n        # So, let's recalculate the possible minimal for triplet and sequence\n        # Let's redo the code for the triplet and sequence parts\n        # So, after checking if the existing tiles are already a mentsu, we calculate the minimal for triplet and sequence\n        # Let me adjust the code accordingly\n        # So, the code after checking existing mentsu is as follows:\n        # Calculate the minimal for triplet and sequence\n        # For triplet:\n        # The current maximum frequency is either 1 or 2\n        # For example, if max_count is 2, then need 1 more tile to make triplet\n        # If max_count is 1, then need 2 more tiles\n        # For sequence:\n        # The minimal_add is calculated as above\n        # Then the answer is the minimum between the triplet and sequence options\n        # So in the code, after computing the minimal_add for sequence, we compare with the triplet option\n        # So in the code:\n        # triplet_required = 2 if max_count == 1 else 1 if max_count == 2 else 3\n        # Wait, the code earlier has:\n        # max_count = max(freq.values())\n        # if max_count == 2:\n        #     return 1\n        # elif max_count == 1:\n        #     return 2\n        # But that's not correct, because the code returns immediately, but we need to compare with the sequence option\n        # Therefore, the code structure needs to be revised to calculate both triplet and sequence options and then take the minimum\n        # So the correct approach is:\n        # After checking that the existing tiles do not form a mentsu, compute the minimal for triplet and for sequence, then take the minimum of the two.\n        # Therefore, the code should be adjusted to calculate both possibilities\n        # Let me restructure the code accordingly\n        # So, here's the corrected approach:\n        # Compute the minimal tiles needed for triplet and for sequence, then return the minimum of the two\n        # So, after checking that the initial tiles are not a mentsu:\n        # Calculate the triplet_required\n        # Calculate the sequence_required\n        # Return the minimum of triplet_required and sequence_required\n        # So, in the code, after the first check, we need to calculate both possibilities\n        # Therefore, the code should be modified as follows:\n        # Let me re-implement the code accordingly\n\n    #

We need to find the minimal number of tiles to add\n        # Since we have only 3 numbers, let's see possible scenarios\n        # For example, if the numbers are [a, b, c], sorted\n        a, b, c = nums_sorted\n        if b == a + 1 and c == b + 1:\n            # Already a sequence, but we checked earlier, so this shouldn't happen\n            continue\n        # Check if adding one tile can make a sequence\n        # Possible cases:\n        # 1. a, a+1, a+2: already a sequence\n        # 2. a, a+1, a+3: need a+2 (1 tile)\n        # 3. a, a+2, a+3: need a+1 (1 tile)\n        # 4. a, a+1, a+4: need a+2 and a+3 (2 tiles)\n        # etc.\n        # So for the three numbers, we can check if any of the following conditions can be met with adding 1 or 2 tiles\n        # Let's check for possible sequences\n        # Find the minimal tiles required to form a sequence\n        # For example, if the three numbers are [1,2,4], then the minimal is 1 (add 3)\n        # For [1,3,5], need to add 2 and 4 (2 tiles)\n        # For [1,2,5], need to add 3 and 4 (2 tiles)\n        # For [1,4,5], need to add 2 or 3 (but not sure)\n        # Let's think of all possible combinations\n        \n        # Generate all possible sequences that can be formed with the existing numbers plus added ones\n        # The possible sequences can be of length 3, so we need to check all possible sequences that can be formed\n        # Since there are only 3 numbers, let's consider all possible ways to extend them\n        # For example, if the numbers are a, b, c (sorted), we can check if any of the following is possible:\n        \n        # Check if adding 1 tile can complete a sequence\n        # For example, check if there exists a sequence where two of the numbers are consecutive and the third is one step away\n        # Or check if there's a gap of 1 between two numbers and the third is at least two steps away\n        # Alternatively, we can generate all possible sequences that include at least two of the current numbers and see how many more are needed\n        \n        # Another approach is to consider all possible sequences that could contain the existing numbers and compute the minimal additions required.\n        \n        # Let's try to find the minimal number of tiles to add for this suit\n        # For example, the current numbers are [a, b, c]\n        # Check for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers that can be formed by adding some tiles\n        # For each possible starting number from 1 to 7 (since 7,8,9 is the max sequence)\n        # For each possible start s, check if the numbers in the current list can form part of s, s+1, s+2\n        # Then compute how many tiles are needed to complete the sequence\n        \n        # For example, for current numbers a, b, c:\n        # For each s in 1..7, check how many of s, s+1, s+2 are already present\n        # The required is 3 - count of existing numbers in the sequence\n        \n        # Find the minimal required across all possible s\n        min_add_for_suit = float('inf')\n        for s in range(1, 8):\n            seq = {s, s+1, s+2}\n            current_in_seq = 0\n            for num in nums_sorted:\n                if num in seq:\n                    current_in_seq += 1\n            required = 3 - current_in_seq\n            if required < min_add_for_suit:\n                min_add_for_suit = required\n        #

Wait, earlier code checked for triplet possibility\n        # But perhaps the triplet case is better\n        # For example, if the current tiles have two of the same, then adding one more\n        # So the minimal is 1\n        # But in the code above, the triplet check was done earlier\n        # However, in the code, after checking if the initial tiles are already a mentsu, we check for triplet possibility\n        # So maybe the code should also consider the possibility of forming a triplet by adding tiles\n        # However, the code above for triplet was handled earlier\n        # So perhaps the code needs to compare the possible triplet and sequence options\n        # Let me re-express this part\n        # After checking for existing mentsu, we check for triplet and sequence possibilities\n        # So, the code for triplet is handled earlier, and here we handle sequence\n        # So the minimal between triplet and sequence would be considered\n        # But in the code above, the triplet part is handled first, and the sequence part is handled here\n        # So the minimal is the minimum between the triplet required and the sequence required\n        # So in the code, after checking the triplet, we check the sequence and take the minimum\n        # However, in the current code, the triplet part is handled first, and the sequence part is handled here\n        # So the code should compare the two options\n        # Therefore, after calculating the possible sequence additions, we need to compare it with the triplet option\n        # So, let's recalculate the possible minimal for triplet and sequence\n        # Let's redo the code for the triplet and sequence parts\n        # So, after checking if the existing tiles are already a mentsu, we calculate the minimal for triplet and sequence\n        # Let me adjust the code accordingly\n        # So, the code after checking existing mentsu is as follows:\n        # Calculate the minimal for triplet and sequence\n        # For triplet:\n        # The current maximum frequency is either 1 or 2\n        # For example, if max_count is 2, then need 1 more tile to make triplet\n        # If max_count is 1, then need 2 more tiles\n        # For sequence:\n        # The minimal_add is calculated as above\n        # Then the answer is the minimum between the triplet and sequence options\n        # So in the code, after computing the minimal_add for sequence, we compare with the triplet option\n        # So in the code:\n        # triplet_required = 2 if max_count == 1 else 1 if max_count == 2 else 3\n        # Wait, the code earlier has:\n        # max_count = max(freq.values())\n        # if max_count == 2:\n        #     return 1\n        # elif max_count == 1:\n        #     return 2\n        # But that's not correct, because the code returns immediately, but we need to compare with the sequence option\n        # Therefore, the code structure needs to be revised to calculate both triplet and sequence options and then take the minimum\n        # So the correct approach is:\n        # After checking that the existing tiles do not form a mentsu, compute the minimal for triplet and for sequence, then take the minimum of the two.\n        # Therefore, the code should be adjusted to calculate both possibilities\n        # Let me restructure the code accordingly\n        # So, here's the corrected approach:\n        # Compute the minimal tiles needed for triplet and for sequence, then return the minimum of the two\n        # So, after checking that the initial tiles are not a mentsu:\n        # Calculate the triplet_required\n        # Calculate the sequence_required\n        # Return the minimum of triplet_required and sequence_required\n        # So, in the code, after the first check, we need to calculate both possibilities\n        # Therefore, the code should be modified as follows:\n        # Let me re-implement the code accordingly\n\n    # Re-approach the problem:\n    # After checking for existing mentsu, compute the minimal for triplet and sequence\n    # For triplet:\n    # The number of tiles needed depends on the maximum frequency of any tile\n    max_freq = max(freq.values())\n    if max_freq == 2:\n        triplet_needed = 1\n    elif max_freq == 1:\n        triplet_needed = 2\n    else:\n        triplet_needed = 3  # Should not happen as we checked for existing triplet\n\n    # For sequence:\n    # As before, compute the minimal_add for sequence\n    # Then the answer is min(triplet_needed, sequence_required)\n\n    # Recompute the sequence_required properly\n    # Reset min_add\n    min_add = float('inf')\n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        if len(nums) < 3:\n            continue\n        nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n        a, b, c = nums_sorted\n        #
