He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo, given m, we need to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5! it's 120 (one zero). 6! is 720, same count. Up to 9! which is 362880. So all those numbers have exactly one trailing zero. But why? Because when you go from 5 to 9, the count of 5s increases only once (for 5, 10 would add another). Wait, but 5,6,7,8,9: each of their factorials have exactly one 5 in their factors. Because 5 contributes one, 6-9 don't add any more 5s. But when you get to 10, then 10/5 is 2, plus 10/25 is 0, so total two zeros. So for m=1, the possible n's are from 5 to 9, which is five numbers.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the trailing zero count is exactly m. But how?\n\nThe approach here is to find the possible n's that would result in exactly m zeros. However, there's a catch. For some m, there might be no n's. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Wait, let's think. Let's compute for n=24: 24/5 = 4, 24/25=0. Total 4 zeros. For n=25, it's 25/5=5 + 25/25=1 → 6 zeros. So between 24 and 25, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is exactly 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be 0. So the problem requires checking for such cases.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n2. Determine how many such n's exist and list them.\n\nBut how do I find these n's?\n\nFirst, I need to find the lower and upper bounds of n that would produce exactly m zeros. But since the count of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but sometimes jumps by more than 1 (like when n is a multiple of 5, 25, etc.), there might be ranges where the count is m.\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThe key observation here is that for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or other counts?) that satisfy f(n) = m. Wait, how?\n\nFor example, when m is 1, there are 5 numbers (5-9). When m is 2, let's see. Let's find n where f(n) = 2.\n\nLooking for n:\n\nn=10: f(10) = 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0). So 10! has 2 zeros. Then 11! also has 2, until 14! (since 15/5=3, 15/25=0 → 3 zeros). So for m=2, the possible n's are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 → 5 numbers again. So same pattern.\n\nWait, but why does this happen? Because when you have a number that is not a multiple of 5, adding 1 to it doesn't change the count of 5s. So for numbers between 5k and 5k+4 (but not including 5k+5?), the count of trailing zeros is same. But when you reach 5k+5, which is 5(k+1), then the count increases by 1",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. Additionally, we must list these integers in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight:\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This can be computed using the formula:\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis sum continues until the division result becomes zero.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\n1. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given `m`, find the smallest and largest values of `n` such that `f(n) = m`.\n2. **Check Validity**: If no such `n` exists (i.e., the trailing zeroes jump over `m`), return 0.\n3. **Generate Results**: If valid `n` values exist, output them in ascending order.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n\n- Use binary search to find the smallest `n` where `f(n) = m`.\n- Use binary search to find the largest `n` where `f(n) = m`.\n- If the smallest and largest values differ by at least 4, then there are multiple `n` values satisfying the condition.\n- Otherwise, if the difference is less than 4, there are no such `n`.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_for_m(m):\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m\n    lower = -1\n    upper = -1\n\n    # Find the smallest n where count_trailing_zeros(n) == m\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    lower = left\n\n    # Find the largest n where count_trailing_zeros(n) == m\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros > m:\n            right = mid - 1\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    upper = right\n\n    if count_trailing_zeros(lower) != m:\n        return []\n    if count_trailing_zeros(upper) != m:\n        return []\n\n    return list(range(lower, upper + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m_values = [int(x) for x in input_line.split()]\n\n    results = []\n    for m in m_values:\n        ns = find_n_for_m(m)\n        results.append(str(len(ns)))\n        if len(ns) > 0:\n            results.append(' '.join(map(str, ns)))\n\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.\n- `find_n_for_m(m)` uses binary search to find the smallest and largest `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.\n- If no such `n` exists (i.e., the count jumps over `m`), it returns an empty list.\n- The main function reads input values and prints the results accordingly.\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles edge cases such as when no such `n` exists.",
