He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find these n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or some other count?) that satisfy this. Wait, the example shows for m=1, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Wait why? Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors, but the count remains the same until the next multiple of 5. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nFor example, 5! has 1 zero. 6! is 720, which also ends with one zero. Similarly, 7! is 5040, same. 8! is 40320, same. 9! is 362880. Then 10! has two zeros. So between 5 and 9 inclusive, there are 5 numbers where the trailing zero count is exactly 1. So for m=1, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key here is that for certain m values, there may be multiple n's that produce exactly m zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nThe approach I need to take is:\n\n1. Find all n's where the number of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that would result in exactly m zeros. Let's think about how the trailing zero count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, it adds at least one zero. If it's a multiple of 25, then it adds two, etc.\n\nSo for a given m, there might be a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I can find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there are either 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, the example shows 5 numbers. But why?\n\nWait, let's think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. For numbers between 5k and 5k+4, the f(n) would be the same as for 5k. Unless there's another multiple of 5 in that range. For example, 25 is 5^2, so when you reach 25, the count increases by two. So for numbers from 25 to 29, the count would be f(25) = 6 (since 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). Then for 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, the count is 6. Then 30 adds another 5, so f(30) is 7. So in this case, there are 5 numbers (25-29) that give 6 trailing zeros. Wait, but 25 is part of that. So maybe the number of possible n's for a given m is either 0, 1, or 5?\n\nWait, but what if m is such that there's no n that gives exactly m zeros? Like, for example, m=5. Let's see. Let's compute f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. f(25) is 5 + 1 = 6. So there's no n where f(n)=5. So for m=5, the answer is zero. So in this case, the output is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists n's such that f(n) = m, and if so, how many and which ones.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many positive integers $ n $ exist such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes. If such numbers exist, we must also list them in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $ is determined by the count of factors of 5 in the product $ 1 \\times 2 \\times \\ldots \\times n $. This can be computed using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{count\\_zeroes}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis function increases in steps, and for some values of $ m $, multiple values of $ n $ may result in the same number of trailing zeroes.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeroes}(n) = m $.\n   - Then, check consecutive values to see if more than one $ n $ satisfies the condition.\n\n2. **Check Validity of $ m $**:\n   - If no $ n $ exists such that $ \\text{count\\_zeroes}(n) = m $, return `0`.\n\n3. **Generate Result**:\n   - If such $ n $'s exist, collect all consecutive values of $ n $ that yield exactly $ m $ trailing zeroes.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Binary search to find the lower bound of n where count_zeroes(n) == m\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    left = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if cz == m:\n            left = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        elif cz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if left == -1:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    current = left\n    while count_zeroes(current) == m:\n        result.append(current)\n        current += 1\n\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    n_list = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(n_list))\n    if len(n_list) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, n_list)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- The `count_zeroes` function computes the number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $.\n- The `find_n_values` function uses binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeroes}(n) = m $, then checks all subsequent values until the count changes.\n- If no such $ n $ is found, the result is an empty list.\n- The `main` function reads input, calls `find_n_values`, and prints the output as required.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nFor input `1`, the function will return:\n\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nFor input `5`, the function will return:\n\n```\n0\n```\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly, including when no such $ n $ exists.",
