Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, Valera's paper is a square of size n x n, where n is an odd number. The task is to check if the letters form an \"X\" according to the teacher's definition. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check all the cells on the two diagonals. All of them must be the same. Then, check all the other cells to see if they are the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the diagonals. For a square matrix, the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). For each cell in these two diagonals, we need to check if they are all the same.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping cells? Since n is odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, for example, when n=3, the center cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. So when checking the diagonals, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are the same. But since the center cell is part of both, it's already covered once.\n\nSo the first step is to collect all the cells that are on either of the two diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same character.\n\nThen, collect all the other cells (those not on the diagonals) and check that they are all the same, and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input matrix.\n2. Check if all diagonal cells are the same.\n3. Check if all non-diagonal cells are the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, for each cell (i,j) in the matrix, determine if it is on either of the two diagonals.\n\nA cell is on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if either condition is true, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo for all cells in the matrix, we can check if they are on any of the diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Let's take the first cell (0,0) as the reference. All diagonal cells must be equal to this character. But wait, what if there are multiple cells? For example, if the first cell is 'x', but another diagonal cell is 'y'? Then it's invalid.\n\nSo, for all cells in the diagonals, check that they are equal to the first diagonal cell's value. If any is different, return NO.\n\nThen, for the non-diagonal cells, check that they are all equal to each other and also not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nWait, but what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells (since the center is counted twice). The total cells are 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4. For example, in n=3, the cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So they are 4 cells.\n\nSo, for the non-diagonal cells, we need to check that all of them are the same, and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the diagonal character (d_char). It's the character of the first cell (0,0). But wait, maybe there's a case where the first cell is part of the diagonal, but others are different. So we need to check all diagonal cells.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCollect all the diagonal characters. Check that all are the same. Let's say they are all 'x'. Then collect all non-diagonal characters and check they are all same and not 'x'.\n\nSo how to do that?\n\nFirst, iterate through all cells. For each cell, check if it is on a diagonal.\n\nFor the first part, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect them into a set. If the size of the set is not 1, then it's invalid. Also, if there are no diagonal cells (but that's impossible since n is at least 3, so there are diagonals).\n\nWait, for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells. So the set of diagonal characters must have exactly one element.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then collect all non-diagonal characters. Again, collect them into a set. If the size is not 1, then invalid. Also, check that the non-diagonal set's element is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\n- For each cell (i,j) in the matrix:\n\n   if i == j or i + j == n-1: add to diagonal_chars.\n\nCheck that all elements in diagonal_chars are the same.\n\nCheck non-diagonal:\n\n- For each cell (i,j) not in diagonals: add to non_diagonal_chars.\n\nCheck that all elements in non_diagonal_chars are same and different from diagonal_chars.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nIn code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\n   if i == j or i + j == n-1: it's a diagonal cell.\n\nElse: non-diagonal.\n\nSo, collect all diagonal characters. Let's collect them in a list. Then check that all elements in this list are the same.\n\nSimilarly for non-diagonal.\n\nBut how to check that all elements in a list are the same? Well, for example, take the first element, then check that all others are equal to it.\n\nBut if the list is empty? Well, for non-diagonal, when n is 3, there are 4 cells. So for n >=3, the non-diagonal list is not empty.\n\nBut for the diagonal list, it's always non-empty.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nmatrix = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(matrix[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(matrix[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1: print NO\n\nelse:\n\n   d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n\n   if len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) != 1: print NO\n\n   else:\n\n      nd_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n\n      if nd_char == d_char: print NO\n\n      else: print YES\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. For n=5, the number of non-diagonal cells is 25 - (5 + 5 -1) = 25 -9 = 16. So for any n >=3, the non_diagonal_chars is not empty. So the code is safe.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3, and for n=3, the non-diagonal is 4 cells. So no.\n\nBut let me check for n=1. But the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nBut let me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are cells where i==j or i +j =4.\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (i==j) and j=4 (i+j=4). So first row, first and last cell are diagonal.\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, j=1 (i==j) and j=3 (i+j=4). So row 1, columns 1 and 3.\n\nFor i=2, j=2 (i==j) and j=2 (i +j=4? 2+2=4? yes. So for i=2, j=2 is in both diagonals. So the cell (2,2) is part of both.\n\nSo the diagonal cells include:\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(0,4) x\n\n(1,1) x\n\n(1,3) x\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,1) x\n\n(3,3) x\n\n(4,0) x\n\n(4,4) x\n\nWait, let me count all the diagonal cells for n=5.\n\nEach diagonal has 5 cells. But the intersection is one cell (the center). So total is 5 +5 -1 =9 cells.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars for this example would be:\n\nLooking at the matrix:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) x; (0,4) x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) x; (1,3) x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) x.\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) x; (3,3) x.\n\nRow 4: x o o o x → (4,0) x; (4,4) x.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars are: x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x. All x. So the set is {x}.\n\nThen non_diagonal_chars are all the other cells. Let's look for them.\n\nFor example, in row 0, columns 1,2,3: o, o, o.\n\nRow 1: columns 0,2,4: o, o, o.\n\nRow 2: columns 0,1,3,4: s, o, o, o.\n\nRow 3: columns 0,2,4: o, o, o.\n\nRow 4: columns 1,2,3: o, o, o.\n\nWait, but in row 2, column 0 is (2,0). i=2, j=0. i +j = 2+0=2, which is not 4. So it's not on the diagonal. So the non-diagonal cells include (2,0) which is 's'.\n\nSo the non_diagonal_chars includes s, o, etc. So the non_diagonal_chars would have some s and o's. For example, the cell (2,0) is 's', which is not part of the diagonals. So the non_diagonal_chars would have s and o. Thus, the set of non_diagonal_chars would have at least two elements, so the code would return NO. Which matches the first example's output of NO.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo matrix:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) w, (0,2) w.\n\ncells (1,1) w.\n\ncells (2,0) w, (2,2) w.\n\nSo diagonal_chars are [w, w, w, w, w]. All same.\n\nNon-diagonal cells:\n\ncells (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So non_diagonal_chars is [s, s, s, s]. All same. And s is different from w. So output YES.\n\nThird example input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nMatrix:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) x, (0,2) x.\n\ncells (1,1) x.\n\ncells (2,0) x, (2,2) e.\n\nSo the diagonal cells are x, x, x, x, e. So the set of diagonal_chars is {x, e}, which has size 2. So the code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'b'. Should return YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'a' → returns NO (since they are same as diagonals).\n\nAnother case: diagonals have different letters. Like, some cells on diagonals are 'a' and others 'b' → returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for reading input, the input is given as first line n, then n lines. But in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as a list of strings. But in the actual code, the input is read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n small letters.\n\nSo in code, read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as a list of strings. But that's probably for the example. For the actual code, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n as int(input())\n\nmatrix = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen collect diagonal and non-diagonal.\n\nBut in Python, for each line in matrix, it's a string. So for i in range(n), j in range(n), matrix[i][j] is the character.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(matrix[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(matrix[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n    if len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        nd_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, the non-diagonal is 4 cells. So no.\n\nBut for n=1, but n is at least 3.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code would collect diagonal_chars as all x's except for the cell (2,0) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2, which is not equal to 4 (n-1 is 4). So that cell is not on the diagonal. So in the matrix, the cell (2,0) is 's', which is part of non-diagonal.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars for the first example is all x's? Let me check the matrix again.\n\nOriginal first example's matrix:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) and (0,4) are on diagonals.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) and (1,3) are on diagonals.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is on diagonal (i==j). Also, i +j for (2,2) is 4. So yes.\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) and (3,3) are on diagonals.\n\nRow 4: x o o o x → (4,0) and (4,4) are on diagonals.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars are:\n\nFor (0,0): x\n\n(0,4): x\n\n(1,1): x\n\n(1,3): x\n\n(2,2): x\n\n(3,1): x\n\n(3,3): x\n\n(4,0): x\n\n(4,4): x\n\nSo all x's. So the set is {x}.\n\nThen the non_diagonal_chars includes the cell (2,0) which is 's', and others. So the non_diagonal_chars has 's' and 'o's. So the set would have size 2. Hence, the code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw → matrix:\n\nRow 0: w s w → (0,0) and (0,2) are diagonal.\n\nRow 1: s w s → (1,1) is diagonal.\n\nRow 2: w s w → (2,0) and (2,2) are diagonal.\n\nSo diagonal_chars are [w, w, w, w, w], set size 1. Non-diagonal chars are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. All s. So set size 1. And s != w → YES.\n\nThird sample input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe → matrix:\n\nRow 0: x p x → (0,0) and (0,2) are diagonal.\n\nRow 1: p x p → (1,1) is diagonal.\n\nRow 2: x p e → (2,0) and (2,2) are diagonal.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e → so the set is {x, e} → len 2 → code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase where n=3, all diagonals are same, non-diagonals same but same as diagonals. For example:\n\nmatrix:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonals are all a's. non-diagonal is all a's. So code checks that non-diagonal is same, but same as diagonals → returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are a, non-diagonals are b. So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have different letters. For example, matrix:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nThen the diagonals are (0,0)=a, (0,2)=a, (1,1)=a, (2,0)=a, (2,2)=a. So all a's. Then non-diagonal cells are (0,1)=b, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=a, (2,1)=b. So non-diagonal chars are [b, b, a, b]. So set is {a, b} → len 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nAnother case: n=5, all diagonals are same, non-diagonal are same but different. So returns YES.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to read input correctly.\n\nBut the input may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, as per the problem statement. Each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So each line is exactly n characters.\n\nSo the code can read each line as input().strip(), but perhaps better to read as input().strip() to avoid any leading or trailing whitespace. However, the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps using input().strip() is safe.\n\nBut in some cases, maybe the input has leading/trailing spaces? Probably not. But according to the problem statement, each line contains n letters. So assuming that each line is exactly n letters, so we can read as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, if the input line is 'xooox' (as in the first example), then input().strip() would be 'xooox', which is 5 characters.\n\nSo code should be okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n as int(input())\n\nThen read n lines, each line as input().strip()\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\nmatrix = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(matrix[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(matrix[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n    if len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        nd_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, the non_diagonal_chars has 4 elements. So no.\n\nBut for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut what if n is 3 and all cells are on diagonals? No, for n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells. The total is 9 cells. So non_diagonal has 4 cells.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 5 followed by the lines. The code returns NO.\n\nSample 2: 3 followed by the lines. Returns YES.\n\nSample 3: 3 followed by the lines. Returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square matrix of size n x n (where n is an odd number) forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria.
