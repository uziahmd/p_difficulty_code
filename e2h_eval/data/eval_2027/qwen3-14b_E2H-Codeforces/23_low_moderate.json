            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimal number of draws required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. The output for each case is the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nSo for each of the three cases given in the input, I have to compute the answer.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each set of three tiles, I need to check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to make it possible.\n\nBut how do I check if a set of tiles can form a mentsu, possibly after adding some tiles?\n\nWait, the problem says that after drawing extra tiles, she can have a mentsu. So the total tiles after adding will be 3 + k, where k is the number of drawn tiles. But the mentsu requires exactly three tiles. So the idea is that among all the tiles she has (original plus drawn), there must be a subset of three that form a mentsu. However, the problem says that she can draw any tiles she wants. So the question is, what's the minimal k such that adding k tiles allows her to have a mentsu.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think. For the original three tiles, maybe they can form a mentsu with some additions. For example, if two of them are same, then adding one more would make a triplet. Or if they are in a sequence, but missing one tile, adding that one would complete the sequence.\n\nBut the original three may not form a mentsu. So the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the combined set contains a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo for each possible scenario, I need to check all possibilities of forming a triplet or a sequence, and find the minimal k required.\n\nLet me think about possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The original three tiles already form a triplet or a sequence. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: The original three can form a triplet with adding one tile. For example, two same tiles. Then adding one more same tile makes a triplet. So k=1.\n\nOr, for sequences: suppose the original three tiles are like 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding a 3s would make a sequence. So k=1.\n\nBut how do I check all possibilities?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), compute how many tiles are needed to form that mentsu, and take the minimal over all possibilities.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, let's think about checking if the current tiles can form a triplet. For that, the three tiles must be the same. If they are, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then maybe we can add some tiles to make a triplet. For example, if two tiles are same, then adding another same tile. So for that case, the required number is 1. But maybe there's a better way?\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the original three tiles may not be able to form a triplet unless adding some tiles. For example, if there are two different tiles, then to make a triplet, you need to add two tiles (if you have one of a kind, then you need two more). Wait, but the original three could have two of the same. Like two 1m and one 2m. Then to make a triplet, you can add another 1m (so total 3), so k=1.\n\nSo for triplet possibilities, the minimal required is based on how many of the same tile are present.\n\nBut for the original three tiles, perhaps they can be part of a triplet. For example, if there are two 1m and one 1p, then you can add one 1m to make a triplet. So the required is 1.\n\nSo for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles to add is (3 - count) where count is the maximum number of same tiles in the original three. For example, if there are two same tiles, then 3-2=1. If there are one same tile, then 3-1=2. But wait, maybe there's a better way? For example, if the original three are all different, but you can add two tiles of the same type. But that would require adding two tiles. So for triplet, the minimal required is 3 - max_count, where max_count is the maximum number of same tiles in the original three.\n\nBut that's only if you",
