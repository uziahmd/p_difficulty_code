You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form an odd-length cycle, and also count the number of ways to do that. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that a simple cycle of odd length with more than one vertex. So, the key here is to find if the graph already has such a cycle. If it does, then t is 0 and w is 1? Wait, no. Because the question says \"the minimum number of edges to add\", so if the graph already has an odd-length cycle, then t is 0 and w is the number of ways to add zero edges (which would be 1 if there's at least one such cycle). But wait, the problem says \"the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of odd length\". So if the graph already contains such a cycle, then adding zero edges would be a valid way. But how many such ways are there? Well, since any existing cycle would count as a way. But maybe the problem considers that even if there are multiple existing cycles, the answer for w is 1? Or maybe not. Wait, the note in the example says that for the input where the graph is a triangle (3 nodes connected in a cycle), the output is 0 1. So that implies that when the graph already contains an odd-length cycle, the answer is t=0 and w=1. But why?\n\nWait, the problem says that the ways are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges. So, if there are multiple existing cycles, but the way to add zero edges is considered as one way. Because adding zero edges is just one way, regardless of how many existing cycles there are. Because the question is about the number of ways to add edges to form such a cycle. So if the graph already has such a cycle, then the way to add zero edges is one way. But maybe the problem counts all possible existing cycles as different ways. But no, because adding zero edges doesn't involve any choices. So regardless of how many existing cycles there are, the number of ways is 1. Because you don't add any edges. So the answer for w would be 1 in that case. But wait, the example input 2 is 3 nodes with 3 edges (a triangle), which is an odd cycle. The output is 0 1. Which matches that. So that's the case.\n\nSo first, we need to check if the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If yes, then t=0 and w=1. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal t and the number of ways to add t edges.\n\nNow, if the graph doesn't have any odd-length cycles, then what's the minimal t?\n\nLet me think about bipartite graphs. A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd-length cycles. So if the graph is bipartite, then adding edges to create an odd-length cycle would require certain steps.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: if the graph is bipartite, then we need to add edges to make it non-bipartite. The minimal number of edges to add would be determined by the structure of the graph.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For a bipartite graph, any cycle is of even length. To create an odd-length cycle, we need to add edges that connect two nodes in the same partition. Because in a bipartition (A, B), all edges go between A and B. Adding an edge between two nodes in A would create a cycle of length odd. For example, if there's a path from u to v in A through some even number of edges (since the graph is bipartite), then adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle of length (even +1) which is odd.\n\nSo the minimal number of edges to add is 1. But how to find the number of ways to do that?\n\nWait, but the minimal t is 1. Because adding a single edge between two nodes in the same partition. But for that, the graph must be bipartitioned into two parts. So, for each connected component, if it is bipartite, then we can find the number of possible edges that can be added within the same partition. Then, the total number of ways would be the sum over all connected components of (number of possible edges in the component's partitions) ?\n\nWait, but adding any such edge would create an odd-length cycle. However, the minimal t is 1, so the answer is t=1 and the number of ways is the sum over all connected components of (the number of possible edges that can be added within the same partition in that component).\n\nBut wait, for each connected component, if it is bipartite, then the number of possible edges that can be added within the same partition is (count_A choose 2) + (count_B choose 2), where count_A and count_B are the sizes of the two partitions. However, since the graph may have multiple connected components, each of which is bipartite. So for each connected component, adding any edge within the same partition of that component would create an odd-length cycle. Therefore, the total number of ways is the sum over all connected components of ( (a_i choose 2) + (b_i choose 2) ), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions of the component.\n\nBut then, the minimal t is 1. Because adding any one of these edges would create an odd-length cycle. So in that case, the answer would be t=1, and w is the sum of those combinations across all connected components.\n\nBut wait, what if the graph is not bipartite? Then, it already contains an odd-length cycle, so t=0 and w=1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the graph may not be connected. So the first step is to check whether the graph has any odd-length cycles. If it does, then t=0, w=1. Otherwise, the graph is bipartitioned into multiple connected components, each of which is bipartite. Then, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum over all connected components of ( (a_i choose 2) + (b_i choose 2) ), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions of that component.\n\nWait, but what if the graph is bipartite, but adding one edge can create an odd-length cycle. However, adding that edge may not necessarily create a cycle. For example, if the graph is a tree (so no cycles). Adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create exactly one cycle. Since the original path between them is of even length (since the graph is bipartite), adding the edge creates a cycle of length even+1, which is odd. So yes, adding that edge would create an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCheck if the graph has any odd-length cycles. If yes, then output t=0 and w=1.\n\nElse, compute for each connected component (which is bipartite) the number of possible edges that can be added within the same partition. Sum all those numbers, and that's w. And t is 1.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the first input:\n\nInput is:\n\n4 4\n\nEdges: 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3.\n\nSo the graph has 4 vertices and 4 edges. Let's see if it has an odd-length cycle.\n\nLooking at the graph. Let's see:\n\nThe edges are:\n\n1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4.\n\nSo the graph is connected. Let's check for bipartition.\n\nLet me try to color it. Let's say node 1 is color 0. Then 2 and 3 are color 1. Then node 4 is connected to 2 and 3, so it should be color 0. So the partitions are {1,4} and {2,3}. So the graph is bipartite. So there is no odd-length cycle. Hence, t is 1, and the number of ways is (2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches the first example's output of 1 2.\n\nAnother example is when the input is 3 3 (triangle). The graph is a cycle of length 3, which is odd. So t=0 and w=1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example is 3 0. So the graph is three nodes with no edges. It's bipartite (each component is a single node, which is trivially bipartite). So for each component, the number of possible edges to add is (1 choose 2) + (0 choose 2) = 0 + 0 = 0? Wait, no. Wait, for each connected component (each node is a component), the bipartition is {1}, { } (since the component is a single node). So for each component, the number of possible edges is (1 choose 2) + (0 choose 2) = 0 + 0 = 0. But then the total sum is zero. But according to the third example, the output is 3 1.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the third example input is 3 0. So the graph is three isolated nodes. So for each component, the bipartition is (size 1 and 0). So for each component, the number of possible edges to add within the same partition is (1 choose 2) + (0 choose 2) = 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum over all components is 0. But according to the example, the output is 3 1. So clearly, my reasoning is wrong here.\n\nHmm. What's going on here?\n\nLet me think again. How can we create an odd-length cycle in a graph with three isolated nodes?\n\nWe need to add edges. The minimal number of edges to add is t. So what's the minimal t?\n\nWell, to form a cycle of odd length, you need at least three nodes. So for three nodes, you need to add three edges (like a triangle). But that would be adding three edges. But according to the example, the output is 3 1. So that's correct. So why does my previous logic not apply here?\n\nBecause the previous logic assumed that the graph is bipartite. Which it is. So according to the previous reasoning, the minimal t is 1. But in reality, the minimal t is 3. So my earlier reasoning is wrong. So where's the mistake?\n\nAh! Oh right. Because adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a bipartition would create an odd-length cycle only if there's a path between them. But in the case of three isolated nodes, each component is a single node. So the bipartition for each component is (1, 0). So adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (but in this case, each component is a single node, so the same partition would be the same component. But since there's no existing path between them, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (say, node 1 and node 2) would not create a cycle. So adding that edge would create a path of length 1 between them. But there's no cycle. So the previous logic is wrong.\n\nSo my mistake was thinking that adding any edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd-length cycle. But that's only true if the two nodes are in the same partition and there's a path between them. Because then the new edge plus the existing path would form a cycle.\n\nSo, in the case of a connected bipartite graph, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition creates a cycle. But for disconnected bipartite graphs, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (but from different components) would not create a cycle. Because there's no path between them. So the new edge would create a new component, but no cycle.\n\nSo, the previous reasoning was incorrect. So how can we fix this?\n\nThe key is that for a bipartite graph, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of the same connected component will create an odd-length cycle. But adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of different connected components will not create a cycle. So in order to create a cycle, the added edge must be between two nodes in the same partition of the same connected component.\n\nSo, the number of ways to add t edges (t=1) is the sum over all connected components of (number of possible edges that can be added within the same partition of that component, i.e., (a_i choose 2) + (b_i choose 2)), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions of the component.\n\nBut in the third example, each component is a single node. For each component, the size of the two partitions is 1 and 0. So (1 choose 2) + (0 choose 2) = 0 + 0 = 0. So the total sum is zero. But the example requires that we add three edges. So this suggests that the previous approach is not sufficient.\n\nSo what's the problem here?\n\nThe problem is that when the connected component is a single node, the bipartition is (1,0). So adding any edge between two nodes in the same partition (but since each component is a single node, the only way to add edges between same partitions is to add edges between nodes in the same partition of their own component. But since there's only one node in the component, there's no such pair. So for a component of size 1, the number of possible edges to add within the same partition is zero.\n\nSo in the third example, the graph has three components, each of size 1. So the sum is zero. But according to the example, we need to add three edges. So how do we get that?\n\nAh, so perhaps the minimal t is not always 1. So what's the correct way to find the minimal t?\n\nLet me think again. If the graph is bipartite, then adding edges to make it non-bipartite. The minimal number of edges needed to do that.\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, then to make it non-bipartite, you need to add at least one edge that creates an odd-length cycle.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn the case where the graph is bipartite and consists of multiple disconnected components, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of the same component would create an odd-length cycle. But if all components are single nodes, then adding an edge between two nodes (say, between node 1 and node 2) would create a new component (with two nodes connected by an edge). That component is bipartitioned into {1} and {2}, which is bipartite. So adding that edge doesn't create an odd-length cycle. So to create an odd-length cycle, you need to have a cycle. So adding edges between three nodes in a way that forms a triangle.\n\nSo, in the case where the graph is completely disconnected (all components are single nodes), then the minimal number of edges to add is 3 (to form a triangle), which is an odd-length cycle. So in this case, t is 3 and the number of ways is 1 (only one way to choose three edges between three nodes, which is the triangle).\n\nSo my previous approach was wrong. It seems that the minimal t depends on the structure of the graph.\n\nSo how do we approach this problem?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe problem requires that after adding some edges, the graph contains an odd-length cycle. The minimal number of edges to add is t.\n\nSo, the minimal t is determined by the following:\n\nIf the graph already contains an odd-length cycle, then t=0.\n\nElse, the graph is bipartite. So, to create an odd-length cycle, we need to add edges in a way that introduces an odd-length cycle. The minimal number of edges to add depends on the structure of the graph.\n\nCase 1: There exists a connected component with at least two nodes. In this case, adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition of that component would create an odd-length cycle. So t=1.\n\nCase 2: All connected components are single-node. Then, to create a cycle, you need to add at least three edges (forming a triangle), so t=3.\n\nSo, the minimal t is either 1 or 3, depending on whether there's at least one connected component with at least two nodes.\n\nSo, the problem is split into:\n\nCheck if the graph has an odd-length cycle. If not, then:\n\nIf the graph has at least one connected component with size ≥ 2, then t=1. The number of ways is the sum over all connected components (of size ≥ 2) of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions of the component. However, for components with size 1, they contribute 0.\n\nIf the graph has no connected component with size ≥ 2 (i.e., all components are single nodes), then t=3, and the number of ways is C(n, 3) (the number of ways to choose three nodes and connect them into a triangle). Wait, but the problem says that the added edges must form a cycle. So adding three edges between three nodes (forming a triangle) is one way. But how many ways are there to add three edges to form a triangle? Well, for three nodes, there's only one way to add all three edges. So the number of ways is the number of possible triplets of nodes, each contributing one way. So the number of ways would be C(n, 3), since each triplet can be connected as a triangle. However, the example for n=3, m=0 gives output 3 1. Which is correct: C(3,3)=1. So that works.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, check if the graph has any odd-length cycle. If yes, then t=0, w=1.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if there exists any connected component with size ≥ 2. If yes, then t=1, and w is the sum over all connected components (with size ≥ 2) of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2).\n\nIf all components are size 1, then t=3, and w is C(n, 3).\n\nBut wait, what about cases where there are components with size ≥2 and also components with size 1?\n\nFor example, suppose the graph has a component with two nodes (connected by an edge) and another component with one node. Then, the minimal t is 1. Because adding an edge between the two nodes in the same partition of the component with two nodes (but wait, the component with two nodes is a bipartition of size 1 and 1. So adding an edge between the two nodes would create a cycle of length 1 (no, that's impossible). Wait, the component with two nodes is a single edge. The bipartition is {u}, {v}. Adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle of length 2? No, that's not possible. Wait, but adding an edge between u and v again would create a parallel edge, which is not allowed. But the original graph has one edge between u and v. So adding another edge is prohibited. So in this case, the component is a bipartition (A, B) with |A|=1, |B|=1. The number of edges that can be added within the same partition is (1 choose 2) + (1 choose 2) = 0 + 0 = 0. So in this case, the sum is zero. But how can we create an odd-length cycle?\n\nWait, the component is a single edge. So the bipartition is {u} and {v}. Adding an edge between u and v is not allowed (since it's a parallel edge). So adding an edge between u and u (a loop) is prohibited. Similarly for v. So the component with size 2 cannot contribute to the sum. But then, how to create an odd-length cycle?\n\nAh! Oh wait, the component is bipartitioned into two sets of size 1. So, the number of possible edges to add within the same partition is zero. So the sum is zero. But then, how can we create an odd-length cycle?\n\nThis suggests that my previous reasoning is incomplete. Because in this case, the component is a single edge (two nodes connected), and the graph is bipartite. But adding any edges would not create an odd-length cycle. Because adding an edge between u and v is not allowed (parallel), adding an edge between u and another node (say, a new node in a separate component) would create a path. For example, if there's another component with a node w, then adding an edge between u and w (assuming that u is in partition A, and w is in partition A (as part of its component of size 1, which has partitions A' and B', but since it's a single node, perhaps the partition is A' = {w}, B' = empty set). So adding an edge between u (A) and w (A') would create a new component. But there's no cycle. So how can we create an odd-length cycle?\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal t is 2. Because adding two edges. For example, adding edges between u and w, and between v and w. Then, the cycle u-w-v-u is of length 3, which is odd. So that would require adding two edges.\n\nBut according to the earlier reasoning, if there is a component of size ≥2, then t=1. But in this case, the component of size 2 can't contribute to the sum, and adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (which is not possible) leads to no way. So what's wrong here?\n\nThis suggests that my previous approach is missing something. So I need to reevaluate.\n\nThe problem arises when a connected component is bipartitioned into two sets A and B, and the component is a tree (so no cycles). For example, a tree with two nodes (edge between u and v). Then, adding an edge between u and v would be a parallel edge, which is not allowed. But adding an edge between u and another node (say, w) in a different component would not create a cycle. However, adding two edges between u and w and v and w would create a cycle of length 3.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the minimal t is 2. But according to the previous approach, since there is a connected component with size ≥2, the minimal t is 1, but it's not possible. So what's the mistake here?\n\nAh, the mistake is that the previous reasoning assumes that adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a connected component would create an odd-length cycle. But that is only true if there is a path between those two nodes. For example, in a connected bipartite graph, if two nodes are in the same partition, there is a path between them of even length. Adding an edge between them creates a cycle of odd length. However, if the two nodes are in the same partition but are not connected by any path (i.e., they are in different connected components), then adding an edge between them would not create a cycle.\n\nSo, the previous reasoning was correct for connected components. But in the case of a connected component where there are no pairs of nodes in the same partition (like a component with two nodes in a bipartition of size 1 and 1), then adding an edge between them is not possible (because that would be a parallel edge). So for such components, the number of possible edges to add is zero.\n\nSo, the sum over all connected components (with size ≥2) of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2) gives the number of ways to add a single edge that creates an odd-length cycle. However, if this sum is zero, then adding a single edge is not possible. Then, what is the minimal t?\n\nIn that case, the minimal t would be 2. Because adding two edges can create a cycle. For example, adding edges between two nodes in different components, but creating a cycle. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is 1 if there exists at least one connected component with at least two nodes and that component has a_i ≥ 2 or b_i ≥ 2. Otherwise, the minimal t is 2 or 3.\n\nWait, let's think again. For a connected component that is bipartite, but has a_i ≥ 2 or b_i ≥ 2, then adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (say, a_i ≥ 2) would create a cycle. For example, if the component is a tree with three nodes, arranged as a chain (u connected to v connected to w). Then, the bipartition is {u, w}, {v}. Adding an edge between u and w (both in the same partition) would create a cycle of length 2 (the existing path from u to w is length 2, adding the edge makes a cycle of length 3). So that's an odd-length cycle. So in this case, the component has a_i = 2, b_i = 1. The sum for this component would be (2 choose 2) + (1 choose 2) = 1 + 0 = 1. So the sum is 1, and t=1.\n\nSo, the key is that for a connected component, if the size of the partition is ≥ 2, then there are possible edges to add. So for a connected component of size ≥ 2, the sum (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2) is zero only if both a_i and b_i are 1 (i.e., the component is a single edge). Otherwise, it's non-zero.\n\nSo, if the graph has a connected component that is bipartite and has size ≥ 2, but not a single edge (i.e., the component has more than two nodes, or is a tree with more than two nodes), then the sum is non-zero and t=1.\n\nBut if the graph has only components that are single edges (size 2), then the sum is zero. So in this case, adding a single edge is not possible. Then, what is the minimal t?\n\nFor example, consider a graph with two components, each being a single edge (u-v and x-y). Then, adding an edge between u and x (from different components) would not create a cycle. But adding an edge between u and v would be a parallel edge. So to create a cycle, we need to add two edges. For example, connect u to x, and v to x. Now, the cycle is u-x-v-u, which is length 3. So t=2.\n\nIn this case, the minimal t is 2. But according to the previous logic, since there are components with size ≥ 2, the minimal t is 1, but in reality, it's not possible. So the previous approach is incomplete.\n\nSo, the problem now becomes more complex. How to determine t and w in all cases.\n\nLet me re-express the problem:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, then:\n\nCase 1: There exists at least one connected component that is not a single edge (i.e., has size ≥ 2 and is not just two nodes connected by an edge). Then, t=1 and w is the sum over all such components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2).\n\nCase 2: All connected components are single edges (i.e., each component is two nodes connected by an edge). Then, t=2 and w is the number of ways to choose two edges to add that form a cycle. How?\n\nIn this case, each component is a single edge. Let's say there are k components. To create a cycle, we need to connect two components. For example, take two components: (u-v) and (x-y). Add edges u-x and v-x. This creates a cycle u-x-v-u, which is length 3. Alternatively, add edges u-x and v-y, creating a cycle u-x-y-v-u, which is length 4 (even). Not useful. So to create an odd-length cycle, we need to connect two components in a way that forms a triangle.\n\nSo, the minimal number of edges to add is 2. And the number of ways is the number of pairs of components multiplied by the number of ways to connect them in a way that forms a triangle.\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nEach pair of components contributes (number of ways to choose two nodes from each component and connect them in a way that forms a cycle of length 3).\n\nFor example, for two components (each with two nodes), the number of ways to connect them with two edges to form a triangle is 2 * 2 * 1 = 4? Or let's think:\n\nTake component 1: nodes A and B connected by an edge.\n\nComponent 2: nodes C and D connected by an edge.\n\nTo form a triangle, we need to connect A to C and B to C. That's one way. Or A to D and B to D. Another way. Or A to C and B to D? That would form a square (A-C-D-B-A), which is even length. So no. Or A to D and B to C? Same as before.\n\nSo for two components, the number of ways to add two edges to form a triangle is 2 (choose which node in component 2 to connect to both nodes of component 1). For each pair of components, the number of ways is 2 (since for each component, there are two nodes, and you can connect both nodes of component 1 to one node of component 2, or to the other node of component 2). Wait, for component 1 (A, B), and component 2 (C, D), the possible ways are:\n\nConnect A to C and B to C → forms triangle A-B-C-A (length 3).\n\nConnect A to D and B to D → forms triangle A-B-D-A (length 3).\n\nConnect A to C and B to D → forms a square (A-C-D-B-A) of length 4.\n\nConnect A to D and B to C → same as above.\n\nSo for two components, there are 2 ways to add two edges to form a triangle.\n\nSo for each pair of components, the number of ways is 2. And the number of pairs of components is C(k, 2), where k is the number of components. So total ways is C(k, 2) * 2.\n\nBut what if there are more than two components?\n\nFor example, if there are three components (each being a single edge), then the minimal t is still 2. Because adding two edges between two components (as before) creates a triangle. The number of ways would be C(k, 2)*2.\n\nSo, in this case, if all components are single edges, then t=2 and w= C(k, 2) * 2.\n\nBut what if the graph has components that are single edges and also some other components (e.g., a component with three nodes connected as a tree)? Then, the previous case applies (t=1, etc.)\n\nSo this adds more complexity.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nFirst, check if the graph has any odd-length cycles. If yes, output t=0 and w=1.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if there are any connected components that are not single edges (i.e., components with size ≥2 and not just two nodes). If there are such components, then:\n\nt=1, and w is the sum over all connected components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions of the component.\n\nElse:\n\nAll connected components are single edges (each component has exactly two nodes). Then:\n\nif the number of components is 1 (k=1), then adding two edges to form a triangle is not possible. Because the component has two nodes. So you need to add two edges between them, but that would create two edges between the same pair (which is not allowed). So in this case, you cannot form a cycle with t=2. So what is the minimal t here?\n\nIf there's only one component (two nodes), then the graph is a single edge. To form a cycle, you need to add at least two edges. But adding two edges between the same two nodes is not allowed (parallel edges). So you cannot form a cycle. So you need to add three edges (connect to another node?), but there are no other nodes. So this is impossible. But this case is not possible, since the graph has n ≥ 2. Wait, if n=2 and m=1, then the graph has one component (two nodes connected by an edge). To form a cycle, you need to add at least one edge to create a cycle. But adding an edge between the two nodes would be a parallel edge. So it's not allowed. So you cannot form a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the graph can be modified by adding edges. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the graph is given with n vertices. So if n is 2 and m=1, then the minimal t is 1? No, because adding an edge between the two nodes is not allowed (parallel edge). So it's impossible. But the problem says that the graph is undirected and has no loops or parallel edges. So adding edges must not create loops or parallel edges. So for this case, it's impossible to form a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the answer must exist. But how?\n\nBut the problem says that the graph is not necessarily connected, and you can add edges. So in this case, you can't form a cycle. But the problem says that the output must be t and w. How?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the graph is given with n vertices and m edges. So in this case, for example, n=2, m=1. Then, the graph is a single edge. Adding any edge would create a parallel edge (not allowed). So there is no way to form a cycle. But the problem requires that you must find the minimal number of edges to add to form a cycle. How is that possible?\n\nThis suggests that there is a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Perhaps the initial assumption that the graph is bipartite and that adding edges can form a cycle is not sufficient. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the graph is such that it is possible to form a cycle by adding edges. Or perhaps not? The problem says nothing about that. So perhaps the code needs to handle all cases.\n\nBut the problem examples include cases where the answer is possible. So perhaps in the case of a single component with two nodes (single edge), the minimal t is 1, but it's not possible. So how to resolve this?\n\nThis seems to be a contradiction. So perhaps the earlier analysis is missing something. Let me think again.\n\nIf the graph is bipartite and all components are single edges (each component is two nodes connected by an edge), then the minimal t is 2. But how to achieve that.\n\nFor example, if there are two components (each with two nodes), then adding two edges between the two components can form a triangle. So t=2.\n\nBut if there's only one component (two nodes), then there's no way to add edges to form a cycle. So the minimal t is impossible. But according to the problem statement, the graph is given with n vertices. So for n=2, m=1, the answer would be impossible. But the problem requires that the answer exists. So perhaps the problem guarantees that it's possible to form a cycle by adding edges. Or perhaps not. How to proceed?\n\nThis seems very complicated. Perhaps there's a better way to approach the problem.\n\nAlternative idea:\n\nThe problem requires forming a simple cycle of odd length. The minimal number of edges to add is determined by the following:\n\nIf the graph is not bipartite, then t=0.\n\nElse:\n\nIf the graph has at least one connected component with at least three nodes, then t=1.\n\nElse:\n\nIf the graph has at least two connected components with at least two nodes each, then t=2.\n\nElse:\n\nIf the graph has exactly one connected component with two nodes, then t=3 (add three edges to form a triangle, but that would require adding three edges between the two nodes and a third node, but there are no other nodes. So this is impossible. So this case is not possible.)\n\nWait, this seems to suggest that the minimal t is 1, 2, or 3, depending on the structure.\n\nBut how to determine which case applies?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor a bipartite graph:\n\n- If there exists a connected component with at least three nodes, then t=1.\n\n- Else, if there are at least two connected components with two nodes each, then t=2.\n\n- Else, if there is one connected component with two nodes, then t=3 (but this is impossible, since you need at least three nodes to form a cycle).\n\n- Else (all components are single nodes), then t=3.\n\nBut how to handle the case where there is one component with two nodes. For example, n=2, m=1. Then, you can't form a cycle. But according to the problem statement, it's required to find the answer. So perhaps this case is not possible, because the problem says that the graph can be modified by adding edges to form a cycle. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem ensures that it's always possible to form a cycle by adding edges. For example, if the graph has n ≥ 3, then it's possible.\n\nBut the third example in the problem is n=3, m=0. Output is 3 1. So adding three edges to form a triangle.\n\nSo, back to the general approach:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, then:\n\nLet's define the following variables:\n\n- Let c be the number of connected components that are not single nodes (i.e., size ≥ 2).\n\n- Let s be the number of connected components",
