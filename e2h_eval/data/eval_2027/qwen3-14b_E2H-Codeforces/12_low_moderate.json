The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. \n\nSo the problem says that each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). Oh right, and moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. \n\nThe input is n and m, then m numbers representing the a_i's. The output is the total time taken.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, Xenia starts at house 1. For each task, she needs to move from her current position to the required house for that task. But since the tasks are in order, each subsequent task depends on the previous ones. So, for example, if the first task is at house 3, she needs to move from 1 to 3. Then, the next task might be at 2, so she moves from 3 to 2. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the direction is fixed. \n\nWait, the movement is clockwise only. So moving from house x to house y (clockwise) takes (y - x) mod n steps if y >=x? Or wait, no. Because if she's moving clockwise, the number of steps between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, but if y < x, then it's (n - x + y) steps. Wait, for example, if n=4, moving from 3 to 1: clockwise, she goes 3→4→1, which is 2 steps. Which is (1 - 3 + 4) = 2. So yes, the formula would be (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). But since the movement is clockwise, the time between x and y is (y - x) % n? Wait, no. Because (y - x) mod n gives the correct value. For example, when x=3, y=1, (1-3) mod 4 is (-2) mod 4 = 2. Which is correct. So the time between x and y is (y - x) mod n. But wait, if x is 1 and y is 3, then (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct. So that's the formula.\n\nBut for each task, we need to calculate the time from her current position to the next a_i, and accumulate that.\n\nBut the key is that the tasks are processed in order. So for each task i, we need to compute the time from the previous position (which is the a_{i-1} position) to a_i. Wait, no. Because the previous position is the position where she was after completing the previous task. So for example, if the first task is a_1, she starts at 1, moves to a_1. Then, for the second task, she is at a_1, and needs to move to a_2. But the movement from a_1 to a_2 is (a_2 - a_1) mod n steps? Wait, no. Because the movement is clockwise. So for example, if a_1 is 3, and a_2 is 2, then moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would take (2 - 3 + n) steps. Which is (n -1) steps. But if a_1 is 3, and a_2 is 3, then no steps needed. \n\nSo the idea is: we need to track Xenia's current position. Initially, it's 1. For each task in order, we calculate the time needed to get from the current position to a_i, add that to the total time, and then update the current position to a_i.\n\nWait, but the tasks are given as a list. So for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n4 3\n3 2 3\n\nSo the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. \n\nStarting at 1. \n\nFirst task is 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise steps. Let's calculate (3 - 1) = 2 steps. So total time is 2. Now current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. So moving from 3 to 2. Since it's clockwise, the steps are (2 - 3 + 4) = 3 steps. So total time is 2+3=5. Current position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Moving from 2 to 3: 1 step. Total time 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. The key is to efficiently compute the time taken to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the target house of the task.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Since the movement is clockwise, the time to move from house `current` to house `target` is calculated using `(target - current) % n` if `target >= current`, otherwise `(target - current + n) % n`. This ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Keep a running total of the time taken for all movements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Update Position**: After each task, update the current position to the target house to prepare for the next task.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the total time by considering only the necessary movements between consecutive tasks, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular structure of the ringroad. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of tasks, making it efficient even for large inputs.",
