The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task must be done in a specific house, and she can only do the i-th task after completing all previous ones. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to do all tasks.\n\nHmm, the input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of a_i's. The initial position is house 1. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, so from house n, moving to 1 is one step.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. For each task, she needs to move from her current position to the required house for that task. But since the tasks have to be done in order, each subsequent task depends on the previous.\n\nSo, for example, if the first task is at house 3, she starts at 1. How many steps? Well, moving clockwise from 1 to 3: 2 steps (1→2→3). But if the next task is at 2, then she has to go from 3 to 2. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she can't go backward. So from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2? That's 3 steps. Or maybe there's a shorter way. Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, the distance between two houses can be calculated as (target - current) mod n. Wait, but if the target is before the current position, then moving clockwise would require going around the ring.\n\nWait, for example, if current is 3 and target is 2. The distance is (2 - 3 + n) % n. Let's see: (2-3) is -1, adding n (say n=4) gives 3. So 3 steps. Which matches the example given in the note.\n\nSo the formula for the time between current position and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, if target is larger than current, then (target - current) is positive. If target is smaller, then (target - current) is negative, and adding n gives the correct number of steps. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the right way to compute it.\n\nBut wait, for example, if current is 3 and target is 2, then moving clockwise requires going through 4, 1, 2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4 = 3 mod 4 = 3. Correct.\n\nSo for each task, we need to calculate the steps from the previous position to the current target, and accumulate that.\n\nBut the key is that the tasks are processed in order. So the initial position is 1. Then, for each task a_i, we compute the steps from the previous position (which is the position of the previous task, or 1 if it's the first task) to a_i, and add that to the total.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple tasks in the same house? For example, if the tasks are [3, 3, 3], then after the first task, she's already at 3. The next tasks don't require any movement. So the steps between them are zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   compute the steps needed from current_position to a_i.\n\n   add that to total_time.\n\n   set current_position to a_i.\n\nBut how to compute the steps between current_position and a_i?\n\nYes, using (a_i - current_position) % n if that's positive, but wait, no. Because if a_i is less than current_position, then (a_i - current_position) is negative, and adding n gives the correct steps.\n\nWait, for example, current is 3, a_i is 2, n=4. (2 -3) = -1. Adding n (4) gives 3. Which is the correct steps. So the formula is (a_i - current_position) if positive, else (a_i - current_position + n). But that's equivalent to (a_i - current_position) % n, but since in Python, modulo can return negative numbers, but perhaps not. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nIn Python, (-1) % 4 is 3. So yes, (a_i - current_position) % n gives the correct steps. Because if a_i is greater than current_position, then (a_i - current_position) is positive, mod n is same as that value. If a_i is less than current_position, then (a_i - current_position) is negative, and mod n gives the correct steps.\n\nWait,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad, where each task must be completed in a specific house and in a specific order. The movement between adjacent houses is clockwise and takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the target house for the task.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to compute the shortest path on a ringroad. The formula `(target - current) % n` gives the correct number of steps needed to move clockwise from the current house to the target house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        diff = (ai - current) % n\n        total_time += diff\n        current = ai\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: The key insight is using `(ai - current) % n` to determine the number of steps needed to move clockwise from the current house to the target house. This handles both cases where the target house is ahead or behind the current position on the ringroad.\n- **Accumulating Time**: For each task, the calculated steps are added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the target house for the next task.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
