    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we need to compute this modulo mod. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's required here. Let's break it down. \n\nSo, for all possible pairs of permutations p and q, where p is lex smaller than q, we need to count how many of them have inv(p) > inv(q). \n\nBut considering that n can be up to 500, the brute force approach of checking all possible pairs is impossible. Because the number of permutations is n! which is way too big for n=500. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties here. \n\nThe key idea might be to find for each possible inversion count, how many permutations have that count, and then use that to compute the required pairs. \n\nLet me think: For all pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, and inv(p) > inv(q). So, if we can compute for each possible inversion count i and j, the number of permutations with inversion count i, then multiply by the number of permutations with inversion count j, but only when i > j and p < q lex. Wait, but how do we account for the lex order?\n\nWait, but the lex order between p and q isn't directly related to their inversion counts. However, since the problem requires p < q lex, and inv(p) > inv(q), perhaps we can find a way to compute the total number of such pairs by considering all possible pairs of permutations where p is lex smaller than q and their inversion counts satisfy the condition.\n\nBut how do we compute that? \n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex. Since there are n! permutations, the total number of such pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But that's not helpful directly. However, maybe we can find that for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly half of them have p < q lex, but that's only true if all permutations are unique. Well, since all permutations are unique, for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Therefore, the total number of pairs where p < q is (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) / 2. \n\nBut our problem is to find among those pairs, how many have inv(p) > inv(q). \n\nBut perhaps there's a symmetry here. Suppose that for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, exactly half have inv(p) > inv(q) and half have inv(p) < inv(q), but that's only if the inversion counts are symmetric. However, this isn't necessarily the case. Because for some pairs, inv(p) could be equal to inv(q). \n\nWait, but the problem is to count the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me denote the total number of such pairs as T. \n\nNow, consider all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q. Each such pair contributes to exactly one of the following: either p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q), or p < q lex and inv(p) < inv(q), or p < q lex and inv(p) = inv(q), or the reverse. \n\nBut for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So, for all unordered pairs {p, q}, if inv(p) != inv(q), then exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), or p < q and inv(p) < inv(q)) will hold. \n\nIf we can compute the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), then the answer would be equal to the number of such pairs where p < q. But how does that relate?\n\nLet me think. Let's say S is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q). Then, since for each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p is true, and for each such pair, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) would contribute to the count. \n\nSo, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) has p < q. And in that case, if inv(p) > inv(q), then the ordered pair (p, q) would be counted if p < q, or (q, p) would be counted if q < p. But since inv(p) > inv(q), then in the unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs contributes to the count. \n\nBut how does that relate to the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q)? Let me think again. \n\nSuppose that for an unordered pair {p, q}, inv(p) > inv(q). Then, exactly one of p < q or q < p is true. So, the ordered pair (p, q) will be counted in the answer if p < q. Otherwise, if q < p, then (q, p) would be considered, but since inv(q) < inv(p), that would not contribute to the answer. \n\nTherefore, the total number of valid ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how can we compute this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of such ordered pairs is equal to the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1/2? No, because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) has p < q. So, for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will be counted in the answer. But since inv(p) > inv(q), the answer counts (p, q) if p < q, else (q, p) is not counted. \n\nBut this seems complicated. However, if we can compute the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q), then the answer would be equal to (total_ordered_pairs_with_inv_p_gt_inv_q - number_of_pairs_where_p_gt_q_lex_and_inv_p_gt_inv_q) ) / something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Let me think: For all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each pair (p, q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds, unless inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nSo, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) / 2. Where total_pairs is n! * (n! - 1), and same_inversion_pairs is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = inv(q) and p != q. \n\nBut how does this help us? \n\nBecause the answer we want is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). Which is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of p < q. \n\nSo, if we can compute the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), then that's exactly the answer. \n\nBut how to compute that? \n\nWell, the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) / 2, where total_pairs is the number of unordered pairs (which is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2). \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. For each of these pairs, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nLet’s denote:\n\nA = number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q)\nB = number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q)\nC = number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) = inv(q)\n\nThen A = B, and A + B + C = total_unordered_pairs. \n\nSo, A = (total_unordered_pairs - C) / 2. \n\nBut the answer we need is A. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is counted in the answer (the one where p < q). So the answer is exactly A. \n\nWait, that's brilliant! Because the answer is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), since for each such pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) satisfies p < q. And in that case, the answer counts exactly one of them. \n\nSo, the answer is (total_unordered_pairs - C) / 2, where C is the number of unordered pairs with same inversion counts. \n\nBut wait, how do we compute C? \n\nC is equal to sum_{k} (count_k choose 2), where count_k is the number of permutations with inversion count k. Because for each inversion count k, the number of unordered pairs of permutations with that inversion count is (count_k choose 2). \n\nSo, if we can compute for all possible inversion counts k, the number of permutations with that count, then we can compute C. \n\nOnce we have that, the answer is (total_unordered_pairs - C) / 2. \n\nBut wait, what's the total_unordered_pairs? It's (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) / 2. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nanswer = ( (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1) // 2 ) - C ) // 2 \n\nBut why? Because the total_unordered_pairs is (total_permutations choose 2) = total_permutations*(total_permutations-1)/2. Then, subtract C (the number of unordered pairs with same inversion counts) gives us the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) != inv(q). Since A = B, each of these is split equally between A and B. So A is (total_unordered_pairs - C) / 2. \n\nYes! So, the answer is (total_unordered_pairs - C) / 2. \n\nBut wait, this is only true if the answer is A, which is the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). And according to our earlier reasoning, this is exactly the answer required. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing C, which is the sum over all k of (count_k choose 2). \n\nSo, the steps needed are:\n\n1. Compute for each possible inversion count k, the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions. Let's call this inv_count[k].\n\n2. Compute C = sum( inv_count[k] * (inv_count[k] - 1) // 2 for all k )\n\n3. Compute total_unordered_pairs = (fact * (fact - 1)) // 2, where fact is n! \n\n4. The answer is (total_unordered_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod. \n\nWait, but why? Because the answer is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), which is A = (total_unordered_pairs - C) / 2. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the problem now becomes: how to compute inv_count[k], the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions. \n\nThis seems like a classic dynamic programming problem. \n\nFor example, the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions can be computed using DP. Let's think about it. \n\nLet dp[n][k] be the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions. \n\nThe recurrence relation is as follows: \n\nWhen adding the nth element (which is n) into a permutation of n-1 elements, inserting it at position i (0-based from the end) will add i inversions. For example, inserting n at the end adds 0 inversions. Inserting it at the first position adds (n-1) inversions. \n\nSo, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(n-1, k)} dp[n-1][k - i]\n\nThe base case is dp[1][0] = 1, and dp[1][k>0] = 0. \n\nBut for n up to 500, the maximum possible number of inversions is (n*(n-1))/2. For n=500, that's 500*499/2 = 124750. So the maximum k for which we need to compute is 124750. \n\nSo, the DP table would be of size (n+1) x (max_inversion + 1). For n=500, max_inversion is about 125,000. So the DP table is manageable. \n\nBut with n up to 500, and k up to ~125,000, the DP approach would be O(n^3) time? Let's see. For each n from 1 to 500, and for each k up to max_inversion, and for each possible i (up to n-1 steps). So for each dp[n][k], we have to sum up to n terms. \n\nThe total number of operations would be O(n^2 * max_k). For n=500, max_k is about 125,000, so 500^2 * 125,000 is 500*500*125,000 = 3.125e10 operations. That's way too big. \n\nThat's impossible for Python to handle in reasonable time. So we need a better way. \n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to optimize this. For each n, the dp[n][k] can be computed using a sliding window approach. Because for dp[n][k], it's the sum of dp[n-1][k - i] for i from 0 to min(n-1, k). \n\nThis looks like a convolution. Alternatively, for each n, the dp[n][k] can be computed based on dp[n-1][...], and the sum can be optimized using prefix sums. \n\nLet me think. For example, when building dp[n], for each k, dp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(n-1, k)} dp[n-1][k - i]. \n\nBut this is equivalent to the sum of dp[n-1][k'] where k' ranges from max(0, k - (n-1)) to k. \n\nWait, for each k, the sum is for all k' such that k' = k - i, where i ranges from 0 to min(n-1, k). So i can be from 0 to m, where m = min(n-1, k). So k' ranges from k - m to k. \n\nBut m is min(n-1, k). So for k >= n-1, m is n-1, so k' ranges from k - (n-1) to k. For k < n-1, m is k, so k' ranges from 0 to k. \n\nThus, for each k, dp[n][k] = sum_{x = max(0, k - (n-1))}^{k} dp[n-1][x]. \n\nSo, if we precompute prefix sums for dp[n-1], then for each k, we can compute the sum quickly. \n\nYes! For example, for each n, we can compute the prefix sums of dp[n-1], and then for each k, the sum is prefix[k] - prefix[max(0, k - (n-1) - 1)]. \n\nThis way, the time complexity becomes O(n * max_k) for each n. Which for n=500 and max_k=125,000 is 500 * 125,000 = 62,500,000 operations, which is manageable in Python. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute dp[n][k] for all n up to 500 and k up to max_inversion (which is 500*499/2 = 124750). \n\n- Initialize dp[1][0] = 1. \n\n- For each n from 2 to 500:\n\n   - Compute prefix sums of dp[n-1][...]\n\n   - For each k in 0 to max_inversion:\n\n      - compute the lower bound of the sum: l = max(0, k - (n-1))\n\n      - the sum is prefix[k] - prefix[l-1] (if l > 0 else prefix[k])\n\n      - dp[n][k] = sum\n\nBut wait, the prefix sum array for dp[n-1] is up to the maximum possible inversion count for n-1. However, for n, the maximum inversion count is (n*(n-1))/2. So when building dp[n], for each k up to (n*(n-1))/2, we need to compute the sum. \n\nSo the steps for the DP:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] represents the number of permutations of i elements with j inversions. \n\nWe can use a list of lists, where for each i, we have a list of size (max_k_i) where max_k_i is i*(i-1)/2. \n\nBut for n up to 500, the maximum k is 500*499/2 = 124750. So we can precompute for all n up to 500, and for all k up to 124750. \n\nBut for each n, the maximum possible k is (n*(n-1))/2. So for n=500, the maximum k is 124750. \n\nSo, the initial dp array can be a 2D array of size (n_max + 1) x (max_k + 1). \n\nBut for n=500, max_k is 124750. So the DP array will be 501 x 124751. \n\nIn Python, initializing such a 2D array may be memory intensive. Let's check. For 500 x 125,000, each entry is a number. For 500 * 125,000 = 62,500,000 entries. Each is a 64-bit integer (but in Python, integers can be arbitrary size). However, even with that, it's manageable. \n\nBut for Python, even with 62 million entries, it's going to take some memory, but given that n is up to 500, perhaps manageable. \n\nAlternatively, since for each n, we only need the previous row (n-1), we can optimize the space. We can have two 1D arrays: previous and current. \n\nYes! Because for each n, dp[n][k] depends only on dp[n-1][...]. So we can use two 1D arrays: prev and curr. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize prev as a list where prev[k] is the number of permutations of size 1 with k inversions. For n=1, only k=0 is 1, others are 0. \n\nThen for each n from 2 to N (where N is up to 500):\n\n   curr is initialized as a new list of zeros with size up to (n*(n-1))/2. \n\n   compute the prefix sums of prev. \n\n   for each k in 0 ... (n*(n-1))/2:\n\n      l = max(0, k - (n-1))\n\n      sum_val = prefix[k] - (prefix[l-1] if l > 0 else 0)\n\n      curr[k] = sum_val\n\n   prev = curr.copy()\n\nBut how to handle the prefix sums? \n\nWait, for each n, the maximum inversion count for the previous step (n-1) is (n-1)*(n-2)/2. So when we compute the prefix sum for prev, which has length (n-1)(n-2)/2 + 1. However, when n increases, the current k can be up to (n*(n-1))/2. For example, when n=2, the maximum k is 1. \n\nBut for the current n, when we process k up to (n*(n-1))/2, for each k, the value of l is max(0, k - (n-1)). However, for k - (n-1) can be negative. So for the previous step, the prev array has entries up to (n-1)(n-2)/2. So when k is larger than (n-1)(n-2)/2, then the sum would include up to the maximum of prev. \n\nWait, but for example, when n=2, the previous array is for n=1, which has max k=0. Now, for curr[n=2], the max k is 1. \n\nSo for k=1, the sum is from l = max(0, 1 - (2-1)) = 0. So sum from 0 to 1. But the previous array (for n=1) has entries up to 0. So the sum for k=1 is sum from 0 to 1, but since the previous array has entries only up to 0, the sum is prev[0] (since prev[1] is zero). \n\nSo, during the calculation of the prefix sum, we need to make sure that the prefix array is of length up to the maximum possible k for the previous n-1. \n\nBut when we compute the prefix sum for prev, which is for n-1, the maximum k for prev is (n-1)(n-2)/2. So, for any k in the current step (for n), when we calculate the sum for curr[k], the upper limit is k, but the prev array has entries up to (n-1)(n-2)/2. So for k that is larger than (n-1)(n-2)/2, the sum would include up to the maximum of prev. \n\nSo, when building the prefix sum array, we need to have it up to the maximum possible k for the previous step. \n\nBut for the current step, when we compute for k up to (n*(n-1))/2, but the previous step's prefix is only up to (n-1)(n-2)/2. \n\nTherefore, when calculating the sum for curr[k], the upper limit is min(k, (n-1)(n-2)/2). \n\nBut perhaps the way to handle this is to have the prefix array for the previous step extended to the current maximum k. \n\nAlternatively, during the prefix sum calculation, for any k beyond the previous max, the value is zero. \n\nSo, for the prefix sum array, let's imagine that the prev array is extended to the current maximum k, with zeros beyond the original length. \n\nBut how to handle this in code? \n\nLet me think. For each step, when we compute the prefix sums for the prev array, we can create a prefix array that has length up to the current maximum k for the current n. \n\nBut perhaps for each n, the maximum k for curr is (n*(n-1))/2. \n\nBut when building the prefix sums for prev (which is for n-1), the maximum k in prev is (n-1)(n-2)/2. So for the current n, when we compute curr[k], the maximum k for which we need to access prev is k. However, if k exceeds (n-1)(n-2)/2, then the sum would include all entries in prev up to the maximum of prev. \n\nTherefore, when building the prefix sum array for prev, we can pad it with zeros up to the current maximum k. \n\nBut how to do this in code? \n\nFor example, for the current n, the maximum possible k is max_k_prev = (n-1)*(n-2)//2. The current maximum k for curr is max_k_curr = n*(n-1)//2. \n\nSo when building the prefix sum array for prev, we can create a prefix array of size max_k_curr + 1. For positions beyond max_k_prev, the prev values are zero. \n\nBut for the code, perhaps the easiest way is to precompute for each n, the maximum k. \n\nSo, here's the plan for the DP:\n\nInitialize for n=1, the prev array is [1] (since only k=0 is possible). \n\nFor each n from 2 to 500:\n\n   max_k_prev = (n-1)*(n-2) // 2 \n\n   max_k_curr = n*(n-1) // 2 \n\n   curr = [0] * (max_k_curr + 1)\n\n   # Create prefix array for prev, extended to max_k_curr + 1\n   prefix = [0] * (max_k_curr + 1)\n   prefix[0] = prev[0]\n   for i in range(1, max_k_curr + 1):\n       if i <= len(prev) - 1:\n           prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + prev[i]\n       else:\n           prefix[i] = prefix[i-1]\n\n   # Wait, no. The prev array is of length max_k_prev + 1. For i from 0 to max_k_prev, prev[i] is defined. For i > max_k_prev, prev[i] is zero. \n\n   So the prefix array is built as follows:\n\n   prefix = [0]*(max_k_curr + 1)\n   prefix[0] = prev[0] if 0 < len(prev) else 0\n   for i in range(1, max_k_curr + 1):\n       if i < len(prev):\n           prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + prev[i]\n       else:\n           prefix[i] = prefix[i-1]\n\n   Wait, perhaps a better way is to first extend the prev array to the size of max_k_curr + 1, filling with zeros beyond the original length. Then compute the prefix sum. \n\n   So, for example:\n\n   prev_extended = prev + [0]*(max_k_curr + 1 - len(prev))\n   prefix = [0]*(max_k_curr + 1)\n   prefix[0] = prev_extended[0]\n   for i in range(1, max_k_curr + 1):\n       prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + prev_extended[i]\n\n   Then, for each k in 0 to max_k_curr:\n\n       l = max(0, k - (n-1))\n       if l == 0:\n           sum_val = prefix[k]\n       else:\n           sum_val = prefix[k] - prefix[l-1]\n       curr[k] = sum_val\n\n   But this approach would work. \n\nBut how to manage the prev array? Let's think in code. \n\nInitially, for n=1, prev is [1], which represents that for k=0, there is 1 permutation. \n\nFor n=2, max_k_prev is (1*0)/2 = 0. max_k_curr is 2*1/2=1. \n\nprev_extended is [1] + [0]*(1+1 - 1) = [1, 0]. \n\nprefix is [0, 0] initially? Or:\n\nWait, the code for building the prefix array would be:\n\nprev_extended = prev + [0]*(max_k_curr + 1 - len(prev)) \n\nBut for n=2, max_k_curr is 1, so the length of prev_extended is 2. \n\nprev is [1], so prev_extended becomes [1, 0]. \n\nThen, the prefix array is computed as:\n\nprefix[0] = prev_extended[0] = 1 \n\nprefix[1] = prefix[0] + prev_extended[1] = 1 + 0 = 1 \n\nThen, for each k in 0..1:\n\nFor k=0:\n\nl = max(0, 0 - (2-1)) = max(0, -1) = 0. \n\nsum_val = prefix[0] - (prefix[-1] if l>0 else 0) → 1 - 0 = 1. So curr[0] = 1. \n\nBut for n=2, inserting the second element (2) into the permutation of 1 element. The possible permutations are [1,2] (0 inversions) and [2,1] (1 inversion). \n\nSo for k=0, the number of permutations is 1 (only [1,2]). For k=1, it's 1 ([2,1]). \n\nSo for curr[0], the sum is 1? Wait, according to the code above. \n\nWait, when n=2, for k=0, the sum is from l=0 to k=0. The sum is prefix[0] - (prefix[-1] if l>0 else 0) → 1. Which is correct. \n\nFor k=1, l = max(0, 1 - 1) = 0. So sum is prefix[1] - prefix[-1] → 1. So curr[1] = 1. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code seems to work. \n\nSo, in code, for each n, we can generate the curr array. \n\nOnce we have the dp table, for the given n, we can get the inv_count array. \n\nOnce we have inv_count for all k, then compute C as sum( cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 for cnt in inv_count.values() )\n\nBut wait, inv_count is the array for n elements, which is the prev array after processing n. \n\nSo, once we compute the prev array for the given n, that array contains for each k, the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions. \n\nOnce we have that, we can compute C as the sum over all k of (inv_count[k] * (inv_count[k] - 1)) // 2. \n\nThen, compute total_permutations = factorial(n). \n\ntotal_unordered_pairs = (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) // 2 \n\nanswer = (total_unordered_pairs - C) // 2 \n\nBut wait, since the answer is (total_unordered_pairs - C) divided by 2, but since the problem says that mod may not be a prime, we need to compute this modulo mod. However, division by 2 in modular arithmetic requires multiplying by the modular inverse of 2 modulo mod. But since mod can be even, we can't always compute the inverse. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the answer must be computed modulo mod. However, the formula (total_unordered_pairs - C) must be even. Because:\n\ntotal_unordered_pairs is (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) / 2. \n\nC is the number of pairs with same inversion counts. \n\nSo, (total_unordered_pairs - C) is the number of unordered pairs with different inversion counts. Since for each such pair, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds, then the total must be even. Therefore, (total_unordered_pairs - C) is even, so dividing by 2 is an integer. \n\nTherefore, in code, we can compute (total_unordered_pairs - C) as a number, then divide by 2. \n\nBut when working modulo mod, how to compute this? Because (a - b) / 2 mod mod can be written as ((a - b) mod (2*mod)) // 2 mod mod. But perhaps in Python, since (a - b) is even, we can compute (a - b) // 2, then take mod mod. \n\nBut since the numbers can be very large (for n=500, total_permutations is 500! which is a huge number), but we need to compute (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) // 2 mod mod. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nBecause 500! is a huge number, but mod can be up to 1e9. However, for n up to 500, we can compute the factorial mod (mod * 2) or something, but even that may not be feasible. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that the answer is (total_unordered_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod. \n\nLet me think about the steps again. \n\nFirst, compute total_permutations = fact(n). \n\nThen, total_unordered_pairs = fact(n) * (fact(n) - 1) // 2 \n\nBut since mod can be up to 1e9, and fact(n) can be up to 500! which is way larger than 1e9, we can't compute fact(n) directly. However, since we need to compute (total_unordered_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod, perhaps we can compute each part modulo (mod * 2), then perform the division. \n\nBut even that may not be feasible. Alternatively, note that:\n\n(total_unordered_pairs - C) is even. \n\nSo, let me think: \n\nLet me denote A = total_unordered_pairs - C. Then the answer is A // 2. \n\nBut A can be written as ( (fact * (fact - 1) ) // 2 ) - C. \n\nBut how to compute this modulo mod? \n\nThe problem is that fact(n) can be very large. However, since mod is given, perhaps we can compute fact(n) modulo (mod * 2), because when we compute (fact * (fact - 1)) // 2, the division by 2 is exact, and the result modulo mod can be found by first computing the product modulo (mod * 2), then dividing by 2, then taking modulo mod. \n\nBut how to compute fact(n) mod (mod * 2)?\n\nBut for n up to 500, even mod * 2 can be up to 2e9. But computing 500! mod (something) is manageable. \n\nYes. Because 500! is a product of 500 numbers. So, for each n up to 500, we can compute fact = 1, then multiply by i for i from 1 to n, and take mod (mod * 2) each time. \n\nBut wait, but mod can be 1. However, the problem says 1 ≤ mod ≤ 1e9. \n\nSo, for the code:\n\nCompute fact_n = factorial(n) mod (2 * mod). \n\nThen compute total_unordered_pairs_num = (fact_n * (fact_n - 1) // 2) mod (2 * mod). \n\nBut wait, no. Because fact_n is the value of factorial(n) mod (2 * mod), but the actual value of fact * (fact - 1) could be very large. However, since (fact * (fact - 1)) is even, and we need to compute (fact * (fact - 1) // 2) mod mod. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nLet me think. Let me denote:\n\nLet total_fact = fact(n). \n\ntotal_unordered_pairs = (total_fact * (total_fact - 1)) // 2 \n\nWe need to compute (total_unordered_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod. \n\nBut since total_unordered_pairs can be very big, but C is also big. However, C can be computed modulo (2 * mod), because when we subtract C from total_unordered_pairs, and then divide by 2, the result mod mod depends on the difference mod 2*mod. \n\nBut how to compute total_unordered_pairs mod (2 * mod). \n\nLet me think. Let me compute total_fact mod (2 * mod). Let me call this f. Then:\n\ntotal_fact * (total_fact - 1) mod (2 * mod * 2) ?\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The solution involves dynamic programming to compute inversion counts for permutations and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Inversion Counts**: Use a DP approach to compute the number of permutations of size `n` with exactly `k` inversions. This is done using a sliding window technique with prefix sums to optimize the computation.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo a given value, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers. We compute factorials modulo `2 * mod` to ensure accurate results when dealing with divisions.\n3. **Combining Results**: Calculate the total number of unordered pairs of permutations and subtract the number of pairs with the same inversion count. The result is then divided by 2 to get the final answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    mod = int(input[1])\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    max_k = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    prev = [0] * (max_k + 1)\n    prev[0] = 1  # For n=1, only 1 permutation with 0 inversions\n    \n    for current_n in range(2, n + 1):\n        max_k_prev = (current_n - 1) * (current_n - 2) // 2\n        max_k_curr = current_n * (current_n - 1) // 2\n        curr = [0] * (max_k_curr + 1)\n        \n        # Extend prev to the required length\n        prev_extended = prev + [0] * (max_k_curr + 1 - len(prev))\n        \n        # Compute prefix sums\n        prefix = [0] * (max_k_curr + 1)\n        prefix[0] = prev_extended[0]\n        for i in range(1, max_k_curr + 1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + prev_extended[i]\n        \n        # Calculate curr\n        for k in range(0, max_k_curr + 1):\n            l = max(0, k - (current_n - 1))\n            if l == 0:\n                sum_val = prefix[k]\n            else:\n                sum_val = prefix[k] - prefix[l - 1]\n            curr[k] = sum_val\n        \n        prev = curr\n    \n    # Now compute C\n    C = 0\n    for cnt in prev:\n        if cnt >= 2:\n            C += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2\n    C %= (2 * mod)  # To handle later division by 2\n    \n    # Compute fact(n) mod (2 * mod)\n    fact = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        fact = fact * i % (2 * mod)\n    \n    total_fact = fact\n    total_unordered_pairs = (total_fact * (total_fact - 1) // 2) % (2 * mod)\n    \n    A = (total_unordered_pairs - C) % (2 * mod)\n    # Since A is even, divide by 2\n    answer = (A // 2) % mod\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The DP array `prev` keeps track of the number of permutations with specific inversion counts.
