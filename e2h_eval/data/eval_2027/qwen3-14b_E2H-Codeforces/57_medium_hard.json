His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores of all participants, but they are not linked to names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b, right? Wait, no. Wait, the input gives two lists: the first list is the first tour points for all participants, and the second list is the second tour points. However, the problem says that each participant participated in both tours. But the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but they are not linked. So, the actual pairing between a_i and b_j for each participant is unknown. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each participant has a first tour score and a second tour score. But the input gives the first tour scores as a list and the second tour scores as another list. However, the order is arbitrary. So, for example, the first participant's first tour score is a_1, but their second tour score could be any of the b's. But the teacher doesn't know which a_i pairs with which b_j. So when considering possible scenarios, we can pair the a's and b's in any way, as long as each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa. But Vasya is one of the participants, and his total is at least x. But the problem says that there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, we need to find the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have, given that his total is at least x, and that the actual pairing of a and b's is such that for each participant, their a and b are paired. \n\nSo, the approach is: For the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so he can be as high as possible), and arrange other participants' totals such that as many as possible are worse than him. For the worst possible rank, we want to minimize his total (so that others can be better than him as much as possible), and arrange others to be as good as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. To find the best possible rank, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, arrange the other participants' pairs such that as few as possible have a higher sum than Vasya's. Because the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily when there are ties. So, for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and then count how many participants have a sum strictly greater than that. Then the best rank is that count + 1. But since there can be ties, maybe even if others have the same sum, the jury can give him the best rank.\n\nWait, the problem says that if two or more have the same sum, the jury can assign the places as they choose. So for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is as high as possible. Then, the number of people with sum strictly higher than Vasya's is the number of people that must be ranked above him. Then, his best possible rank is that count + 1. Because even if there are people with the same sum, the jury can place him first.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nFor the best case:\n\nWe need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, count how many other pairs (a_p, b_q) (where p and q are different from i and j?) No, no. Wait, no. Because the pairing is such that each participant has exactly one a and one b. So, for the best case scenario, we can choose Vasya's a_i and b_j (but the rest of the participants are paired in a way that minimizes the number of people with higher sum than Vasya's. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank for Vasya is when his sum is as high as possible, and the other participants are paired in a way that their sum is as low as possible. But how can we model that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Then, the best possible rank is determined by how many other participants can have a sum higher than that. But how to find that?\n\nWait, here's an idea. To find the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's total (so that as many others as possible can't be higher than him). Then, for the other participants, we can pair their a and b in a way that their sum is as small as possible. But that's not possible. Wait, no. Because the pairing is fixed once we choose the pairs. But the problem allows us to choose any possible pairing of a and b. So, for the best possible scenario for Vasya, we can choose his a_i and b_j to be the maximum possible sum. Then, for the other participants, we can pair their a and b in a way that their sum is as small as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best case, the maximum possible sum Vasya can have is the maximum a_i + b_j. Then, the number of people who can have a sum strictly greater than that is zero. Therefore, his best possible rank is 1. But that's not correct. Because maybe there are other pairs that sum to the same value. For example, if there are multiple pairs that sum to the same maximum value, then Vasya can be placed first. But if someone else's sum is higher than that, then that's not possible. Wait, but if we choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya, then no other participant can have a higher sum than that. Because if there's another pair (a_p, b_q) with sum higher than Vasya's, then that would contradict the fact that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Therefore, in this scenario, the number of people with higher sum is zero. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, how can we choose Vasya's a_i and b_j to be the maximum possible sum? For example, suppose there are multiple a_i and b_j that can be combined to get the maximum sum. So, for the best case, we can choose that combination. Then, the other participants are paired in a way that their sum is as low as possible. But how does that affect the count of people with higher sum than Vasya's?\n\nWell, if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then no other pairing can have a higher sum. Because even if you pair other a's and b's, the maximum possible sum is already achieved by Vasya. So, the number of people with sum strictly higher than Vasya's is zero. Hence, his best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic. Let me check the sample input.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nInput is 5 2, and all a's are 1, all b's are 1. So the maximum sum for Vasya is 2. All other participants have sum 2. So in the best case, the jury can assign him first place. In the worst case, he can be fifth. Which matches the sample output.\n\nIn the second example, the best case is when Vasya's sum is 4+8=12. Then, others have sums like 6+4=10, etc. So no one has higher than 12, so best rank is 1.\n\nSo this suggests that for the best possible rank, it's sufficient to find the maximum possible sum for Vasya, and then count how many other participants can have a sum strictly greater than that. But since we can arrange the pairings, how can that happen?\n\nWait, no. Because if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then even if other participants have a_i and b_j that could be paired to have higher sums, but we can't pair them that way. Because in the scenario where Vasya's sum is the maximum, we have to pair the other a's and b's in a way that their sum is as low as possible. But how?\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the actual pairing of a's and b's is unknown. So, for the best case scenario for Vasya, we can choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the other participants' pairings are arranged in such a way that their sums are as low as possible. But how can that be done?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum that Vasya can have is the maximum of a_i + b_j for all i, j. But since each a and b can be used only once, that's not possible. Because if you take the maximum a_i and maximum b_j, then those two can't be used again for other participants. But for the best possible scenario, we can choose Vasya's pair to be (max_a, max_b), and then for the other participants, pair their a's and b's in a way that their sum is as low as possible. However, that's not possible because the other participants' a and b are fixed. Wait, no. Because the pairing is arbitrary. So for the best case, we can pair the a's and b's in such a way that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and other participants' sum is as low as possible. But how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think again.\n\nThe key point is that the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, given that there exists at least one pairing where his total is at least x. But how do we model the possible pairings?\n\nBut for the best possible rank, we want to find the minimal possible rank (i.e., the best possible) that Vasya can have. To do that, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and arrange other pairings such that as few as possible have a higher sum than him.\n\nBut how can we model that? Because for the best possible rank, the minimal possible rank is determined by the number of participants that have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum in the best scenario.\n\nBut how can we compute that?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's total is as high as possible. Then, the number of participants that have a sum strictly greater than that is zero. Because we can pair the a's and b's such that no one else has a higher sum than Vasya's. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Because if there are other a and b that could be paired to have a higher sum than Vasya's, but we can't pair them that way. For example, suppose that Vasya is paired with (a1, b1) which gives sum S. But there's another pair (a2, b2) that gives sum S + 1. But if a1 and b2 are used in Vasya's pairing, then a2 and b1 can't be used. Wait, no. Wait, in the pairing, each a is assigned to exactly one b, and vice versa. So, for example, if we choose to pair Vasya's a_i with b_j, then the other a's can't be paired with b_j anymore.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is not necessarily the maximum of all a_i + b_j, because that would require that a_i and b_j are available. So for example, if there are two a's with values 5 and 3, and two b's with 5 and 3. The maximum possible sum for Vasya is 5+5=10, but that would use up both 5's. Then, the other participant would have 3+3=6. So in this case, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is 10, and others can't have higher.\n\nBut if there are three a's and three b's, say a = [5, 5, 0], b = [5, 5, 0]. Then, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is 5 + 5 = 10. Then, the other two participants can be paired as (5, 0) and (0,5), giving sums 5 and 5. So no one else has a higher sum than 10. So Vasya's best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut if there are other combinations, like a = [5, 5], b = [5, 5]. Then, the maximum sum for Vasya is 10, and the other participant can have sum 5 + 5 = 10. So in that case, there's one other person with the same sum. But the jury can assign Vasya first place, so the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that for the best possible rank, it's 1. But that's not correct in all cases. Wait, what if there are some pairs that can't be avoided?\n\nWait, let's take an example where Vasya's sum is not the maximum possible. Suppose that there are two participants, and x is 5. The a's are [3, 4], and the b's are [3, 4]. The possible pairings are:\n\nCase 1: (3,3) and (4,4): sums 6 and 8. If Vasya's sum is 6, then he's second. But if he is paired with (4,4), sum 8, then he's first.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the teacher knows that there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So in this case, x is 5. So, Vasya can be paired with (3,3) which gives 6 >=5, or (4,4) gives 8 >=5. So for the best possible rank, he can choose to be paired with (4,4), sum 8. Then, the other participant's sum is 3+3=6 <8. So Vasya's best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that for the best possible rank, it's always possible to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others have lower or equal sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut this contradicts the first sample input. Wait, in the first sample input, all participants have sum 2. So the best possible rank is 1, but the sample output says 1. Which matches. So why in the first sample the best is 1, and the worst is 5. So that seems correct.\n\nBut then, why in the second sample, the best is 1. Which matches the sample output. So perhaps the best possible rank is always 1. But that can't be true. What if there are other participants whose sum is higher than any possible sum that Vasya can have?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that there exists some i and j where a_i + b_j >=x. But that doesn't mean that there's a pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum. For example, suppose that there are two participants. a = [1, 1], b = [3, 3]. x is 4. So, there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is 1 + 3 =4. But in any pairing, the two participants will have sums 1+3=4 and 1+3=4. So the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 2. But according to the problem statement, the answer would be 1 2.\n\nBut what if the a's are [1, 2], and the b's are [3, 4]. x is 5. Then, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is 2 + 4 =6. So the other participant would have 1 +3 =4. So best rank is 1. So yes.\n\nBut what if there's a situation where even if you pair Vasya optimally, there's someone else with a higher sum?\n\nFor example: n=2, x=5. a = [3, 4], b = [3, 5]. So possible pairings:\n\nIf Vasya is paired with 4 and 5, sum 9. The other participant is 3 and 3, sum 6. So Vasya is first. So best rank is 1.\n\nAnother scenario: a = [3, 4], b = [5, 6]. x is 7. So possible pairings:\n\nVasya can be 4+6=10, other is 3+5=8. Best rank is 1.\n\nBut suppose that the a and b arrays are such that even when Vasya takes the maximum possible sum, there's another participant who can have a higher sum. How?\n\nWait, impossible. Because if Vasya takes the maximum possible sum, then no other pairing can have a higher sum. Because that would require that there's another a_i and b_j that sum to higher than Vasya's. But if Vasya took the maximum possible sum, then that would have been the maximum. Unless there are multiple pairs with the same maximum.\n\nBut how can you have that? For example, if a = [5,5], b = [5,5]. Then, the maximum sum is 10. Any pairing would have two participants with 10. So the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 2.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that for the best possible rank, it's always 1. Because you can pair Vasya with the maximum possible sum, and arrange other pairings so that no one has a higher sum. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. What if there's a scenario where even the maximum possible sum for Vasya is not possible? Like, if there's no way to pair a and b such that the sum is higher than some other participant's sum?\n\nNo, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So for the best case scenario, we can choose that pair for Vasya, and then arrange the rest. But how to ensure that the maximum possible sum is chosen.\n\nBut how to compute the best possible rank? According to this reasoning, it's always 1. But that's not the case. Let's think again.\n\nWait, no. Because in the case where there are multiple participants, and even after choosing the best possible pair for Vasya, there's someone else who has a higher sum. How?\n\nBut how can that be? For example, suppose that n=3. a = [10, 1, 1], b = [10, 1, 1]. x is 20. So the possible pairings for Vasya could be (10,10) sum 20. Then, the other two participants can be (1,1) and (1,1), sum 2 and 2. So Vasya's best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut if there's another participant that can have a higher sum than Vasya's? How?\n\nOnly if there's another pair that can be formed with higher sum. But if Vasya has chosen the maximum possible sum, then there can't be any other pair with higher sum. Because that would imply that there's another pair (a_i, b_j) with higher sum than Vasya's, which would contradict the choice of Vasya's pair being the maximum possible.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the best possible rank is 1. Therefore, the first part of the output is always 1.\n\nBut that seems to contradict the sample input. Wait, no. The first sample's output is 1 5. Which includes 1 as the best possible. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about the second sample? The output is 1 5, which again includes 1 as the best possible. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the first part of the answer is always 1. But why does the problem even ask for it? Maybe I'm missing something here. Let's think again.\n\nWait, what if there are multiple participants and their sum is higher than Vasya's sum. But how can that happen if we choose the best possible pairing for Vasya?\n\nAh! Because the pairing is such that each a and b is used once. For example, suppose that a = [5, 5], b = [5, 5]. Then, the maximum sum for Vasya is 10. But the other participant's sum is also 10. So the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can assign him first.\n\nBut if there's a scenario where, even after pairing Vasya with the maximum possible sum, there's another participant whose sum is higher than that. How?\n\nThat can't happen. Because the maximum possible sum is the maximum of all possible pairs. So, if you pair Vasya with that maximum, then no other participant can have a higher sum than that. Because that would require that there's another pair with higher sum, which is not possible.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. Therefore, the first part of the output is 1. But why is the problem asking for it then? Well, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. So, the teacher knows that there exists some pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. However, in reality, Vasya's actual sum is some value >=x. But for the purposes of calculating the best and worst possible ranks, the teacher needs to consider all possible pairings where Vasya's sum is at least x, and find the best and worst possible ranks he could have.\n\nBut perhaps the best possible rank is not always 1. Because maybe, even though there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is very high, but in that case, there are other participants with the same sum. However, the teacher wants to find the best possible rank that Vasya could have, which is 1. So that's correct.\n\nBut then why is the first part of the sample output 1? Because it is. So perhaps the best possible rank is always 1. So the first part of the answer is always 1. But that seems strange. However, according to the problem's note, in the first sample, the best possible rank is 1. Which aligns with this.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1. Now, what about the worst possible rank?\n\nThe worst possible rank is determined by the scenario where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others are arranged to have as many as possible higher or equal sums. But how?\n\nTo compute the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than or equal to Vasya's sum. But since the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily for ties, the worst possible rank is determined by the number of participants that have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1. Or, if there are participants with the same sum as Vasya, the worst possible rank could be that number plus the number of participants with same sum.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the jury can assign the places as they choose when there are ties. So, for the worst possible rank, we want to maximize the number of participants that are ranked higher than Vasya. To do that, we need to arrange the pairings such that as many as possible participants have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum, and also arrange that any participants with the same sum as Vasya are placed after him. Wait, no. Because in the worst case, the jury can arrange the participants with the same sum as Vasya to be placed after him. So, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other participants' pairings to maximize the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have, which is at least x. Let's call this S_min.\n\n2. Then, find the maximum number of participants that can have sum strictly greater than S_min. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to compute S_min? Well, S_min is the minimal possible value that is >=x. So, the minimal possible sum for Vasya is x (if possible) or higher. But how to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is at least x.\n\nBut how to find that? Because Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j, where a_i is from the first array, b_j is from the second array. And the pairing must be such that each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa.\n\nBut since the pairing is arbitrary, to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya, we can choose the minimal possible sum that is >=x. But how?\n\nWait, the problem states that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, for the worst case scenario, we need to choose a pair for Vasya that is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Because that way, more other participants can have higher sums.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\nFind the minimal possible value S such that S >=x, and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum S. Then, arrange the other participants' pairings to maximize the number of participants with sum > S.\n\nBut how to compute this S?\n\nTo find S, we need to find the minimal possible sum that is >=x. For example, if x is 2, and there are pairs with sum 2, then S is 2. If x is 3, and the minimal sum >=3 is 3, then S is 3.\n\nOnce we have S, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than S. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum number?\n\nThis seems challenging. How can we find, for a given S, the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than S, given that we can pair the a and b arrays in any way, except that one pair is (a_i, b_j) with sum S (for Vasya's case).\n\nWait, but how can we pair the a and b arrays to maximize the number of participants with sum > S?\n\nThis is similar to a problem where we want to pair a_i with b_j such that as many pairs as possible have sum > S. However, one of the pairs must be exactly S (or >=x, but we're considering S as the minimal possible sum that is >=x).\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAn approach for this is:\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j > S. But with the constraint that there exists at least one pair that sums to S (or more, but for our case, S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x, so we need to have at least one pair with sum exactly S, but perhaps others can be higher).\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy algorithm. For example, sort the a array in ascending order, and the b array in descending order. Then, pair the smallest a with the largest b, and so on. This would maximize the number of pairs with sum > S.\n\nWait, but the exact approach depends on S. So, for a given S, the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > S is computed as follows:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet, such that a_i + b_j > S. But this might not be optimal. Alternatively, we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\nBut how to find this maximum number?\n\nLet me think. For the maximum number of pairs with sum > S, the standard approach is to sort a and b. Let's sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet and such that a_i + b_j > S. This is similar to the two-pointer approach for maximum matching.\n\nAlternatively, here's a standard method:\n\nSort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j > S. Then, for all elements after that in b, they can be paired with a_i. But this is for the maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair it with the first available b_j that when added to a_i gives > S. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the standard approach for maximum number of pairs with sum > S is:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers: i starting from 0 (beginning of a), j starting from n-1 (end of b). For each a[i], if a[i] + b[j] > S, then we can pair them, increment i and decrement j. Else, increment i. This counts the maximum number of pairs possible.\n\nYes, this is a known approach. For example, in the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with sum greater than a target.\n\nSo, for the worst case scenario, once we have S, the minimal possible sum >=x, the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S is found by this two-pointer approach.\n\nBut how to find S?\n\nTo find S, the minimal possible sum that is >=x, we need to find the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. However, since the pairing is arbitrary, we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to >=x, and choose the one with the minimal possible sum. So, the minimal S is the minimal possible sum of a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nBut how to find this minimal S?\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the minimal value s such that s >=x and there exists a_i and b_j with a_i + b_j = s. To find this, we can generate all possible a_i + b_j and find the minimal one that is >=x. However, since n can be up to 1e5, generating all pairs is O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nThus, we need an efficient way to find the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can sort the a array and the b array. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal sum for that a_i is a_i + the minimal such b_j. Then, among all these possibilities, find the overall minimal sum >=x.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Sort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i, we can find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Since b is sorted, we can use binary search for each a_i. Then, the minimal sum for this a_i is a_i + b_j (the minimal b_j that satisfies the condition). We can collect all these possible sums and find the minimal one.\n\nBut this would be O(n log n) time, which is acceptable for n=1e5.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\nSort a and sort b.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   find the smallest index j in b where b[j] >= (x - a_i). Because a_i + b[j] >=x.\n\n   if such j exists, then the minimal sum for this a_i is a_i + b[j].\n\n   else, there is no such pair (but the problem says there is at least one pair).\n\nWe then take the minimal of all these a_i + b[j] values. That's our S_min.\n\nOnce we have S_min, then we need to find the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > S_min. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut wait, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min is computed as follows:\n\nWe can pair the a and b arrays in a way that maximizes the number of pairs with sum > S_min. Then, the number of such pairs is K. So, in the worst case scenario, there are K participants with sum > S_min. Thus, Vasya's rank is K + 1.\n\nBut how to compute K?\n\nAs discussed earlier, using the two-pointer approach:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i = 0, j = n-1, count = 0.\n\nWhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] > S_min:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThis gives the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps for the worst possible rank are:\n\n1. Find S_min as the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\n2. Compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > S_min. Let's call this K.\n\n3. The worst possible rank is K + 1.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple pairs with sum equal to S_min? For example, if S_min is 2, and there are several pairs with sum 2, and some pairs with sum higher than 2. Then, in the worst case scenario, we can have K pairs with sum > S_min, and then the rest can have sum <= S_min. But since Vasya's sum is S_min, which is >=x, the number of participants with sum strictly greater than S_min is K. Thus, the worst possible rank is K + 1.\n\nBut what if there are other pairs with sum equal to S_min? For example, if there are m pairs with sum S_min. Then, in the worst case, the jury can arrange them to be placed after Vasya. Thus, the worst possible rank would be K + 1, not K + m + 1. Because the jury can choose to place Vasya after all the K participants with higher sum, and before the ones with equal sum.\n\nSo the worst possible rank is K + 1.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nS_min is 2. Because for each a_i=1, the minimal b_j is 1 (since 1+1=2 >=x=2).\n\nThen, compute K: maximum number of pairs with sum > 2. Since all pairs sum to 2, K=0. So worst rank is 0 + 1 = 1? But the sample output says 5. Oh, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, this indicates a problem with the approach. Because according to this calculation, the worst rank would be 1. But the sample output says 5.\n\nWait, what's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because in this scenario, the worst possible rank is when Vasya is placed as low as possible. But the approach of counting K (number of pairs with sum > S_min) is 0. So the worst rank is 0 + 1 = 1. But according to the sample input, the worst rank is 5.\n\nThis indicates that there is a flaw in the reasoning.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nLet me re-examine the problem.\n\nIn the first sample, all participants have sum 2. So, for the worst possible rank, the jury can arrange Vasya to be last. So, the worst possible rank is 5. However, according to the approach above, K is 0 (no one has sum > S_min=2). So the worst rank is 0 + 1 = 1. Which contradicts the sample.\n\nSo clearly, the approach is wrong.\n\nWhat's the mistake here?\n\nAh! The mistake is in the assumption that the worst possible rank is K + 1. But when S_min is the minimal sum >=x, and there are m participants with sum equal to S_min, then the worst possible rank is K + m + 1? Or how?\n\nWait, the problem is that when there are other participants with sum equal to S_min, the jury can arrange them to be placed after Vasya. So, if there are m participants (including Vasya) with sum S_min, then the worst possible rank is K + m, because the jury can arrange all of them to be placed after the K participants with higher sums. But since Vasya is one of them, the worst possible rank is K + m, but since there are m participants with sum S_min, including Vasya, the maximum possible number of people that can be placed before him is K + (m - 1). So his rank is K + (m - 1) + 1 = K + m.\n\nBut how to calculate m?\n\nBut how can we compute m?\n\nThis complicates things. So, the previous approach only considers the number of participants with sum > S_min, but ignores the number of participants with sum equal to S_min. Because in the worst case scenario, those participants can be placed after Vasya, thus increasing his rank.\n\nSo, the correct worst possible rank is:\n\nnumber",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves efficiently calculating these ranks by considering optimal pairings of scores from the first and second tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: \n   - The best possible rank is always 1. This is because we can always pair Vasya's scores such that he achieves the highest possible sum, ensuring no one else has a higher score.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - To find the worst possible rank, we need to determine the minimum possible sum Vasya can have (which is at least `x`). This involves finding the smallest sum `S_min` such that `S_min >= x`.\n   - Once we have `S_min`, we calculate the maximum number of participants who can have a sum greater than `S_min`. This is done using a two-pointer technique after sorting the scores.\n   - The worst possible rank is then determined by the number of participants with a sum greater than `S_min` plus one, considering all participants with the same sum as `S_min` can be placed after Vasya.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    \n    # Best place is always 1\n    best = 1\n    \n    # For worst place\n    # Find minimal S >= x\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Find S_min\n    S_min = float('inf')\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        # Find the first b_j >= target\n        j = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if j < n:\n            current_sum = ai + b_sorted[j]\n            if current_sum < S_min:\n                S_min = current_sum\n    # Now compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_asc = sorted(b)\n    \n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count = 0\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a_asc[i] + b_asc[j] > S_min:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Now, how many participants have sum == S_min?\n    # We need to calculate how many pairs can be formed with sum == S_min\n    # But this is complicated.

Because the jury can arrange the participants with equal sum to be placed after Vasya.\n    \n    # If there are k participants with sum > S_min, and m participants with sum == S_min (including Vasya), then the worst possible rank is k + 1. Because Vasya can be placed after all k participants with higher sums, and before the others with equal sums. Thus, his rank is k + 1.\n    \n    # But in the first sample, k is 0, and m is 5. So the worst rank is 0 + 1 = 1, which contradicts the sample. So why is the sample output 5?\n    \n    # Ah! Because the sample input says that all participants have sum 2. So Vasya's sum is 2. The number of participants with sum > 2 is 0. So the worst possible rank is 0 + 1 = 1. But the sample output is 5. So clearly, this reasoning is wrong.\n    \n    # What's the correct way to compute the worst possible rank?\n    \n    # Let me refer back to the problem statement. The worst possible rank is the maximum possible rank Vasya can have. This happens when as many participants as possible have a sum >= Vasya's sum. Since the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily for ties, the worst possible rank is the total number of participants with sum >= Vasya's sum.\n    \n    # So, if Vasya's sum is S, then the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >= S. Because the jury can place Vasya last among those with sum >= S.\n    \n    # So, for the first sample, all 5 participants have sum >= S (which is 2). Hence, the worst possible rank is 5.\n    \n    # So the correct approach is:\n    # For the worst possible rank:\n    # 1. Find S_min, the minimal sum >= x.\n    # 2. Compute the number of participants that can have sum >= S_min. Let this be total_ge.\n    # 3. The worst possible rank is total_ge.\n    \n    # How to compute total_ge?\n    \n    # To compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min, given that we can pair a and b in any way, and one of the pairs must be S_min (Vasya's sum).\n    \n    # However, this is complex. An alternative approach is to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min, and then subtract 1 if Vasya's pair is counted in that number.\n    \n    # But how to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min?\n    \n    # For that, we can use a modified two-pointer approach.\n    \n    # Let's think of it this way: To maximize the number of pairs with sum >= S_min, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, and try to pair each a_i with the largest possible b_j such that a_i + b_j >= S_min.\n    \n    # This is similar to the previous approach but for sum >= S_min instead of > S_min.\n    \n    # So, let's adjust the two-pointer approach to count the number of pairs with sum >= S_min.\n    \n    # Let's implement this:\n    \n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    \n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    count_ge = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a_asc[i] + b_desc[j] >= S_min:\n            count_ge += 1\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    \n    # However, this may not be the optimal way to maximize the count_ge. But this is a standard greedy approach.\n    \n    # Now, since Vasya's pair is one of these pairs, the maximum number of participants with sum >= S_min is count_ge. Hence, the worst possible rank is count_ge.\n    \n    # But in the first sample, this would give count_ge = 5, which matches the sample output.\n    \n    # Let's test this approach for the first sample:\n    # a_asc = [1,1,1,1,1], b_desc = [1,1,1,1,1]\n    # S_min = 2\n    # i=0, j=0: 1+1=2 >=2 → count_ge=1, i=1, j=1\n    # i=1, j=1: 1+1=2 → count_ge=2, i=2, j=2\n    # ... until i=5, j=5. count_ge=5. So worst rank is 5. Correct.\n    \n    # For the second sample:\n    # Input is:\n    # 6 7\n    # a = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n    # b = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n    # After sorting a_asc = [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n    # b_desc = [8,6,4,4,3,0]\n    # S_min is the minimal sum >=7.\n    # For example, possible pairs:\n    # Let's find S_min.\n    # For each a_i in a_sorted, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7.\n    # For a_i=3: need b_j >=4. The minimal b_j is 4 (since b_sorted is [0,3,4,4,6,8]. So sorted b is [0,3,4,4,6,8]. So for a_i=3, the minimal b_j is 4 (index 2). sum=3+4=7.\n    # For a_i=4: need b_j >=3. The minimal is 3 (index 1), sum=4+3=7.\n    # Similarly for other a_i. So S_min is 7.\n    # Now, compute count_ge: number of pairs with sum >=7.\n    # a_asc = [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n    # b_desc = [8,6,4,4,3,0]\n    # i=0, j=0: 3+8=11 >=7 → count_ge=1, i=1, j=1\n    # i=1, j=1: 4+6=10 >=7 → count_ge=2, i=2, j=2\n    # i=2, j=2: 4+4=8 >=7 → count_ge=3, i=3, j=3\n    # i=3, j=3: 4+4=8 → count_ge=4, i=4, j=4\n    # i=4, j=4: 5+3=8 → count_ge=5, i=5, j=5\n    # i=5, j=5: 6+0=6 <7 → j increments to 6, loop ends.\n    # So count_ge is 5. Hence, worst rank is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n    \n    # Thus, the correct approach is:\n    # For the worst possible rank, compute count_ge (the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min), and that is the worst possible rank.\n    \n    # So, the steps are:\n    # 1. Find S_min as the minimal sum >=x.\n    # 2. Compute count_ge as the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min.\n    # 3.
