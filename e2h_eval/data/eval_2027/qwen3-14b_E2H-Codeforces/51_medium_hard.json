Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the pile should contain exactly all the letters from both names combined, no more, no less. Any extra letters or missing letters would result in a \"NO\".\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the combined letters of the guest and host names match exactly with the letters in the pile. How to do that?\n\nHmm. One way is to count the frequency of each character in the guest and host names combined, and compare that with the frequency of each character in the pile. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nRight. So, for each test case, we have three lines: guest, host, pile. We need to check if the concatenation of guest and host has the same character counts as the pile.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the guest and host strings into one string.\n3. Check if the concatenated string and the pile string have the same character counts.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, we can use the collections.Counter class. For example, Counter(guest + host) should give the counts of each character in the combined string. Similarly for the pile. Then compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both Counters have the same elements with the same counts, then they are considered equal.\n\nYes. So the plan is straightforward.\n\nBut let me think about possible edge cases. For example:\n\n- What if the guest and host combined have a total length different from the pile? Then obviously it's impossible. But the Counter approach would catch that, since if the lengths differ, the Counters can't be equal. So that's handled automatically.\n\nAnother example: if the pile has all the letters but one is missing. Like in the second sample input, where the pile is missing a 'P' and has an extra 'L'. The Counter would catch that.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nRead the three lines. For each test case, combine the first two lines into a single string, then create a Counter for that. Create a Counter for the third line. Compare the two Counters. If equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to handle multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three lines, but the actual input is three lines. Wait, the problem says the input is three lines. But the sample input shows something like ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...], which seems like multiple test cases. Oh, wait, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. But the actual input is three lines per test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\n\nWait, but the sample input shows three different test cases. So maybe the actual input is multiple test cases, each with three lines. But how many test cases are there?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nSo each test case is three lines. So the program needs to process multiple test cases. But how does the input work? How many test cases are there?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three lines. But the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. However, the problem's input description says that the input file consists of three lines. That seems conflicting with the sample input.\n\nWait, maybe the sample input is presented as a list of three test cases, but in reality, the actual input is three lines for each test case. But the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the user is to read three lines for one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the original problem is that the input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how many test cases are there?\n\nWait, the problem's sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each with three lines. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. That's confusing. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo, the input is three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user is to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input is given as a list of three entries, each being three lines (the first entry is 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' etc). So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each with three lines. So the program needs to read all test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how to determine how many test cases there are?\n\nBut in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is given as multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the actual input is a single test case. But that's conflicting with the sample.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the input is three lines for each test case, and the number of test cases is determined by the input. For example, in some programming competition problems, the input is read until EOF. But in this case, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code should read all lines, group them into triplets, and process each triplet as a test case.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in the sample input, the first test case is three lines: guest, host, pile. Then another test case, etc. So the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, perhaps the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which suggests that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is a list of three strings, each representing the three lines of a test case. The output is a list of three answers. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. But how is that represented in the actual input?\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's not matching the actual input. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the actual input for the problem is three lines (one test case). But that would make the sample input and output inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is actually multiple test cases, each with three lines. However, the problem's input description is wrong. Or perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the input is three lines per test case, and the number of test cases is arbitrary, and the code must process all test cases until the end of input. But how to read that in Python?\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input has three test cases. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is presented in a way that's not standard. For example, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, each being three lines. But in reality, the input is three lines, and the sample input is three test cases. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the input is three lines, and the sample input is three test cases, but the problem is expecting that the code reads three lines for each test case, and the number of test cases is determined by the input. However, in programming competitions, the input is usually given as multiple test cases, and the code must process all of them.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. Therefore, the code should read all lines from the input, group them into triplets, and process each triplet as a test case.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? For example, the code could read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut how does the input end? For example, in programming competitions, the input is usually read until EOF. So perhaps the code should read all lines, then process them in groups of three.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think about the sample input. The sample input is given as three test cases. Each test case is three lines. So for example, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\nLine 1: PAPAINOEL\n\nLine 2: JOULUPUKKI\n\nLine 3: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nAnd third test case:\n\nLine 1: BABBONATALE\n\nLine 2: FATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nLine 3: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo the code must process each of these three test cases.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? Well, in programming competitions, the input is usually read via stdin. So perhaps the code should read all lines, then process them in groups of three.\n\nSo the code could read all lines, then for each i in 0, 3, 6,..., take lines[i], lines[i+1], lines[i+2] as the three lines of a test case.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines() to get all lines.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n    guest = lines[i]\n\n    host = lines[i+1]\n\n    pile = lines[i+2]\n\n    # process and output\n\nBut wait, what if the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Well, according to the problem statement, each test case is three lines, so the input will have a number of lines that is a multiple of three.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the input is only one test case. But according to the sample input, that's not the case. So perhaps the problem is that the user has to read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which is confusing. However, the sample input and output suggest that there are multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's input description is incorrect, and the actual input is multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut how to confirm? Well, looking at the sample input and output. For example, the sample input shows three test cases, and the output is three answers. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code must read all lines, group them into triplets, and process each triplet.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from input.\n\nFor each group of three consecutive lines:\n\n   guest = first line\n\n   host = second line\n\n   pile = third line\n\nCheck if the combined guest and host's letters match the pile's letters.\n\nOutput YES or NO accordingly.\n\nSo, the code would need to process each triplet.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplementing that in Python.\n\nFirst, read all lines.\n\nThen, for each triplet, process.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImport sys and Counter.\n\nThen:\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n    guest = lines[i]\n\n    host = lines[i+1]\n\n    pile = lines[i+2]\n\n    combined = guest + host\n\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if there are not enough lines? For example, if len(lines) is not a multiple of 3. But according to the problem statement, each test case is three lines, so the input is correct. So perhaps the code can assume that.\n\nBut in practice, perhaps the code should process lines in groups of three, but for the code submission, perhaps the problem expects that there is only one test case. But according to the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input is given as three test cases, but the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's input is three lines, but the sample input shows three test cases. But that's impossible. So perhaps the problem's sample input is presented in a way that is not the actual input format. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as three test cases, but each test case is three lines. But the actual input for the problem is three lines (so one test case). However, the sample input and output show three test cases, but that's just for the example.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. So why does the sample input show three test cases?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo the input is three lines. So the sample input is probably given as three separate test cases, but the actual input is three lines. However, the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers. So perhaps the problem's input is multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut how to resolve this contradiction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given in a way that's not standard. For example, the first line of the sample input is a list of three strings, each representing the three lines of a test case. But in reality, the input is three lines for each test case. So perhaps the code should read three lines for each test case, and the number of test cases is not specified.\n\nBut how to know when to stop reading? In programming competitions, sometimes the input is given as multiple test cases, and you read until EOF. So perhaps the code should read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is wrong. But given that the sample input and output are given as such, perhaps the problem requires handling multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the user is to write a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the code would read three lines for each test case, and output three answers.\n\nThus, the code would be written as follows.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? Let's proceed with that approach.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS'\n\nhost = 'DEDMOROZ'\n\npile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined guest + host is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'.\n\nLet me count the letters.\n\nBut the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nWait, perhaps the code would compare the Counter of guest + host with the Counter of pile.\n\nLet me check for the first test case.\n\nguest + host is SANTACLAUS + DEDMOROZ → let's count letters.\n\nBut the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nBut perhaps the code would find that the counts are the same.\n\nIn the first sample, the output is YES.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nAnother sample: the second test case.\n\nguest is PAPAINOEL, host is JOULUPUKKI. Combined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI.\n\nPile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me check the counts.\n\nFor example, the guest + host has:\n\nP: 2 (from PAPAINOEL: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of code.\n\nBut the code uses Counter, which would count all letters.\n\nIn the second test case, the pile has an extra L and missing a P. So the code would return NO.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nWe need to import sys and Counter.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the lines are not a multiple of 3? For example, if there are 4 lines, then the code would process i=0, then i=3. But for i=3, lines[3+1] is lines[4], which is out of range. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so the code can assume that the number of lines is a multiple of 3.\n\nBut in practice, perhaps the code should handle that. However, given that the problem's input is correct, we can proceed.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input as per the problem's example is three test cases. Each has three lines. So the code would process them correctly.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nBut when split into lines, each of these strings would be split into three lines. For example, the first string is 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' which would be split into three lines: 'SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nSo the code would process them correctly.\n\nBut when the code is run with that input, the lines list would be:\n\nlines = [\n'SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS',\n'PAPAINOEL', 'JOULUPUKKI', 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI',\n'BABBONATALE', 'FATHERCHRISTMAS', 'BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'\n]\n\nThen, for i=0, 3, 6.\n\nSo the code would process each triplet correctly.\n\nThus, the code would output YES, NO, NO as expected.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: empty lines? No, the problem says all lines are not empty.\n\nEdge case 2: all letters same. For example, guest is 'A', host is 'A', pile is 'AA' → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'A', host is 'B', pile is 'AB' → YES.\n\nIf pile is 'BA', same as AB → YES.\n\nIf pile is 'AAB', then Counter would have 2 A's and 1 B. Combined guest and host is 'AB' → 1 A and 1 B. So the code returns NO.\n\nAnother edge case: when the combined length is different from pile's length. For example, guest is 'A', host is 'B', pile is 'AB' → same length. But if pile is 'ABC', then length is 3 vs 2 → Counter would differ.\n\nSo the code would catch that.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the character counts of the combined names match exactly with the character counts of the pile of letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input lines at once and split them into individual lines.\n2. **Grouping Lines**: Process each group of three consecutive lines as a test case, where the first line is the guest's name, the second line is the host's name, and the third line is the pile of letters.\n3. **Character Count Comparison**: For each test case, concatenate the guest and host names and compare their character counts with the character counts of the pile using Python's `collections.Counter`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once using `sys.stdin.read().splitlines()` to handle multiple lines efficiently.\n- **Processing Groups**: The lines are processed in groups of three, where each group represents a single test case.\n- **Character Count Check**: By using `collections.Counter`, we can efficiently compare the frequency of each character in the combined string of the guest and host names with the frequency in the pile of letters. If both counters match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, resulting in \"YES\"; otherwise, it results in \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact character count match, which is both time and space efficient given the constraints.",
