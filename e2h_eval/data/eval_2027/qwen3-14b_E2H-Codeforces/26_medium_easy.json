    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds. So for any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition here is x + y > z. Because z is the largest side. So the other inequalities (like x + z > y) will automatically hold since z is bigger than y and x.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z, and x + y > z. Wait, but wait, the constraints given are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Oh right, so x can be from A to B, but y has to be at least B, and up to C. And z has to be at least C, up to D. Also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, so x ≤ y. Similarly, y ≤ C ≤ z, so y ≤ z. So the ordering x ≤ y ≤ z is already satisfied by the ranges. So the problem is to count all possible x, y, z in their respective ranges where x + y > z.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently? Because if I naively iterate over all possible x, y, z, that would be O(B * C * D), which is way too slow given that D can be up to 5e5. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the variables. For each possible x and y, what is the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. Also, since z must be ≥ y (since y ≤ C ≤ z). Wait, no: z is between C and D, and y is between B and C. So since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, then z ≥ y. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] that are less than x + y, and also ≥ y (but since z ≥ C and y ≤ C, then if C ≥ y, then z ≥ C ≥ y. So the lower bound for z is C, and upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). However, for this to be valid, we need that x + y > C. Otherwise, there's no z that satisfies z ≥ C and z < x + y. Because if x + y ≤ C, then the minimum z is C, which is ≥ x + y. So no solution for that x and y.\n\nSo for each x and y, the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C. Otherwise zero.\n\nWait, but the z has to be at least C, and up to D. So the range of z is [C, D]. But we want z < x + y. So the maximum z is min(D, x + y - 1). So the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y -1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the formula for the count of z's for given x and y is:\n\nif x + y > C:\n    lower = C\n    upper = min(D, x + y - 1)\n    count_z = upper - lower + 1 if upper >= lower else 0\nelse:\n    count_z = 0\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem is to sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], the count_z for each x and y.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)] if x + y > C else 0.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let me consider that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let me note that for each x and y, the value of x + y can vary. Let me try to find for each x, the range of y's where x + y > C. Then, for each such y, compute the number of z's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can precompute for each x and y, but even that would be O(B*C), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a better approach.\n\nWait, but let's think about the constraints. Since A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D, and x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. So for x and y, the minimal x is A, and minimal y is B. So the minimal x + y is A + B. The maximum x + y is B + C.\n\nSo for each x and y, x + y can be from (A+B) to (B + C).\n\nBut the key condition is x + y > C. Let's see. For example, when x is fixed, and y varies from B to C.\n\nSo for a given x, the minimum value of y is B. So x + B must be > C for there to be any possible y's. Otherwise, for x + B <= C, then for all y in [B, C], x + y <= x + C <= (since x <= B) B + C. But if x + B <= C, then for all y in [B, C], x + y <= C + x <= C + B (but x is at most B). Wait, but if x + B <= C, then for y >= B, x + y >= x + B. Which is <= C. So x + y <= C. Therefore, for such x, there's no possible z, since z >= C, and x + y <= C. So for these x, we can ignore them.\n\nSo for a given x, we can find the minimum y where x + y > C. Let me call that y_min. For y >= y_min, then the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo for x fixed, y ranges from max(B, y_min) to C. Then, for each such y, we can compute the number of z's as follows.\n\nLet me calculate y_min for x: x + y > C => y > C - x. Since y is integer, y_min is floor(C - x) + 1. Wait, for example, if C - x is an integer, then y needs to be at least (C - x) + 1. So y_min = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nBut y must be >= B and <= C. So for x, if C - x + 1 > C, then there are no valid y's. Which happens when C - x + 1 > C => x < 1. But x >= A >= 1, so this can't happen. So for each x, the valid y's are in the range y_low to y_high, where y_low = max(B, C - x + 1) and y_high = C. But if y_low > y_high, then there are no valid y's for this x.\n\nSo for each x, the number of valid y's is (y_high - y_low + 1) if y_high >= y_low. Else zero.\n\nBut for each such y, the number of z's is min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1, provided that x + y - 1 >= C. Which is true because x + y > C, so x + y - 1 >= C.\n\nSo for a given x and y, the count_z is min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1. Which can be rewritten as:\n\ncount_z = min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, (x + y - 1) - C + 1) ?\n\nWait, D - C + 1 is the number of possible z's if x + y - 1 >= D. Because then, the number of z's is D - C + 1. Otherwise, it's x + y - 1 - C + 1 = x + y - C.\n\nSo for each x and y, the count_z is:\n\nif x + y - 1 >= D: then D - C + 1\nelse: (x + y - 1) - C + 1 = x + y - C\n\nSo the count_z is min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, x + y - C)\n\nTherefore, for each x and y in their valid ranges, we can compute this count_z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for all x in [A, B], and y in [y_low, C], compute the sum of min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the variables. For a given x, y ranges from y_start (which is max(B, C - x + 1)) to C. Let me denote S = x + y - C. So for each y in the range, S is x + y - C. The min between D - C + 1 and S is the same as min(S, D - C + 1). So for each x and y in the valid range, we have to add min(x + y - C, D - C + 1).\n\nLet me denote K = D - C + 1. So K is a constant for the problem. For example, if D = C, then K = 1. If D is larger than C, then K increases.\n\nSo for each x and y in the valid range, the contribution is min(x + y - C, K).\n\nLet me think about x and y. For each x, the y ranges from y_start to C. Let me denote y_start = max(B, C - x + 1). Let me also note that since y can be up to C, and x is fixed, then for each x, the sum over y is:\n\nsum_{y = y_start}^C min(x + y - C, K)\n\nLet me make a substitution: let t = y. Then x + t - C = x - C + t. Let me denote m = x - C. So the expression becomes m + t.\n\nSo for each x, the sum is sum_{t = y_start}^C min(m + t, K), where m = x - C.\n\nBut m can be negative. Let's think about that. For example, if x is small, say x is A, which is possibly smaller than C. Then m = x - C is negative.\n\nBut for each x, the valid y's are such that y >= C - x + 1. Let me think about m + t. Since t >= C - x + 1, m + t = (x - C) + t >= (x - C) + (C - x + 1) ) = 1. So m + t >= 1. Which makes sense, because x + y > C implies x + y - C >= 1.\n\nSo for each x, the sum over y is sum_{t = y_start}^C min(m + t, K), where m = x - C.\n\nLet me think about the sum for each x. Let me denote for a particular x, the value of m = x - C. Then, the sum is over t from y_start to C of min(m + t, K).\n\nLet me note that m + t can be written as (t + m). Since t ranges from y_start to C, which is from some value to C.\n\nLet me think about the values of t where t + m <= K and where t + m > K.\n\nThe threshold is when t + m = K → t = K - m.\n\nSo for t ≤ K - m, the min is t + m. For t > K - m, the min is K.\n\nSo the sum can be split into two parts:\n\nsum_{t = y_start}^{t_max} (t + m) + sum_{t = t_max + 1}^C K, where t_max = min(C, K - m).\n\nBut we need to check whether K - m is within the t range [y_start, C].\n\nLet me find t_max = min(C, K - m). But if K - m < y_start, then the entire sum is just sum_{t} (t + m) for all t in [y_start, C]. Or if K - m >= C, then the entire sum is sum_{t} K for all t in [y_start, C].\n\nSo for each x, the steps are:\n\nCompute m = x - C.\n\nCompute the threshold T = K - m.\n\nThen, the t's in [y_start, C] can be split into two ranges:\n\nt ≤ T → contribute (t + m)\n\nt > T → contribute K.\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nnumber_of_terms_in_first_part * (average of first part) + number_of_terms_in_second_part * K.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nFirst, find the lower and upper bounds for t, which is y_start to C.\n\nLet me define low = y_start, high = C.\n\nThen, the threshold T is K - m.\n\nBut m is x - C → T = K - x + C.\n\nSo T = (D - C + 1) - x + C = D - x + 1.\n\nWait, K is D - C + 1. So T = K - m = (D - C + 1) - (x - C) = D - C + 1 - x + C = D - x + 1.\n\nAh, interesting. So T is D - x + 1.\n\nSo for a given x, T = D - x + 1.\n\nSo for t in [low, high], the split is between t ≤ T and t > T.\n\nSo, the sum becomes:\n\nsum_{t = a}^b min(t + m, K) = sum_{t = a}^b min(t + m, K) where m = x - C.\n\nBut since t + m = t + (x - C) = x + t - C. Which is the same as earlier.\n\nBut now, T is D - x + 1. So for each t, the value of t + m is x + t - C. And we compare it to K = D - C + 1. So x + t - C ≤ K → x + t - C ≤ D - C + 1 → x + t ≤ D + 1 → t ≤ D + 1 - x.\n\nWhich is exactly T = D - x + 1.\n\nSo, for t ≤ T → x + t - C ≤ K → min is x + t - C. For t > T → min is K.\n\nSo the sum over t from low to high is:\n\nsum_{t in [low, high]} [ if t <= T: x + t - C else K ]\n\nBut how do I compute this?\n\nLet me find the overlap between [low, high] and [ -infinite, T ] and [ T+1, +infinite ].\n\nLet me compute the lower and upper bounds of the first part. The first part is t from low to min(high, T). Let's call that upper1 = min(high, T). If upper1 < low, then there's no terms in the first part. Otherwise, the first part is from low to upper1.\n\nThe second part is t from max(low, T+1) to high. If this range is invalid (max(...) > high), then there's no terms in the second part.\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nsum_part1 = sum_{t = low}^{upper1} (x + t - C) \n\nsum_part2 = (high - lower2 + 1) * K, where lower2 = max(low, T + 1)\n\nSo sum_part1 can be calculated as:\n\nsum (x - C) + sum t from low to upper1.\n\nSince x and C are constants for this x, sum (x - C) over (upper1 - low + 1) terms is (x - C) * (upper1 - low + 1).\n\nSum t from low to upper1 is (upper1 + low) * (upper1 - low + 1) // 2.\n\nSimilarly, sum_part2 is the count of terms multiplied by K.\n\nSo for each x, we can compute this sum_part1 and sum_part2.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this for all x in [A, B], and sum all the contributions.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute K = D - C + 1. If D < C, then K is 0? But since C ≤ D, K is at least 1.\n\n- For each x in [A, B], compute:\n\n   y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_start > C → no contribution for this x.\n\n   else:\n\n      low = y_start\n\n      high = C\n\n      T = D - x + 1\n\n      upper1 = min(high, T)\n\n      if upper1 < low → sum_part1 = 0, sum_part2 = 0?\n\n      else:\n\n         sum_part1 = (x - C) * (upper1 - low + 1) + (upper1 + low) * (upper1 - low + 1) // 2\n\n      lower2 = max(low, T + 1)\n\n      if lower2 > high → sum_part2 = 0\n\n      else:\n\n         count_part2 = high - lower2 + 1\n\n         sum_part2 = count_part2 * K\n\n      total_contribution = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\n      add this to the overall answer.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe main loop is O(B - A + 1) iterations, which is up to 5e5 steps. Each step is O(1) operations. So this should be acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 1 2 3 4 → A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4. K = 4-3+1 = 2.\n\nFor each x in [1, 2].\n\nx=1:\n\ny_start = max(B=2, C -x +1 = 3 -1 +1 = 3). So y_start = 3. Since C=3, so low=3, high=3. T = D -x +1 =4 -1 +1=4. upper1 = min(3,4) =3. So upper1 >= low.\n\nsum_part1 = (1-3) * 1 + (3 + 3)*1//2 → (-2)*1 + 3 → -2 + 3 = 1.\n\nlower2 = max(3, 4+1=5) → 5. Which is higher than high=3. So sum_part2 is 0. Total contribution is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_start = max(B=2, 3 -2 +1 = 2). So y_start=2. low=2, high=3. T = D -x +1 =4-2+1=3.\n\nupper1 = min(3,3)=3. So sum_part1 is (2-3)*(3-2+1) + (3+2)*(3-2+1)/2 → (-1)*2 + (5*2)/2 → -2 + 5 = 3.\n\nlower2 = max(2, 3+1=4) → 4. high is 3. So sum_part2 is zero. So total contribution is 3.\n\nSo overall answer is 1 + 3 = 4, which matches the first example. Correct.\n\nSecond example input: 1 2 2 5. So A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5. K =5-2+1=4.\n\nFor x in [1,2].\n\nx=1:\n\ny_start = max(B=2, C -x +1= 2 -1 +1=2). So y_start=2. high=C=2. T=5 -1 +1 =5. upper1 is min(2,5) =2.\n\nsum_part1: (1-2) * 1 + (2+2)*1//2 → (-1) + 2 → 1. sum_part2: lower2 = max(2,5+1=6) → 6>2 → 0. total 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_start = max(2, 2 -2 +1=1) → 2. low=2, high=2. T=5-2+1=4. upper1 is min(2,4)=2. sum_part1: (2-2)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 → 0 + 2 → 2. sum_part2: lower2 is max(2, 4+1=5) →5>2 → 0. total 2. So overall answer is 1+2=3. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: 500000 500000 500000 500000. So A=B=C=D=5e5. K=5e5 -5e5 +1 =1. For x in [5e5, 5e5]. x=5e5.\n\ny_start = max(B=5e5, C -x +1 =5e5 -5e5 +1=1) → 5e5. low=5e5, high=5e5. T = D -x +1 =5e5 -5e5 +1=1. upper1 = min(5e5, 1) =1. But low is 5e5, which is larger than upper1. So sum_part1 is 0. sum_part2: lower2 = max(5e5, 1+1=2) →5e5. high is 5e5. count_part2 =1. sum_part2=1*1=1. So total contribution 1. Which matches the third example.\n\nLooks good.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nInitialize answer = 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   compute y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_start > C: continue\n\n   low = y_start\n\n   high = C\n\n   T = D - x + 1\n\n   upper1 = min(high, T)\n\n   if upper1 < low:\n\n       sum_part1 = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       n = upper1 - low + 1\n\n       sum_part1 = (x - C) * n + (low + upper1) * n // 2\n\n   lower2 = max(low, T + 1)\n\n   if lower2 > high:\n\n       sum_part2 = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       count_part2 = high - lower2 + 1\n\n       sum_part2 = count_part2 * K\n\n   answer += sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nReturn answer.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Well, since x ranges from A to B, and D is >= C. For example, if D is large, T could be large. But in the code, upper1 is min(high, T), which is okay.\n\nBut what about when T is very large, like larger than high? Then upper1 is high, and sum_part1 is computed as (x - C) * n + ... where n is high - low + 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that for large values (up to 5e5), the loop from A to B may take O(5e5) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, loops over 5e5 elements are manageable, as per time constraints.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead the input. The input is multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is four integers on the first line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input says: The first line contains four integers... So the input is one line per test case? But the sample input shows multiple lines, e.g., ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'] — but perhaps that's the input for multiple test cases. However, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is given as per standard input. So the actual code should read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is four integers. The output is the number of triangles. The sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's three test cases. But the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the code should process one test case. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'], but perhaps that's the input for three test cases. But the problem says \"the first line contains four integers\", which suggests that the input is a single line. However, the sample input shows multiple lines, which might be for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the input is only one test case. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Maybe the sample input is for multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one line of input. However, the sample input shows three lines, which probably corresponds to three test cases. Therefore, the code should read multiple lines (each being a test case) and output the corresponding answers.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nOutput:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that there are three test cases, each given in a separate line. Therefore, the code should read multiple lines from stdin, each line being a separate test case, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as \"the first line contains four integers\". This seems conflicting. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the actual problem expects that the code reads multiple lines (each line is a separate test case). However, the problem statement's input description may be incorrect, or perhaps the sample input is formatted in a way that shows multiple test cases.\n\nBut in competitive programming problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the problem is expecting a single test case. However, the sample shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nThis suggests that the input consists of multiple lines, each being a separate test case. Therefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"the first line contains four integers\", which is confusing. However, given the sample input and output, I think that the code should process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, split each line into four integers, and process each as a separate test case.\n\nBut to confirm, looking at the problem's note:\n\nIn the first example, the input is '1 2 3 4' and output is 4. So the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nThus, the code should read from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, and compute the answer.\n\nSo in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n    # compute the answer and print\n\nBut for the code submission, perhaps the input is a single line. However, given the sample input, the code should handle multiple lines. But perhaps the problem is designed for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple lines, but perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, in the problem statement, the sample input is written as a list of inputs, but in reality, the code should read one line per test case.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single line. However, the sample input shows three lines. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. The sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's the way the sample is presented. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases. Therefore, the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps the code should read all lines and process each as a test case. So the code would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print.\n\nNow, proceeding with writing the code.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead each line from stdin.\n\nFor each line, split into A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nInitialize answer = 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B inclusive:\n\n   y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_start > C: continue\n\n   low = y_start\n\n   high = C\n\n   T = D - x + 1\n\n   upper1 = min(high, T)\n\n   if upper1 < low:\n\n       sum_part1 = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       n = upper1 - low + 1\n\n       term1 = (x - C) * n\n\n       term2 = (low + upper1) * n // 2\n\n       sum_part1 = term1 + term2\n\n   lower2 = max(low, T + 1)\n\n   if lower2 > high:\n\n       sum_part2 = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       count_part2 = high - lower2 + 1\n\n       sum_part2 = count_part2 * K\n\n   answer += sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nPrint(answer)\n\nNow, let's test this code.\n\nAnother test case: when A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5. As in the second example.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_start = max(2, 2 -1 +1) = max(2, 2) = 2. low=2, high=2. T =5-1+1=5. upper1 = min(2,5)=2. sum_part1: (1-2)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 → -1 + 2 → 1. sum_part2: lower2 = max(2,5+1=6) →6>2 →0. total 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_start = max(2, 2 -2 +1) = max(2,1) →2. low=2, high=2. T=5-2+1=4. upper1 = min(2,4) =2. sum_part1: (2-2)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 →0 + 2 →2. sum_part2: lower2 = max(2,4+1=5) →5>2 →0. total 2. answer is 1+2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when x is such that T is less than low.\n\nFor example, let's say x is very large. Let's take A=1, B=3, C=5, D=5. So K =5-5+1=1.\n\nx=3:\n\ny_start = max(3, 5 -3 +1) = max(3, 3) =3. low=3, high=5. T =5 -3 +1 =3. upper1 is min(5,3) =3. So sum_part1 is (3-5)* (3-3+1) + (3+3)*1//2 → (-2)*1 + 3 → 1. sum_part2: lower2 = max(3, 3+1=4). high=5. count_part2 is 5-4+1=2. sum_part2 = 2 * 1 = 2. total for this x is 1+2=3.\n\nBut what is the actual count?\n\nFor x=3, y ranges from 3 to 5. For each y, z must be >=5 (C=5) and <=5 (D=5). So z can be 5. And x + y > z → 3 + y >5 → y>2. Which is always true since y starts at 3. So for each y, the count_z is min(5-5+1, 3 + y -5) → min(1, y-2). Since y ranges from 3 to 5:\n\ny=3: 3-2=1 → min(1,1) →1. So count_z=1.\n\ny=4: 4-2=2 → min(1,2) →1. count_z=1.\n\ny=5: 5-2=3 → min(1,3) →1. count_z=1.\n\nTotal for this x is 3 * 1 =3. Which matches the code's calculation. So correct.\n\nSo the code works for this case.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that in Python, for large ranges, looping from A to B may be slow if A and B are up to 5e5. However, 5e5 iterations are manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        K = D - C + 1\n        ans = 0\n        for x in range(A, B+1):\n            y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n            if y_start > C:\n                continue\n            low = y_start\n            high = C\n            T = D - x + 1\n            upper1 = min(high, T)\n            if upper1 < low:\n                sum_part1 = 0\n            else:\n                n = upper1 - low + 1\n                term1 = (x - C) * n\n                term2 = (low + upper1) * n // 2\n                sum_part1 = term1 + term2\n            lower2 = max(low, T + 1)\n            if lower2 > high:\n                sum_part2 = 0\n            else:\n                count_part2 = high - lower2 + 1\n                sum_part2 = count_part2 * K\n            ans += sum_part1 + sum_part2\n        print(ans)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, for the third test case, where A=B=C=D=5e5, the code would process x=5e5. Let's see:\n\ny_start = max(B=5e5, C -x +1 =5e5 -5e5 +1=1) →5e5. low=5e5, high=5e5. T = D -x +1 =5e5 -5e5 +1=1. upper1 = min(5e5, 1) =1. upper1 < low (1 < 5e5) → sum_part1 is zero. lower2 = max(5e5, 1+1=2) →5e5. high is 5e5. count_part2 = 5e5 -5e5 +1 =1. sum_part2 = 1 * K. K is 5e5 -5e5 +1=1. So sum_part2 is 1. So ans is 1. Correct.\n\nNow, what about when D is very large, like D=1e9. Then K is D - C + 1, which can be large, but the code handles it.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where B < C -x +1. For example, A=1, B=2, C=5, x=1. C -x +",
