Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need to find the minimal number of such cards required.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimal number of cards needed to sum up to T, where each card's value is between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the absolute value of T. Because if T is positive, we can use positive numbers; if it's negative, we can use negative numbers. So, the minimal number of cards depends on the absolute value of T and the maximum allowed per card (x).\n\nFor example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to 2. So, 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because two cards can give 4 (2+2), and then one more card of 1. Or maybe 2+2+1, but that's three cards. Alternatively, maybe 2+1+2? Same thing. So the minimal number is ceil(T / x). But wait, what if T is exactly divisible by x? Like T=6 and x=3. Then 6/3=2 cards, which is optimal.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of (abs(T) / x). But wait, let me check some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input, the found cards are -1, 1, 2. Their sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 is 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the example.\n\nIn the second example, input is [-2, -2]. Sum is -4. T is 4. x is 3. So 4 /3 is 1.333... so ceiling is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo yes, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S. If T is zero, return 0.\n3. Otherwise, compute the absolute value of T, say abs_T.\n4. The minimal number of cards is ceil( abs_T / x )\n\nBut how to compute the ceiling of division in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, for positive integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b - 1) // b.\n\nYes. So for example, 5 / 2 is 2.5, ceil is 3. (5 + 2 -1 ) // 2 = 6//2=3. Correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n and x, then the list of numbers. Compute sum_S = sum of the list. T = -sum_S. If T is zero, output 0. Else, compute abs_T = abs(T). Then the answer is (abs_T + x -1 ) // x.\n\nWait, but what if x is zero? No, the input constraints say x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo that's the plan. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput is 3 2, numbers -1, 1, 2. Sum is 2. T is -2. abs_T is 2. (2 + 2-1 ) // 2 = (3)//2 = 1. Correct.\n\nSecond example: input is 2 3, numbers -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. (4 +3 -1 )//3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if sum is 0, output 0. If T is 0, output 0.\n\nAnother test case: T is 5, x is 3. (5 +3-1)/3 =7//3=2.333 floored to 2. Which is correct since 3+2=5. So two cards.\n\nAnother case: T is 3,",
