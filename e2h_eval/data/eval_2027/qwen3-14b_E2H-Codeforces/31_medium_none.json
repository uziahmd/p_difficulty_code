Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The original cards are given, and the new ones can be any numbers between -x and x. The key is to figure out what's the minimal number of cards needed to balance the sum.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's denote the required sum from new cards as target = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of integers (each between -x and x) that sum up to target. But how?\n\nLet me think. Each card can contribute a value between -x and x. So for each new card, the maximum possible contribution towards the target is x, and the minimum is -x. But since we want the minimal number of cards, we should maximize the contribution per card.\n\nFor example, if the target is T, then the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but considering the direction. Wait, but let's think:\n\nSuppose the target is T. Let's take absolute value. Let's say T is positive. Then each card can contribute at most +x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Similarly, if T is negative, then each card can contribute at most -x, so again the same calculation. Because for example, if T is -5 and x is 2, then we need 3 cards: -2, -2, -1. Or maybe -2, -2, -1, but that's 3 cards. Wait, 5 / 2 is 2.5, so ceil(5/2) is 3. So yes, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is exactly divisible by x? For example, T=4, x=2. Then 4/2=2, so two cards. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the numbers on the new cards can be any integer between -x and x. So for example, if T is 3 and x is 2, then the minimal number is 2 cards (2 + 1). But 3/2 is 1.5, ceil is 2. So that works.\n\nSo the formula seems to be: the minimal number of cards is ceil( |target| / x ), but only if target is not zero. If target is zero, then zero cards are needed.\n\nWait, but what if target is zero? Then the sum is already zero, so no need to add any cards. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the original cards, S.\n\n2. Compute target = -S. Because adding new cards with sum target will make the total sum zero.\n\n3. If target is zero, the answer is 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards required to reach target, which is ceil( |target| / x )\n\nBut wait, let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum S is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. Target is -2. So |target| is 2. x is 2. 2/2 is 1, so ceil(1) is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input: 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. Target is 4. x is 3. |target| is 4. 4/3 is 1.333..., ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: if target is 5, x is 3. So 5/3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. So two cards: 3 and 2. Which works.\n\nAnother case: target is 0. Then answer is 0.\n\nBut what if target is 0 but the original sum is zero? Then yes, answer is zero.\n\nSo this formula seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if the target is something that can't be achieved with that number of cards? Like, for example, target is 3, x is 2. So according to the formula, 3/2 is 1.5, ceil is 2. So two cards. How? Let's see. 2 + 1 = 3. So yes, possible. But what if x is 1 and target is 3? Then 3/1 is 3, so 3 cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCalculate the sum of the original cards. Then compute the target as -sum. If target is zero, return 0. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |target| / x ). But how to compute this in Python?\n\nBut wait, how to compute ceil of division in Python?\n\nIn Python, for positive numbers, ceil(a / b) can be done as (a + b - 1) // b.\n\nYes. For example, 5 / 3 is 1.666, (5 + 3 -1) //3 = 7//3=2.\n\nSo for |target| divided by x, we can compute it as (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nsum_s = sum of the list.\n\ntarget = -sum_s.\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    required = (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x\n\n    print(required)\n\nWait, but let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nsum is 2. target is -2. abs(target) is 2. x is 2. (2 + 2-1 )//2 = 3//2 = 1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: sum is -4. target is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: target is 5, x=3. (5+3-1)//3 =7//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: target is 0. So output 0.\n\nBut what if the target is 0 but sum is zero? Well, that's the same as target being zero. So yes.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when x is larger than the target?\n\nLike, target is 3, x is 5. Then (3 +5-1)/5 = 7//5=1. Which is correct. Because one card with 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: target is 1, x is 1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Correct.\n\nSo this formula works.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead the input. First line is n and x. Second line is the list of numbers.\n\nIn Python, read from stdin. So:\n\nProbably, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is '3 2', the second line is '-1 1 2'.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead first line as n, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read the second line as list of integers.\n\nsum_s = sum( list_of_numbers )\n\ntarget = -sum_s\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    required = (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x\n\n    print(required)\n\nBut wait, what if x is zero? No, the constraints say x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, x=2. numbers are [-1,1,2]. sum is 2. target is -2. abs(target)=2. (2 + 2-1) //2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: n=2, x=3. numbers are [-2,-2]. sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is zero. Then output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x is 5. target is -5. abs(target) is 5. (5 +5-1)/5 =9//5=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 3. target is -5. abs(target) is 5. (5 +3-1)/3=7//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input, compute sum, compute target, then compute required.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\ntarget = -s\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print( (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, let me check the second example in the problem statement.\n\nSecond example input is:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nsum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1) //3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: if the sum is 0, output 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x is 1. Then target is -1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x is 2. target is -3. (3 +2-1)/2 =4/2=2. Which is correct: 2 cards of -2 and -1.\n\nSo yes, the code works.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. The new cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum required from the new cards to balance the total sum to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by x. This is efficiently calculated using integer arithmetic as `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\ntarget = -current_sum\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print((abs(target) + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card). The second line contains the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to reach zero.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum needed from new cards is the negative of the current sum of found cards.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, we determine the minimum number of cards required to achieve the target sum. This is done by considering the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target by `x`, which ensures we use the minimum number of cards by maximizing the contribution of each card.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in constant time after reading the input, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
