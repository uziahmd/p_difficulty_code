She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Luba has n tabs open, indexed 1 to n. The mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs except those from l to r inclusive. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this. Each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right of the current position. \n\nHmm. The key here is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize time. Let's think about the steps involved.\n\nFirst, the tabs that need to stay are [l, r]. So, any tabs outside this range must be closed. But how does closing work? When she closes tabs to the left or right of the current position, that affects the a and b values (the current min and max of open tabs). But since we need to end up with exactly [l, r], maybe we can model this by figuring out which sides need to be closed.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. For example, if the current l and r are already the entire range of tabs (like in the third example where l=1 and r=5 and n=5), then nothing needs to be done. So the answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, there are two possibilities: closing tabs to the left of l, and/or closing tabs to the right of r.\n\nBut how do we get to the positions where we can perform these closes?\n\nLet's break it down. Let's consider the left and right boundaries.\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within the target range [l, r]. Then, perhaps we need to close tabs on the left and right. But how?\n\nWait, but the initial a and b are 1 and n. So when closing, the a and b change. However, for the problem, the initial state is all tabs open. So, the process of closing tabs will reduce the a and b as needed. But for our problem, the only thing that matters is that after all operations, the open tabs are exactly l to r. So, the steps would involve:\n\n- Closing all tabs to the left of l (if any)\n- Closing all tabs to the right of r (if any)\n\nBut to do that, Luba must be positioned at the correct spot to perform these closes. For example, to close tabs to the left of l, she needs to be at position l, then close all to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at position r, then close all to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close both sides in some way. But the order might affect the steps.\n\nLet me think about the first example input: 6 3 2 4. The target is tabs 2-4. So, she needs to close tabs 1 and 5-6. How?\n\nThe example solution says she moves to tab 2, closes left (which would close tab 1), then moves to 3, then 4, then closes right (closing 5 and 6). Let's count the steps:\n\n- From pos 3 to 2: 1 second (move left once)\n- Close left: 1 second (so total 2)\n- Then move to 3 (from 2) takes 1 sec (total 3)\n- Then move to 4 (another sec, total 4)\n- Close right (tabs 5-6): 1 sec. Total 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the total steps are 5.\n\nAnother example is when the input is 6 3 1 3. The target is tabs 1-3. So the current position is 3. She can just close the tabs to the right (tabs 4-6) by being at 3 and closing right. That takes 1 second. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems to be:\n\nDetermine whether we need to close left (if l > 1) and/or close right (if r < n). Then, compute the steps required to reach the positions where these closes can be done, plus the steps for the closes themselves.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet's think of the steps needed for each case:\n\nIf we need to close the left side (i.e., l > 1), then we need to move to position l, and then close left. Similarly for the right side: move to r, then close right.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the target range? For example, if the target is [l, r], and the current pos is somewhere inside. Then, moving to l and then closing left, and moving to r and closing right.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l? Then, closing left is possible immediately. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut what if the target is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Luba to close all tabs outside a specified range [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos` among `n` tabs. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Target Boundaries**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` and/or to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Calculate Moves**: Compute the time required to move the cursor to the appropriate positions to perform the closes:\n   - If there are tabs to the left of `l`, move to `l` and close them.\n   - If there are tabs to the right of `r`, move to `r` and close them.\n3. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the target range already includes all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no action is needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the target range is already the entire set of tabs, nothing to do\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Calculate steps needed for left and right closures\n    steps = 0\n    # Check if we need to close left side (tabs before l)\n    if l > 1:\n        # Need to move to l and close left\n        steps += abs(pos - l) + 1  # move to l, then close\n    # Check if we need to close right side (tabs after r)\n    if r < n:\n        # Need to move to r and close right\n        # After closing left, the current position is l, so move from l to r\n        steps += abs(l - r) + 1  # move to r, then close\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Case Check**: If the target range [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Left Closure**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, Luba needs to move her cursor to `l` and close all tabs to the left. The time taken is the distance from her current position to `l` plus one second for the close operation.\n3. **Right Closure**: Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of `r`, she moves to `r` from her current position (or from `l` if she just closed the left side) and closes all tabs to the right. This also takes the distance moved plus one second for the close operation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize the number of moves by directly moving to the necessary positions for closing operations, thus optimizing the total time required.",
