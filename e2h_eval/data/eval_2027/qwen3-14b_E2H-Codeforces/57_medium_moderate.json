His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in the Olympiad based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the points from the first and second tours, but they are not associated with names. So, we have to consider all possible pairings of first and second tour points for the participants, and determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could get, given that his total is at least x.\n\nThe key here is that the participants' points in the first and second tours are given in arbitrary order. So, for each participant, their first tour score and second tour score could be any combination of the a_i and b_j values, but each a_i and b_j must be used exactly once. Wait, no— wait, the problem says that each participant participated in both tours. So the first tour's list is all the participants' first tour scores, and the second tour's list is all participants' second tour scores. But the problem is that the lists are given in arbitrary order. So for example, the first list is a_1 to a_n, which are the first tour scores of the participants, but we don't know which participant is which. Similarly for the second tour. So, when pairing them, we can arrange the pairs (a_i, b_j) such that each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa. But since the problem states that Vasya is present, there exists some i and j where a_i + b_j >= x. But for the purposes of calculating the best and worst possible positions, we need to consider all possible pairings of the a and b arrays, and for each possible pairing, find the position of the participant whose total is at least x (Vasya's possible total). However, since Vasya's actual total is at least x, but the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But in our problem, we need to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, given that there exists a pairing where his total is at least x.\n\nWait, but how do we model Vasya's possible total? Because the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual total could be higher than x. However, for the purpose of determining his rank, the best possible scenario would be when his total is as high as possible (so he gets the best rank), and the worst possible scenario is when his total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and others are arranged to make his rank as bad as possible.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible rank: we want to maximize Vasya's total points. Because if his total is as high as possible, then he can be placed as high as possible. For example, if he has the maximum possible total, then he will be first. But how to find that maximum total?\n\nThe maximum total Vasya can have is the maximum a_i + b_j, but considering that each a and b can be paired only once. Wait, but in reality, each participant has one a_i and one b_j. So the problem is that the pairing between a and b is arbitrary. So for the best case, we can choose the pairing that allows Vasya to have the highest possible total. However, since the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where Vasya's total is at least x. So for the best case, we can assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j, but how?\n\nWait, but how does the pairing work? Because the problem says that each participant has one a_i and one b_j. So, the pairing is a permutation of the b array. For example, for the first tour scores a_1...a_n and second tour scores b_1...b_n, the actual participants' total scores are a_1 + b_p(1), a_2 + b_p(2), ..., where p is a permutation of 1..n.\n\nSo, the problem requires that for all possible permutations p of the b array, we can consider the total scores. However, since the teacher doesn't know which a_i is paired with which b_j, but wants to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya, assuming that there exists at least one permutation where his total is at least x (which is guaranteed by the problem).\n\nBut how do we model Vasya's possible position? Since the teacher can choose any possible pairing (as long as there exists at least one where his total is at least x), we need to find:\n\n- The best possible rank (minimum possible rank number) that Vasya can have, considering all possible pairings where his total is at least x. For this, we can arrange the pairing so that his total is as high as possible, and others are arranged to be as low as possible.\n\n- The worst possible rank (maximum possible rank number) that Vasya can have, considering all possible pairings where his total is at least x. For this, we can arrange the pairing so that his total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and others are arranged to be as high as possible.\n\nBut how to compute these?\n\nLet me think about the best possible rank. To get the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's total. How can we do that? Well, the maximum possible sum he can have is the maximum a_i + b_j, but considering that the pairing must be a permutation. So, for example, if we can pair the largest a_i with the largest b_j, then that would be the maximum possible. But since the pairing is a permutation, the maximum sum is achieved by sorting a in descending order and b in descending order, and pairing them. Then, the maximum sum is a[0] + b[0], etc.\n\nBut for the best case scenario, we can assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible sum. Then, in that case, his rank would be 1 if there's no one else with a higher sum. But if there are other participants with the same sum, then the jury can assign him the first place. So for the best possible rank, the answer is 1, because we can arrange the pairing so that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and even if others have the same sum, the jury can assign him first place.\n\nWait, but how do we know that there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum possible? Because the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where his total is at least x. But the maximum possible sum is definitely >= x. So for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But wait, maybe not. Because in the sample input 1, all participants have a sum of 2. So the best possible rank is 1, and worst is 5. So the sample output is 1 5.\n\nBut how do we find the best possible rank?\n\nWait, the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. If that maximum is unique, then he can be first. If not, then he can be placed first as per the jury's choice. So regardless of how many people have the same maximum, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, for the best possible rank, it's always 1. Wait, but what if there's no way to have Vasya's sum be the maximum? For example, suppose that the maximum sum is achieved by someone else, but Vasya can't have that sum. Wait, no. Because the pairing can be chosen such that Vasya's a_i and b_j are the ones that give the maximum sum. For example, if you have a_i and b_j sorted in descending order, then pairing the first a with the first b gives the maximum sum. So for the best possible scenario, we can choose that pairing, and assign Vasya to that pair. So his sum is maximum possible. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple people with that same maximum sum? Then the jury can assign him first place. So the best possible rank is always 1. Therefore, the first part of the answer is always 1?\n\nBut looking at the sample input 2:\n\nSample input 2:\n\n6 7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nThe output is 1 5.\n\nWhich matches the explanation. So in that case, the best possible rank is 1. So yes, seems like the best possible rank is always 1.\n\nWait, but why? Because the teacher can choose the pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. So the best possible rank is 1. So that's the first part of the answer.\n\nSo for the first part, the answer is always 1. But wait, what if x is higher than the maximum possible sum? But the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists a pairing where a_i + b_j >=x. So that's not possible. So the best possible rank is always 1. Therefore, the first number in the output is 1.\n\nWait, but that seems too easy. Let me check the sample input 1. In that case, all participants have sum 2. So the best possible rank is 1. Which matches the sample output. So perhaps the first answer is always 1.\n\nBut why is that? Because the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So we can choose that pair as Vasya's, and arrange the rest of the pairings such that his sum is as high as possible. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo the first part of the answer is always 1. But why isn't that the case? Let me think of another example. Suppose there are two participants. x is 3. a = [2, 1], b = [2, 1]. So possible pairings are:\n\nEither (2+2=4, 1+1=2) → Vasya's sum is 4 → rank 1.\n\nOr (2+1=3, 1+2=3) → Vasya's sum is 3, which is >=x. So in this case, the best possible is 1. So yes.\n\nAnother example: n=2, x=3. a = [1, 3], b = [2, 2]. So possible pairings: (1+2=3, 3+2=5) → Vasya's sum is 3. So the best possible rank is 1 (since the jury can assign him first place if there are others with same sum). Or if the pairing is (1+2=3, 3+2=5), then Vasya's sum is 3, and the other has 5. So his rank is 2. But the best possible scenario is when he has the maximum sum. So for the best possible, we can pair 3 with 2, getting 5. So his sum is 5. Then his rank is 1. So yes, the best possible is 1.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the answer is always 1. So the first output is 1.\n\nSo the main challenge is to find the worst possible rank. Now, how to compute that.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to arrange the pairing such that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and as many other participants as possible have a higher total than him. So, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of participants that can have a higher total than Vasya, given that his total is at least x.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think. Let's say that Vasya's total is s, which is >=x. We need to find the minimal possible s (but >=x) and arrange the rest of the pairings such that as many as possible participants have higher total than s.\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible s? Well, the minimal possible s is x. But perhaps there's no way to have s=x, but the problem says that there exists a pairing where s >=x. So the minimal possible s is the minimal value that can be achieved by pairing a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case scenario, we need to choose s as the minimal possible (but still >=x) and arrange the other pairings to maximize the number of people with total >s.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach: For the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a total strictly greater than Vasya's total, given that Vasya's total is at least x. And then the worst rank is that number plus 1.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants that can have a total higher than Vasya's total, given that Vasya's total is at least x.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nThe way to maximize the number of people with higher total than Vasya is to have Vasya's total as small as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other pairings to have as many as possible people with higher totals.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s (Vasya's total) that is >=x. Then, arrange the rest of the pairings so that as many as possible participants have a total >s.\n\nBut how to find s? It's possible that the minimal s is x. However, perhaps there's no way to have s=x, but the minimal s is higher. For example, if x is 5, and the possible sums are 6, 7, etc. But the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where s >=x.\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible s? Well, perhaps the minimal possible s is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x, but considering that the pairing is a permutation.\n\nBut how to find that? It's not straightforward. Because the minimal possible s is determined by the way we pair the a and b arrays. For example, if we have to pair a and b such that one of the pairs has a_i + b_j >=x, but we want to minimize that sum.\n\nBut this seems like a problem of finding the minimal possible sum that is >=x, given that the a and b arrays are paired in a permutation.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case scenario, we can assume that Vasya's total is exactly x. But perhaps there's no way to pair a_i and b_j to get exactly x, but we can get higher. But in that case, the minimal possible s is the minimal possible sum that is >=x.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case scenario, we can choose any possible s >=x, and find the maximum number of participants that can have a total higher than s. Then, the worst possible rank is the maximum over all possible s (>=x) of that number plus 1.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy. However, perhaps there's a way to model this.\n\nBut perhaps the worst case scenario is when Vasya's total is as small as possible (so that more people can have higher totals than him). Therefore, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible s (>=x) and then compute how many people can have a total higher than s.\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible s?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think about the following approach.\n\nTo find the minimal s that is achievable (i.e., there exists a permutation where at least one pair has a_i + b_j = s, and s >=x). Then, we can use that s to compute the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how to find that s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal s is the minimal possible value that can be achieved by pairing a and b arrays such that there's at least one pair with sum >=x. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think that for the worst case scenario, we can choose Vasya's sum to be as small as possible (but at least x), and arrange the rest of the pairs to have as many as possible higher sums.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nLet me think of an approach for the worst case.\n\nLet's think of the problem as follows: We need to select one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, pair the rest of the a's and b's in a way that maximizes the number of pairs with sum > (a_i + b_j). Then, the worst rank would be that number + 1.\n\nBut since we can choose any such (a_i, b_j) pair (with sum >=x), we need to find the one that allows the maximum number of other pairs to have sum > (a_i + b_j). That would give the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. However, perhaps we can find that the optimal choice for the minimal s is x, and then compute how many pairs can be formed with sum >x. However, this may not be possible. For example, if the minimal possible s is higher than x.\n\nBut perhaps the worst case scenario occurs when Vasya's sum is as small as possible. So, the approach would be:\n\nFind the minimal possible s (>=x) that can be achieved by pairing a and b arrays. Then, compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >s. Then, the worst possible rank is that number +1.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal possible s is x. So, we can try to find whether there exists a pairing where at least one pair has sum exactly x. If not, then the minimal s is the minimal sum that is greater than x.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nFor the worst case scenario, we can assume that Vasya's total is x. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of pairs (from the remaining a and b elements) that can have sum >x. Then, the worst possible rank is that count + 1.\n\nBut how to find that maximum number?\n\nBut how can we ensure that there exists a pairing where at least one pair has sum >=x (which is required by the problem statement)?\n\nWell, the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists such a pair. So, even if the minimal possible s is higher than x, we can proceed.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >s, given that s is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think of the worst case scenario as follows: We want to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya, such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible (but at least x), and then arrange the remaining a's and b's in a way that as many as possible of them have sum larger than that. The worst possible rank would then be the number of such pairs plus 1.\n\nSo, how can we find the minimal possible s (the sum of Vasya's pair) that is >=x, and then compute the maximum number of other pairs that can have sum >s.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of the following steps for the worst case:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x. Among these, we want to choose the one with the minimal possible sum s. Because that will allow more other pairs to be larger than s.\n\nOnce we have that s, then we need to compute how many pairs can be formed with sum >s, given that one pair (a_i, b_j) is used for Vasya.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum number of pairs with sum >s.\n\nBut even this seems challenging. However, perhaps we can find the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >s, given that we have to remove one a_i and one b_j (the ones used for Vasya's pair). But since we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya, perhaps we can find the best possible way to choose that pair so that the maximum number of other pairs can be formed with sum >s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can ignore the specific choice of the pair for Vasya and instead find the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >x. But this is not necessarily correct because s could be higher than x.\n\nBut perhaps the worst case scenario is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible. So, for example, if we can have Vasya's sum equal to x, then the worst case is when the maximum number of other pairs have sum >x. Otherwise, if the minimal possible sum is higher than x, then we need to use that sum.\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >s, given that s is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nThis seems quite complex. Let's think of an alternative approach.\n\nLet me think of the worst case scenario as follows:\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a total higher than Vasya's total, given that Vasya's total is at least x. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nSo, the question is: What is the maximum number of participants that can have a total higher than some value s (where s >=x), and how to find that s.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For the worst case, we want to maximize the number of participants with total >s, where s is the minimal possible value that is >=x.\n\nSo, to find the maximum number of participants with total >s, we need to find the maximum possible count of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum >s, considering that each a and b is used once.\n\nBut how to find this count for varying s?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with sum >k, given two arrays a and b, and choosing a permutation.\n\nThis is a classic problem. For example, to maximize the number of pairs with sum >k, you can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, and pair them. For each pair, check if a[i] + b[j] >k. The maximum number of such pairs is found by this greedy approach.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose I want to maximize the number of pairs with sum >k. How can I pair a and b?\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, for each i, pair a[i] with b[i]. Then, check how many of these pairs have sum >k. This approach is known to maximize the number of pairs with sum >k. Because by pairing the smallest a with the largest b, we can maximize the chances of getting a sum >k.\n\nYes, this is a standard approach. For example, in the problem of maximum number of pairs with sum greater than k, this is the way to go.\n\nSo, if we can find the minimal possible s (>=x) and then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s, then that would give us the maximum number of people that can have higher total than Vasya's s. Then, the worst possible rank is that number +1.\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible s that is >=x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal possible s is the minimal possible value such that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x, and the rest of the pairs can be arranged to maximize the count of pairs with sum >s.\n\nBut how to find this s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case scenario, the minimal possible s is x. So, we can proceed under the assumption that s is x, and compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >x. However, if there is no way to have s=x (i.e., all possible pairs have sum >x), then we can take s as the minimal sum possible (which would be higher than x). But how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case scenario is determined by the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >x. Let me think.\n\nSuppose that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is x. Then, the maximum number of other pairs with sum >x is the maximum possible, which would be the number of pairs that can be formed with sum >x. However, if there is no way to have a pair with sum x (i.e., all possible pairs have sum >x), then Vasya's sum is the minimal sum, which is higher than x. But in that case, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s would be the maximum number of pairs with sum >s, where s is the minimal sum >=x.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps there's a better way. Let's think of the worst case scenario as follows:\n\nWe can imagine that Vasya's sum is s, which is the minimal possible sum >=x. Then, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is the maximum possible, and thus the worst possible rank is that number +1.\n\nTo find s, we need to find the minimal possible sum that can be achieved by pairing a and b, such that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x. However, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >x, assuming that there is at least one pair with sum >=x. Because even if the minimal possible s is higher than x, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s would be less than or equal to the maximum number of pairs with sum >x.\n\nWait, for example, if s is higher than x, then the number of pairs with sum >s is less than or equal to the number of pairs with sum >x. Thus, if we take s=x, then the maximum number of pairs with sum >x is the maximum possible, leading to the worst possible rank.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the worst possible rank can be computed by finding the maximum number of pairs with sum >x, and then adding 1. However, this assumes that there exists a way to have a pair with sum exactly x. If not, then perhaps the maximum number of pairs with sum >x is not the right value.\n\nWait, but the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So, if there is no pair with sum exactly x, but all pairs have sum >x, then the minimal s is the minimal sum among all pairs. Which is greater than x. But in this case, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is less than the maximum number of pairs with sum >x. So, in this case, the worst possible rank would be determined by the maximum number of pairs with sum >s, which is less than the maximum number for x.\n\nBut how do we handle this?\n\nThis seems very complex. Perhaps there is a way to model this by considering all possible s >=x, and for each s, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s, then take the maximum over all possible s. However, this is not feasible computationally.\n\nAlternative idea: For the worst possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is the minimal possible value that is >=x. Then, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > that value. How to find this minimal value?\n\nBut how to find that minimal value?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. We can find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that are >=x. Among these pairs, find the minimal sum s. Then, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of pairs (excluding this pair) that can be formed with sum >s.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive. However, given that n can be up to 1e5, we need an efficient approach.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, even O(n^2) approaches are impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but for the minimal s, it's the minimal sum of a_i + b_j that is >=x. But how to find this?\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the minimal sum that is >=x, considering all possible pairs (a_i, b_j). However, since we have to pair a and b in a permutation (each a is paired with exactly one b), this complicates things. Because the minimal sum s for Vasya's pair is not just the minimal a_i + b_j >=x, but also ensuring that there exists a permutation where that pair is included.\n\nBut this seems very hard. However, perhaps the minimal possible s is the minimal possible sum of a_i + b_j >=x, regardless of the permutation. Because if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s >=x, then there exists a permutation where this pair is included (by pairing a_i with b_j, and then pairing the rest arbitrarily). Therefore, the minimal s is the minimal sum of a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to:\n\nFind the minimal sum s such that there exists a_i and b_j with a_i + b_j >=x. Then, compute the maximum number of pairs (in the entire array) that can be formed with sum >s, minus 1 (because one pair is Vasya's, which has sum s).\n\nWait, no. Because after choosing the pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s, we have to pair the remaining a and b elements. So, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining a and b elements with sum >s. But how to compute this?\n\nThis seems very complex. However, perhaps for the worst case scenario, we can proceed as follows:\n\nAssume that Vasya's sum is the minimal possible s >=x. Then, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >s, given that one pair (a_i, b_j) is used for Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can ignore the fact that one pair is used for Vasya and just compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >s, and then subtract 0 or 1, depending on whether that pair is counted.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2. a is [1,1,1,1,1], b is [1,1,1,1,1]. All pairs have sum 2. So the minimal s is 2. Now, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is zero. So the worst rank is 0 + 1 = 1? No, but the sample output says 5.\n\nWait, this suggests that my approach is wrong. Because in the first sample, the worst possible rank is 5. Which implies that there are 4 participants with sum higher than Vasya's. But in reality, all sums are equal to 2. So how can there be participants with sum higher than Vasya's?\n\nAh! Because in this case, s is 2, and the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is zero. So the worst possible rank is 0+1=1? But the sample output says 5. So clearly, this approach is incorrect.\n\nThis indicates that my previous reasoning is flawed. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because when all pairs have sum equal to s (2), then the number of participants with sum >s is zero. So the worst possible rank is zero + 1 = 1. But according to the sample, the worst possible rank is 5. This suggests that my understanding of the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's the correct way to calculate the worst possible rank?\n\nIn the first sample, all participants have sum 2. So Vasya's sum is 2. The other participants also have sum 2. So the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum is zero. But the rank depends on how the jury assigns places to those with equal sums. Since all participants have the same sum, the jury can assign Vasya the last place (5th), which is the worst possible. Hence, the worst possible rank is n.\n\nSo, the previous approach was missing this case. Therefore, the formula for the worst possible rank is not simply the number of participants with sum >s plus 1. It's the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum equal to s (including Vasya) minus 1, plus 1? No, that's not correct.\n\nWait, the rank calculation depends on how many people have a higher sum than Vasya, and how many have the same sum. For example, if there are k people with sum higher than Vasya's, and m people with the same sum as Vasya (including him), then Vasya's rank can be anywhere between k+1 and k + m. So the worst possible rank is k + m.\n\nIn the first sample, k=0, m=5. So the worst possible rank is 0 + 5 = 5, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the formula for the worst possible rank is:\n\nworst_rank = number_of_people_with_sum_greater_than_s + number_of_people_with_sum_equal_to_s.\n\nBut how to calculate this?\n\nBut how to find the number_of_people_with_sum_greater_than_s and number_of_people_with_sum_equal_to_s, given that s is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut this requires knowing how many pairs have sum >s, and how many have sum ==s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nBut again, this depends on the pairing. So, the problem becomes:\n\nFor the worst case scenario, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is s (minimal possible >=x), and arrange the rest of the pairs such that the number of people with sum >s is as large as possible, and the number of people with sum ==s is as large as possible.\n\nBut this seems very complex.\n\nLet me think of the worst case scenario as follows: We want to maximize the number of people who have sum >=s, and among them, maximize the number of people with sum >s, and then add to that the number of people with sum ==s. Wait, no. Because the worst possible rank is when the number of people with sum >s is as large as possible, and the number of people with sum ==s is as large as possible.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, we want to maximize the number of people with sum >=s (including Vasya's sum) and the number of people with sum >s. But how?\n\nThis seems too vague. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me consider that in the worst case, Vasya's sum is s, and we want to maximize the number of people with sum >=s. Because then, the worst possible rank is the number of people with sum >=s.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nBut how to find s and the maximum number of people with sum >=s.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s, for some s >=x.\n\nBut this seems like a different problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s, where s is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nLet me try to think differently. For the worst possible rank, we want to maximize the number of people who have a sum >= Vasya's sum. Because the more people with the same or higher sum, the worse Vasya's rank can be.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is the maximum number of people that can have sum >=s, where s is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nBut how to find s and the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s.\n\nBut this seems like a problem that can be solved with binary search.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible s (>=x) and then find the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >=s. The worst rank is that number.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFind the minimal possible s such that there exists a pairing where at least one pair has sum s >=x. Then, compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >=s.\n\nBut again, how to find this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >=x. Let me think.\n\nIf we can find the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x, then in the worst case, Vasya's sum is x, and there are k pairs with sum >=x. So his rank could be k.\n\nBut in the first sample, the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x (which is 2) is 5 (all pairs have sum 2). So the worst rank would be 5, which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample, the worst rank is 5. Let's see.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=6, x=7.\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nThe worst case scenario is when Vasya's sum is 7 (assuming that's the minimal possible s). How many pairs can have sum >=7?\n\nBut the maximum number of pairs with sum >=7 would be ?\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the sample explanation.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, Vasya's sum is 4+3=7. The other pairs are arranged to have as many as possible higher sums.\n\nThe example says that the worst possible rank is 5. So there are 4 participants with sum higher than 7, and Vasya is the fifth.\n\nSo, the number of participants with sum >=7 is 5 (4 higher, plus Vasy",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to find these ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best possible rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because we can always pair his scores such that he has the highest possible total score among all participants.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to:\n   - Find the maximum number of participants who can have a higher total score than Vasya's minimum possible score (which is at least `x`).\n   - Use a greedy approach to maximize the number of pairs with sums greater than a given value.
