He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given a list of prefixes and suffixes of some unknown string, I have to assign each of them as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there exists at least one possible original string that fits. And the output is a string of P's and S's in the order of the input.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem better. The input gives me 2n-2 strings. Each of these is either a proper prefix or a proper suffix of the original string s. But I don't know which is which. My task is to assign each of them as P or S such that there exists a string s of length n that has all the P's as its prefixes and S's as suffixes.\n\nThe key here is to find for each possible candidate string s (which is of length n), check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, for each such s, assign the corresponding labels. But since n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities might be computationally heavy? Wait, but for n=100, the possible s's are 26^100, which is way too big. So brute-forcing all possible s is impossible.\n\nSo, how else can I approach this?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. That is, there exists at least one s. So perhaps there's a way to reconstruct the original s from the given data.\n\nAnother idea: the original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1. Similarly for suffixes. But since the input includes exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1, but they are a mix of prefixes and suffixes, perhaps we can find which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes by checking overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, think about the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the original string s has a prefix of length n-1. Let's call that prefix p. Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 is s. But since the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes, the longest possible prefix (length n-1) and the longest possible suffix (length n-1) must be present in the input. However, since there are two strings of each length, one of them is the prefix of length n-1, and the other is the suffix of length n-1. But how do I know which is which?\n\nWait, but for the original string s, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:]. So, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must be different unless the entire string is made of the same character. For example, if s is \"aaa\", then the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\" and the suffix of length 2 is also \"aa\".\n\nSo, for the case where the original string is all same characters, the prefix and suffix of length n-1 would be same. But in general, they are different.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to reconstruct the original string is to find for each possible candidate of the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1), and check if they can overlap correctly. Because the original string s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 (let's call it p) and the suffix of length n-1 (call it s) must overlap. For example, the first n-1 characters of s is p, and the last n-1 characters is s. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of p must match the last n-2 characters of s. Because s is the original string, so p is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So, the first n-2 characters of p (which is s[0..n-3]) must equal the last n-2 characters of the suffix (s[1..n-1] has last n-2 characters s[2..n-1]? Wait, maybe I need to think of the overlapping between p and s.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the original string is ababa (n=5). The prefix of length 4 is abab, and the suffix of length 4 is baba. Now, the first 3 characters of the prefix (aba) must be the same as the last 3 characters of the suffix (aba). Indeed, the suffix is baba, last three are aba. So yes.\n\nSo, the idea is that the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must have their first n-2 characters equal to the last n-2 characters of the suffix. So, the overlap between",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct assignment of 'P' (prefix) and 'S' (suffix) for each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that fits the given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of the original string `s` must be of length `n-1`. These two strings must overlap correctly. Specifically, the first `n-2` characters of the longest prefix must match the last `n-2` characters of the longest suffix.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: Using the identified longest prefix and suffix, we can reconstruct the original string `s` by combining these two strings appropriately.\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once the original string `s` is reconstructed, validate all given input strings to check if they are either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n4. **Assign Labels**: Based on the validation, assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the possible candidates for the longest prefix and suffix (length n-1)\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == n - 1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all pairs of candidates for longest prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(len(candidates)):\n        for j in range(len(candidates)):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Check if they can overlap correctly\n            if prefix_candidate[:n-2] == suffix_candidate[-(n-2):]:\n                # Reconstruct the original string\n                s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                # Now check all input strings against this s\n                result = []\n                for st in strings:\n                    is_prefix = True\n                    is_suffix = True\n                    for l in range(1, len(st)+1):\n                        if st != s[:l]:\n                            is_prefix = False\n                        if st != s[-l:]:\n                            is_suffix = False\n                    if is_prefix:\n                        result.append('P')\n                    elif is_suffix:\n                        result.append('S')\n                    else:\n                        # This should not happen as per problem statement\n                        pass\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: We identify all strings of length `n-1` which are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Checking Overlap**: For each pair of candidate strings (one as prefix and one as suffix), we check if they can overlap correctly. This is done by ensuring the first `n-2` characters of the prefix match the last `n-2` characters of the suffix.\n4. **Reconstructing the String**: Using the valid prefix and suffix candidates, the original string `s` is reconstructed.\n5. **Validation and Labeling**: Each input string is checked against the reconstructed `s` to determine if it is a prefix or suffix. The corresponding labels ('P' or 'S') are assigned and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates for the longest prefix and suffix, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal given the constraints.",
