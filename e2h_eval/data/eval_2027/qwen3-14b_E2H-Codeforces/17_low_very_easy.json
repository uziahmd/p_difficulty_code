He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's corresponding to each input string.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the original string s must have all these given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. But since we don't know s, we need to figure out which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes such that there exists at least one possible s that fits.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For example, the original string s has exactly n characters. All the given strings are improper prefixes or suffixes. So for each possible candidate string s, we can generate all its prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1, and check if they match the input. However, since we don't know s, but the input gives us all those prefixes and suffixes, perhaps we can find s by looking for the unique string that has all the given strings as its prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, but how? Because the input is a mix of prefixes and suffixes. So for example, in the first sample input, the correct s is ababa. Its prefixes of length 1 to 4 are: a, ab, aba, abab. The suffixes are: a, ba, aba, baba. But the input given includes all these, but mixed. So the problem is that we need to assign each of the input strings to be either a prefix or a suffix of s, such that when we collect all the prefixes and suffixes, they match exactly the given input.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, the original s must be such that for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings in the input: one that is a prefix and one that is a suffix. Wait, no. Wait, the input contains exactly 2n-2 strings. For each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. But each of those two is either a prefix or a suffix. For example, for length 1, there are two strings, which could be the prefix (length 1) and the suffix (length 1) of s.\n\nSo the idea is that the original string s must have, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), exactly one prefix of length l and exactly one suffix of length l. Therefore, the set of input strings must contain exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of s. So the problem reduces to finding s, then checking which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of s.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, the original s must be such that:\n\n- The longest prefix (of length n-1) is a string in the input. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is also in the input. But wait, the input includes all possible prefixes and suffixes. So for example, the original s's prefix of length n-1 is a string in the input. Also, the suffix of length n-1 is another string in the input.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to find the possible candidates for s. For example, for each possible candidate string, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes of s, the original s must be such that:\n\nThe concatenation of the longest prefix (n-1 length) and the last character of the original string s. Or wait, perhaps the original s can be determined by taking the longest prefix (which is of length n-1) and adding a character. But that's not necessarily correct because the longest prefix is of length n-1, but the original s is of length n. So the original s would be the longest prefix plus one character. But how do we find that character?\n\nAlternatively, considering that for the original s, the suffix of length n-1 is a string in the input. Let's say that the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n]. Then the original s is the first character plus this suffix. But again, how do we find that?\n\nAnother approach: the original s must have a unique prefix of length n-1 and a unique suffix of length n-1. But since the input contains exactly two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix of length n-1, and the other must be the suffix of length n-1. So, for example, if we take the two strings of length n-1, then the original s must be the one that is formed by combining the prefix of length n-1 with the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think.\n\nSuppose the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` based on the given input and then classifying each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Original String `s`**: \n   - The original string `s` can be determined by considering the longest possible prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`) from the input. For each candidate string of length `n-1`, we check if there exists another string in the input that could be its suffix when combined with an additional character.\n\n2. **Classify Input Strings**:\n   - Once we have identified the correct string `s`, we classify each input string as a prefix or suffix by checking if it matches any prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Find the possible s\n    # The correct s must have all the given strings as its prefixes or suffixes\n    # We can try all combinations of the two longest strings (length n-1)\n    # Since there are exactly two strings of length n-1\n    candidates = []\n    for i in range(len(strings)):\n        if len(strings[i]) == n-1:\n            candidates.append(strings[i])\n    \n    # Try each candidate as the prefix of length n-1\n    for prefix_candidate in candidates:\n        # The original s would be prefix_candidate + last_char\n        # But we need to find the last_char such that the suffix of length n-1 is also in the input\n        # The suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n], so we need to find a string in the input that matches s[1...n]\n        # So for the suffix_candidate, it should be s[1...n] = s[1:] which is prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char\n        # Wait, if s is prefix_candidate + last_char, then s[1:] is prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char\n        # So we need to check if there is a string in the input equal to prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char\n        # But how to find last_char?
