He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the given prefixes and suffixes. And our job is to assign P or S to each input string such that there exists some s that matches.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the correct assignments. Let's think about the possible approach.\n\nLet me think: For a string s of length n, all its proper prefixes and suffixes are given. Each of these strings is either a prefix or a suffix of s. But the problem is that the input gives all of them mixed up, and we have to assign which is which.\n\nThe key observation here is that the original string s must be such that all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it. So, for example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be a prefix of s. Similarly for the longest suffix. Wait, but there are two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. For example, when n=5, there are two strings of length 4. One of them is the prefix of length 4, and the other is the suffix of length 4. So for the original string s, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1].\n\nSo, perhaps the way to approach this is to find which of the input strings could be the prefix of length n-1 and which could be the suffix of length n-1. Once we have those, we can build the original string s by combining them. Because the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must overlap in the middle. For example, if the prefix of length n-1 is P and the suffix is S, then the original string s must be P + last character of S (since S is the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1], so the first character of S is s[1], and the last character is s[n-1]. But the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], so the original string is s = P + (last character of S). But also, since the suffix of length n-1 is S, the original string s must be the first character of S plus S[1..n-2] (since S is s[1..n-1], so s[0] is the first character of S? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s. So if the original string is s of length n, then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. So the first character of the suffix is s[1], and the last is s[n-1]. The prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], which ends with s[n-2].\n\nSo the original string s must be equal to the prefix of length n-1 (let's call it p) plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1 (call it s_suffix). Because the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1], so the last character is s[n-1]. Therefore, the original string s is p + s_suffix_last_char. But also, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1], which is equal to the original string s's suffix of length n-1. So the original string s must start with p (the prefix of length n-1), and end with s_suffix (the suffix of length n-1). Therefore, the first character of the suffix of length n-1 is s[1], which is the second character of the original string. But the prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], so the original string is s = p + c, where c is the last character of the suffix of length n-1. But then, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1] = (p[1...n-2] + c). So the suffix of length n-1 is p[1...n-2] + c. Which must be equal to the given suffix string of length n-1. \n\nSo, given that, for the two strings of length n-1 in the input, one must be the prefix of length n-1, and the other must be the suffix of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. Then, the original string s would be A + (last character of B). Also, the suffix of length",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the longest prefix and suffix of `s` from the input and using them to reconstruct the original string `s`, then validating all other strings against this reconstructed string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The input contains two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`. For the longest possible length (`n-1`), one string must be the prefix and the other must be the suffix of the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct Original String**: Using the identified prefix and suffix of length `n-1`, we can reconstruct the original string `s` by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix.\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once we have the reconstructed string `s`, we check each input string to see if it is a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try each pair as prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1 - i]\n        # Reconstruct the original string\n        s_reconstructed = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        # Check if the suffix_candidate is indeed a suffix of s_reconstructed\n        if s_reconstructed[-len_n_minus_1:] == suffix_candidate:\n            # Now check all strings against this s_reconstructed\n            result = []\n            for s in strings:\n                if s == s_reconstructed[:len(s)]:\n                    result.append('P')\n                elif s == s_reconstructed[-len(s):]:\n                    result.append('S')\n                else:\n                    # This should not happen as per the problem statement\n                    pass\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`, and the subsequent lines contain the prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: We identify the two strings of length `n-1` from the input, as these are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of `s`.\n3. **Reconstructing the String**: By trying each candidate as a prefix and the other as a suffix, we reconstruct the original string `s` by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix.\n4. **Validation**: For each input string, we check if it matches the corresponding prefix or suffix of the reconstructed string `s`, and assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes based on the given constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.",
