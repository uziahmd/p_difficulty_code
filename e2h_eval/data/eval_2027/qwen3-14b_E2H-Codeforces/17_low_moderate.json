He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string of P's and S's, each indicating the type for the corresponding input string.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the original string s could be. Because once I know s, I can check each input string to see if it's a prefix or suffix. But how do I find s?\n\nThe problem says that the input gives all improper prefixes and suffixes of s. So for example, if s is \"ababa\" (like in the first example), then all prefixes of lengths 1-4 and suffixes of lengths 1-4 are given. But the input doesn't tell which is which. My job is to assign each of the input strings as either a prefix or a suffix such that there exists at least one possible s that fits.\n\nBut how do I find s? Well, the original string s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. So perhaps the correct approach is to find all possible candidates for s, then for each candidate, check if the input strings can be partitioned into prefixes and suffixes accordingly.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities might be computationally feasible. However, generating all possible candidates for s might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think about the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the original string s has a prefix of length n-1 and a suffix of length n-1. But those two must be different. Wait, but maybe not. For example, if the string is \"aaa\", then the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\" and the suffix of length 2 is also \"aa\".\n\nSo, the key idea here is that the original string s must be such that all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Therefore, the correct way to find s is to find a string that has all the input strings as either prefixes or suffixes. However, since we don't know which ones are which, how can we find s?\n\nAnother approach: The original string s must be the unique string that has all the given strings as prefixes or suffixes. However, since there may be multiple possible s's, but the problem allows any answer that is consistent with at least one s.\n\nBut how to find s? Let's think about the following: The longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be present in the input. But since the input contains exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, for length n-1, there are two strings. One of them must be the prefix of length n-1, and the other must be the suffix of length n-1. But wait, no. Because for example, in the case of s being \"aaa\", the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\" and the suffix of length 2 is \"aa\". So both are the same. So for that case, the input would have two copies of \"aa\" for length 2.\n\nSo, for the case of the maximum length (n-1), the two strings given are the prefix and suffix of that length. But how do I know which one is which? Well, perhaps the correct s is determined by combining the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1. Because for example, the original string s is of length n. So the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the original string s can be formed by taking the prefix of length n-1 (let's say p) and adding a character to the end, or taking the suffix of length n-1 (suf) and adding a character to the beginning. But since the prefix and suffix of length n-1 must overlap in the original string, the correct way to find s is that the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must have a common part of length n-2. So, for example, if the prefix is p and the suffix is suf, then the original string s must be p + c, where c is the last character of s. Also, the suffix is s[1..n-1], which is the original string without the first character. So the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], which is the original string minus the first character. Therefore, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So combining these two, the original string s must be equal to the prefix of length n-1 plus the last",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to classify each input string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S').\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest improper prefix and suffix of `s` (both of length `n-1`) must be present in the input. These two strings can help reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: By combining the longest prefix and suffix, we can infer possible candidates for `s`. Specifically, if we take the longest prefix and append the last character of the longest suffix, or vice versa, we can form potential candidates for `s`.\n3. **Validate Candidates**: For each candidate string, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n4. **Classify Input Strings**: Once a valid candidate string `s` is identified, classify each input string as a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find all strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates_len_n_minus_1 = [s for s in strings if len(s) == len_n_minus_1]\n    \n    # Try each pair of candidates for the max length as prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(len(candidates_len_n_minus_1)):\n        for j in range(len(candidates_len_n_minus_1)):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates_len_n_minus_1[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates_len_n_minus_1[j]\n            \n            # Possible s1: prefix_candidate + last char of suffix_candidate\n            s1 = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Possible s2: first char of prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate\n            s2 = prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate\n            \n            # Check if s1 is valid\n            valid_s = None\n            for s in [s1, s2]:\n                # Check if all strings are either prefix or suffix of s\n                all_valid = True\n                for st in strings:\n                    is_prefix = s.startswith(st)\n                    is_suffix = s.endswith(st)\n                    if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                        all_valid = False\n                        break\n                if all_valid:\n                    valid_s = s\n                    break\n            if valid_s:\n                break\n        if valid_s:\n            break\n    \n    # Now, for each input string, determine if it's a prefix or suffix of valid_s\n    result = []\n    for st in strings:\n        if valid_s.startswith(st):\n            result.append('P')\n        else:\n            result.append('S')\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: We identify the strings of length `n-1` which are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n3. **Reconstructing `s`**: By combining the longest prefix and suffix candidates, we generate potential strings `s1` and `s2`. We validate these candidates by checking if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of these candidates.\n4. **Classifying Strings**: Once a valid candidate `s` is found, each input string is classified as a prefix or suffix of `s`, and the results are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct classification of each input string based on the constraints provided.",
