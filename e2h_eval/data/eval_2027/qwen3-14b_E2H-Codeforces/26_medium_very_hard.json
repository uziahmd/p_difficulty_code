    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D values. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The problem says that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Wait, so x is between A and B, inclusive. Then y has to be at least B (since B ≤ y) and up to C. And z is between C and D. Also, since the triangle is non-degenerate, the triangle inequality must hold. For any triangle with sides x, y, z, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe we can find a way to simplify this.\n\nWait, but the problem says that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So x ≤ y ≤ z? Let me think. Because x is up to B, and y starts from B. So x can be up to B, and y is at least B. So x ≤ y. Also, y is up to C, and z starts from C. So y ≤ z. Therefore, x ≤ y ≤ z. So the triangle inequalities would require that x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order x ≤ y ≤ z, the sum of the two smaller sides (x + y) must be greater than the largest side (z). If that holds, then the other inequalities (x + z > y, y + z > x) will automatically hold because z is bigger than or equal to y and x.\n\nSo the key condition here is x + y > z. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triplets (x, y, z) where:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\nand x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we efficiently compute this?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z and check the condition, but given that the maximum value for D is 5e5, this would be O(B * C * D), which is way too slow. For example, if all values are 5e5, then B*C*D would be (5e5)^3 = 1.25e17 operations. That's impossible to compute in reasonable time.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about breaking down the problem into parts. Since x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C, and z ranges from C to D. Also, for each x and y, the z has to be less than x + y, but also within [C, D]. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those that are between max(C, ... ) and min(D, x + y - 1). Wait, because z has to be >= C and <= D, and also z < x + y. So for each x and y, the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of the count of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y.\n\nBut even this approach would be O(B * C) time. Let's see: B can be up to 5e5, and C can be up to 5e5. So 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11 operations. Which is way too slow for Python. So this approach isn't feasible either. Need to find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the variables. Let me rephrase the problem. For each x and y, the lower bound for z is C, upper bound is D. But also, z must be less than x + y. So the upper bound for z is min(D, x + y - 1). The number of valid z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C. Otherwise zero. So the count for each x and y is:\n\nif x + y - 1 < C → no z's. So 0.\nelse:\nthe upper limit is min(D, x + y - 1)\nso the number of z is upper - C + 1, where upper = min(D, x + y - 1). But only if upper >= C.\n\nSo the problem becomes: compute for all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], the value of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y - 1 >= C.\n\nNow, how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges for x and y. Let's consider that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let me denote S = x + y. The condition is that S - 1 >= C → S >= C + 1. So for each x and y such that x + y >= C + 1, then the number of z is min(D, S - 1) - C + 1. Which is equivalent to:\n\nIf S - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\nElse if S - 1 >= C → S - 1 - C + 1 = S - C\n\nSo the number of z is:\n\nif S >= C + 1:\n    if S - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n    else → S - C\n\nSo the total contribution for each (x, y) is:\n\nif x + y > C → then:\n\n    if x + y - 1 > D → D - C + 1\n    else → (x + y - 1) - C + 1 = x + y - C\n\nSo the problem now is to compute the sum over x and y of:\n\nif x + y > C → then:\n\n    if x + y > D + 1 → D - C + 1\n    else → x + y - C\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think of splitting the sum into two parts:\n\nFor all (x, y) pairs where x + y > C, we have to compute:\n\nsum_{x,y} [ min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 ]\n\nWhich is equal to sum_{x,y} [ (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) ] if x + y > C.\n\nLet me denote T = x + y. Then T ranges from (A + B) to (B + C). But since x is up to B and y up to C, the maximum T is B + C.\n\nSo for T in [C+1, B + C], we can compute how many (x, y) pairs have x + y = T, and then for each such T, compute the contribution to the sum based on whether T-1 is larger than D or not.\n\nSo first, for each T, compute the number of (x, y) pairs such that x + y = T, with x in [A, B], y in [B, C].\n\nThen, for each such T, the contribution is:\n\nif T - 1 >= D → (D - C + 1) * count(T)\nelse if T >= C + 1 → (T - C) * count(T)\n\nSo the overall sum is:\n\nsum over T >= C + 1:\n\n   if T - 1 >= D: (D - C + 1) * count(T)\n   else: (T - C) * count(T)\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n1. For each possible T, compute count(T) = number of (x, y) pairs with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y = T.\n\n2. Then, for each T, compute the contribution based on T and D.\n\nNow, how to compute count(T) efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible values of T. The minimum possible T is when x is A and y is B → T_min = A + B. The maximum T is B + C.\n\nBut since x ranges from A to B and y ranges from B to C, for each T, the count is the number of x in [A, B] such that y = T - x is in [B, C].\n\nSo for each T, the count is the number of x in [A, B] such that B ≤ T - x ≤ C.\n\nRearranged:\n\nB ≤ T - x ≤ C → T - C ≤ x ≤ T - B.\n\nBut x also has to be between A and B.\n\nSo x must be in [max(A, T - C), min(B, T - B)].\n\nBut wait, T - x must be between B and C. So solving for x:\n\ny = T - x ≥ B → x ≤ T - B.\n\ny = T - x ≤ C → x ≥ T - C.\n\nSo x must be ≥ T - C and ≤ T - B.\n\nBut x also has to be between A and B.\n\nTherefore, the valid x's are in the intersection of [A, B] and [T - C, T - B].\n\nSo the lower bound for x is L = max(A, T - C).\n\nThe upper bound for x is R = min(B, T - B).\n\nIf L > R, then there are zero x's for this T. Otherwise, the count is R - L + 1.\n\nSo for each T, count(T) = max(0, R - L + 1) where R = min(B, T - B), L = max(A, T - C).\n\nNow, how do we compute this for all T in the range [A + B, B + C]?\n\nBut even if we loop through all T in that range, it's O(B + C - A - B + 1) = O(B + C - A). Since A can be as low as 1, and B and C up to 5e5, this could be O(1e6) steps. Which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute all T from T_min = A + B to T_max = B + C.\n\n- For each T, compute L and R as above.\n\n- Compute count(T) = max(0, R - L + 1) if L <= R else 0.\n\nOnce we have count(T) for all T, we can process each T to calculate its contribution to the total sum.\n\nNow, for each T:\n\nIf T is less than or equal to C, then x + y = T would be less than or equal to C. But since x <= B and y >= B, and B <= C, perhaps not. Wait, T ranges from A + B to B + C. But for T to be >= C + 1, we need to have T >= C + 1.\n\nSo for each T in the range [C + 1, B + C], we need to calculate the contribution.\n\nBut for T < C + 1, their contribution is zero. Because x + y must be > C for the z to exist. So for T <= C, the contribution is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute all T from T_min to T_max. For each T, compute count(T) as before. Then, for T >= C + 1, compute the contribution.\n\nNow, for each T >= C + 1, what is the contribution?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the contribution is:\n\nif (T - 1) >= D → (D - C + 1) * count(T)\n\nelse if (T - 1) < D → (T - C) * count(T)\n\nBut T - 1 >= D is equivalent to T >= D + 1.\n\nSo for T >= D + 1: contribution is (D - C + 1) * count(T)\n\nFor T in [C + 1, D]: contribution is (T - C) * count(T)\n\nFor T in [D + 1, ... ]: contribution is (D - C + 1) * count(T)\n\nSo, the total contribution is:\n\nsum over T in [C + 1, T_max] of:\n\n   if T > D: (D - C + 1) * count(T)\n\n   else: (T - C) * count(T)\n\nSo, the problem now is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute for each T in [C+1, T_max], the count(T) and then multiply by the corresponding factor.\n\nNow, how to compute this sum?\n\nWe can split the T's into two ranges:\n\n1. T ranges from C + 1 to D: contribution is (T - C) * count(T)\n\n2. T ranges from D + 1 to T_max: contribution is (D - C + 1) * count(T)\n\nSo, we can compute these two parts separately.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the sum for these ranges.\n\nBut again, for each T in the range [C+1, T_max], we can compute count(T) as before, and then add to the respective part.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo putting it all together, the algorithm steps are:\n\n- Compute T_min = A + B, T_max = B + C.\n\n- For each T in [T_min, T_max], compute L = max(A, T - C), R = min(B, T - B). If L > R, then count(T) = 0. Else, count(T) = R - L + 1.\n\n- Then, for all T >= C + 1:\n\n   if T <= D:\n\n      add (T - C) * count(T) to the total.\n\n   else:\n\n      add (D - C + 1) * count(T) to the total.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nCompute T_min = A + B, T_max = B + C.\n\nfor T in T_min to T_max:\n\n   compute L = max(A, T - C)\n\n   compute R = min(B, T - B)\n\n   if L > R:\n\n       continue\n\n   count = R - L + 1\n\n   if T < C + 1:\n\n       continue\n\n   if T <= D:\n\n       total += (T - C) * count\n\n   else:\n\n       total += (D - C + 1) * count\n\nreturn total\n\nBut wait, what about T being in the range [C+1, D]?\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nBut what about the case when T - B is less than A? For example, T - B could be less than A, leading to R = min(B, T - B) being less than A, so L = max(A, ...) would be higher than R. So count is zero. Which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nT_min = 1 + 2 = 3. T_max = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo T ranges from 3 to 5.\n\nFor each T:\n\nT = 3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 3) = max(1, 0) = 1.\n\nR = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) = 1.\n\ncount = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.\n\nCheck T >= C + 1? C is 3. C + 1 is 4. T is 3 < 4 → no contribution.\n\nT=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4 - 3) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\nR = min(2, 4 - 2) = min(2, 2) = 2.\n\ncount = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nT is 4 >= 4 (C+1=4). Now, T is 4 <= D (4). So contribution is (4 - 3) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nT=5:\n\nL = max(1, 5-3) = max(1, 2) = 2.\n\nR = min(2, 5 - 2) = min(2, 3) = 2.\n\ncount = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.\n\nT is 5 >= 4. T is 5 <= D=4? No. So T is 5 > D. So contribution is (4 - 3 + 1) * 1 = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nSo total is 2 + 2 = 4. Which matches the first sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: '1 2 2 5' → Output is 3.\n\nLet's compute.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nT_min = 1+2=3. T_max = 2+2=4.\n\nFor T in 3, 4:\n\nT=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 2) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\nR = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) → 1. count is 1.\n\nCheck T >= C+1? C is 2. C+1=3. T=3 is equal. So yes.\n\nNow T=3. Is T <= D (5)? Yes. Contribution is (3 - 2) * 1 = 1*1=1.\n\nT=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4 - 2) = max(1, 2) = 2.\n\nR = min(2, 4 - 2) = min(2, 2) = 2. count is 1.\n\nT=4 >= 3. T is 4 <=5. Contribution is (4-2)*1 = 2*1=2. Total becomes 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nA=B=C=D=500000.\n\nT_min = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\nT_max = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\nSo T is 1e6.\n\nCompute L = max(500000, T - C) → T - C = 1e6 - 5e5 = 5e5. So L = 5e5.\n\nR = min(5e5, T - B) → T - B = 1e6 - 5e5 = 5e5. So R = 5e5. count = 1.\n\nCheck T >= C+1? C is 5e5, C+1 is 5e5 + 1. T is 1e6 = 5e5 * 2. So T is 1e6 >= 5e5 + 1 → yes.\n\nNow T is 1e6. D is 5e5. So T is larger than D. So contribution is (D - C +1) * count → (5e5 - 5e5 +1) * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python efficiently.\n\nBut the problem is that T can range up to B + C. For B and C up to 5e5 each, T_max can be up to 1e6. So looping from T_min to T_max is O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable in Python.\n\nBut what about when T_min is larger than T_max? Well, since A ≤ B and B ≤ C, T_min = A + B ≤ B + B ≤ B + C = T_max. So T_min is always <= T_max.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the code needs to read multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as four integers in the first line. But the sample input shows multiple lines, like ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', ...], but perhaps the actual input is one line per test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So the input is a single line per test case. However, looking at the sample input, the user provided three examples, but the actual input is probably multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'] — but that's probably the way the user presented the input as a list of test cases. However, the actual problem's input is one line per test case. Or maybe the input is multiple lines, each line being a test case. For example, in the sample input, the first line is the first test case, the second line is the second, etc.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is the first line containing four integers. So the code should read one line of input, split into four integers. But the sample shows multiple lines. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the sample input section, the user wrote:\n\nInput\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nOutput\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nBut that's probably just a way to show multiple test cases. However, the actual problem says that the input is four integers on the first line. So the code should read a single line of input, split into four integers. However, perhaps the problem allows multiple test cases, but the original problem's input is one line. But looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is the first line containing four integers. So the code should read one line, process it, and output one line.\n\nBut the sample shows multiple test cases, but perhaps that's part of the way the user presented the problem. So the code should process one test case per input line. However, the problem's note says that the input is four integers. So the code should read one line, split into four integers, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines. Maybe the original problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So perhaps the code should read one line of input. However, in the sample input, there are three lines. So perhaps the actual problem expects multiple test cases. But the problem statement is unclear. However, looking back at the original problem's note, the sample input is given as three lines, but the output is three lines. So the code should process multiple test cases, each given on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case. But the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. So the code should process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. This suggests that perhaps the problem is from a contest where multiple test cases are allowed, but the problem statement's input description is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code should read one line.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input shows that the user inputs three different test cases, and the outputs are three different answers. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the code should read one line. However, in the sample input, the user shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, and the code should process them all.\n\nBut this is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is '1 2 3 4', the second is '1 2 2 5', etc. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the result for each.\n\nBut how can we know? Well, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. But the sample shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where the code should read multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, it's possible that the input is a single test case, but the sample shows multiple.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the user provided three test cases. So the code should read multiple lines. However, the original problem may have different input specifications. But since the user provided the sample input as multiple lines, perhaps the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo that implies that there is only one test case. But the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that the user is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code should process one line.\n\nBut the original problem's note says that the sample input has three test cases. Therefore, the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous. But given that the sample shows multiple lines, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, and process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces or similar, where the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is four integers. But perhaps the original problem is from a contest where the code must read multiple test cases. For example, the sample input shows three lines, each with four integers, and the output is three lines.\n\nSo in the code, we should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, it says that the first line contains four integers. Which would imply that there is only one test case. However, the sample shows multiple lines. This is conflicting. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving the problem, perhaps the code should read one line of input. However, given that the sample shows multiple lines, perhaps the code should read all lines.\n\nBut the problem's note says that the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nOutput:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process the four integers.\n\nBut in practice, in programming contests, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. So the code should read all lines from stdin, split each into four integers, and process each.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process the four integers.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, split each line into four integers, and process each.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute the answer and print it.\n\nBut for the sample input, the code would process three lines and output three answers.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nNow, the code for each test case is:\n\ndef compute(A, B, C, D):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    T_min = A + B\n\n    T_max = B + C\n\n    for T in range(T_min, T_max + 1):\n\n        # compute L and R\n\n        L = max(A, T - C)\n\n        R = min(B, T - B)\n\n        if L > R:\n\n            continue\n\n        count = R - L + 1\n\n        if T < (C + 1):\n\n            continue\n\n        if T <= D:\n\n            contribution = (T - C) * count\n\n        else:\n\n            contribution = (D - C + 1) * count\n\n        total += contribution\n\n    return total\n\nBut wait, for T_max, the code loops from T_min to T_max inclusive. Because in Python, range is exclusive on the upper end, but in the code, the for loop is written as range(T_min, T_max + 1).\n\nYes.\n\nBut for large values of T_max, say 1e6, this loop is O(1e6) steps. Which is acceptable for Python, given that 1e6 steps are manageable.\n\nBut what if A and B are 5e5, and C is 5e5, then T_min = 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6, T_max is 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the loop runs once.\n\nBut for the worst case, when B and C are 5e5, T_max is 1e6. So for T_min = A + B. For example, if A is 1 and B is 5e5, then T_min is 1 + 5e5 = 500001. T_max is 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the loop runs 1e6 - 500001 + 1 = 500,000 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is efficient enough.\n\nBut let's think about the time complexity. The maximum possible T_max is B + C. Since B and C can be up to 5e5, T_max can be up to 1e6. So the loop is O(1e6) steps per test case. For multiple test cases, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut what about when T_min exceeds T_max? Well, since A ≤ B and B ≤ C, T_min is A + B ≤ B + B ≤ B + C = T_max. So T_min is always ≤ T_max.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nLoop T from 3 to 5.\n\nAs discussed earlier, returns 4.\n\nSample 2:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nT ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nT=3: contribution is 1.\n\nT=4: contribution is 2. Total 3.\n\nSample 3:\n\nA=B=C=D=5e5.\n\nT ranges from 1e6 to 1e6.\n\nT=1e6.\n\nL = max(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) = max(5e5, 5e5) → 5e5.\n\nR = min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → min(5e5, 5e5) → 5e5. count is 1.\n\nT >= C+1 → C is 5e5, C+1 is 5e5 + 1. T is 1e6 >= that. T is 1e6 > D (5e5). So contribution is (5e5 - 5e5 + 1) * 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where C + 1 is larger than T_max. For example, A=1, B=1, C=3, D=5. Then T_min is 2, T_max is 1+3=4. C+1 is 4. So T ranges from 2 to 4. Only T=4 is >= C+1 (4). For T=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4 - 3) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\nR = min(1, 4 - 1) → min(1, 3) = 1. count is 1.\n\nT=4 is <= D (5). Contribution is (4-3)*1 = 1. So total is 1.\n\nBut what are the possible triangles?\n\nx can be 1 (A=1, B=1). y can be 3 (since B=1, C=3. So y ranges from 1 to 3. Wait, the constraints are B ≤ y ≤ C. So y is between B and C. Here B is 1 and C is 3. So y can be 1, 2, 3. But in the code, for T=4, which is x + y = 4. x is 1, so y is 3. So (x=1, y=3). Then z must be >= C=3, <= D=5. Also, z < x + y = 4. So z can be 3. So one option. So the code returns 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when D is smaller than C. But according to the input constraints, C ≤ D. So D can't be smaller than C. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother case: when D is exactly equal to C. So for example, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3. Then for T >= C+1 =4. T ranges from 3 to 5 (assuming B=2, C=3, T_max=2+3=5). For T=4 and 5.\n\nFor T=4:\n\ncontribution is (4 - 3) * count(T) → 1 * count.\n\nFor T=5: since D=3, T=5 > D. So contribution is (3-3 +1)*count(T) → 1 * count(T).\n\nBut z must be between C=3 and D=3. So z can be 3. So for x + y > z → x + y > 3. So for T = x + y, which is 4 or 5, then z can be 3. So for T=4, x + y =4>3 → z can be 3. So the count for T is added as 1 * count(T).\n\nBut in this scenario, the code would calculate correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: when x and y are such that x + y is exactly C. Then T = C. Since T needs to be >= C+1, it is not counted. So no contribution.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut for very large values of T_max (up to 1e6), the code may take some time. However, given that 1e6 iterations are manageable in Python, even for multiple test cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead each line from stdin, split into A, B, C, D.\n\nFor each, compute the total as per the above.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total = 0\n        T_min = A + B\n        T_max = B + C\n        for T in range(T_min, T_max + 1):\n            L = max(A, T - C)\n            R = min(B, T - B)\n            if L > R:\n                continue\n            count = R - L + 1\n            if T < (C + 1):\n                continue\n            if T <= D:\n                contribution = (T - C) * count\n            else:\n                contribution = (D - C + 1) * count\n            total += contribution\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 2, the code returns 3. Let's see.\n\nSample input 2: 1 2 2 5.\n\nT_min = 1 + 2 = 3. T_max = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nLoop T=3 and 4.\n\nFor T=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 2) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\nR = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) → 1. count is 1.\n\nT is 3 >= C+1 (C is 2, C+1 is 3). So yes.\n\nT is 3 <= D (5). Contribution is (3 - 2) * 1 = 1.\n\nFor T=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4 - 2) = max(1, 2) = 2.\n\nR = min(2, 4 - 2) = min(2, 2) = 2. count is 1.\n\nT=4 >= 3. T is 4 <=5. contribution is (4-2)*1 = 2. Total is 1+2=3. Correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother edge case: when A=B=C=D=1. Then T_min is 2, T_max is 2. T=",
