The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. \n\nWait, but for each even chest, we need an odd key. And each odd chest needs an even key. So the maximum possible is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nOh right! Because each even chest can be matched with an odd key, but only up to the number of available keys. Similarly for the other way around. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Let's say even_chest = count of a_i even, odd_chest = count of a_i odd.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   - even_key = count of b_j even, odd_key = count of b_j odd.\n3. The answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each even chest can take an odd key, and each odd chest can take an even key. But the keys can't be reused, so the total is the sum of those two minima.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chest is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chest is 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7).\n\nSo min(even_chest=3, odd_key=1) → 1. min(odd_chest=2, even_key=3) → 2. Total 3, which matches the sample output. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\n\nKeys: 5 → odd. So odd_key=1, even_key=0.\n\nSo min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 → all even. So even_chest is 1, odd_key is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other term is min(0, 4) → 0. So total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic works. So the code needs to compute these counts.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. Count even and odd.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Count even and odd.\n\nCompute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes. Now, code-wise:\n\nIn Python, for each list, we can loop through the elements and check if they are even or odd. For example, for the a list:\n\neven_chest = 0\nfor num in a_list:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest +=1\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\nSame for the keys.\n\nBut since n and m can be up to 1e5, this is O(n + m) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute even_chest, odd_chest, even_key, odd_key.\n\nCalculate the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nPrint that answer.\n\nSo that's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All chests even, all keys even. Then answer is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: All chests odd, all keys odd. Answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: chests have 1 even, 1 odd. Keys have 1 even, 1 odd. Then answer is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: chests even count is 2, keys odd count is 3. Then min(2,3) is 2. Then add whatever from the other side.\n\nSo code seems solid.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, how to read the input? The input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as per the sample. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nSample input is given as:\n\nThe first line is ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50'] ?\n\nWait, no. Wait the user provided the input as a list of strings. Wait, perhaps the original problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, but in the actual programming problem, the input is per test case. Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_i.\n\nThe third line contains m integers b_j.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different cases, each with their own input. So perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases, but in the actual programming problem, each test case is processed separately. However, the code needs to read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is typically one test case per run. Wait, but the sample input shows three different test cases, but the output is three lines. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But the original problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input is given as per the problem's input format.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then the second line has the a_i, third line has the b_j. So the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows three different test cases. But that's probably because the user is showing multiple examples. So in the actual programming problem, the code should read one test case, not multiple.\n\nWait, the original problem's sample input shows three different inputs, but the output is three lines. But in the actual programming problem, the code is supposed to read a single test case. So perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases in the sample input, but the code is supposed to handle a single test case.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. So for the code, the input is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nRead the next line as the list of b_j.\n\nSo the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. However, in the problem statement, the sample input is written as a list of three separate inputs. But that's perhaps for the purpose of the example. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nOutput:\n\n['3', '1', '0']\n\nBut that's perhaps the way the user presented the sample input and output. However, in reality, the code should read from standard input, which for each test case is three lines. So in the actual code, the code should read the first line as n and m, then the next line as a list of n numbers, then the next line as a list of m numbers.\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. Therefore, the code should read from stdin as follows.\n\nIn Python, the code can read the input lines via input() function. However, sometimes, for multiple lines, it's better to read all at once. But for the problem, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nRead the second line as a list of integers.\n\nRead the third line as a list of integers.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute even_chest, odd_chest, etc.\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read correctly. For example, in the first sample input, after splitting the first line, n=5, m=4. Then the second line is 9 14 6 2 11. Third line is 8 4 7 20.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, implement the counts.\n\nSo:\n\neven_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest +=1\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_key +=1\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\neven_chest is 3 (14,6,2). odd_chest is 2 (9, 11).\n\neven_key is 3 (8,4,20). odd_key is 1 (7).\n\nmin(3,1) is 1. min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=5, m=1. a is [2,4,6,8,10]. even_chest is 5. odd_chest is 0.\n\nb is [5]. even_key is 0, odd_key is 1.\n\nans is min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThird sample: n=1, m=4. a is [10] (even). b is [20,30,40,50] (all even). even_key is 4, odd_key is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about when the input is read correctly? For example, when the input lines are split properly. For example, when the input is read via input().split(), but the code may have leading or trailing spaces. But in Python, the split() method handles that.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead a list of n numbers.\n\nRead a list of m numbers.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest += 1\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_key += 1\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n\nYes. That should do it.\n\nNow, check for edge cases.\n\nCase where n=1, m=1. a is [1], b is [2]. Then a is odd, b is even. So min(1, 1) (since even_key is 1, odd_key is 0. Wait:\n\nWait, a is [1], odd_chest is 1. even_chest is 0.\n\nb is [2], even_key is 1, odd_key is 0.\n\nSo min(0, 0) + min(1, 1) → 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a is [1], b is [1]. Then sum is 2, even. So no. So answer is 0. Which the code gives: even_chest is 0, odd_chest is 1. even_key is 0, odd_key is 1. min(0, 1) is 0. min(1,0) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a has 2 even and 3 odd. Keys have 3 even and 2 odd. So min(2, 2) is 2, min(3,3) is 3. Total 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This translates to checking the parity (even or odd) of the numbers on the chests and keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers. Similarly, count how many keys have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n2. **Match Parities**: \n   - An even-numbered chest can be opened by an odd-numbered key.\n   - An odd-numbered chest can be opened by an even-numbered key.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Openings**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys plus the minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest += 1\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_key += 1\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests (`n`), number of keys (`m`), the list of chest numbers (`a`), and the list of key numbers (`b`).\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We iterate through the list of chest numbers and count how many are even (`even_chest`) and how many are odd (`odd_chest`). Similarly, we count even and odd keys.\n3. **Determine Maximum Openings**: Using the counts of even and odd chests and keys, we compute the maximum possible matches. The result is the sum of two minimum values: the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers, ensuring an optimal solution with linear time complexity.",
