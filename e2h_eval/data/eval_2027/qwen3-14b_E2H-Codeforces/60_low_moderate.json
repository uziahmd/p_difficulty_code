Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$)Â â€” the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code after each modification. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. So, each time we add a 0 or 1 to the string S, we need to compute how many valid Morse code substrings there are. But the key is that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4) corresponds to a letter except four specific ones. So, for any substring of S that is of length between 1 and 4, we need to check if it's one of the valid ones. And then count all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting the substrings into valid Morse codes.\n\nWait, no. Wait. The problem says: find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So, for example, if a substring is \"11\", that could be a single letter (like M), or part of a longer sequence. But the question is about all possible ways to split the substrings into valid Morse code letters. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each sequence of letters is represented by some substring. So for example, if a substring is \"11\", then that could represent the letter M (if \"11\" is valid). Also, if the substring is longer, like \"111\", then there are multiple ways to split it into valid letters. For instance, \"1\" followed by \"11\" (T and M), or \"11\" followed by \"1\" (M and T), or \"111\" as a single letter (O). Each of these splits would correspond to different sequences of letters. However, the problem says that the count is the number of such sequences. \n\nSo the task is not just to count the number of valid Morse code substrings (each of which represents a letter), but to count all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code representations. \n\nBut how do we model this? Because for each possible substring of S, we need to consider all possible ways to split it into valid Morse code letters. Then, each split corresponds to a sequence of letters. However, each such split is considered as a separate sequence. \n\nFor example, take the sample input where S is \"111\". The substrings are:\n\n- All substrings of length 1: \"1\", \"1\", \"1\". Each is valid. So each contributes 1 sequence (the single letter).\n\n- Substrings of length 2: \"11\", \"11\". Each is valid, contributing 1 sequence each. Also, for each of these substrings, there's the possibility of splitting into two letters? No, because each substring is of length 2, which is a single valid code. So each of those contributes 1 sequence.\n\n- Substrings of length 3: \"111\". This can be split in three ways: as a single letter (O), or as \"1\" + \"11\" (T and M), or \"11\" + \"1\" (M and T). So that's 3 sequences.\n\nAdditionally, there are other substrings. For example, the substring \"11\" (positions 1-2) can be split as a single letter, contributing 1 sequence. Similarly for the other substrings.\n\nBut the total count in the sample was 7. Let's see how that comes about. According to the note, the answer after three 1s is 7. The explanation lists 7 sequences. So how does that sum up?\n\nThe sample counts all possible sequences that can be formed from any substring. For example, the first step when S is \"1\" (after first modification), the answer is 1. That's just the single letter.\n\nAfter the second modification, S is \"11\". Now, the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (twice, but each contributes 1 sequence)\n- \"11\" (contributes 1 sequence)\n- Also, the substring \"11\" can be split as a single letter, but the two individual \"1\"s are also present. So total sequences are 2 (from single letters) + 1 (from the two-letter substring) = 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird modification, S is \"111\". The substrings are:\n\nAll substrings of length 1: 3, contributing 3 sequences.\n\nSubstrings of length 2: two of them, each contributing 1. So 2.\n\nSubstring of length 3: contributes 3 sequences (as explained earlier).\n\nAlso, there are substrings of length 3 that are split into parts. Wait, but each substring is considered once. For example, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code after each modification. The key challenge is efficiently tracking valid Morse code substrings and their contributions to the total count of sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: First, identify which Morse code strings (of lengths 1 to 4) are valid. We exclude the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string `S`.\n3. **Prefix Tracking**: Maintain a dictionary to track the counts of valid Morse code substrings ending at each position. This helps in efficiently updating the DP array as the string grows.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, use modulo $10^9 + 7$ to keep numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    S = []\n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # dp[i] will store the number of valid sequences ending at position i-1\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    prefix_counts = {}\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(c)\n        current = ''.join(S)\n        \n        # Update dp[i]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]  # carry over previous count\n        \n        # Check all possible substrings ending at position i-1\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l >= 0:\n                substr = current[-l:]\n                if substr not in invalid and len(substr) <= 4:\n                    # Add the number of ways to form sequences ending at i-l\n                    # If substr is valid, add 1 (single letter) and any sequences before\n                    # that can be combined with this new letter\n                    if l == 1:\n                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD\n                    else:\n                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - l] + 1) % MOD\n        \n        # Also, check for all possible substrings that end at current position\n        # but this is already handled by the above loop\n        print(dp[i] % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, with each line representing either a '0' or '1' appended to the string `S`.\n2. **Invalid Morse Codes**: A set of invalid Morse code strings is pre-defined to quickly check validity.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: The `dp` array tracks the number of valid sequences ending at each position. This is updated iteratively as each character is added to `S`.\n4. **Substring Checks**: For each new character added to `S`, we check all possible substrings ending at the current position. If a substring is valid, it contributes to the count of valid sequences, either as a single letter or as part of a longer sequence.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Ensures that the numbers remain within the bounds of typical integer limits, preventing overflow and meeting the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the dynamic nature of the string `S` and ensures that each update is processed in constant time relative to the length of the string, making it suitable for large inputs up to 3000 operations.",
