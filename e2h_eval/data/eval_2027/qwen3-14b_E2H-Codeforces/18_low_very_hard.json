The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nThe frog starts at position 0. It can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't jump outside the interval [0, x] when calculating f(x). So f(x) is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach, considering that during any jump, it can't go beyond 0 or x. And we have to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to find this sum efficiently, especially since m can be up to 1e9. So brute force approaches are out of the question. We need a mathematical formula or pattern here.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can move in both directions, but with constraints on the positions it can land on. Let's first consider the case where there are no constraints (i.e., x is very large). What positions can the frog reach?\n\nThe frog starts at 0. Each jump adds a or subtracts b. So the positions reachable are those that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. Wait, but since the frog can do multiple jumps, maybe it's more complicated. However, perhaps the key is to find all positions that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b). Because the frog can reach positions that are linear combinations of a and b, but since it can only add a or subtract b, the positions must be in the form of multiples of the gcd.\n\nBut wait, the frog can only move forward by a or backward by b. So the problem might be similar to the classic problem of finding reachable positions with steps of a and -b. Let's think about the possible positions.\n\nLet me think of the problem without the constraints. The frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b, but with coefficients that are non-negative for a and non-negative for b? No, because each jump is either adding a or subtracting b. So the total displacement is (number of +a jumps)*a - (number of -b jumps)*b. So the displacement can be written as (k*a - l*b), where k and l are non-negative integers. However, the frog can take any sequence of jumps. So the set of positions reachable is all numbers that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers.\n\nBut since the frog can move back and forth, perhaps the set of reachable positions is all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is gcd(a,b), and also satisfy some other conditions. For example, if a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of 1 (i.e., any integer), but only if they can reach it through some combination of a and b steps.\n\nWait, but for example, if a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. Then the frog can reach positions like 5, 5-3=2, 5+5=10, 10-3=7, etc. But can it reach every positive integer? Probably not. For example, can it reach 1? Let's see. Suppose the frog jumps +a once (5), then subtracts b three times: 5-3*3 = -4, which is invalid. But the frog can't make jumps that take it below 0. So maybe the reachable positions depend on the constraints of the problem.\n\nThis seems complicated. However, in our problem, the frog can only jump within the interval [0, x]. So for each x, the frog's movement is constrained. Therefore, the positions that can be reached are those that can be achieved via some combination of jumps, but never stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the problem for a general x. The frog can reach positions that are reachable via some path of jumps, staying within [0, x].\n\nBut given that x can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to compute f(x) for all x up to m, and sum them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each x, the number of positions reachable, and find a pattern or formula that allows us to compute the sum quickly.\n\nLet me think about the sample input:\n\nFirst example: m=7, a=5, b=3. The output is 19.\n\nIn the note, f(5) is 3, which suggests that when x is 5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 2 (since 5-3=2). Then for x=6, the frog can reach 0,5,2, and maybe 5+5=10 (but x is 6, so 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line given certain jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values over a range. The challenge lies in efficiently computing this for very large ranges up to $10^9$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either `a` steps forward or `b` steps backward. The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are linear combinations of `a` and `b` with non-negative coefficients.\n2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The positions reachable by the frog must be multiples of the GCD of `a` and `b`. This is because any linear combination of `a` and `b` will be a multiple of their GCD.\n3. **Handling Constraints**: The frog cannot jump outside the interval `[0, x]`. Thus, for each `x`, we need to count how many such positions fall within this interval.\n4. **Efficient Summation**: Given the constraints on input size, we need an efficient way to compute the sum without iterating through each value up to `m`. This involves leveraging mathematical properties and periodic patterns in the reachable positions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    if a == 0 and b == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a //= d\n    b //= d\n\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        print((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2)\n        return\n\n    if a == b:\n        print((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2)\n        return\n\n    if a < b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    max_pos = m\n    total = 0\n\n    # For each residue mod a, find the minimal position that can be reached\n    # and then calculate how many times this residue appears in [0, m]\n    # We can use BFS to find all reachable positions within [0, a*b] (since beyond that, it's periodic)\n    from collections import deque\n\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append(0)\n    visited.add(0)\n\n    while queue:\n        pos = queue.popleft()\n        for delta in [a, -b]:\n            next_pos = pos + delta\n            if 0 <= next_pos <= a * b and next_pos not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                queue.append(next_pos)\n\n    # Now, for each residue mod a, collect all positions in visited\n    residues = [0] * a\n    for pos in visited:\n        residues[pos % a] = 1\n\n    # Now, for each residue r where residues[r] == 1, find the minimal x such that x â‰¡ r mod a and x >=0\n    # Then, the number of positions in [0, m] congruent to r mod a is floor((m - r)/a) + 1 if r <= m else 0\n    # But we also need to check that the position is reachable (i.e., exists in the visited set)\n\n    # Precompute for each residue r if it's reachable\n    # Then, for each r in 0..a-1, if reachable, compute the count of numbers in [0, m] congruent to r mod a\n    # Then multiply by the number of such positions (each contributes 1 to f(x) for x >= that position)\n\n    # However, since f(x) counts all positions reachable up to x, we need to find for each x, how many positions are <=x\n    # So the total sum over x=0 to m of f(x) is equal to the sum over all positions p of (m - p + 1) if p <= m\n\n    # Because each position p contributes 1 to f(x) for every x >= p.

Positions are checked modulo this GCD.\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Used to explore all reachable positions within a bounded range (`a*b`) to determine which residues modulo `a` are reachable.\n3. **Summation Optimization**: Instead of calculating `f(x)` for each `x` individually, we directly compute the contribution of each reachable position to the sum by considering how many times it is counted across all `x` values from 0 to `m`.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency even for very large values of `m` by leveraging mathematical properties and avoiding brute-force iteration.",
