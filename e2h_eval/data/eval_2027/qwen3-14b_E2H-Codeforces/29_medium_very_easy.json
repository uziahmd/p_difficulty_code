Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and a series of substitution queries. After processing all queries, I have to compute the number represented by the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. But how do I handle the substitutions efficiently, especially considering that the string can be very long and the number of queries is up to 1e5?\n\nFirst, let me think about the straightforward approach. If I process each query by replacing all occurrences of di in the string with ti, then for each query, I would have to scan the entire string and replace each occurrence. However, if the string is large (like 1e5 characters) and there are many queries, this approach would be O(n * m), where m is the length of the string. For example, if there are 1e5 queries, each taking O(1e5) time, that's 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo the straightforward approach isn't going to work here. We need a smarter way. Let me think about the substitutions. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But substitutions are done in order, so later substitutions can override earlier ones. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', then later replace '0' with '5', then the original '2's would become '00', and then each '0' becomes '5', so the original '2's would end up as '55'.\n\nBut how can I model this? Maybe instead of keeping track of the actual string, I can track for each digit what it expands to. Because when a substitution is applied, it's replacing all instances of a digit with some other string. However, since substitutions are processed in order, each substitution affects the current state of the digits. So, for example, if I have a mapping from digits to their expansions, and when a new substitution comes in, I need to update that mapping.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if a digit is replaced by another string that contains digits that may themselves be replaced later. So, for example, if I first replace '2' with '3', then replace '3' with '4', then the original '2's would become '4's. But if I first replace '3' with '4', then replace '2' with '3', then the original '2's would become '3's, which then become '4's. So the order of substitution matters. Therefore, the way to model this is to track for each digit, what it expands to, considering all substitutions that have been applied so far.\n\nBut how can I represent this? Let me think of it as a dynamic mapping. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a substitution is made, say di → ti, we need to update the mapping for di. However, when we replace di with ti, we need to consider that ti may contain digits that have their own mappings. Wait, no. Because the substitution is done in the order of queries. So when processing a query, the replacement is done immediately. So, for example, when a query comes in, we replace all instances of di in the current string with ti. But if ti contains digits that may be replaced in future queries, that's handled later. So, the key is that during the substitution steps, when we replace di with ti, we have to make sure that ti is stored as-is, and any future substitutions on digits in ti will affect those digits.\n\nBut how can we model the final expansion of the original string? Because each substitution is applied in sequence, and the replacements are done in the order of queries. So, perhaps we can model this using a data structure that keeps track of the expansion of each digit, such that when a substitution is made, we update the expansion for that digit. However, since substitutions can be applied multiple times, we need to ensure that each substitution overwrites the previous one for that digit.\n\nWait, but if we have a substitution for di, then when we process that query, all current instances of di in the string are replaced with ti. But if ti contains digits that are later replaced, then those replacements would be handled in subsequent queries. So, the problem is that the actual string is being transformed step by step, and each substitution replaces all current instances of a digit with the given ti.\n\nBut trying to model the entire string is not feasible for large input sizes. Therefore, we need a way to represent the transformations in a way that allows us to compute the final value without actually building the entire string.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose we can track, for each digit d, the value that it represents after all substitutions. However, since substitutions are applied in sequence, the way to model this is to track for each digit, what it expands to. For example, initially, each digit d maps to itself. When a substitution di → ti is processed, we need to update the mapping for di. However, the ti may contain digits that have their own mappings. So, when we process a substitution, we need to replace di's expansion with ti, but then, when we compute the expansion of di, we have to take into account the current mappings of the digits in ti.\n\nWait, but if we track for each digit, the expansion as a string, then when we substitute di with ti, we can just set di's expansion to ti. But when we need to compute the final value, we have to expand each digit in the original string according to the current mappings. However, this approach would require that when we process substitutions, we don't immediately expand the string, but instead track for each digit, what it's expanded to. Then, when we need to compute the final value, we can process the original string, expanding each character according to the current mappings.\n\nBut how does that work? Let me think with an example. Suppose the original string is \"123\", and the substitutions are:\n\n1. 2 → 00\n2. 0 → 5\n\nThen, the first substitution replaces 2 with 00. The original string becomes \"1003\". Then the second substitution replaces 0 with 5, leading to \"1553\".\n\nBut if we model the expansion mappings as follows: Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when the first substitution (2→00) is processed, the mapping for 2 becomes \"00\". Then, when the substitution 0→5 is processed, the mapping for 0 becomes \"5\". Now, when we process the original string \"123\", we need to expand each digit:\n\n- 1 → 1\n- 2 → 00 → which is now 0's expansion. But 0 is mapped to 5, so 00 would expand to 55.\n- 3 → 3.\n\nSo the final string would be 1 followed by 55 followed by 3 → \"1553\".\n\nSo, if we can model for each digit, the expansion as a string, but when we process substitutions, we can overwrite the expansion for a digit. However, when we need to compute the final value, we have to recursively expand each digit according to the current mappings. But how can we compute the final value efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that if we have a substitution that replaces a digit with a long string, and that string contains digits that are themselves replaced, then expanding the original string would require recursively expanding each digit. However, doing this naively for each character in the original string would take O(k) time per character, where k is the length of the expansion. But since the original string can be up to 1e5 characters, and the expansion could be exponential, this approach might not be feasible.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires us to compute the final number modulo 1e9+7. So, perhaps we can model the expansion not as strings, but as numbers modulo MOD, along with the length of the expansion. Because when we replace a digit with a string, the value of that expansion can be computed as a number mod MOD, and the length can be tracked as well. Because when you have a number represented by a string, the value mod MOD can be computed incrementally.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a digit 'd' that expands to a string S. The value of S mod MOD is val, and the length of S is len. Then, when this expansion is used in another expansion, say, replacing a digit with a string that includes this expansion, we can compute the contribution based on the val and len.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's say that for each digit d, we store two values: the value mod MOD that the expansion of d would contribute, and the length of the expansion (number of digits). This way, when we have a substitution that replaces d with a string t, we can compute the value and length of t, and store them for d. However, when t contains other digits, which may have their own expansions, we need to compute the value of t based on the current expansions of its digits.\n\nWait, but how can we compute the value of t when it's made up of other digits? For example, if t is \"a\" followed by \"b\", then the value of t is (value of a * 10^len(b) + value of b) mod MOD. Similarly, the length of t is len(a) + len(b).\n\nSo, if we can precompute for each digit d, the value and length of its expansion, then when a substitution comes in, we can compute the value and length of the new ti string, taking into account the current mappings of the digits in ti.\n\nBut how do we compute the value of ti when ti is a string that may contain digits which have their own expansions?\n\nAh! Here's the idea: whenever we process a substitution query di → ti, we need to compute the value of ti as a number mod MOD, considering that each digit in ti may be expanded. However, since the substitution is processed in order, the current mappings of the digits are already up to date. Therefore, when processing the substitution, we can compute the value and length of ti by expanding each character in ti using the current mappings.\n\nWait, but ti is a string that is being used as the replacement. So, for example, if ti is \"ab\", then the expansion of ti is the concatenation of the expansion of a and the expansion of b. Therefore, the value of ti is (value_a * 10^len_b + value_b) mod MOD, and the length is len_a + len_b.\n\nTherefore, for each substitution, when we need to replace di with ti, we can compute the value and length of ti by processing each character in ti, using the current mappings. Then, we can store for di the value and length of ti. This way, when we process the original string, we can compute the value by processing each character in the original string, and for each character, use the stored value and length.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's formalize this:\n\nWe'll maintain for each digit d (0-9) two values:\n\n- val[d]: the value of the expansion of d mod MOD.\n- len[d]: the length of the expansion of d.\n\nInitially, for each digit d, val[d] = d, len[d] = 1.\n\nWhen a substitution query comes in: di → ti.\n\nWe need to compute the value and length of ti, based on the current mappings. Let's process ti as follows:\n\nInitialize current_val = 0, current_len = 0.\n\nFor each character c in ti:\n\n   current_val = (current_val * 10 + val[c]) % MOD\n\n   current_len += len[c]\n\nWait, no. Because the value of ti is the concatenation of the expansions of each character in ti. For example, if ti is \"ab\", then the expansion of ti is (expansion of a) concatenated with (expansion of b). The value of this is (value_a * 10^len_b + value_b). So, to compute this, we can't just do current_val = (current_val * 10 + val[c]) because that would be equivalent to appending the value of c as a single digit. However, the expansion of c may have multiple digits, so when we append it, the existing value needs to be multiplied by 10^len(c) and then add the value of c.\n\nBut how can we compute that efficiently? Because for each character in ti, we need to compute the contribution of that character's expansion to the overall value.\n\nSo, for example, let's say we have a current value V and length L. Then, we process a new character c which has value v and length l. The new value is V * (10^l) + v, and the new length is L + l.\n\nTherefore, for each substitution, when we process ti, we need to compute the value and length of ti as follows:\n\nInitialize total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\nFor each character c in ti:\n\n   temp_val = val[c]\n\n   temp_len = len[c]\n\n   total_val = (total_val * pow(10, temp_len, MOD) + temp_val) % MOD\n\n   total_len += temp_len\n\nSo, this way, we can compute the value and length of ti based on the current mappings of the digits in ti.\n\nOnce we have this total_val and total_len for ti, we can set val[di] = total_val and len[di] = total_len.\n\nThis seems correct. Then, once all substitutions are processed, we can compute the value of the original string s by processing each character in s, and for each character c, we take its val[c] and len[c], and combine them in the same way as above.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize val and len arrays for digits 0-9.\n\n2. For each query, process the substitution by computing the new val and len for the digit being replaced.\n\n3. After processing all queries, process the original string s by combining the val and len of each character in s, using the same method as for ti.\n\nBut how do we compute the pow(10, temp_len, MOD) efficiently? Since temp_len can be up to something like 1e5 (since the sum of ti lengths is 1e5, and each substitution can have len up to that). However, for each step, when we process a character in ti, we need to compute 10^temp_len mod MOD. But temp_len is the len of the current character's expansion.\n\nBut how can we compute this quickly? Well, for each character in ti, we can compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) once. But since len[c] can be up to ... well, let's think. Initially, len[c] is 1. But after substitutions, len[c] can be larger. However, during substitution processing, for each character in ti, we need to calculate 10^len[c] mod MOD. So, for each substitution, during processing of ti, for each character in ti, we can compute this exponent.\n\nBut calculating pow(10, len[c], MOD) for each character in ti could be expensive if done naively. However, since len[c] can be up to ... well, let's see. Each substitution can increase the length. For example, if we replace a digit with a string of length k, then the len for that digit becomes k. Then, if another substitution replaces a digit with a string that includes that digit, the len could grow. However, for the problem constraints, the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is 1e5. So, during substitution processing, the total number of characters processed across all ti is 1e5. For each of these, we need to compute 10^len[c] mod MOD.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently? Well, we can precompute the powers of 10 mod MOD, but since len[c] can be up to ... let's think. For example, if we have a substitution that replaces a digit with a string of length 1e5, then len[c] would be 1e5. So, for each character in ti during substitution processing, the len[c] can be up to O(1e5). So, computing pow(10, len[c], MOD) each time would take O(log len[c)) time, which is acceptable for 1e5 operations.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute a power array, but since len[c] can be up to something like 1e5 * 1e5 (if substitutions are nested), but that's not feasible. So, perhaps the best approach is to compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) on the fly for each character in ti during substitution processing.\n\nBut in Python, pow(a, b, mod) is efficient even for large exponents.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize val and len arrays for each digit. Initially, val[d] = int(d), len[d] = 1.\n\n- For each query:\n\n   - Parse di and ti.\n\n   - Compute the value and length of ti, using the current val and len arrays for each character in ti.\n\n   - Update val[di] and len[di] to this computed value and length.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, process the original string s:\n\n- Initialize total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\n- For each character c in s:\n\n   - current_val = val[c]\n\n   - current_len = len[c]\n\n   - total_val = (total_val * pow(10, current_len, MOD) + current_val) % MOD\n\n   - total_len += current_len\n\nAt the end, if the total_len is zero (i.e., the original string was empty, but according to the problem statement, s has at least 1 character, so maybe not?), but according to the problem statement, the original string s is non-empty. However, substitutions can lead to an empty string. For example, if the original string is \"1\" and a substitution replaces '1' with empty string. Then, the final string is empty, which is considered as zero.\n\nSo, after processing the original string, if total_len is zero, then the answer is 0. Otherwise, the answer is total_val mod MOD.\n\nWait, but in the case where the original string is empty? According to the problem statement, the initial s has length between 1 and 1e5, so that's not possible. However, substitutions can lead to an empty string. For example, if the original string is \"1\" and a substitution replaces 1 with empty string. Then, the final string is empty. So, in this case, the value is zero.\n\nBut how does our code handle that? Because during processing the original string, for each character in s, we process it. If the original string is \"1\", and after substitution, val['1'] is 0, len['1'] is 0. Then, during processing the original string, for each character c in s:\n\ncurrent_val = val[c] = 0, current_len = 0.\n\ntotal_val is initially 0. Then, total_val = (0 * pow(10, 0) + 0) mod MOD = 0. total_len is 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nSo, after processing, the total_val is 0, and total_len is 0. So, the code would output 0, which is correct.\n\nBut in the case where the total_len is zero, the value is zero. Otherwise, the value is total_val. So, the code can just return total_val if total_len is not zero, else 0. However, since in the code, when total_len is zero, the total_val would also be zero. Because for example, if the string is empty, the code would not process any characters, and total_val would be zero. So, perhaps the code can just output total_val mod MOD regardless. Because even if the string is empty, the code would have total_val = 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, let's think: when processing the original string, if the string is empty, then the loop doesn't run, and total_val remains zero. Which is correct. If the string is non-empty, but substitutions have caused all characters to be replaced with empty strings, then during processing, each character in the original string contributes val[c] = 0 and len[c] = 0. So, for each character, the total_val is (total_val * 10^0 + 0) = total_val + 0. So, after processing all characters, total_val is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code can safely output total_val mod MOD.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic correctly.\n\nNow, the next thing is to handle the initial setup. For the digits 0-9, initially, val[d] = d, len[d] = 1.\n\nBut in Python, we can represent val and len as lists of size 10. For example:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nval = [0]*10\n\nlen_ = [0]*10\n\nfor d in range(10):\n\n    val[d] = d\n\n    len_[d] = 1\n\nBut for the initial setup, yes.\n\nThen, for each query, parse the query. Each query is of the form \"di->ti\". For example, \"2->00\" means di is '2', ti is '00'.\n\nSo, for each query, we need to split the string into di and ti. For example, splitting on '->' gives us the parts. So, for the query string, we can split on '->' into two parts. The first part is di (a single character), the second part is ti (could be empty).\n\nOnce we have di and ti, we need to compute the value and length of ti based on the current val and len arrays.\n\nSo, for ti, process each character in ti. For each character c in ti, get its current val[c] and len[c]. Then, compute the value and length of ti as follows:\n\nInitialize total_val_ti = 0, total_len_ti = 0.\n\nfor c in ti:\n\n    current_val_c = val[c]\n\n    current_len_c = len_[c]\n\n    total_val_ti = (total_val_ti * pow(10, current_len_c, MOD) + current_val_c) % MOD\n\n    total_len_ti += current_len_c\n\nOnce this is done, we set val[di_digit] = total_val_ti and len_[di_digit] = total_len_ti.\n\nBut wait, di is a character (like '2'), so we need to convert it to an integer. For example, di is '2', then di_digit is 2.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, then process the original string s.\n\nInitialize total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    current_val_c = val[int(c)]\n\n    current_len_c = len_[int(c)]\n\n    total_val = (total_val * pow(10, current_len_c, MOD) + current_val_c) % MOD\n\n    total_len += current_len_c\n\nFinally, print total_val % MOD.\n\nBut wait, in the case where total_len is zero, which implies that the entire string is empty. But according to the problem statement, the original s is non-empty, but substitutions can cause it to be empty. However, the code handles this correctly, because in that case, the total_val is zero.\n\nBut let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nOriginal s is '123123', n=1, query '2->00'\n\nProcessing the query:\n\nti is '00'. For each character in ti, which is '0' and '0'.\n\nInitially, val[0] is 0, len[0] is 1.\n\nProcessing first '0':\n\ntotal_val_ti starts at 0. current_val_c = 0, current_len_c = 1.\n\ntotal_val_ti = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. total_len_ti = 1.\n\nProcessing second '0':\n\ntotal_val_ti = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. total_len_ti = 2.\n\nSo, val[2] becomes 0, len[2] becomes 2.\n\nThen, processing the original string '123123'.\n\nEach character:\n\n1: val[1] is 1, len 1.\n\n2: val[2] is 0, len 2.\n\n3: val[3] is 3, len 1.\n\nSo processing the string:\n\nStart with total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\nFirst character '1':\n\ntotal_val = 0 * 10^1 + 1 = 1. total_len = 1.\n\nSecond character '2':\n\ncurrent_val_c = 0, current_len_c = 2.\n\ntotal_val = 1 * 10^2 + 0 = 100. total_len = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThird character '3':\n\ncurrent_val_c = 3, len 1.\n\ntotal_val = 100 * 10^1 +3 = 1000 +3 = 1003. total_len = 3 +1=4.\n\nFourth character '1' again:\n\ncurrent_val_c = 1, len 1. total_val = 1003 * 10^1 +1 = 10030 +1 = 10031. total_len 5.\n\nFifth character '2' again: same as before. total_val = 10031 * 10^2 + 0 = 10031 * 100 = 1003100. total_len 5+2=7.\n\nSixth character '3': total_val = 1003100 *10^1 +3 = 10031000 +3 = 10031003. total_len 8.\n\nWhich matches the first sample output of 10031003 mod MOD, which is 10031003. Since MOD is 1e9+7, which is larger than 10 million, the output is 10031003.\n\nAnother sample input is the third example:\n\nInput: '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'\n\nSo original string is '222', two queries: first replace 2 with 0, then replace 0 with 7.\n\nLet's process the queries:\n\nInitially, val[2] is 2, len[2] is 1.\n\nFirst query: 2 → '0'.\n\nProcessing ti '0', which is a single '0'. For this, current_val_c is val[0] = 0, len is 1. So total_val_ti is 0, len is 1. So val[2] becomes 0, len[2] becomes 1.\n\nSecond query: 0 → '7'. So ti is '7'. Processing this, for each character in ti (which is '7'):\n\ncurrent_val_c is val[7] =7, len is 1. So total_val_ti is 7, len is 1. So val[0] becomes 7, len[0] becomes 1.\n\nNow, processing original string '222':\n\nEach '2' has val[2] = 0, len 1. So processing each '2' in the string:\n\nFirst '2': total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. total_len = 1.\n\nSecond '2': total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. total_len = 2.\n\nThird '2': same, total_val is 0. total_len 3.\n\nBut wait, why is the sample output 777?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the third sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', ...]\n\nOriginal string is '222', n=2. Queries are:\n\nFirst query: 2 → 0.\n\nSecond query: 0 → 7.\n\nSo, after first query, when we process the original string, each '2' is replaced with '0', so the string becomes '000'. Then, the second query replaces '0's with '7's, so the string becomes '777'.\n\nBut according to our approach:\n\nAfter first query, val[2] is 0, len[2] is 1. Then, the second query is replacing 0 with '7'.\n\nSo, when processing the second query, ti is '7'. So for each character in ti (which is '7'), val[7] is 7, len[7] is 1. So total_val_ti is 7, len is 1. So val[0] is updated to 7, len[0] is 1.\n\nNow, when processing the original string '222', each '2' is processed as follows:\n\nFor each '2', val[2] is 0, len[2] is 1. So:\n\ntotal_val starts at 0.\n\nFirst '2' contributes 0. total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. total_len is 1.\n\nSecond '2' contributes 0. total_val = 0 * 10^1 +0 = 0. total_len 2.\n\nThird '2' contributes 0. total_val = 0 * 10^1 +0 = 0. total_len 3.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the result should be 777. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh no, I think I messed up the order of substitution processing. Let me re-examine the approach.\n\nIn the approach, when processing the substitution queries, each substitution is processed in order. So, the first substitution is 2 → 0. Then, the second substitution is 0 → 7. So, when we process the second substitution, we compute the value of ti (which is '7'), which is 7. So, val[0] is set to 7, len[0] is 1.\n\nBut when processing the original string, each '2' is mapped to val[2], which is 0. But 0's expansion is 7. However, the approach is that the val[2] is 0, which is the value of the expansion of 2. But that expansion is '0', which is replaced by 7 in the substitution. However, the code does not take into account that 0 is being replaced. Because when the substitution is processed, the val[2] is set to the value of ti (which is '0'), but the ti is processed based on the current mappings. So, during the first substitution, when ti is '0', which is processed as follows:\n\nti is '0', which is a single character. At the time of processing the first substitution, val[0] is 0, len[0] is 1. So, the value of ti is 0, len is 1. So, val[2] is set to 0, len[2] is 1.\n\nThen, when processing the second substitution, which is 0 → '7', the ti is '7', which is processed as follows: for each character in ti (which is '7'), val[7] is 7, len is 1. So, the value of ti is 7, len is 1. So, val[0] is set to 7, len[0] is 1.\n\nNow, when processing the original string '222', each '2' is mapped to val[2] = 0, len[2] = 1. So, the code would compute the value as 000, which is 0. But according to the sample, it should be 777. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh! Oh no! Because when the substitution is processed, the code is not updating the val and len for the digits that are being replaced. For example, when we process the first substitution (2 → 0), the code sets val[2] to the value of ti (which is 0), and len[2] to 1. But when the second substitution (0 → 7) is processed, the code updates val[0] to 7, len[0] to 1. However, the val[2] is still 0, which is the value of the expansion of '0' at the time of the first substitution. But now, after the second substitution, the expansion of '0' is '7', but the expansion of '2' is still '0', which is now replaced by '7'? No, no. The expansion of 2 is '0' (from the first substitution), which is a string that, when processed, would be replaced by 7 in the second substitution. However, the code does not automatically update the val[2] when substitutions for other digits happen. Because the val[2] is set to the value of ti (the '0') at the time of the substitution. But that ti's value was computed based on the current mappings. However, when later substitutions change the mappings of other digits, the val[2] is not automatically updated. Because val[2] was computed once, based on the ti at the time of substitution.\n\nWait, that's a critical mistake. Because when we process the first substitution, the ti is '0', and we compute its value as 0 (based on the current val and len for '0'). But then, when the substitution for '0' is processed, the val[0] changes. However, the val[2] is still 0, which is based on the old value of val[0]. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nOh no! That's a big problem. How can we handle this?\n\nThis suggests that the approach of storing for each digit its current value and length is incorrect. Because when a substitution replaces a digit di with ti, which depends on other digits, and then later substitutions change those other digits, the val[di] is not automatically updated.\n\nFor example, in the third sample, after the first substitution (2 → 0), the val[2] is 0, which represents the expansion of '0' at that time. But when the substitution for 0 is processed, the expansion of '0' changes, but the expansion of '2' is still based on the old expansion of '0'.\n\nThis is a critical flaw in the approach. Therefore, the previous reasoning is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to model this?\n\nThe problem is that when we replace a digit di with ti, the value of ti is computed based on the current mappings of the digits in ti. However, if those digits are later changed, the value of ti (and thus the value of di) should not be affected. Because the substitution for di was processed at a certain time, and the ti was fixed at that time.\n\nWait, no. The substitution is processed in sequence. For example, the first substitution replaces 2 with 0. Then, the second substitution replaces 0 with 7. So, the original 2's expansion is 0. But after the second substitution, the expansion of 0 is 7. Therefore, the original 2's expansion is now 0, which is replaced by 7? Or is the original 2's expansion still 0, but during the substitution steps, the expansion of 0 is changed, but the expansion of 2 was already fixed as 0?\n\nNo. Because the substitution steps are applied sequentially. The first substitution replaces all occurrences of 2 in the current string with 0. Then, the second substitution replaces all occurrences of 0 in the current string with 7. So, after the first substitution, the string is 000. Then, the second substitution replaces each 0 with 7, resulting in 777.\n\nBut according to the approach, the val[2] is 0, which represents the expansion of 2 as 0. But when we process the original string, which is 222, each 2 is replaced by 0, which is then replaced by 7. But the approach does not model this. It only models the expansion of 2 as 0, not taking into account that 0 is later replaced. So, the approach is missing this.\n\nThis indicates that the initial approach is wrong. Because the substitutions are applied in sequence to the string, not to the expansion mappings. So, when a substitution replaces a digit with a string, that string is processed immediately. But in the approach, the expansion of di is fixed once it is computed, and future substitutions on other digits don't affect it.\n\nBut in reality, substitutions are applied to the current string, which may have been modified by previous substitutions. So, for example, when we replace 2 with 0, and then replace 0 with 7, the 2's expansion is 0, which is then replaced by 7 in the second substitution. However, the approach does not model this, because the expansion of 2 is fixed as 0, and the expansion of 0 is fixed as 7. So, when processing the original string, the expansion of 2 is 0, which is then processed as 0, which is replaced by 7. But according to the approach, the expansion of 2 is 0, and the expansion of 0 is 7. So, during processing the original string, the expansion of 2 is 0, which is then processed as 0. But the code would not automatically expand the 0 further, because the code processes the original string once, expanding each character according to their current mappings.\n\nWait, no. The code processes the original string, and for each character in the original string, it expands it according to the current mappings. So, in the example, the original string is '222'. Each '2' is expanded to 0 (val[2] is 0, len is 1). So, during processing of the original string, the code would treat each '2' as contributing a value of 0 and length 1. Then, when combining these, the code would compute 000, which is 0. But the correct result is",

Initially, each digit maps to itself with length 1.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each substitution query, we compute the new value and length of the target digit by iterating through the replacement string and using the current mappings of each character in the replacement string.\n3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all queries, we compute the final value of the original string by iterating through each character and using the precomputed values and lengths for each digit. This avoids constructing the actual string and handles large numbers using modular arithmetic.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle substitutions and large numbers, adhering to the constraints and providing the correct result modulo $10^9 + 7$.",
