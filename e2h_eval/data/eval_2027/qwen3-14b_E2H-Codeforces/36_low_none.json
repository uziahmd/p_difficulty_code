The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully and understand what's required.\n\nSo, there are n+2 towns on a line from 0 to n+1. For towns 1 to n, each has a 50% chance of having a radio tower. After building these towers, we need to assign signal powers such that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nThe task is to compute the probability that such an assignment is possible, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. The key is to find all subsets of towns (from 1 to n) where there's a way to assign signal powers meeting those conditions, then multiply by (1/2)^n since each tower is built with probability 1/2.\n\nBut how do we model the valid subsets of towers?\n\nLet me think about the constraints for the signal setup.\n\nEach tower's signal power p must be chosen so that:\n\n- The tower at i with power p covers towns from i-p+1 to i+p-1 (since |c -i| < p implies c ranges from i-p+1 to i+p-1).\n\nBut the coverage must be such that:\n\n- Town 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower. So for any tower at position i, the signal power p must satisfy that i - p +1 > 0 (so that town 0 isn't covered) and i + p -1 < n+1. Wait, no. Because for town 0, the distance from tower i is |i - 0| = i. So for town 0 to not get any signal, the signal power of every tower must be less than or equal to i. Wait, no. The signal from a tower at i reaches towns c where |c - i| < p. So for town 0 to not be covered by tower i, we must have that |0 - i| >= p → i >= p. Similarly, for town n+1, the same applies: |(n+1) - i| >= p → (n+1 - i) >= p → p <= (n+1 - i).\n\nBut when choosing p for a tower, it's possible that the p can be set in a way that satisfies these constraints. However, the main problem is ensuring that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once.\n\nSo the question is, given a subset S of towns (1..n), can we assign p_i to each tower in S such that:\n\n- For each i in S, p_i is at least 1, and at most some value based on the positions of the towers.\n\nBut more importantly, the coverage of the towers must partition the towns 1..n into regions where each is covered exactly once.\n\nThis seems similar to certain tiling or interval covering problems. Let's think about how the towers must be arranged.\n\nAn important observation: For the coverage to be exactly one per town, the towers must be arranged in a way that their ranges don't overlap except at the edges. But perhaps even overlapping is allowed as long as each town is covered exactly once.\n\nBut how can that happen? For example, if two towers are adjacent and their ranges just touch. Like tower at i with p=1 and tower at i+1 with p=1. Then town i is covered by the first tower (since |i -i| <1 → 0 <1, yes), and town i+1 is covered by the second. But what about town i+1? Wait, the tower at i with p=1 covers up to i+0. So i is covered. The tower at i+1 with p=1 covers up to (i+1)+0 = i+1. So town i+1 is covered. But town i is only covered by the first tower, town i+1 by the second. So that's okay.\n\nBut another scenario: suppose there are two towers at positions i and j (j >i). Suppose their ranges overlap. For example, tower at i has p=2, which covers up to i+1. Tower at j has p=2, which covers down to j-1. If j is i+1, then their ranges would cover i-1 to i+1 and j-1 to j+1. But since j = i+1, the ranges would overlap between i and j. Then towns in that overlapping region would be covered by both towers, which is invalid.\n\nSo the arrangement of towers must be such that their coverage regions are non-overlapping and cover all towns exactly once.\n\nThis suggests that the towers must be placed in a way that they form a partition of the towns 1..n into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. How can this be achieved?\n\nAnother thought: For each tower, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building radio towers in towns 1 through n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: A valid configuration of towers must allow for a partition of towns 1 through n into intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower. This can be modeled using dynamic programming to count valid configurations efficiently.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid ways to place towers in the first `i` towns such that the coverage constraints are satisfied.\n3. **Transition**: For each position `i`, consider two cases:\n   - If there is no tower at position `i`, then the number of valid configurations is the same as `dp[i-1]`.\n   - If there is a tower at position `i`, then it must cover from `i` to some position `j` such that the previous segment ends before `i`. This leads to transitions involving previous states.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, use modular inverses to handle divisions and ensure all operations remain within the modulus.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (1..i)\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: no towns, one way (no towers)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i, so dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        # Case 2: tower at i. It must cover from i to some j >= i\n        # The tower at i must cover up to at least i, but not reach town 0 or n+1\n        # So the maximum possible p is min(i, n+1 - i)\n        # However, to ensure that the coverage does not overlap with previous towers\n        # We need that the previous tower ends before i\n        # So the previous tower must end at i-1 or earlier\n        # This suggests that the tower at i can cover from i to i + p - 1\n        # But for the coverage to start at i, the previous tower must end at i-1\n        # Therefore, the number of ways is dp[i-1] (since the previous part is valid)\n        # Wait, maybe we need to look back to some position j < i such that the tower at i covers from j+1 to i\n        # But how to model this?\n        # Alternative approach inspired by tiling problems:\n        # Let's think that if we place a tower at i, then it must cover from i to some position k, and the previous segment must end before i\n        # So, for the tower at i, it can cover from i to i + p - 1. To ensure that town 0 is not covered, p <= i\n        # To ensure that town n+1 is not covered, p <= n+1 - i\n        # But for our purposes, the tower at i can have any p such that the coverage starts at i and ends at some position, but ensuring that the previous coverage ends before i\n        # So, for the tower at i, the minimal coverage is p=1 (covers only i)\n        # Thus, the number of ways when placing a tower at i is dp[i-1] (since the previous part must be valid)\n        # Because placing a tower at i can be done by considering that the previous part was valid up to i-1, and then the current tower covers i\n        # Wait, but this would imply that the tower at i has p=1, covering only itself. That's one possibility.\n        # But what about larger p? Like covering i and i+1?\n        # Hmm, perhaps the DP approach needs to account for the fact that placing a tower at i can cover up to some point, but the rest of the coverage is handled by subsequent towers.\n        # However, given the complexity, perhaps the correct recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-1] / 2 ? No, that doesn't seem right.\n        # Let me refer to the example given in the problem statement.\n        # For n=2, the answer is 1/4. The valid configuration is both towers present.\n        # How does that fit into the DP?\n        # For i=1: dp[1] = dp[0] (no tower) + dp[0] (tower at 1). So dp[1] = 2.\n        # For i=2: dp[2] = dp[1] (no tower at 2) + dp[1] (tower at 2). So dp[2] = 4.\n        # But the valid configurations are those where both towers are present. Which is 1 out of 4 possible subsets. But according to this, dp[2] is 4, which counts all possibilities. But how to get the valid ones?\n        # Ah, I think my initial approach is incorrect. The DP should track the number of valid configurations, not all possible subsets.\n        # So, perhaps the DP[i] represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns, considering that the last tower ends at i.\n        # Alternatively, the recurrence might be similar to the tiling problem, where each configuration is a valid tiling of the towns.\n        # Let me think again.\n        # The problem is similar to the problem of tiling a 1xN grid with tiles of certain sizes. Here, each tower can be thought of as a tile that covers a certain range.\n        # However, the exact constraints make it complex. Another observation: the valid configurations are those where the towers form a set of intervals such that each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and the coverage does not reach town 0 or n+1.\n        # Let's consider that for a valid configuration, the towers must be placed in such a way that they can be arranged with their ranges not overlapping except at the edges, and covering exactly the towns 1..n.\n        # This resembles the problem of domino tiling or other tiling problems where each tile must be placed in a specific way.\n        # Let's consider that each tower must be responsible for a contiguous block of towns. For example, a tower at position i can be responsible for towns from a to b, where a ≤ i ≤ b, and the tower's power is chosen such that the coverage includes exactly these towns.\n        # For the tower to cover exactly from a to b, its power p must satisfy p > |i - a| and p > |i - b|. Also, the coverage must not extend beyond a and b.\n        # However, this seems too vague. Perhaps we can model the problem by considering that each tower must be placed such that it is the only one covering its position and the ones adjacent to it.\n        # Another approach: the valid configurations are those where the towers form a set such that between any two consecutive towers, there is exactly one tower covering the gap. This seems similar to the problem of placing towers such that they do not overlap and cover the entire range.\n        # Let's look for a pattern in small n values.\n        # For n=1:\n        # Possible subsets: {1} (probability 1/2). Can we set the power? The tower at 1 must have power 1 (covers town 1). Town 0 and 2 (n+1=2) are not covered. So yes. So the answer is 1/2.\n        # For n=2:\n        # Valid subsets are those where both towers are present. Because if only one tower is present, say at 1, then it must cover up to 2, but then town 2 is covered, but town 0 is not. However, the tower at 1 with power 2 would cover town 0 (since |0 - 1| < 2 → 1 < 2 → yes). So that's invalid. Similarly for tower at 2 with power 2. So the only valid subset is {1,2}, which gives answer 1/4.\n        # For n=3:\n        # According to the note, the answer is 1/4. But let's see. The valid configurations are:\n        # - All three towers. Set their power to 1. Then each covers their own town. Towns 0 and 4 are not covered.\n        # - Only the middle tower (2). Set power to 2. Covers towns 1,2,3. But then all towns are covered by one tower. Towns 0 and 4 are not covered. This is valid.\n        # So there are 2 valid subsets. Each has probability 1/8, total 2/8 = 1/4.\n        # So for n=3, the answer is 1/4.\n        # So the pattern seems to be that the number of valid subsets is 2^{n-1} / 2^n} = 1/2? No, for n=2 it's 1/4, for n=3 it's 1/4, for n=1 it's 1/2.\n        # Wait, but the answer for n=1 is 1/2, n=2 is 1/4, n=3 is 1/4, n=5 is 5/32 (from the note).\n        # Looking for a pattern, it seems that the number of valid subsets is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number, but scaled somehow.\n        # Alternatively, looking for a recurrence relation for the number of valid subsets. Let's denote f(n) as the number of valid subsets for size n.\n        # From the examples:\n        # f(1) = 1 (subset {1})\n        # f(2) = 1 (subset {1,2})\n        # f(3) = 2 (subsets {1,2,3} and {2})\n        # For n=4, what is f(4)? Let's think.\n        # Valid configurations could be:\n        # - {2,3}: Tower at 2 with p=2 (covers 1,2,3), tower at 3 with p=1 (covers 3). But town 3 is covered by both. Not valid.\n        # Wait, no. That's invalid. So what's a valid configuration?\n        # Maybe {2,4}: Tower at 2 with p=2 (covers 1,2,3), tower at 4 with p=1 (covers 4). Towns 0 and 5 are not covered. Towns 1-4 are covered once. That's valid. So subset {2,4} is valid.\n        # Or {1,3,4}: Tower at 1 with p=1, tower at 3 with p=2 (covers 2,3,4), but then town 3 is covered by both. Invalid.\n        # Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the number of valid ways to cover the first i towns.\n        # Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (positions 1..i). The recurrence can be derived as follows:\n        # - If there is no tower at position i, then dp[i] += dp[i-1].\n        # - If there is a tower at position i, then it must cover from some position j+1 to i. To ensure that the previous coverage ends at j, we can consider that the tower at i covers from i-k+1 to i, where k is the power. But to simplify, we can consider that the tower at i must cover exactly the town i, and possibly more, but ensuring that the previous part is valid.\n        # This seems similar to the tiling problem where we can either place a tile of length 1 (just the current town) or longer, but ensuring that the previous part is properly tiled.\n        # However, given the complexity, another approach is to realize that the valid configurations are those where the towers form a set where each tower is either alone (covering its own town) or paired with adjacent towers in a way that their coverage doesn't overlap.\n        # Based on the examples, the recurrence seems to be dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2], which is the Fibonacci sequence. For example:\n        # dp[1] = 1\n        # dp[2] = 1\n        # dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 2\n        # dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 3\n        # dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] = 5\n        # For n=5, the number of valid subsets is 5. The total number of possible subsets is 2^5 = 32. So the probability is 5/32, which matches the note.\n        # This seems promising. So the number of valid subsets for n is the (n)th Fibonacci number, but shifted.\n        # Let's check:\n        # For n=1: dp[1] = 1 → 1/2 → correct.\n        # For n=2: dp[2] = 1 → 1/4 → correct.\n        # For n=3: dp[3] = 2 → 2/8 = 1/4 → correct.\n        # For n=5: dp[5] = 5 → 5/32 → correct.\n        # So the pattern is dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2], with dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 1.\n        # So the number of valid subsets is the (n)th Fibonacci number, starting from dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 1.\n        # Therefore, the answer is (fib(n) / 2^n) mod MOD.\n        # Now, we need to compute fib(n) where fib(1) = 1, fib(2) = 1, fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).\n        # So, the steps are:\n        # 1.

The DP should track the number of valid configurations, not all possible subsets.\n        # So, perhaps the DP[i] represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns, considering that the last tower ends at i.\n        # Alternatively, the recurrence might be similar to the tiling problem, where each configuration is a valid tiling of the towns.\n        # Let me think again.\n        # The problem is similar to the problem of tiling a 1xN grid with tiles of certain sizes. Here, each tower can be thought of as a tile that covers a certain range.\n        # However, the exact constraints make it complex. Another observation: the valid configurations are those where the towers form a set of intervals such that each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and the coverage does not reach town 0 or n+1.\n        # Let's consider that for a valid configuration, the towers must be placed in such a way that they can be arranged with their ranges not overlapping except at the edges, and covering exactly the towns 1..n.\n        # This resembles the problem of domino tiling or other tiling problems where each tile must be placed in a specific way.\n        # Let's consider that each tower must be responsible for a contiguous block of towns. For example, a tower at position i can be responsible for towns from a to b, where a ≤ i ≤ b, and the tower's power is chosen such that the coverage includes exactly these towns.\n        # For the tower to cover exactly from a to b, its power p must satisfy p > |i - a| and p > |i - b|. Also, the coverage must not extend beyond a and b.\n        # However, this seems too vague. Perhaps we can model the problem by considering that each tower must be placed such that it is the only one covering its position and the ones adjacent to it.\n        # Another approach: the valid configurations are those where the towers form a set such that between any two consecutive towers, there is exactly one tower covering the gap. This seems similar to the problem of placing towers such that they do not overlap and cover the entire range.\n        # Let's look for a pattern in small n values.\n        # For n=1:\n        # Possible subsets: {1} (probability 1/2). Can we set the power? The tower at 1 must have power 1 (covers town 1). Town 0 and 2 (n+1=2) are not covered. So yes. So the answer is 1/2.\n        # For n=2:\n        # Valid subsets are those where both towers are present. Because if only one tower is present, say at 1, then it must cover up to 2, but then town 2 is covered, but town 0 is not. However, the tower at 1 with power 2 would cover town 0 (since |0 - 1| < 2 → 1 < 2 → yes). So that's invalid. Similarly for tower at 2 with power 2. So the only valid subset is {1,2}, which gives answer 1/4.\n        # For n=3:\n        # According to the note, the answer is 1/4. But let's see. The valid configurations are:\n        # - All three towers. Set their power to 1. Then each covers their own town. Towns 0 and 4 are not covered.\n        # - Only the middle tower (2). Set power to 2. Covers towns 1,2,3. But then all towns are covered by one tower. Towns 0 and 4 are not covered. This is valid.\n        # So there are 2 valid subsets. Each has probability 1/8, total 2/8 = 1/4.\n        # So for n=3, the answer is 1/4.\n        # So the pattern seems to be that the number of valid subsets is 2^{n-1} / 2^n} = 1/2? No, for n=2 it's 1/4, for n=3 it's 1/4, for n=1 it's 1/2.\n        # Wait, but the answer for n=1 is 1/2, n=2 is 1/4, n=3 is 1/4, n=5 is 5/32 (from the note).\n        # Looking for a pattern, it seems that the number of valid subsets is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number, but scaled somehow.\n        # Alternatively, looking for a recurrence relation for the number of valid subsets. Let's denote f(n) as the number of valid subsets for size n.\n        # From the examples:\n        # f(1) = 1 (subset {1})\n        # f(2) = 1 (subset {1,2})\n        # f(3) = 2 (subsets {1,2,3} and {2})\n        # For n=4, what is f(4)? Let's think.\n        # Valid configurations could be:\n        # - {2,3}: Tower at 2 with p=2 (covers 1,2,3), tower at 3 with p=1 (covers 3). But town 3 is covered by both. Not valid.\n        # Wait, no. That's invalid. So what's a valid configuration?\n        # Maybe {2,4}: Tower at 2 with p=2 (covers 1,2,3), tower at 4 with p=1 (covers 4). Towns 0 and 5 are not covered. Towns 1-4 are covered once. That's valid. So subset {2,4} is valid.\n        # Or {1,3,4}: Tower at 1 with p=1, tower at 3 with p=2 (covers 2,3,4), but then town 3 is covered by both. Invalid.\n        # Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the number of valid ways to cover the first i towns.\n        # Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (positions 1..i). The recurrence can be derived as follows:\n        # - If there is no tower at position i, then dp[i] += dp[i-1].\n        # - If there is a tower at position i, then it must cover from some position j+1 to i. To ensure that the previous coverage ends at j, we can consider that the tower at i covers from i-k+1 to i, where k is the power. But to simplify, we can consider that the tower at i must cover exactly the town i, and possibly more, but ensuring that the previous part is valid.\n        # This seems similar to the tiling problem where we can either place a tile of length 1 (just the current town) or longer, but ensuring that the previous part is properly tiled.\n        # However, given the complexity, another approach is to realize that the valid configurations are those where the towers form a set where each tower is either alone (covering its own town) or paired with adjacent towers in a way that their coverage doesn't overlap.\n        # Based on the examples, the recurrence seems to be dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2], which is the Fibonacci sequence. For example:\n        # dp[1] = 1\n        # dp[2] = 1\n        # dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 2\n        # dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 3\n        # dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] = 5\n        # For n=5, the number of valid subsets is 5. The total number of possible subsets is 2^5 = 32. So the probability is 5/32, which matches the note.\n        # This seems promising. So the number of valid subsets for n is the (n)th Fibonacci number, but shifted.\n        # Let's check:\n        # For n=1: dp[1] = 1 → 1/2 → correct.\n        # For n=2: dp[2] = 1 → 1/4 → correct.\n        # For n=3: dp[3] = 2 → 2/8 = 1/4 → correct.\n        # For n=5: dp[5] = 5 → 5/32 → correct.\n        # So the pattern is dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2], with dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 1.\n        # So the number of valid subsets is the (n)th Fibonacci number, starting from dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 1.\n        # Therefore, the answer is (fib(n) / 2^n) mod MOD.\n        # Now, we need to compute fib(n) where fib(1) = 1, fib(2) = 1, fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).\n        # So, the steps are:\n        # 1. Compute fib(n) mod MOD.\n        # 2. Compute 2^n mod MOD.\n        # 3. Compute the modular inverse of 2^n mod MOD.\n        # 4. Multiply fib(n) by the inverse and mod MOD.\n        # So now, we can implement this.\n\n    # Compute Fibonacci numbers up to n\n    fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n    if n >= 1:\n        fib[1] = 1\n    if n >= 2:\n        fib[2] = 1\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        fib[i] = (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) % MOD\n\n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    power = pow(2, n, MOD)\n\n    # Compute modular inverse of power\n    inv_power = pow(power, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n    # Result is (fib[n] * inv_power) mod MOD\n    result = (fib[n] * inv_power) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
