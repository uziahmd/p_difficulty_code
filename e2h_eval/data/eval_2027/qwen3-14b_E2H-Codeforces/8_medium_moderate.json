Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to assign directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the flow is a valid maximum flow. The conditions are that for all vertices except source (1) and sink (n), the incoming flow equals outgoing. Also, the source has no incoming edges, and the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the approach. The problem gives us the flow values for each edge, but not their directions. We need to assign directions so that the flow is valid.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a flow network, the flow conservation holds for all nodes except source and sink. So for each node except 1 and n, the sum of flows into the node must equal the sum of flows out of it. Also, the source has all its edges directed away, and the sink has all directed towards it.\n\nBut how do we assign the directions? The challenge is to find a way to direct the edges so that these conditions are met, and also the resulting graph is acyclic.\n\nWait, the problem says that the given graph is connected and a solution exists. So there's definitely a way.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. For example, if we can assign directions such that edges go from earlier nodes in the order to later ones, then there can't be cycles.\n\nSo maybe we can find a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and all edges go in the direction of the order. Then, for each node except the source and sink, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow is a maximum flow. Wait, but the problem says that the given ci's are the flow volumes. So the total flow from source to sink is fixed. But how does that help here?\n\nAnother thought: since the flow is a valid maximum flow, the direction of each edge must be such that it's part of the residual network. However, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows entering must equal the sum leaving. Which means that the net flow through the node is zero. So for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into the node minus the sum of flows on edges directed out of the node equals zero. Wait, no. The sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, the net flow is zero.\n\nBut how to model this. For each edge, when directed, it contributes to either the incoming or outgoing of the nodes it connects.\n\nLet me think of it as a graph where each edge is directed, and for each node (except 1 and n), the sum of the flows on edges directed into it equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of it.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations. But solving it directly would be computationally expensive for large n and m.\n\nAlternative idea: since the graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in some order where edges go from earlier to later. Then, for each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges going into the node (from previous nodes) plus the flows on edges going out (to later nodes) must balance. But how?\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a topological order. Let's say we have a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last. Then, for each node, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes. So for any node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges going into v (from predecessors) must equal the sum of flows on edges going out of v (to successors). Because that's the flow conservation.\n\nBut how can we find such a topological order and assign directions accordingly?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation is satisfied. How?\n\nAnother angle: the flow conservation for each node (except source and sink) implies that the total flow through the node is zero. So, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges adjacent to v must be even? No, because each edge contributes once to the sum. For example, if an edge is directed into v, it adds ci to incoming, and if directed out, it adds ci to outgoing. So the sum of incoming and outgoing is the same as the sum of all edges adjacent to v. But for flow conservation, incoming = outgoing. So sum_incoming = sum_outgoing → sum_incoming + sum_outgoing = 2 * sum_incoming = sum_edges_adjacent_to_v. Therefore, sum_edges_adjacent_to_v must be even. Wait, but the problem says that a solution exists. So that's guaranteed.\n\nBut how does that help me?\n\nMaybe I can model this as a directed graph where for each node (except 1 and n), the in-degree (sum of flows) equals the out-degree (sum of flows). But again, how to find the directions.\n\nAnother idea: since the graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can process the nodes in a certain order and assign directions based on that. For example, using a DFS traversal and assigning directions based on the traversal order. But how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree or DAG where the flow conservation holds. For example, imagine that the nodes are arranged in a hierarchy, and the flow moves from higher levels to lower levels. The source is at the top, the sink at the bottom.\n\nWait, maybe we can use a BFS or DFS approach to assign directions. For example, starting from the source, and directing edges away from it. But how to handle the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-flow equal to out-flow. This is similar to the concept of an Eulerian trail, but for nodes. However, in an Eulerian trail, each node has in-degree equal to out-degree, which is similar here. Except here, it's about the sum of flows, not the count of edges.\n\nBut maybe we can model this as a directed graph where for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum on outgoing. So, the net flow is zero.\n\nSo, how to assign directions. Let's think of the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to assign directions to each edge such that:\n\n- For each node v not 1 or n, sum of flows on incoming edges equals sum on outgoing.\n\n- Source (1) has no incoming edges.\n\n- The directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, the key insight here is that the directed graph must be acyclic. Therefore, there exists a topological order. Let's consider such an order. Let's say that the topological order starts with the source and ends with the sink. Then, for each node in the order, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes.\n\nIn this case, the flow conservation for a node v (not source or sink) would require that the sum of flows on edges coming into v (from previous nodes in the order) equals the sum of flows on edges going out of v (to later nodes in the order).\n\nBut how can we find such a topological order?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge is directed from u to v if u comes before v in the topological order. Then, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows of edges coming into v (from predecessors) must equal the sum of flows of edges going out (to successors).\n\nSo, the question becomes: can we find a topological order such that for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges that connect v to nodes before it in the order equals the sum of flows on edges that connect v to nodes after it in the order?\n\nBut how to compute that order?\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe there's another way. Let's think of the problem in terms of a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that allows for flow conservation and acyclicity.\n\nAnother thought: since the graph is connected and the solution exists, maybe we can construct a directed tree (like a spanning tree) rooted at the source, and direct the edges away from the root. Then, for the non-tree edges, we can direct them in a way that maintains the acyclicity and flow conservation.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\n3 nodes, edges between 3-2 (10), 1-2 (10), 3-1 (5). The output directions are 1 (so 3→2?), 0 (1→2), 1 (3→1?), but wait the output is 1,0,1. Let me check:\n\nOriginal edges:\n\nEdge 1: 3 2 10 → direction is 1, meaning it's directed from bi to ai? Or wait, the output di is 0 if direction is ai→bi, else 1. So for the first edge, which is ai=3, bi=2, if di is 1, then direction is bi→ai, i.e., 2→3. But in the sample output, the first line is 1, so the direction is 2→3. Then, the second edge is 1→2 (di=0). Third edge is 3→1 (di=1, since original is 3 and 1, di=1 means direction is 1→3? Wait, no. Wait, the original edge is between ai and bi. If di is 0, direction is ai→bi. If di is 1, direction is bi→ai.\n\nSo for the third edge, which is ai=3, bi=1, di=1 → direction is bi→ai, i.e., 1→3. So the edges are directed as:\n\n2→3 (edge 1), 1→2 (edge 2), 1→3 (edge 3). Then, the flow conservation for node 2 (which is not source or sink) is incoming: 10 (from 1→2) and outgoing: 10 (to 3). So yes, balance. Node 1 has no incoming edges. Node 3 is the sink, so no constraints. The directed graph is acyclic: 1→2→3, and 1→3. So no cycles.\n\nSo in this case, the topological order could be 1, 2, 3. Then, edges are directed from earlier to later in the order.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find a topological order where the source is first, sink is last, and for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges from predecessors to v equals the sum on edges from v to successors.\n\nBut how to compute that order?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: For each node except the source and sink, the sum of flows on edges connected to it must be even. Wait, earlier thought said that sum of flows on edges adjacent to v must be even. Because for flow conservation, sum_in = sum_out → sum_in + sum_out = 2*sum_in = sum_edges_adjacent_to_v. So sum_edges_adjacent_to_v must be even. However, the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists, so that's already handled.\n\nBut how to assign directions.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model this as a directed graph. For each node v (not source or sink), the net flow (sum of flows on edges directed into v minus sum of flows on edges directed out of v) must be zero. But the source has net flow equal to the total flow (since all edges are outgoing), and the sink has net flow equal to negative of that.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe think of the problem as a directed graph where the flow is a valid flow, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nAnother idea: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can perform a topological sort. Suppose we arrange the nodes in a topological order where the source is first and the sink is last. Then, for each node in the order, we can direct all edges from earlier nodes to later nodes. Then, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges that go into v (from previous nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges that go out of v (to later nodes). How can we ensure that?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each node, we need to balance the flows between the edges that are directed towards it and those directed away. But how to compute that.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem where for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges that are directed into v (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v (to later nodes). Let's denote the sum of flows on edges connected to v as S. Then, the sum of flows directed into v from earlier nodes plus the sum of flows directed out of v to later nodes is S. And since they are equal, each must be S/2.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order where for each node v, the sum of flows on edges that are directed into it (from earlier nodes) is exactly S/2.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. For example, during the topological sort, when adding a node to the order, we need to ensure that the sum of flows from already added nodes to this node is S/2. But how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we can construct the topological order incrementally. Start with the source. Then, for each node added to the order, we need to choose nodes whose edges can be directed towards or away from them in a way that balances the flow.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can build a directed spanning tree from the source to the sink, and direct all edges in the tree according to the parent-child relationships. Then, for non-tree edges, direct them in a way that doesn't create cycles. But again, how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed acyclic graph with a unique sink (node n) and source (node 1). For each node, except the source and sink, the flow in equals flow out. So, the entire graph can be viewed as a DAG with flow conservation for internal nodes.\n\nThis seems similar to a flow network where the edges are directed in such a way. But how to find the directions.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's requirement of acyclicity. Let's construct a DAG where all edges are directed from the source towards the sink. To do this, we can perform a BFS or DFS and assign directions based on the traversal order. However, the flow conservation needs to be ensured.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Build a directed graph where each edge is directed from the node that was discovered first in a traversal (like BFS) to the one discovered later. But how to adjust directions to satisfy flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, during traversal, for each node, we can track the required flow that needs to be sent out. For example, for the source, the total flow is the sum of all edges connected to it. Then, for each node, when processing it, we direct edges to other nodes such that the flow conservation is maintained.\n\nBut this feels vague.\n\nAnother idea: since the flow conservation requires that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. Let's model this as a graph where each node has a \"balance\" that needs to be zero. Initially, for each node v, the balance is the sum of flows of all edges connected to it. For the source, the balance should be the total outflow (which is the sum of flows of edges connected to it). For the sink, the balance should be the negative of that.\n\nBut how to adjust the directions of edges to balance the nodes.\n\nWait, here's a possible way: For each edge, directing it from u to v subtracts ci from u's balance and adds ci to v's balance. Or vice versa. So, for each edge, choosing a direction affects the balances of the two nodes.\n\nThe problem requires that for all nodes except source and sink, the final balance is zero. For the source, the balance is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it (since all edges are outgoing). For the sink, the balance is negative of that.\n\nSo this looks like a problem of adjusting the direction of edges to achieve the desired balances.\n\nBut how to model this. It's similar to a problem where each edge can be considered as a variable that can be added to one node's balance and subtracted from the other. We need to find a set of directions (variables) such that the balances are correct.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for large n and m.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a system of equations, but solving it for large n and m is impractical.\n\nAnother thought: the problem resembles finding an Eulerian trail. In an Eulerian trail, each node (except start and end) has equal in-degree and out-degree. But in our case, the in-flow equals out-flow. However, the flows are weighted, not just counts.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where for each node, the in-flow equals the out-flow. So, the net flow is zero for internal nodes.\n\nBut again, how to find directions.\n\nWait, what if we model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in such a way that the net flow for each node is correct. For example, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum on edges directed out. So, the net change for v is zero.\n\nLet me think of this as a flow problem. Imagine that each edge can carry flow in either direction. But since the flow is fixed, we need to assign directions such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut this seems circular.\n\nAnother angle: Since the graph is undirected, and the flow is already determined, maybe we can construct a directed graph by choosing directions such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it equals the required value. For example, the source's outflow is the total flow, which is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it. But how to find that.\n\nWait, the total flow from source to sink is fixed. Let's denote it as F. Then, for the source, the sum of flows on outgoing edges must be F. For the sink, the sum of flows on incoming edges must be F. For other nodes, the sum of outgoing flows must equal the sum of incoming flows.\n\nBut how to compute F. Well, since the given graph is a maximum flow, the F is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. However, since the problem provides the flow values for each edge, but not their directions, perhaps F can be computed as the sum of flows on edges connected to the source, but adjusted based on their direction. But since we don't know the directions yet, this seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, since the given flow is a maximum flow, the total flow from source to sink is fixed. But how to find it. Well, perhaps the sum of flows on edges connected to the source (assuming all are outgoing) would be F. But that's not necessarily true, because some of the edges may be directed into the source, which is not allowed.\n\nAh, right! The source has no incoming edges. So all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Therefore, the sum of flows on edges connected to the source is the total flow F.\n\nSimilarly, for the sink, all edges connected to it must be directed towards it. So the sum of flows on edges connected to the sink is F.\n\nSo, this gives us a way to compute F. For example, F is the sum of flows on edges connected to the source. Because all edges connected to the source are directed away from it. Similarly, the sum of flows on edges connected to the sink must be F as well.\n\nBut how to verify this. Let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 nodes, edges between 3-2 (10), 1-2 (10), 3-1 (5).\n\nEdges connected to source (node 1) are 1-2 (10) and 3-1 (5). So the sum is 15. But the output shows that the 3-1 edge is directed from 1 to 3 (since di=1 for that edge, which is ai=3, bi=1 → direction is bi→ai, i.e., 1→3). So the flow from source is 10 (from 1→2) and 5 (from 1→3), totaling 15. The sink is node 3. Edges connected to it are 3-2 (10) and 3-1 (5). In the output, the direction of 3-2 is 2→3 (so flow into sink is 10) and 3-1 is directed as 1→3 (so flow into sink is 5). Total 15, which matches F=15. So yes, this works.\n\nSo F is the sum of flows on edges connected to the source. And for the sink, it's the same.\n\nThis suggests that for each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges connected to it must be even. Because, for each such node, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, the total sum of flows on edges connected to it is 2 * sum_incoming. Hence, it must be even. Which the problem says is guaranteed.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes: assign directions to edges such that:\n\n- All edges connected to source are directed away from it.\n\n- All edges connected to sink are directed towards it.\n\n- For other nodes, the sum of flows on incoming edges equals sum on outgoing.\n\n- The directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, how to proceed.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where we need to assign directions to edges, ensuring that the flow conservation holds and the graph is acyclic.\n\nOne possible way to achieve acyclicity is to construct a directed tree (like a BFS tree) where the edges are directed away from the source and towards the sink. Then, for non-tree edges, direct them in a way that doesn't form cycles.\n\nBut again, how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nAnother idea: since the flow conservation for each node is that the sum of flows on edges directed into the node equals the sum directed out, we can model this as a directed graph where each node has an in-flow and out-flow that balance. This sounds like a problem that can be solved using a greedy algorithm, perhaps using a priority queue or some kind of traversal.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can treat this as a directed graph where we need to assign directions to edges such that for each node (except source and sink), the in-flow equals out-flow. We can process nodes in a certain order, and for each node, direct edges in a way that satisfies the balance.\n\nFor example, we can perform a BFS starting from the source. When visiting a node, we can direct edges to unvisited nodes away from the current node. But how to ensure that the flow conservation is met.\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes as being processed in a topological order. For each node, after processing, we ensure that the sum of flows directed into it from already processed nodes is equal to the sum of flows directed out to unprocessed nodes. How?\n\nLet me think of this as follows: suppose we have a node v. We want to direct some edges from v to other nodes, and others from other nodes to v. The sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum on edges directed out. But how to determine which edges to direct in which way.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. For the source node (1), direct all edges away from it. This ensures that it has no incoming edges.\n\n2. For the sink node (n), direct all edges towards it.\n\n3. For other nodes, we need to balance the flows.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges connected to it is S. We need to direct exactly S/2 of that sum as outgoing, and S/2 as incoming.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nMaybe we can model this as a graph where each node has a required outflow of S/2. For example, for node v, after directing some edges, the sum of flows on edges directed out must be equal to S/2.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where we can use a greedy approach. For example, we can process nodes in a certain order, and for each node, direct edges to other nodes in a way that helps achieve the required outflow.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to think of an example. Take the first sample input again. Node 2 is not source or sink. Its connected edges are 1-2 (10), 3-2 (10). Sum is 20, so required outflow is 10.\n\nInitially, node 1 is processed. Its edges are directed away. So for edge 1-2, it's directed from 1 to 2. This contributes 10 to the outflow of node 1, and 10 to the inflow of node 2. Now, node 2 has an inflow of 10. It needs to have outflow of 10. So we look at its other edges. The edge between 2 and 3 has flow 10. To get outflow of 10 from node 2, we direct this edge from 2 to 3. That way, node 2's outflow is 10, matching the inflow. Then, node 3's inflow increases by 10 (from 2→3) and also from the edge 1→3 (directed from 1 to 3, which is part of the source's edges). But node 3 is the sink, so all edges are directed towards it. So the edge between 3 and 1 is directed from 1 to 3, and the edge between 3 and 2 is directed from 2 to 3. Thus, the inflow for node 3 is 10+5=15, which is F.\n\nSo in this case, the algorithm worked by directing edges from node 1 to 2, then directing the edge between 2 and 3 from 2 to 3.\n\nThis suggests that we can process nodes in a certain order, and for each node, direct edges to other nodes in a way that helps balance their outflow.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps we can use a BFS-like approach, where we maintain for each node the amount of flow that needs to be sent out. For example, initially, for the source, all edges are directed away, contributing to the outflow. For other nodes, we calculate the required outflow as S/2, and then direct edges to other nodes to fulfill that.\n\nHere's a possible algorithm:\n\n- Compute for each node v (not source or sink) the required outflow: req[v] = sum of flows on edges connected to v / 2.\n\n- For the source, req[source] is sum of flows on edges connected to it (since all are directed out).\n\n- For the sink, req[sink] is zero (all edges are directed in).\n\n- Use a priority queue or some data structure to process nodes. Start with the source.\n\n- For each node u processed, iterate through its edges. For each edge (u, v), if v hasn't been processed yet, direct the edge from u to v. Subtract the flow from req[u], and add it to req[v]. Then, if req[v] becomes zero, process it next.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me think through this.\n\nLet's take the first sample:\n\nNodes are 1, 2, 3. Source is 1, sink is 3.\n\nreq[1] = sum of flows connected to it: 10 (from 1-2) +5 (from 3-1) = 15. req[2] = (10+10)/2 = 10. req[3] = (10+5)/2 = 7.5? Wait no. Wait for node 3, it's the sink, so all edges are directed towards it. So req[3] is zero? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, for the sink node, all edges are directed towards it. So for node 3, the inflow is sum of flows on all edges connected to it. Hence, req[3] is zero, because the required outflow is zero (since it's the sink).\n\nBut how to handle the sink in this algorithm.\n\nLet me think again. For the source, we direct all edges away. For the sink, we direct all edges towards it. For other nodes, we need to balance their inflow and outflow.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nInitialize a queue with the source. Mark it as processed.\n\nFor each node u in the queue:\n\n   For each edge (u, v) not yet directed:\n\n      if v is the sink: direct the edge towards it (from u to v if u is not sink, but since v is sink, we direct from u to v).\n\n      else if v is not processed:\n\n          direct the edge from u to v.\n\n          subtract ci from req[u], add ci to req[v].\n\n          if req[v] == 0, add v to the queue.\n\nThis way, for each node v, when it is added to the queue, it has req[v] = 0, meaning that all edges connected to it are directed in a way that balances the inflow and outflow.\n\nBut why would req[v] be zero?\n\nLet me think for the first sample:\n\nInitially, req[1] = 15. Process node 1.\n\nEdges connected to node 1 are 1-2 (ci=10) and 3-1 (ci=5).\n\nFor edge 1-2 (v=2, not processed):\n\ndirect from 1 to 2. Subtract 10 from req[1] (now 5), add 10 to req[2] (now 10).\n\nFor edge 3-1 (v=3, which is the sink). Direct from 1 to 3 (since sink is v). So subtract 5 from req[1] (now 0). Add 5 to req[3], but since it's sink, req[3] is not tracked. But for the sink, all edges are directed towards it, so this is handled.\n\nNow, req[1] is 0. So we have processed it.\n\nNext, req[2] is 10. So we add node 2 to the queue.\n\nProcess node 2. Its edges are 1-2 (already directed), 2-3 (ci=10).\n\nFor edge 2-3 (v=3, sink): direct from 2 to 3. Subtract 10 from req[2] (now 0). Add 10 to req[3], but since it's sink, we ignore. Now, req[2] is 0, so we add it to the queue. But it's already processed? Or we add it to the queue only when req becomes zero.\n\nSo, after processing node 2, req[2] becomes zero. So we add it to the queue. But when we process it, we check its edges. The only edge left is 2-3, which is directed towards the sink.\n\nThus, the directions are as expected.\n\nThis seems to work for this case.\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose there's a node v connected to the source and to another node w. Let's say the sum of flows for v is 20 (so req[v] is 10). When the source processes its edges, it directs the edge to v, adding 10 to req[v]. Then, when v is processed, it will direct edges to other nodes, like w, to subtract from its req[v].\n\nBut how does this ensure that req[v] becomes zero?\n\nYes, because when v is processed, it directs edges to unprocessed nodes, which contributes to req[v] being reduced. Once req[v] reaches zero, it is added to the queue.\n\nBut what if there are multiple edges connected to v? For example, v has edges to u and w. When v is processed, it will direct edges to u and w, which would reduce req[v] by the flows of those edges. But how to ensure that req[v] reaches zero.\n\nThis depends on the way the edges are directed. But since the problem states that a solution exists, this algorithm should work.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each node, calculate the required outflow (req[v]) as the sum of flows on edges connected to it divided by 2, except for source and sink.\n\n- For source, req is the sum of flows on edges connected to it (since all edges are directed away).\n\n- For sink, all edges are directed towards it, so no req is needed.\n\n- Use a queue to process nodes. Start with the source.\n\n- For each node u in the queue, iterate over all its edges. For each edge (u, v) not yet directed:\n\n   - if v is the sink, direct from u to v.\n\n   - else if v is not processed:\n\n       direct from u to v.\n\n       subtract ci from req[u], add ci to req[v].\n\n       if req[v] becomes zero, add to the queue.\n\nThis way, when a node is processed, all edges connected to it are directed in a way that contributes to the required outflow.\n\nBut how to track which edges have been processed. Also, how to handle edges that connect to already processed nodes.\n\nWait, in this algorithm, when processing node u, for each edge (u, v), if v is not processed, we direct the edge from u to v. Otherwise, if v is already processed, we don't do anything. But what if v is processed and the edge is between u and v? How to handle that.\n\nBecause, for example, if u is processed and v is already processed, then the edge between them could be directed either way. But since the algorithm only processes edges when one end is processed and the other is not, perhaps this ensures that all edges are processed in this way.\n\nBut what about edges between two processed nodes? For example, if both u and v are processed. In this case, the edge between them would have been directed when one of them was processed. But how?\n\nWait, the algorithm processes nodes in the order that they are added to the queue. When a node u is processed, it directs edges to unprocessed nodes. Once a node is processed, it is not processed again. So, for an edge between two processed nodes, it would have been directed when one of them was processed.\n\nBut what if the edge is between two processed nodes, and neither has directed it yet? For example, suppose u and v are both processed, and the edge between them hasn't been directed. How would that happen?\n\nBut according to the algorithm, when u was processed, it would have directed edges to unprocessed nodes. If v was already processed, then the edge between u and v would not be directed during u's processing. Similarly, when v was processed, it would not have directed the edge to u (since u was already processed). So this edge would remain undirected, leading to a problem.\n\nBut this is impossible, since the algorithm is supposed to direct all edges. How to avoid this?\n\nAh, this suggests that the algorithm as described is incomplete. It only directs edges from processed nodes to unprocessed ones. What about edges between processed nodes?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the graph is connected. So there must be a way to direct all edges. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the algorithm needs to handle edges between processed nodes. However, since the problem guarantees that a solution exists, perhaps the way the algorithm works ensures that such edges are not present. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the algorithm starts with the source. Then processes nodes in the order they are added to the queue. Each time a node is processed, it directs all edges to unprocessed nodes. Once a node is processed, it's not revisited. So, for any edge between two nodes, one of them must be processed first. When the first one is processed, it directs the edge to the unprocessed node. So the edge is directed.\n\nThus, all edges are directed in this way. Because the graph is connected, and the algorithm processes all nodes in the queue, eventually all edges are directed.\n\nBut how about edges between two processed nodes. For example, suppose u and v are both processed, and the edge between them is undirected. How can this happen?\n\nIt can't, because when u was processed, v was already processed. So during u's processing, the edge between u and v was not directed, because v was already processed. Similarly, during v's processing, the edge between u and v was not directed. But this would leave the edge undirected. However, the problem says that the solution exists, so there must be a way to direct it.\n\nBut this suggests that the algorithm as described may not handle such cases. So, what's wrong here?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose there are three nodes: 1 (source), 2, 3 (sink). Edges between 1-2 (c=10), 2-3 (c=10), and 1-3 (c=10). The sum for node 2 is 10 + 10 = 20 → req[2] is 10.\n\nProcessing starts with node 1. It has edges to 2 and 3.\n\nFor edge 1-2: v=2 is unprocessed. Direct from 1 to 2. Subtract 10 from req[1] (which was 10+10=20? Wait, source's req is the sum of flows on edges connected to it. In this case, edges are ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that it forms a valid maximum flow with specific constraints. The constraints include ensuring that each vertex (except the source and sink) has equal incoming and outgoing flow, the source has no incoming edges, and the resulting directed graph is acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Flow Conservation**: For each vertex (except the source and sink), the sum of the flows on incoming edges must equal the sum of the flows on outgoing edges.\n2. **Acyclic Graph**: The directed graph must be acyclic, which can be ensured by processing nodes in a topological order.\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal**: Use BFS starting from the source node to process nodes and direct edges appropriately.
