He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a and b (or R), then a number c in base a. My task is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the second line is the number c in base a. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Convert c from base a to decimal (base 10).\n2. Then convert that decimal number to base b, which could be another base or Roman numerals.\n\nSo, the main parts are:\n\n- Parsing the input correctly.\n- Converting the input number from base a to decimal.\n- Converting the decimal number to base b (or Roman numerals).\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. Since c can have letters (like A, B, etc.) if a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F. Wait, but the problem says that in the input, c is given as a string in base a. So, for bases larger than 10, the digits are represented using letters, like A for 10, B for 11, etc. But how are they represented in the input? For example, if the input is 'A', then it's 10 in base a. So, when converting, I need to handle letters as digits.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros, but its length is up to 10^3. So, for example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). So, when converting the input string to decimal, I need to process each character as a digit in base a.\n\nSo, the first step is to write a function that converts a string (like 'A') in base a to decimal. For example, 'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal. How to handle that?\n\nFor the conversion from base a to decimal: Each character in the string represents a digit. For example, '1A' in base 16 would be 1*16 + 10 = 26.\n\nSo, I need to process each character in the string, converting it to its numerical value, then compute the decimal value.\n\nBut how to handle letters? Let's think: for digits, if the character is a digit (0-9), then its value is int(c). If it's a letter (A-F?), then it's 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A')). But wait, the problem says that for bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So the letters are uppercase? The input c is given as a string. But the problem says that in the input, the c may contain leading zeros but it's a valid number in base a. So, the input for c is a string of digits, possibly with letters (uppercase?), but the problem says that in the input, the c is a non-negative integer in base a. So, perhaps the input uses uppercase letters for digits beyond 9. For example, if a is 12, then 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11. So, when processing the input string, each character is converted to its value.\n\nSo, for the first step, I need to process the input string into a decimal number. Let's code that.\n\nNext, after getting the decimal value, I need to convert it to base b, which could be another base (like 2, 16) or Roman numerals.\n\nSo, the second part is converting from decimal to base b, or Roman numerals.\n\nLet's break this down into two cases:\n\nCase 1: b is not 'R'. Then, we need to convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for higher digits. Also, the output should not have leading zeros. For example, if the number is zero, but the problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. However, in other cases, the input c may be zero? Wait, the problem says that if Roman numerals are included, the number is not zero. Otherwise, the number won't be greater than 1e15. So, in the case where the output is not Roman, the decimal number could be zero?\n\nWait, the input says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15.\" So, when converting to Roman, the decimal number is between 1 and 3000. But for other cases, the decimal number can be zero? Well, the input c may be zero. For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0. Then the output would be 0. But according to the problem statement, the input c may be zero. However, the note says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is not zero. So, for other cases, the output can be zero.\n\nSo, for converting to base b (non-Roman), we need to handle zero properly. For example, if the decimal value is zero, then the output is 0.\n\nSo, for the conversion from decimal to base b (when b is not R), here's what I need to do:\n\nIf the decimal number is zero, output '0'.\n\nElse, convert the number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z as needed. Also, omit leading zeros.\n\nFor example, if the decimal number is 10 and base is 16, output is 'A'.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nThe standard way is to take the number, divide by the base, collect the remainders, then reverse the collected digits. But for digits larger than 9, we need to represent them as letters.\n\nFor example, for a digit value of 10, it's 'A'; 11 is 'B', etc. So, for each remainder, if it's less than 10, we use the digit as a string. Else, we use the corresponding letter.\n\nSo, the function for converting decimal to base b (non-Roman) would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    # Now reverse the digits and convert to characters\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    result = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            result += str(d)\n        else:\n            result += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return result\n\nWait, but what if the base is 1? Well, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So, the base is at least 2, so no problem.\n\nBut wait, the input for a and b is 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25. But in the first line, the input is two integers a and b, except that b can be R. So, for the case where b is not R, then it's between 2 and 25. So, the code for converting to base b is okay.\n\nBut what if the number is zero? For example, if the input c is zero (like in the case where a=10, c=0, and b=2). Then, the output is '0'.\n\nSo, the code above handles that.\n\nNow, the other case is when b is 'R'. Then, we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, how to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nRoman numerals have certain rules. The standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, the standard list is:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, we check how many times the value fits into the number, append the symbol that many times, and subtract the value.\n\nSo, for example, 4 is IV.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman numerals is guaranteed to be between 1 and 3000, inclusive, and not zero. So, the code can safely assume that the decimal number is in that range.\n\nSo, the function to convert decimal to Roman is straightforward.\n\nImplementing that:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nThat should work.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFirst, parse the input. The first line is two elements: a and b. But b can be 'R'.\n\nWait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is two elements, a and b. For example, in the sample input, one of the test cases is '16 R\\n5'.\n\nSo, for the first line, split into a and b. But the second part can be 'R' instead of a number.\n\nSo, in Python, for each test case, the first line is split into two parts. For example, for the first line, say, '10 2', then a is 10, b is 2. For '16 R', a is 16, b is 'R'.\n\nThen, the second line is the number c in base a.\n\nSo, for each test case, the steps are:\n\nRead a and b (could be R), then read c.\n\nSo, the first thing is to parse the first line. Let's think about the code structure.\n\nThe input is given via stdin. But the problem says that the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWait, this seems like multiple test cases. But how is the input provided? The problem says that the first line contains two integers a and b, then the next line contains c. So, the input is per test case. However, the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a...\n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Oh, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual input is one test case. Wait, the sample input shows that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the problem says that the input is for one test case. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, there are five test cases. The output is five lines. So, the actual problem is that the program must read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the original problem statement may have been written in a way that the input is a single test case. However, looking at the sample input and output, it's clear that the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem description says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines. So, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. For example, the first line is a and b, the second line is c. Then, another test case starts with a new first line, etc.\n\nBut how to read that? Because in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous here. But looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of test cases. For example, the first input line is '10 2\\n1' meaning that the first test case is a=10, b=2, c=1. The output is '1'.\n\nSo, the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says \"the first line contains two integers a and b...\" which implies that there's only one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, which suggests that the code should read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So, the code should read all lines from stdin, processing them in pairs.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, perhaps the code can read all lines, split them into groups of two lines. For example, for each test case, read two lines: the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases, each with two lines. So, the code should process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to read from stdin? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut the problem's input may vary. So, the code must process multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nBut the problem's original statement says that the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of test cases. For example, the first line is ['10 2\\n1', ...], which suggests that each element in the list is a separate test case. But the actual input would be, for example, for the first test case, the first line is '10 2' and the second line is '1'. Then another test case's first line is '16 R', and the second line is '5', etc.\n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple test cases. Each test case is two lines. So, the code should read all lines from stdin, group them into pairs, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nWell, in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, and the code must read until EOF. So, for example, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut in practice, the code can read lines until there are no more lines. So, for example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n   process lines[i] and lines[i+1]\n\nBut this assumes that the number of lines is even. Which it should be, since each test case has two lines.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to handle the input? Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, the code will process each test case as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead the first line, split into a and b. For example, '10 2' → a=10, b=2. Or '16 R' → a=16, b='R'.\n\nThen, read the second line, which is the string c in base a.\n\nOnce I have a, b, and c, I need to process them.\n\nSo, the steps for each test case:\n\n1. Convert c from base a to decimal.\n\n   For example, c is '5' in base 16 → decimal is 5. But if a is 5, c is '4', then decimal is 4.\n\n   How to handle letters in c?\n\n   For example, if a is 12, and c is 'A', then the value is 10.\n\n   So, the code needs to process each character in c, converting it to its value.\n\n   Let's think about writing a function to convert a string s in base a to decimal.\n\n   Let's write a helper function called base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n\n       value = 0\n\n       for char in s:\n\n           digit = char_to_value(char)\n\n           value = value * a + digit\n\n       return value\n\n   But what about the char_to_value function?\n\n   For example, for a character '0' to '9', it's the digit. For 'A' to 'Z', it's 10 to 35. But since a is up to 25, the maximum digit is 24. So, the input c can have letters up to 'Y' (for base 25, digits up to 24).\n\n   But the problem says that the input c is a valid number in base a. So, each character in c is a valid digit in base a.\n\n   So, the code for converting a character to its value is:\n\n   def char_to_value(c):\n\n       if c.isdigit():\n\n           return int(c)\n\n       else:\n\n           return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\n   But wait, for example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So, that's correct.\n\n   However, the input c may have lowercase letters? Probably not. The problem says that the input is given as a string, but it's unclear. However, the problem says that in the input, the c may contain leading zeros, but the actual digits are valid. So, assuming that the input is uppercase letters for digits beyond 9.\n\n   So, the code should process the input string as uppercase letters. But in practice, perhaps the code should process it as case-insensitive. For example, if the input is 'a', then it's 10. But the problem says that the input c is a valid number in base a. So, perhaps the input uses uppercase letters, but the code can process both upper and lower case. However, the problem's sample input includes 'A' as a digit, like in the case of '12 13\\nA' which outputs 'A' (since converting from base 12 to base 13, A is 10 in base 12, which is 10 in decimal, and in base 13, that is 'A' again).\n\n   So, the code can process the input as uppercase letters, converting any case to uppercase.\n\n   So, in the code:\n\n   for each character in the string c:\n\n       if it's a digit, take its value.\n\n       else, convert to uppercase, then calculate its value as ord(c) - ord('A') + 10.\n\n   So, the code for converting the string to decimal:\n\n   def str_to_decimal(s, base):\n\n       num = 0\n\n       for ch in s:\n\n           if ch.isdigit():\n\n               d = int(ch)\n\n           else:\n\n               d = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\n           num = num * base + d\n\n       return num\n\n   But what about leading zeros? For example, '001' in base 10 is 1. But the code handles that correctly.\n\n   So, this function should work.\n\n   Now, once we have the decimal number, we need to process it based on the value of b.\n\n   So, for each test case:\n\n   After getting decimal_num:\n\n   if b is 'R':\n\n       convert decimal_num to Roman numerals.\n\n   else:\n\n       convert decimal_num to base b, as a string, without leading zeros.\n\n   Now, for the case when decimal_num is zero, but b is not R. For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0. Then the output is '0'.\n\n   So, the code for converting to base b is as discussed earlier.\n\n   Now, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\n   Edge case 1: c is zero. For example, a=10, b=2, c=0 → output is 0.\n\n   Edge case 2: converting to Roman numerals. For example, decimal_num is 4 → 'IV'.\n\n   Edge case 3: converting to base 1 (but the problem says that b is between 2 and 25, so this is not possible).\n\n   Another edge case: when the decimal number is zero and b is not R. The code must output '0'.\n\n   Now, let's test the sample inputs.\n\n   Sample Input 1:\n\n   10 2\n\n   1\n\n   So, a=10, b=2. c is '1' in base 10 → decimal is 1. Convert to base 2 → '1'. Output is '1'.\n\n   Sample Output is '1'.\n\n   Sample Input 2:\n\n   16 R\n\n   5\n\n   So, a=16, c is '5' in base 16 → decimal is 5. Convert to Roman: V. Output 'V'.\n\n   Sample Input 3:\n\n   5 R\n\n   4\n\n   So, a=5, c is 4 in base 5 → decimal is 4. Convert to Roman: IV. Output 'IV'.\n\n   Sample Input 4:\n\n   2 2\n\n   1111001\n\n   So, the input is binary 1111001, which is 121 in decimal. Convert to base 2 → same as input. Output is '1111001'.\n\n   Sample Input 5:\n\n   12 13\n\n   A\n\n   So, a=12, c is 'A' which is 10 in decimal. Convert to base 13: 10 is represented as 'A' (since 10 < 13). So output 'A'.\n\n   All samples match the outputs.\n\n   Now, code steps.\n\n   Now, code structure.\n\n   Read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs.\n\n   For each pair:\n\n   first_line = line1.split()\n\n   a = first_line[0]\n\n   b = first_line[1]\n\n   Wait, but in the first line, it's two elements. For example, '10 2' → a is 10, b is 2. Or '16 R' → a is 16, b is R.\n\n   So, in code:\n\n   for each test case:\n\n       line1 = first line of the test case.\n\n       parts = line1.split()\n\n       a = int(parts[0])\n\n       b_part = parts[1]\n\n       if b_part == 'R':\n\n           b_is_roman = True\n\n       else:\n\n           b = int(b_part)\n\n           b_is_roman = False\n\n       line2 = second line of the test case.\n\n       c_str = line2.strip()\n\n   Then, convert c_str from base a to decimal.\n\n   Then, if b is roman, convert to roman.\n\n   Else, convert to base b.\n\n   Now, code for the conversion functions.\n\n   Now, implement the code.\n\n   Now, code:\n\n   First, read the lines.\n\n   Then, process each pair.\n\n   Now, code:\n\n   import sys\n\n   def char_to_value(c):\n\n       if c.isdigit():\n\n           return int(c)\n\n       else:\n\n           return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\n   def str_to_decimal(s, base):\n\n       num = 0\n\n       for ch in s:\n\n           d = char_to_value(ch)\n\n           num = num * base + d\n\n       return num\n\n   def decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n       if n == 0:\n\n           return '0'\n\n       digits = []\n\n       while n > 0:\n\n           rem = n % base\n\n           digits.append(rem)\n\n           n = n // base\n\n       digits = digits[::-1]\n\n       res = ''\n\n       for d in digits:\n\n           if d < 10:\n\n               res += str(d)\n\n           else:\n\n               res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n       return res\n\n   def decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n       roman_numerals = [\n\n           (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n\n           (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n\n           (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n\n       ]\n\n       res = ''\n\n       for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n\n           while n >= value:\n\n               res += symbol\n\n               n -= value\n\n       return res\n\n   def main():\n\n       import sys\n\n       lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n       idx = 0\n\n       while idx < len(lines):\n\n           line1 = lines[idx]\n\n           line2 = lines[idx+1]\n\n           idx += 2\n\n           parts = line1.split()\n\n           a = int(parts[0])\n\n           b_part = parts[1]\n\n           c_str = line2\n\n           # Convert c_str from base a to decimal\n\n           decimal_num = str_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\n           # Process based on b_part\n\n           if b_part == 'R':\n\n               result = decimal_to_roman(decimal_num)\n\n           else:\n\n               b = int(b_part)\n\n               result = decimal_to_base(decimal_num, b)\n\n           print(result)\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n\n       main()\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the decimal number is zero, the code returns '0', which is correct. For other cases, when converting to base b, the code returns the digits without leading zeros. Because in the decimal_to_base function, if the number is zero, it returns '0', else, the digits are generated by dividing by base, which ensures that leading zeros are not present. For example, if the number is 5 in base 10, the code returns '5'.\n\nBut what about when the number is zero? For example, if the input is a=10, c=0, then decimal_num is 0, and the code returns '0'.\n\nBut what if the input is a=10, c=0, and b is 2. Then the output is '0'.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c=1 → decimal is 1 → converted to base 2 → '1'.\n\nSample output is '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c=5 → decimal is 5 → converted to Roman is 'V'.\n\nSample output 'V'.\n\nTest case 3:\n\na=5, b=R, c=4 → decimal is 4 → 'IV'.\n\nSample output 'IV'.\n\nTest case 4:\n\na=2, b=2, c=1111001 → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nSample output '1111001'.\n\nTest case 5:\n\na=12, b=13, c=A → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nSample output 'A'.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: input a=10, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c=255 → decimal is 255 → converted to base 16 is 'FF'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=R, c=3000 → decimal is 3000 → Roman is MMM.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and not zero.\n\nNow, what about numbers that require subtractive notation?\n\nLike 4 → IV.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the input c is zero and the output is Roman? According to the problem statement, the input for Roman is guaranteed not to be zero. So, the code does not need to handle that case.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, when converting from base a to decimal, what if the input c is empty? But according to the problem statement, c is a non-negative integer, and the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, the code can assume that c is a valid string in base a.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when the input c is '0' (with leading zeros). For example, a=10, c='000' → decimal is 0. Then output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when the decimal_num is zero and b is not R. Output is '0'.\n\nNow, code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the input c is very long, but the code can handle it as the code processes each character in O(n) time.\n\nBut for the constraints given, the length is up to 10^3, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich gives output '1'.\n\nThe code processes line1 as '10 2', parts is ['10', '2'], a=10, b_part is '2' → not R. c_str is '1'.\n\ndecimal_num is 1. Then converted to base 2 → '1'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input: '5 R\\n4' → decimal_num is 4 → converted to Roman 'IV'.\n\nAnother sample input: '2 2\\n1111001' → decimal_num is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 → 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Converting to base 2 → 1111001. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input: '12 13\\nA' → A in base 12 is 10 in decimal. Converted to base 13: 10 is less than 13, so output is 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code seems correct. Now, code must be written in Python, reading from stdin, and outputting the correct answers.\n\nBut in the code, when reading lines, the code uses [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]. But sometimes, the input may have empty lines. However, the problem says that the input is valid, so perhaps not. But the code skips empty lines.\n\nBut in the code, the lines are processed in pairs. So, the code must have even number of lines. Otherwise, it will crash. However, the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code is written as per the problem's instructions.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which could be a standard numerical base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to decimal (base 10) and then converting it to the target base `b` or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`. We first convert this number to its decimal (base 10) equivalent.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a standard numerical base or Roman numerals, we convert the decimal number accordingly:\n   - **Standard Numerical Base**: Convert the decimal number to the specified base using division-remainder method, handling digits beyond 9 with letters (A-Z).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: Convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs, applying subtractive notation where necessary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        d = char_to_value(ch)\n        num = num * base + d\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n        line2 = lines[idx+1]\n        idx += 2\n        parts = line1.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        c_str = line2\n        decimal_num = str_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            result = decimal_to_roman(decimal_num)\n        else:\n            b = int(b_part)\n            result = decimal_to_base(decimal_num, b)\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, processing each pair of lines as a separate test case.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `str_to_decimal` converts the input string from base `a` to decimal by iterating through each character and computing its value.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: \n   - For standard bases, the function `decimal_to_base` uses division and modulus operations to convert the decimal number to the target base, handling digits greater than 9 with letters.\n   - For Roman numerals, the function `decimal_to_roman` uses a list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient and correct conversion between different numeral systems, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
