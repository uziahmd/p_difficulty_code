They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can be the champion given the tournament structure and the rules for each phase. \n\nSo, the tournament is a single-elimination bracket with 2^n teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The results of each phase depend on the string s. For each phase i (starting from 0?), if s[i] is 0, then in that phase, the lower-skilled team wins each match. If it's 1, the higher-skilled one wins. \n\nOur task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nFirst, I need to model how the tournament proceeds. But since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1..2^n, we need to find for each x whether there's a way to arrange the initial positions of the teams such that x can win through the tournament according to the rules of each phase.\n\nWait, but the initial arrangement of the teams in the bracket matters. Because the tournament structure depends on how the teams are paired in each round. However, the problem says that the permutation p is given, but the actual positions of the teams in the bracket are not specified. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the initial pairing is fixed: team 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. But the permutation p defines the skill levels of the teams. So the actual initial positions of the teams in the bracket are fixed, but their skill levels are determined by p. But the question is, can we choose p such that the team with skill x ends up as the champion?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that p is a permutation of 1 to 2^n. So, the teams are numbered 1 to 2^n, and their skill levels are p_1, p_2, ..., p_{2^n}. But the tournament bracket is fixed based on their positions. So, for example, team 1 plays against team 2 in the first round. The winner of that match plays against the winner of team 3 vs 4 in the next round, etc. \n\nBut the problem says that given the string s, we need to find all x where there exists some permutation p such that the team with skill x is the champion. So, the permutation p determines the skill levels of each team. But the positions of the teams in the bracket are fixed. So, the team's position (like team 1, team 2, etc.) is fixed, but their skill levels are assigned via p. \n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the permutation p is the skill levels of the teams. So, for example, if p is [3, 1, 2], then team 1 has skill 3, team 2 has skill 1, team 3 has skill 2. Then, the tournament proceeds with the initial pairings as per their positions. \n\nBut the problem is to find for each x, whether there exists a permutation p such that when the tournament is played according to the rules of s, the team with skill x is the champion. \n\nBut how do we model this? Since the permutation p is arbitrary, we can arrange the skills in such a way that the team with skill x can reach the final by winning each round according to the rules of each phase.\n\nThe challenge is to find all x where such a permutation exists. \n\nLet me think about the approach. For each x, we need to determine if there's a way to assign the skills to the teams such that x can win the tournament. \n\nBut how can we model the tournament structure? Let's think recursively. \n\nEach round of the tournament is a series of matches. The winner of each match proceeds to the next round. The rules for each round (phase) are determined by s. \n\nFor example, in the first phase (phase 1), each match is between two adjacent teams. The winner is determined by the skill level according to s[0]. Then, in the second phase (phase 2), each match is between winners of previous matches, again according to s[1], and so on. \n\nBut the key is that for each round, the way the matches are structured depends on the previous rounds. \n\nBut since we can choose the permutation p, perhaps we can model for each possible x, what constraints must be satisfied for it to be possible for x to be the champion. \n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the tournament as a binary tree. The root is the final match, and each level corresponds to a phase. \n\nBut perhaps we can model for each possible x, the minimal and maximal required values in each round. \n\nAlternatively, think about the path that x must take through the tournament. For each round, depending on the rule (s[i]), x must be the best or worst in its group. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that in order for x to be the champion, in each round, during that phase, x must have beaten all opponents according to the rule of that phase. \n\nBut since the permutation p can be arranged, perhaps we can model for each round, the constraints on x's value relative to other teams in the same subtree. \n\nFor example, in the first phase (phase 1), which is the first round. Suppose the rule is 1 (higher skill wins). Then, in order for x to win its first match, x must be higher than its opponent. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can make sure that x is placed in a position where its opponent has a lower skill. \n\nBut how does this affect subsequent rounds? \n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Let's imagine that for each possible depth (i.e., round), we can determine the possible range of values that x must have in order to survive that round. \n\nFor example, consider the first round (phase 1). If the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the higher of the two in its initial match. So, in that case, x must be larger than the other team in that match. However, since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose that other team to be any value less than x. \n\nBut then, in the next phase (phase 2), the rule could be 0 (lower wins). So, in the next round, x will be facing the winner of another match. For x to win this, depending on the rule of phase 2, x's skill must be either higher or lower than the other competitor. \n\nBut again, since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can model the necessary conditions for x to be able to pass each round. \n\nThis seems similar to building a range of possible values that x must be in for each round, considering the rules of each phase. \n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match. For x to be the champion, it must win all matches along the path from the leaf to the root. \n\nEach match in the tournament is determined by the phase it is in. For example, the first round (phase 1) has matches that are in the first level of the tree. The next round (phase 2) is the second level, and so on. \n\nIn order for x to win all matches, during each phase i (the i-th phase), when x is in a match, the rule for that phase determines whether x must be the higher or lower skill in that match. \n\nBut how can we model the constraints on x's value? \n\nLet me think for each phase. Let's say that during phase i (which is the i-th level of the tournament), the rule is s[i-1] (assuming the string is 0-based). \n\nFor example, in the first phase (i=1), the rule is s[0], in the second phase (i=2), the rule is s[1], etc. \n\nNow, during each phase, the match that x participates in depends on the structure of the tournament. But since we can arrange the permutation p, perhaps we can arrange the other teams in such a way that x can pass each round. \n\nBut how? Let's think recursively. \n\nSuppose we want x to be the champion. Let's consider the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, x must be the winner of its match. \n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each match in the tree requires that x's value is either higher or lower than the other participant in that match, depending on the rule of that round. \n\nBut the other participants in the matches are other teams. Since we can arrange their skill levels, perhaps we can model for each round the required constraints on x. \n\nLet me think of the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to survive each round. \n\nFor example, in the first round, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than its opponent. Since we can arrange the permutation, we can set the opponent's skill to be anything less than x. So, for this round, x must be at least 1 (but since it's a permutation, it's unique). However, in subsequent rounds, x will face other teams that are winners of other matches. \n\nBut how do these other teams' skills compare to x? \n\nLet me think for each round. Let's say that during phase i (the i-th round), the rule is s[i-1]. \n\nIn that phase, x must be the winner of its match. The other participant in that match is the winner of another subtree. \n\nTo ensure that x wins this match, depending on the rule, x must be higher or lower than that other participant. \n\nBut since we can arrange the other participants, perhaps we can model for each round the required constraints. \n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 1), the rule is s[0]. Suppose s[0] is 1. Then, x must be higher than its opponent. So, x must be at least 2 (since the opponent can be 1). But if s[0] is 0, then x must be lower than its opponent. So, x can be 1, but the opponent must be higher. \n\nBut then, in the next round (phase 2), the rule is s[1]. Suppose s[1] is 1. Then, x must be higher than the other winner in that round. But that other winner comes from a different subtree. How can we arrange their skill? \n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model for each round, the minimal and maximal values that x must have in order to survive that round, considering the rules of all previous rounds. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: for x to be the champion, during each phase i (from 1 to n), x must be the \"winner\" in that phase's match. The way to model this is to find for each phase, the required relation between x and the other teams in the same bracket. \n\nAnother approach: think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the number of teams is halved. For x to reach the next round, it must be the winner of its current match. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for a certain round, the rule is '1' (higher wins). Then, in order for x to proceed, it must be the highest in its current group. But since we can arrange the other teams, perhaps we can ensure that all other teams in the group are lower than x. Similarly, if the rule is '0', then x must be the lowest in its group. \n\nWait, but how does this work across multiple rounds? \n\nFor example, consider n=2 (so 4 teams). The first phase (phase 1) has two matches. Suppose s is '10'. \n\nPhase 1: higher wins. Phase 2: lower wins. \n\nFor x to be champion:\n\nIn phase 1, x must be higher than its opponent. Then, in phase 2, x must be lower than the other winner. \n\nBut how can that happen? Let's see. Suppose x is in the first match (teams 1 vs 2). Suppose x is team 1. Then, in phase 1, x must beat team 2. So x's skill is higher than team 2. In phase 2, x will face the winner of teams 3 vs 4. Since phase 2 is lower wins, x must have lower skill than that winner. \n\nBut how can that be? Because in phase 1, x was higher than its opponent. So, for phase 2, the other winner must have higher skill than x. \n\nBut how can we arrange that? Well, for example, suppose x is 3. Then, in phase 1, team 1 (x=3) beats team 2 (skill 2). Then, in phase 2, the other match is between team 3 and 4. Suppose team 3 has skill 4, team 4 has 1. Then, phase 2 is lower wins. So the winner is team 4 (skill 1). But then x (3) would have to beat team 4 (skill 1) in phase 2, which would require that in phase 2, the rule is lower wins. Wait, no. Wait, in phase 2, the rule is lower wins. So, the match between x (skill 3) and the winner of the other match (say, skill 1). Then, the lower skill (1) would win. So x (3) would lose. That's not good. \n\nBut we need x to win. So, for x to win phase 2, the other winner must have higher skill than x. Because phase 2 rule is lower wins. So, in that case, x must be the lower one. So, if x's skill is 2, and the other winner's skill is 3, then x would win. \n\nSo, in this scenario, x must be the lower of the two in phase 2. \n\nSo, in order for x to be the champion, during each phase, x must be the one that wins according to the rule of that phase. \n\nBut how can we model this for all phases? \n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of layers. For each layer (phase), x must be either the minimum or maximum in its current group. \n\nBut the group size doubles each time. Wait, no. For example, in the first phase, each group is two teams. Then, in the next phase, each group is two teams (the winners of two previous groups). So, for each phase i, the group size is 2^{i} teams. Wait, no. The number of rounds is n. Each round halves the number of teams. \n\nBut for the path of x, each round requires that x is the winner of its group. \n\nLet me think recursively. For each round k (from 1 to n), the rule is s[k-1]. \n\nAt round k, the group that x is in consists of 2^{k} teams (but wait, no. The total number of teams in the tournament is 2^n. Each round reduces the number of teams by half. So, in round 1, there are 2^{n}/2 teams, then 2^{n-1}/2 = 2^{n-2}, etc. So, for each round, the group that x is in during that round is 2^{n - (k-1)} teams? Or perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a binary tree with depth n. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match. \n\nFor x to reach the root, it must win all matches along its path from the leaf to the root. Each of those matches is in a different phase. \n\nFor example, the first match (leaf's parent) is phase 1, then the next is phase 2, etc. \n\nSo, for each phase i (from 1 to n), x is part of a match in that phase. \n\nIn that match, depending on the rule s[i-1], x must be the higher or lower of the two in that match. \n\nBut the other participant in that match is the winner of another subtree. \n\nSo, for x to win all matches, during phase i, the other participant in the match must be either higher or lower than x, depending on the rule. \n\nBut how can we model the constraints on x's value? \n\nLet me think of the following approach: For each x, determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to win all rounds. \n\nFor example, during the first phase (phase 1), the rule is s[0]. If s[0] is 1, then x must be the maximum in its initial pair. So, in that pair, x must be higher than the other team. Since we can arrange the permutation, we can set that other team to have a lower value. So, for this phase, x must be at least 2 (since there's another team with lower value). However, if s[0] is 0, then x must be the minimum in its pair. So, x can be 1, and the other team can be higher. \n\nBut then, for the next phase (phase 2), the rule is s[1]. The other participant in that match is the winner of another subtree. To ensure that x wins this match, we need to arrange that the other participant's value is either higher or lower than x, depending on the rule. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nPerhaps, for each phase i, we can track the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have to survive up to that phase. \n\nLet me think of it recursively. Let's say that for each level (phase) i, we can compute the required range of x's value. \n\nFor example, in the first phase (i=1), the required range is:\n\nif s[0] is 1: x must be the maximum in its pair. So, x must be higher than the other team. Since we can arrange the other team to be anything less than x, the minimal possible value for x is 2 (since there's at least one smaller value). However, the upper bound is unbounded except for the overall permutation. But since we are allowed to arrange the permutation, perhaps the upper bound is not a problem as long as x is chosen appropriately. \n\nWait, but this seems too vague. Maybe we need to think of the constraints for each phase in terms of the number of teams that x must be better than or worse than. \n\nAnother idea: For x to be the champion, during each phase i (from 1 to n), x must be the \"winner\" of its group. The size of the group in phase i is 2^{n - i + 1} ? Or maybe not. Let me think. \n\nIn the first phase (i=1), each group is two teams. In the second phase (i=2), each group is two teams (the winners of two groups from the first phase). So, the number of teams in the group for phase i is 2, and the number of teams in the entire tournament in phase i is 2^{n - i + 1} ?\n\nNot sure. But regardless, for x to proceed through each phase, during phase i, it must be the winner of its group. \n\nNow, for each phase, the rule determines whether x needs to be the maximum or minimum in its group. \n\nBut the group for phase i consists of 2^{i} teams? No. Let's think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each match in the tournament is a node. The root is the final match. The leaves are the initial teams. Each node has two children. \n\nThe depth of the tree is n. For example, for n=3, the tree has depth 3. \n\nIn phase i (the i-th phase), the matches are at depth i. \n\nSo, for x to reach the final, it must win matches at depth 1, 2, ..., n. \n\nEach match at depth i has two teams. For x to win that match, depending on the rule of phase i, x must be the higher or lower of the two. \n\nBut the other team in that match is the winner of the subtree rooted at the other child of the current node. \n\nSo, for each such subtree, we can model the constraints on the other team's value. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nLet's think recursively. Suppose that during phase i, the rule is r (either 0 or 1). \n\nIf r is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the higher of the two in the match. Therefore, the other team in the match must be less than x. \n\nBut that other team is the winner of a subtree. For that subtree, during the previous phases (phases 1 to i-1), the other team must have won all matches according to their rules. \n\nSimilarly, if r is 0, then x must be the lower of the two, so the other team must be higher than x. \n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can model for each phase i, the minimal and maximal constraints on x. \n\nFor example, during phase i, if the rule is 1, then x must be greater than all teams in the subtree that the other team comes from. Because during their previous phases, the other team must have been the winner, which depends on the rules of those phases. \n\nWait, but how do we know what constraints apply to the other team's value? \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming. For each node in the tournament tree, and for each possible rule, we can determine the minimal and maximal values that a team must have to be the winner of that subtree. \n\nBut since the tournament is a complete binary tree, perhaps we can model for each depth level and for each possible rule configuration, the required constraints on x. \n\nAlternatively, for a given x, we can simulate the process of determining whether it's possible to arrange the other teams such that x can win all matches. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each x, we can simulate the tournament, assuming that x is the champion, and check if there exists a way to assign the other teams' values such that the rules are satisfied. \n\nBut how to simulate this? \n\nLet's think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the number of teams is 2^{n - (round-1)}. \n\nFor example, round 1 has 2^n teams, round 2 has 2^{n-1}, and so on until round n, which has 2 teams. \n\nBut the problem is that for each round, the way the matches are structured depends on the initial positions of the teams. However, since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the initial positions of the teams in such a way that x can win all matches. \n\nWait, but the initial positions are fixed. The tournament structure is fixed as per the problem statement. The initial pairing is team 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So, the positions are fixed. However, the skill levels of the teams can be arranged as per the permutation. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning the skill levels to the teams such that x is in a position where it can win all matches according to the rules of each phase. \n\nBut how to model the positions? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual positions of the teams in the bracket don't matter, as long as we can arrange their skill levels. Because we can choose the permutation p, which assigns the skill levels to the teams. So, the team that is in the bracket's position (say, position 1) can have any skill level. \n\nTherefore, the key is to find for x, whether there exists a way to assign the skills to the teams such that x is in a path through the tournament where, for each phase, the rules are satisfied. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nLet me think recursively. For each round, during phase i, the team must be the winner of its match. Let's imagine that for each possible depth (number of rounds passed), we can track the constraints on x. \n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 1), if the rule is 1, then x must be the higher of the two in its initial match. So, there exists a team with lower skill. For the second round (phase 2), the rule may be 0. So, x must be the lower of the two in its match. So, the other team must be higher than x. \n\nBut how can we ensure that the other team in the second round is higher than x? Because that other team is the winner of another subtree, which depends on the rules of phase 1 and phase 2. \n\nLet me think of this as a series of constraints. For x to win all matches, during phase i, it must be the maximum or minimum in its current group, depending on the rule. \n\nMoreover, the group size doubles each time. For example, in phase 1, the group is two teams. In phase 2, the group is two teams (the winners of two groups of size 2). In phase 3, the group is two teams (winners of two groups of size 4), etc. \n\nWait, no. Each match in phase i is between two teams that have won their respective matches in phase i-1. So, the group for the match in phase i is two teams. \n\nBut for x to reach phase i, it must have won all previous phases. \n\nSo, for each phase i, the rule determines whether x must be the higher or lower of the two in the match. \n\nBut the other team in the match is the winner of a subtree. For that subtree, the winner must have passed all previous phases according to their rules. \n\nNow, here's an idea: for x to be the champion, during each phase i, x must be either the maximum or minimum in its current group of two teams. \n\nBut the other team in that group must have passed through the previous phases. \n\nSo, for example, during phase 1, if the rule is 1, x must be higher than its opponent. For phase 2, if the rule is 0, x must be lower than its opponent. So, the opponent in phase 2 must be higher than x. But that opponent is the winner of another subtree. For that subtree, during phase 1, the rule is 1, so the opponent must be higher than its own opponent. \n\nBut how can we arrange this? Well, if the opponent in phase 2 is higher than x, and during phase 1, the opponent was higher than its own opponent. \n\nBut since we can choose the permutation, perhaps we can arrange the values of the teams in such a way that these constraints are satisfied. \n\nBut how can we find the possible x's? \n\nLet me think of the constraints for x. \n\nFor each phase i, depending on the rule s[i-1], x must be either the minimum or maximum in its group of two teams in that phase. \n\nLet me define for each phase i, a value that x must be compared to. \n\nFor example, during phase 1, if the rule is 1, x must be the maximum in its group. So, there must be at least one team with lower value. \n\nDuring phase 2, if the rule is 0, x must be the minimum in its group. So, there must be at least one team with higher value. \n\nBut how do these constraints accumulate over the phases? \n\nPerhaps, for each phase i, the required condition is that x must be either the minimum or maximum of a certain number of teams. \n\nFor example, during phase 1, x must be the max of 2 teams. During phase 2, x must be the min of 2 teams (each of which is the max of 2 teams in phase 1). So, x must be the min of two teams, each of which is the max of two teams. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nThis seems similar to building a range of values that x must be in. For example, in phase 1, if the rule is 1, then x must be the maximum in its group. So, x must be higher than at least one other team. \n\nIn phase 2, if the rule is 0, then x must be the minimum in its group, which consists of two teams. One of them is x, and the other is the winner of another subtree. \n\nBut the other team must be higher than x. And that other team is the winner of its subtree. \n\nSo, for that other team to be higher than x, during its own path, it must have been the maximum or minimum depending on the rules. \n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can model the constraints as follows: \n\nFor each phase i, during the tournament, x must be either the maximum or minimum of a certain number of teams. \n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of layers. Each layer corresponds to a phase. For each layer, the number of teams that x must be compared to increases. \n\nFor example, in the first layer (phase 1), x must be the max or min of 2 teams. \n\nIn the second layer (phase 2), x must be the max or min of 2 teams, each of which was the max or min of 2 teams in phase 1. \n\nIn general, for phase i, x must be the max or min of 2 teams, each of which is the result of i-1 phases. \n\nThis seems recursive. \n\nSo, perhaps for each phase i, we can compute the minimal and maximal values that x must have in order to satisfy the rules up to that phase. \n\nLet me try to formalize this. \n\nLet's define for each phase i (starting from 1 to n), the required condition for x. \n\nLet’s denote the current phase as level i. \n\nAt level i, the rule is r_i = s[i-1]. \n\nWe can think of the required condition for x as follows: \n\nIf r_i is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the maximum of the two teams in the match. \n\nIf r_i is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the minimum of the two teams in the match. \n\nBut the other team in the match is the winner of a subtree. \n\nTo model this, we can think recursively. \n\nFor example, suppose during phase i, the rule is 1. Then, x must be the maximum of itself and the other team. The other team must have passed through the previous i-1 phases. \n\nBut what constraints does that impose on the other team? \n\nWell, the other team must be the winner of its own subtree, which depends on the rules of phases 1 to i-1. \n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the other team to be any value that satisfies the constraints of its own path. \n\nBut how can we find the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have? \n\nHere's an idea inspired by the concept of \"range\" for x. \n\nLet's think of for each phase i, the minimal and maximal number of teams that x must be greater than or less than. \n\nAlternatively, for each phase i, we can calculate the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have to satisfy the rules up to that phase. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let’s say that for a given depth (number of phases passed), we can compute a range [low, high] such that x must be within this range to be able to pass through the previous phases. \n\nFor example, starting with depth 0 (no phases passed), the range is [1, 2^n], since x can be any value. \n\nThen, for each phase, we update the range based on the rule. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nInitialize a range [lo, hi] as [1, 2^n]. \n\nFor each phase i from 1 to n: \n\n   if the rule for this phase is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the maximum in its group. This means that x must be greater than the other team in the group. The other team is the winner of another subtree, which must have passed through the previous phases. \n\n   But to ensure that there exists a value for the other team that is less than x, x must be at least (number of teams that must be less than x) + 1. \n\nWait, but how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, for each phase i, if the rule is 1, then x must be the maximum in its group. This group consists of two teams. One is x, the other is a team that must have passed through the previous phases. \n\nTo ensure that x can be the maximum, the other team must be less than x. \n\nBut since we can choose the other team's value, the minimal requirement for x is that there exists at least one value less than x. Which is always true unless x is 1. \n\nBut this doesn't seem sufficient. \n\nWait, but the other team's value must also be able to pass through the previous phases. \n\nSo, perhaps for each phase i, the required condition is that x must be greater than the minimal possible value of the other team, or less than the maximal possible value of the other team. \n\nBut how to find this? \n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using intervals. Let me think recursively. \n\nDefine for each depth i (number of phases passed), the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have. \n\nAt depth 0 (before any phases), the range is [1, 2^n]. \n\nFor each depth i, we process the rule s[i-1]. \n\nLet's think of the current depth as i. \n\nIf the rule is 1 (higher wins), then during this phase, x must be the higher of the two in its group. The other team in the group is the winner of a subtree with depth i-1. \n\nWhat is the range of possible values for that other team? It depends on the rules of the previous phases. \n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can choose the other team's value to be the minimal possible, or maximal possible, depending on the rule. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find for each phase, the minimal and maximal number of teams that x must be greater than or less than. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the solution to similar problems. \n\nFor each phase, depending on the rule, x must be either the minimum or maximum in its current group. \n\nThe group for phase i consists of 2^{i} teams. Wait, no. Each match in phase i has two teams. \n\nBut for x to reach phase i, it must have passed through phases 1 to i-1. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for a certain depth i, the rule is r. \n\nIf r is 1, then x must be the maximum in its group of two teams. The other team in the group must have passed through the previous i-1 phases. \n\nTo ensure that there exists a value for the other team that is less than x, x must be at least (the minimal number of teams that must be less than x) + 1. \n\nBut how to find this minimal number? \n\nAlternatively, think of the number of teams that must be less than x. \n\nFor example, during phase 1, if the rule is 1, then x must be greater than 1 team. \n\nDuring phase 2, if the rule is 0, then x must be less than the other team. But that other team must have passed through phase 1 with rule 1. So, that other team must be greater than 1 team. \n\nSo, for x to be less than this other team, x must be less than some value that is greater than 1 team. \n\nBut since we can arrange the other team's value, perhaps we can choose it to be the minimal possible value that satisfies its own constraints. \n\nThis seems complex. \n\nAnother idea: For x to be the champion, it must be possible to have a path through the tournament where, for each phase, x is the required winner. For this, the number of teams that x must be greater than or less than can be determined based on the rules. \n\nFor example, for each phase i, if the rule is 1, then x must be greater than the number of teams that are in the subtrees that x has to beat. \n\nBut how to calculate that? \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nEach time the rule is 1 (higher wins), x must be the maximum in its current group. This implies that x must be greater than all the teams in the subtree that it has defeated in previous phases. \n\nSimilarly, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), x must be the minimum in its current group, implying it is less than all the teams in the subtree that it has defeated in previous phases. \n\nWait, this might not be accurate. For example, during phase 1, if the rule is 1, x must be greater than its opponent. But during phase 2, if the rule is 0, x must be less than its opponent. This opponent is the winner of another subtree. \n\nBut the winner of that subtree has passed through phase 1 with rule 1, meaning it is greater than its opponent. \n\nSo, for x to be less than this opponent, it must be less than a team that is greater than someone else. \n\nBut since we can choose the values, we can set this opponent to be just slightly higher than x. \n\nBut how to model the number of teams that x must be greater than or less than? \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nFor each phase i, depending on the rule, we can determine how many teams x must be greater than or less than. \n\nFor example, if during phase i, the rule is 1, then x must be greater than the other team in that phase's match. That other team must have passed through phases 1 to i-1. \n\nBut how many teams does that imply x must be greater than? \n\nThis seems to be a recursive problem. \n\nLet's think of it in terms of the number of teams that x must be greater than or less than. \n\nLet me define for each phase i, a value called",

Each round halves the number of teams until only one remains.\n2. **Rules per Phase**: Each phase has a rule (either higher or lower skill level wins). These rules affect how teams progress through each round.\n3. **Constraints on Skill Levels**: For each potential champion, we need to check if there exists a permutation of skill levels such that the team can win all matches according to the given rules. This involves recursively determining the minimum and maximum values a team must have to progress through each phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    s = input[idx]\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    \n    # For each x in 1..total_teams, determine if it's possible\n    result = []\n    \n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        # We need to simulate whether x can be the champion\n        # We'll use a recursive approach with dynamic programming\n        # We'll track for each depth (phase) what is the required min and max\n        # Based on the rules, we'll determine the constraints\n        \n        # Initialize the current range\n        # The idea is that for each phase, we compute the required min and max\n        # For example, during phase i, if the rule is '1', then x must be greater than the other team\n        # which in turn must satisfy the constraints from previous phases\n        \n        # Let's think in terms of ranges for the number of teams that x must be compared against\n        # We can model this with a function that returns the minimal and maximal value x must have\n        \n        # We'll use a helper function to compute the required min and max for each depth\n        def can_win(x, s, n):\n            # For each depth from 1 to n, compute the constraints\n            # Start with the initial range [1, total_teams]\n            low = 1\n            high = total_teams\n            for i in range(n):\n                r = s[i]\n                if r == '1':\n                    # In this phase, x must be the maximum in its group\n                    # So x must be larger than the other team in this match\n                    # The other team is the winner of another subtree, which depends on previous rules\n                    # To ensure this, x must be at least (number of required smaller teams) + 1\n                    # But how?\n                    # For this phase, the other team must be less than x\n                    # Since we can arrange the other team, the minimal requirement is that x can be at least 1 more than the minimal required by previous phases\n                    # But how to model this?\n                    # We need to find the minimal number of teams that x must be greater than\n                    # For example, in phase i, the number of teams that x must be greater than is 2^i - 1\n                    # Because each phase adds another layer of comparison\n                    # Wait, perhaps for each phase, the number of teams that x must be greater than or less than depends on the rules up to that point\n                    # Let me think differently: for each phase, the number of teams that x must be greater than or less than is 2^(i) - 1\n                    # Not sure, but here's an alternative approach:\n                    # For each phase, if the rule is 1, x must be the max in its group of size 2, so x must be greater than the other team\n                    # The other team must have passed through previous phases, and thus must be constrained by those rules\n                    # To ensure that such a team exists, we can adjust the range\n                    # For example, if the current range is [low, high], then after this phase, the new range would be [low_prev + 1, high_prev]\n                    # Because the other team must be < x, so x must be at least low_prev + 1\n                    # Similarly, if the rule is 0, then x must be less than the other team, so x must be at most high_prev - 1\n                    # But this is not accurate, but let's try this approach\n                    # This is inspired by the idea that for each phase, the required constraint tightens the range of x\n                    # Let's try this approach\n                    # For example, if the rule is 1, then x must be larger than the other team, which implies that x must be at least (number of teams that must be smaller) + 1\n                    # However, since we can choose the other team's value, the minimal x can be is 1, but with the previous constraints\n                    # Maybe this approach is not correct, but let's proceed with the following logic:\n                    # For each phase, if the rule is 1, then x must be greater than the other team, so the lower bound increases\n                    # If the rule is 0, then x must be less than the other team, so the upper bound decreases\n                    # But how to calculate how much?\n                    # For example, for each phase, the number of teams that x must be compared against doubles\n                    # For the first phase, it's 1 team, then 2, then 4, etc.\n                    # So, for each phase i, the number of teams that x must be compared against is 2^{i} - 1\n                    # But I'm not sure.
