The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because for a sum to be odd, one has to be even and the other odd. So, if a chest is even, it needs a key that's odd. If the chest is odd, the key must be even. \n\nSo, the approach would be to count how many even and odd chests there are, and similarly count the even and odd keys. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be determined by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. But how exactly?\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say:\n\n- Even chests (a_i even) need odd keys (b_j odd).\n- Odd chests (a_i odd) need even keys (b_j even).\n\nSo, the number of possible pairs for even chests is the minimum between the count of even chests and the count of odd keys. Similarly, the number of possible pairs for odd chests is the minimum between the count of odd chests and the count of even keys. Adding these two gives the total maximum chests that can be opened.\n\nWait, but what if there are more even chests than odd keys? Then, the maximum possible for that part is the number of odd keys. Similarly for the other part. So yes, taking min for each part and adding them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nBut wait, let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9, 11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parity: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1 (7), even_keys = 3 (others). \n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1 (for even chests paired with odd keys). Then, min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output of 3. That works.\n\nSecond example: input is 5 1, chests are 2,4,6,8,10 (all even). Keys is 5 (odd). So even_chests is 5, odd_keys is 1. So min(5,1) is 1. The other part is min(0, 0) since odd_chests is zero. So total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other part: odd_chests is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic seems to hold. Therefore, the solution is to compute these four counts and apply the formula.\n\nSo the steps for code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. Count how many are even and odd.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Count how many are even and odd.\n\nCompute the answer as min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first input is given as a string like ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50'] — but perhaps that's how the user is providing the input for testing. However, in the actual problem, the input is given as per standard input. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given via stdin. So, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows three cases. For example, the first input line is 5 4, then the next lines are the chests and keys. Then another case with 5 1, etc. So, perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, then the second line has the a_i, third line has the b_j. So, perhaps the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but the actual code should process one test case per input. Wait, no. The sample input shows three different test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per one test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is presented as three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one test case. Or maybe the problem is expecting multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m. Then the second line has n integers, third line has m integers. So the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows three different test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per one test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's for multiple test cases. For example, the first line is the first test case's input, then the second line is the second test case's input, etc. But that's not clear. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three strings, each representing a separate test case. The output is a list of three strings, each being the answer for each test case. However, the problem's original input description says that the input is for one test case. So perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases in the input. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But that's probably because the user is showing multiple examples. For example, in the problem statement, the sample input is three different test cases. But the actual code should process one test case. But how?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input and output. The sample input is given as three separate inputs, and the output is three separate outputs. But in the actual problem, when you submit code, it's supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description doesn't mention that. So perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the first test case's input, then the second line is the second test case's input, etc. But that's unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output given in the problem:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['3', '1', '0']\n\nSo each of these is a separate test case. So the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So perhaps the original problem is that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input description is for a single test case. But this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original input and output, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m. Which implies that each test case is given as three lines: first line n and m, then the a_i, then the b_j. So for example, the sample input is three test cases, each with their own three lines. So the code needs to read all test cases. But how does the code know how many test cases there are?\n\nBut the original problem's sample input is given as three test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as per one test case. So perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is not clear. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description may not have mentioned that. But perhaps the problem is from Codeforces or similar, and the actual input is multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m ... \n\nWhich suggests that there's only one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input description is for one test case.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, the first line is the first test case's input, then the second line is the second test case's input, etc. However, the problem's original input description may not have mentioned that. But given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the problem is a single test case. But in the sample input, the code is given three test cases. But how can that be?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases in the input. For example, the code should read until EOF. However, in the problem's original input description, it's not specified. But given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, in Python, reading from stdin, perhaps the code is supposed to read all lines, split them into test cases. However, this is not clear. But looking at the sample input given, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as three lines, and the code needs to process all test cases. However, the problem's original input description may not have mentioned that. But given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement's input description is not clear. But given that the sample input is three test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the number of test cases is given in the input. But in this problem, the sample input shows three test cases, but there's no indication of how many there are. So perhaps the code is supposed to read until EOF. For example, in Python, reading all lines from stdin, and processing each test case as per three lines.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases in the sample input, but the actual problem expects a single test case. For example, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case, and the sample input shows three separate test cases. However, the sample input and output is given as a list of test cases. But the problem's original input is for one test case. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's note, the sample input is given as three examples, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case, and the sample input is just three separate examples. However, the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So the code is supposed to read one test case. But then, why does the sample input show three test cases?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is from a programming contest where the sample input is given as multiple test cases. For example, in some contests, the sample input includes multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description may not mention that. But the code should read all test cases. However, how to know how many test cases there are?\n\nIn this case, perhaps the code should read all test cases until the end of input. For example, in the sample input, each test case is given as three lines. So the code should read lines until there are no more lines left. But how to do that in Python?\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is that the code should process a single test case. And the sample input shows three test cases, but that's just for illustration. For example, the user may have provided three different test cases as examples, but the actual code should process one test case. But the problem's input is for a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first example's input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nThen the second example's input is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nThird example:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nSo each test case is three lines. So the code should read three lines per test case. But how many test cases are there? If the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, then the code needs to read all of them. But the problem's input description doesn't mention that.\n\nBut the problem's original input says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. But regardless, the code needs to be written to process a single test case. Because the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc.\n\nTherefore, the code should read one test case. The sample input shows three test cases, but perhaps that's just for illustration. So, the code will read n and m, then the list of a_i, then the list of b_j, and compute the answer.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute the counts.\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin. However, for large inputs, using sys.stdin is better. But for the purposes of code submission, perhaps the code can read via input().\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen count even and odd in a and b.\n\nSo:\n\neven_chest = 0\n\nodd_chest = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        even_chest +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_chest +=1\n\nSimilarly for keys:\n\neven_key = 0\n\nodd_key = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num %2 ==0:\n\n        even_key +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_key +=1\n\nThen answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nPrint that.\n\nYes. So that's the code. Let's test with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_chest is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chest is 2 (9,11)\n\nb is [8,4,7,20]. even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7). \n\nmin(3,1) is 1. min(2,3) is 2. total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=5, m=1. a is [2,4,6,8,10] → even_chest=5, odd_chest=0. b is [5], even_key=0, odd_key=1. min(5,1) is 1. min(0,0) is 0. total 1.\n\nThird sample: n=1, m=4. a is [10] → even_chest=1, odd_chest=0. b is [20,30,40,50] → even_key=4, odd_key=0. So min(1,0) is 0, min(0,4) is 0. total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all chests are even and all keys are even. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase where some chests and keys are even and odd.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. a is [1], b is [2]. Then a is odd, b is even. So min(1, 1) → 1. Answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. a = [1, 3], b = [2,4]. So odd_chest is 2. even_key is 2. min(2,2) → 2. Answer is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=3. a = [1, 2]. b = [3,4,5]. even_chest is 1 (2), odd_chest is 1 (1). odd_key is 2 (3,5), even_key is 1 (4). So min(1, 2) → 1. min(1, 1) →1. total 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nRead b list.\n\nCount even and odd in a.\n\nCount even and odd in b.\n\nCompute answer.\n\nPrint answer.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nRead the input:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen count:\n\neven_chest = 0\n\nodd_chest = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        even_chest +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_chest +=1\n\neven_key = 0\n\nodd_key = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        even_key +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_key +=1\n\nans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nNow, check for possible edge cases. For example, when n or m is 0? But according to the constraints, n and m are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: when there are zero even chests. For example, all chests are odd. Then the answer depends on the even keys. So min(odd_chest, even_key). Which is handled.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This means that an even chest requires an odd key and an odd chest requires an even key.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Parities**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The number of valid pairs for each type of match is determined by taking the minimum of the counts of respective parities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\nodd_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest += 1\n    else:\n        odd_chest += 1\n\neven_key = 0\nodd_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_key += 1\n    else:\n        odd_key += 1\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of chest numbers `a`, and the list of key numbers `b`.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We iterate through the lists of chest numbers and key numbers to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is calculated by summing the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This ensures we optimally use available keys to open as many chests as possible.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, ensuring it handles the upper constraint limits effectively.",
