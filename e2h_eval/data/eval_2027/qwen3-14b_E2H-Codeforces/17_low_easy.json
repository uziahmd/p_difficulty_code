He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the given prefixes and suffixes. Our job is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists some s that matches these assignments.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the correct assignments. Let's think about what's required for a string to be a prefix or suffix. For example, the original string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input includes all improper prefixes and suffixes, the actual s will have exactly n-1 prefixes (of lengths 1 to n-1) and similarly n-1 suffixes. But the input gives all of them, but mixed up. So our job is to assign which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes, such that there exists a string s that has those as its prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how do we find that?\n\nLet me think. The key observation here is that the original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1. Similarly for suffixes. However, in the input, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So for each length, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo for each length l (from 1 to n-1), exactly one of the two strings of length l is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how can we determine which is which?\n\nLet me think about the case where for each length l, the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l must be such that they agree on the first l characters (for the prefix) and the last l characters (for the suffix). But since the original string s is fixed, the prefix of length l is the first l characters of s, and the suffix of length l is the last l characters of s.\n\nSo, for example, for the longest possible prefix and suffix (length n-1), the prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. Therefore, these two strings must be different (since s is of length n, and the prefix and suffix of length n-1 differ by one character). But in the input, for length n-1, there are two strings. One must be the prefix (the first n-1 characters) and the other the suffix (last n-1 characters). So for the two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So their concatenation would be something like (prefix) + (suffix) = s[0...n-2] + s[1...n-1]. But how can we find which one is which?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to find for each possible candidate of the original string s, check if all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes, and then assign accordingly. But how can we find s?\n\nBut considering that the input is given for a particular s, but we don't know it. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, meaning that there exists at least one s that matches.\n\nSo maybe the approach is to find the correct s by checking which strings could be the prefixes and suffixes. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the original string s must have the property that for each l from 1 to n-1, exactly one of the two strings of length l is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix of s.\n\nSo, for example, for the length n-1, the two strings are the prefix (s[0..n-2]) and the suffix (s[1..n-1]). Therefore, the two strings must be such that the prefix of length n-1 is the first n-1 letters of s, and the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 letters of s. Therefore, if we take the two strings of length n-1, say A and B, then the original string s must be A + last character of B (since the suffix of length n-1 is B, so the last character of B is s[n-1], and the prefix of length n-1 is A, so the first n-1 characters of s are A. So the entire string s would be A concatenated with the last character of B. Alternatively, it could be B concatenated with the last character of A? No, because the suffix of length n-1 is B. So the original string s must end with B. So the entire string is B's first character followed by ... up to the last character. Wait, no. Let's",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct assignments for each string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Original String**: The original string `s` can be reconstructed by considering the longest prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`). The correct original string can be formed by combining the longest prefix with the last character of the longest suffix or vice versa.\n2. **Check Validity**: For each candidate string derived from the longest prefix and suffix, verify if all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate string.\n3. **Assign Roles**: Once the correct candidate string is identified, determine which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes, ensuring that each string is assigned correctly based on its position in the candidate string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Group the strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_dict[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find possible candidates for the original string s\n    # For the longest length (n-1), there are two strings\n    candidates = []\n    max_len = n - 1\n    if max_len in len_dict:\n        lst = len_dict[max_len]\n        for i in range(2):\n            # Try combining prefix and suffix\n            # Case 1: first string is prefix, second is suffix\n            if i == 0:\n                prefix_candidate = lst[0]\n                suffix_candidate = lst[1]\n            else:\n                prefix_candidate = lst[1]\n                suffix_candidate = lst[0]\n            # Construct possible s\n            s1 = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            s2 = suffix_candidate + prefix_candidate[-1]\n            candidates.append(s1)\n            candidates.append(s2)\n    \n    # Now check which candidate is valid\n    valid_s = None\n    for candidate in candidates:\n        # Check if all strings are either prefix or suffix of candidate\n        valid = True\n        for s in strings:\n            if not (s == candidate[:len(s)] or s == candidate[-len(s):]):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            valid_s = candidate\n            break\n    \n    # Now assign P and S based on valid_s\n    result = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if s == valid_s[:len(s)]:\n            result.append('P')\n        else:\n            result.append('S')\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Grouping Strings by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to facilitate processing of prefixes and suffixes of each possible length.\n3. **Generating Candidates**: Potential candidates for the original string `s` are generated by combining the longest prefixes and suffixes.\n4. **Validation**: Each candidate string is validated against all given strings to ensure they are either prefixes or suffixes.\n5. **Assignment**: Once a valid candidate string is found, each input string is checked against the candidate to determine if it is a prefix or suffix, and the result is constructed accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes using logical deductions based on the properties of the original string.",
