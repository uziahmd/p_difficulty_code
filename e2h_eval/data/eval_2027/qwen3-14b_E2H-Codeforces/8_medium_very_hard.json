Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem says that we have an undirected graph with given flows on each edge, and we need to assign directions to these edges such that the flow is valid. The conditions are that for every vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the inflow equals outflow. Also, the source has no incoming edges, and the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. Since the flow is already given (the ci values), the direction assignment needs to satisfy the flow conservation constraints. But how?\n\nLet me think: For each vertex v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows going into it must equal the sum going out. But since the edges are undirected, each edge contributes to either in or out depending on direction. So, for each edge, if we direct it from a to b, then it adds ci to the outflow of a and inflow of b. If we reverse it, then it's the opposite.\n\nBut how do I assign directions so that all these constraints are satisfied?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. So the sum of flows leaving the source must equal the maximum flow. And the sum of flows entering the sink must equal that same value. Also, the flow conservation holds for all other nodes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to directing the edges such that the flow is valid and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how can I model this? One idea is to model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the directions of edges are chosen such that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph must be acyclic, maybe we can find a topological order of the vertices and assign directions based on that. For example, if we have a topological order where the source comes first and the sink comes last, then all edges go from earlier in the order to later in the order. But how does that help with the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow is a valid maximum flow, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is conserved. However, since the original graph is undirected, but we need to assign directions, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of each edge as contributing to the net flow of the nodes. For each node v (other than 1 and n), the total net flow (outflow - inflow) must be zero. Wait, no. Because inflow equals outflow, so net flow is zero. For the source, the net flow is outflow minus inflow equals the total flow (since it's the source). For the sink, it's the opposite. But since the problem says that the source has no incoming edges, all edges adjacent to the source are directed away from it.\n\nSo, the problem requires that for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows going out of it equals the sum of flows coming in. Which is equivalent to saying that the net flow (outflow - inflow) is zero. For the source, the net flow is (outflow - inflow) = total flow (since no inflow). For the sink, the net flow is (inflow - outflow) = total flow.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe we can model this as a flow network and find the direction of each edge such that the flow is valid.\n\nBut since the flows are already given (the ci's), perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. However, solving such a system for large n and m seems computationally intensive.\n\nAlternative idea: The problem requires that the directed graph is acyclic. So perhaps we can build a DAG structure where the edges are directed in a way that allows the flow conservation.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. Let's consider building a DAG where the edges are directed from nodes with lower potential to higher potential. For example, assign a potential (like a topological order) to each node such that for any edge, the direction is from the node with lower potential to higher. Then, the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to assign potentials such that the flow conservation holds?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows going out of v must equal the sum of flows going into v. Which implies that the net flow (sum of outflow - inflow) is zero. But the net flow can be considered as the difference between the sum of flows on edges directed away from v and those directed towards v. Let me denote for each node v, the net outflow as (sum of flows on edges directed away from v) minus (sum of flows on edges directed towards v). For non-source/sink nodes, this must be zero.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's consider that for each edge (u, v), if we direct it from u to v, then it contributes +ci to u's net outflow and -ci to v's net outflow. Alternatively, if we direct it from v to u, then it contributes -ci to u's net outflow and +ci to v's net outflow.\n\nSo, for each node v, the sum over all edges incident to it of (direction * ci) must be zero (for non-source/sink nodes), and for the source, it must be equal to the total flow (since all edges are directed away from it, no inflow). Similarly for the sink, the net outflow is negative of the total flow.\n\nBut how to determine the direction of each edge such that these conditions hold?\n\nThis seems like a system of equations. However, solving such a system for large n and m is not feasible directly. So perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. Let's think of the directed graph as a DAG. In a DAG, we can perform a topological sort. Suppose we assign directions based on a topological order. For example, if we have a topological order where the source is first and the sink is last, then all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes. But how does that help with flow conservation?\n\nBut in that case, for each node v (except source and sink), the inflow must equal outflow. Let's think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v (to later nodes).\n\nHmm. How can we model this? Perhaps we can model this as a problem where we assign directions based on a topological order, and for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it equals the sum of flows on edges directed into it.\n\nBut how to choose the topological order and directions?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree structure. Wait, but the graph can have cycles in the original undirected sense, but after directing, it's acyclic.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's imagine that we can construct a directed graph where each node (except the source and sink) has a net outflow of zero. For that, we can model this as a problem similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but not exactly. Or perhaps, think of the problem as a flow network where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero.\n\nBut the given flows are already part of a maximum flow. So the sum of flows leaving the source is the maximum flow value. Let's denote this value as F. Then, for the sink, the sum of flows entering is F, and the sum of flows leaving is zero.\n\nBut how does this help with assigning directions?\n\nAnother thought: Since the flow is a valid maximum flow, the residual graph has no augmenting paths. But I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a directed graph where for each edge, the direction is determined by the direction of the flow in the original max-flow. But the problem says that Emuskald's algorithm only found the flow volume, not the direction. So the actual flow directions are unknown, but the flow volumes are known.\n\nBut how to reconstruct the directions?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds. Since the flow is already a valid max flow, perhaps we can use some properties of the residual graph or the flow decomposition.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the net flow at each node. For each node v (excluding source and sink), the net flow (outflow - inflow) must be zero. For the source, net flow is F (outflow - inflow). For the sink, it's -F (inflow - outflow).\n\nLet me denote for each node v, the net flow as:\n\nnet_flow[v] = (sum of flows on outgoing edges) - (sum of flows on incoming edges)\n\nFor the source, net_flow[1] = F.\n\nFor the sink, net_flow[n] = -F.\n\nFor others, net_flow[v] = 0.\n\nNow, for each edge (u, v), if we direct it from u to v, then it contributes +ci to net_flow[u] and -ci to net_flow[v]. If directed the other way, it contributes -ci to net_flow[u] and +ci to net_flow[v].\n\nSo, the problem is to assign directions to edges such that the net_flow for each node is as required.\n\nThis looks like a system of equations. However, solving this for large n and m is challenging.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding a directed graph where the net_flow for each node is as required, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the net_flow for each node is fixed. This is similar to finding an orientation of the edges such that the net flow is correct.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation?\n\nAnother observation: The net_flow for each node is fixed. Let me denote for each node v, the required net_flow is:\n\nrequired_net[v] = F if v is source,\n\nrequired_net[v] = -F if v is sink,\n\nrequired_net[v] = 0 otherwise.\n\nNow, the sum of required_net for all nodes must be zero. Let's check:\n\nsum(required_net) = F (source) + (-F) (sink) + 0 for others = 0. Which is correct, since the sum of net flows must be zero.\n\nSo, this is a valid setup.\n\nNow, the problem becomes: Assign directions to edges so that for each node v, the net_flow[v] equals required_net[v], and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAnother idea: Let's model this as a directed graph where each edge contributes to the net_flow. We can think of this as a problem of finding an orientation of edges such that the net_flow is correct.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding an Eulerian orientation. But in that case, for each node, the net flow (out-degree minus in-degree) must be zero. However, in our case, it's not zero for source and sink.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a flow problem again. Let me think: For each node, the required net_flow is known. For each edge, we can decide whether to add +ci to one node and -ci to another. This is similar to a system of equations where variables are the direction choices, and the equations are the net_flow constraints.\n\nBut solving this system for large n and m would be computationally expensive unless there's a clever way.\n\nBut given that the problem states that a solution always exists, perhaps there's a way to construct this.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each edge is bidirectional, and we need to assign a direction to each edge such that the net_flow is correct.\n\nThis is similar to finding a directed graph where the net flow for each node is as required. This can be viewed as a problem of finding a directed graph that satisfies certain constraints on the net flows.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a directed graph where each node has a certain \"excess\" which needs to be balanced by the edges. For example, the source has an excess of F, and the sink has -F. All other nodes have zero.\n\nThen, the problem is to orient the edges such that the excess is balanced. This is similar to the problem of finding an orientation of edges such that the net outflow of each node matches its required value.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach, perhaps using a DFS or BFS traversal, maintaining the required net flow.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where we process the nodes in some order, and for each node, we direct the edges to balance the required net flow.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a node v with a current imbalance. We can look at the edges connected to v and direct them in a way that reduces this imbalance.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nLet's think of the net_flow as a variable for each node. Initially, the net_flow is set to the required value (F for source, -F for sink, 0 otherwise). For each edge, when we direct it from u to v, we subtract ci from u's net_flow and add ci to v's net_flow. Wait, no. Because the net_flow for u is (outflow - inflow). When you direct the edge from u to v, the outflow increases by ci, so net_flow increases by ci. Similarly, for v, net_flow decreases by ci (since inflow increases by ci, outflow remains same, so net_flow is outflow - inflow, which decreases by ci).\n\nWait, the net_flow for u is (outflow - inflow). If we direct the edge u→v, then outflow increases by ci (so net_flow increases by ci), and for v, inflow increases by ci (so net_flow decreases by ci). Therefore, for each edge, directing it from u to v changes the net_flow of u by +ci and v by -ci. If we reverse the direction, it's the opposite.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign directions to edges so that after all assignments, the net_flow for each node is as required.\n\nLet me think of this as a system where for each node, the net_flow starts at required_net, and each edge's direction affects the net_flow of two nodes. We need to adjust the directions to make all net_flow zero (except source and sink).\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a spanning tree. For example, if we construct a spanning tree rooted at the source, and direct the edges in the tree to satisfy the flow conservation. Then, handle the remaining edges as part of the tree.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. Suppose we construct a DAG where the edges are directed in such a way that they form a tree-like structure. For example, build a directed tree from the source to the sink, and direct edges accordingly.\n\nBut how to ensure flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where we can perform a topological sort. Once we have a topological order, we can process the nodes in that order and assign directions to the edges connected to them.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. Compute the required net_flow for each node. For the source, it's F, for the sink it's -F, others zero.\n\n2. Choose a topological order of the nodes. However, since the directed graph is acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in such an order. But how to choose this order?\n\nAlternatively, build a directed graph that is a DAG and assign directions based on that. But how?\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a directed graph and perform a DFS traversal, directing edges in a way that maintains the net_flow constraints. Here's an outline:\n\n- Start with the source node. The required net_flow for the source is F. All edges connected to the source must be directed away from it (since the source has no incoming edges). So, for each edge connected to the source, we direct it away from the source. This will contribute to the net_flow of the source and the adjacent nodes.\n\n- For example, consider an edge between source (u) and another node v. Directing it from u to v adds ci to the net_flow of u (which is F) and subtracts ci from the net_flow of v. So after this, the net_flow of u decreases by ci (since we've accounted for that flow), and v's net_flow is now -ci (since it's the inflow from u).\n\nBut wait, the initial required_net for u is F. After directing the edge u→v, the net_flow of u is F - ci (because we've accounted for that flow). Wait, no. The net_flow is initially F. By directing the edge u→v, we have that the net_flow for u is increased by ci (as per earlier analysis)? Wait, no. Earlier analysis said that directing the edge u→v increases the net_flow of u by ci. But the required_net for u is F. So, after directing this edge, the net_flow of u would be F + ci? That doesn't make sense because the required_net is F. Wait, I think I might have messed up the earlier analysis.\n\nLet me re-express this:\n\nThe net_flow for a node is (sum of flows on outgoing edges) - (sum of flows on incoming edges). So, if we have an edge between u and v, and we direct it u→v, then u's outgoing increases by ci, so net_flow increases by ci. v's incoming increases by ci, so net_flow decreases by ci.\n\nBut the required_net for u is F (source). So, after directing the edge u→v, the net_flow of u is F + ci? That can't be right. Because the required_net is F. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. The required_net is the target value. The initial net_flow for each node is zero. Wait no, no. The required_net is the target value. So, initially, before any edges are directed, the net_flow for each node is zero. Then, by directing edges, we adjust their net_flow to reach the required_net.\n\nAh! That's a crucial mistake. The initial net_flow for all nodes is zero. Then, each direction choice changes the net_flow of the nodes involved.\n\nSo, the goal is to have, after all edges are directed, that the net_flow of each node is equal to the required_net.\n\nSo, for example, the source node's required_net is F. So, during the process of directing edges, we need to ensure that the net_flow of the source ends up being F.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of this as a system where for each edge, we have to choose a direction, and each choice affects the net_flow of the two endpoints.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph where we need to find an orientation of edges such that the net_flow for each node is as required.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation?\n\nLet me think of this as a problem similar to the Eulerian trail. For example, in an undirected graph, an Eulerian trail exists if all nodes have even degree. But here, the situation is different.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow problem where each edge can carry flow in one direction or the other, and the net flow for each node must be as required.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nLet me consider the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in such a way that the net flow for each node is correct. To achieve this, perhaps we can use a DFS-based approach, processing each node and adjusting the directions of edges connected to it to balance the net flow.\n\nLet me outline this approach:\n\n1. Compute the required_net for each node (F for source, -F for sink, 0 otherwise).\n\n2. For each node, keep track of the current net_flow (initially zero).\n\n3. Perform a traversal (like DFS or BFS) starting from the source. For each node, process its edges, and direct them in a way that reduces the discrepancy between the current net_flow and the required_net.\n\nFor example, suppose we are processing node u, and its current net_flow is not equal to the required_net. We can look at edges connected to u that haven't been processed yet. For each such edge (u, v), we can direct it in a direction that helps balance the net_flow.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of this step-by-step. Suppose we have a node u that is currently having a net_flow of current_flow. The required_flow for u is required_flow. The difference between current_flow and required_flow is delta = current_flow - required_flow. We need to adjust this delta to zero by directing edges.\n\nIf we have an edge between u and v, and we direct it from u to v, then the net_flow of u increases by ci, and v's net_flow decreases by ci. Conversely, directing it from v to u would decrease u's net_flow by ci and increase v's by ci.\n\nSo, for example, if u's current_flow is less than required_flow, then we need to increase its net_flow. So, directing edges from u to others would help. But if we direct an edge from u to v, that increases u's net_flow by ci, which brings it closer to the required_flow.\n\nBut how to choose which edges to direct?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, during traversal, whenever we visit a node, we process its edges to balance its current net_flow.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nWe can perform a DFS traversal starting from the source. For each node u visited:\n\n- While u's current net_flow is not equal to required_flow:\n\n   - Find an edge (u, v) that hasn't been directed yet.\n\n   - If directing this edge from u to v would help bring u's current_flow closer to required_flow, then direct it that way. Otherwise, direct it the other way.\n\nBut how to decide which direction to take?\n\nLet's say the current net_flow of u is current_flow. The required_flow is req_flow. The delta is current_flow - req_flow.\n\nIf delta is positive, then u's net_flow is too high. We need to reduce it. To do that, we can direct edges from u to other nodes, which would decrease u's net_flow by ci (no, wait, no. Wait, directing an edge u→v increases u's net_flow by ci. Wait, no. Earlier analysis said that directing u→v increases u's net_flow by ci. So, if the current_flow is higher than required_flow, we want to decrease u's net_flow. So, we should direct edges in the opposite direction, i.e., from v to u. Because that would decrease u's net_flow by ci (since directing v→u would add ci to u's inflow, which reduces the net_flow by ci).\n\nAlternatively, let's think of this as follows:\n\nIf we need to decrease u's net_flow, then we want to direct edges into u (i.e., from other nodes to u), which would subtract from u's net_flow. Or, more precisely, if we direct an edge from v to u, then u's net_flow increases by ci (because the edge is outgoing from v to u, so for u, the inflow increases by ci, which reduces net_flow (outflow - inflow) by ci. Wait, no:\n\nIf the edge is directed from v to u, then for u, this is an incoming edge. So, the net_flow for u is (outflow - inflow). The inflow increases by ci, so net_flow decreases by ci. Thus, the net_flow of u decreases by ci.\n\nSo, if the current_flow of u is higher than required_flow, we need to decrease it by directing edges into u. So, for example, if there's an edge between u and v, and we direct it from v to u, then u's net_flow decreases by ci.\n\nSimilarly, if the current_flow is lower than required_flow, we need to increase it by directing edges out of u (u→v), which increases u's net_flow by ci.\n\nBut how to find such edges? We can process the edges connected to u and direct them in a way that helps balance the current_flow.\n\nBut this approach may require backtracking, which could be computationally expensive for large graphs.\n\nHowever, given that the graph is connected and the problem states that a solution exists, perhaps we can proceed greedily.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Compute the required_net for each node.\n\n- Initialize current_net for all nodes as 0.\n\n- For each edge, we need to decide its direction. Let's process edges in a way that allows us to balance the current_net of the nodes.\n\nBut how to process the edges?\n\nPerhaps, during a traversal (like DFS or BFS), for each node, we process its edges and direct them to balance the current_net.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart with the source node (node 1). Its required_net is F. Initially, current_net is 0. So, we need to increase it by F. How?\n\nWe can direct all edges connected to the source away from it. Each such edge contributes +ci to the source's current_net. So, for each edge from source to v, directing it as source → v adds ci to current_net of source. This would help increase it towards F.\n\nOnce we've processed all edges from the source, the current_net of the source may be adjusted. Then, we move to other nodes connected to the source and process their edges.\n\nBut this approach may not work for all cases. For example, what if there are multiple edges connected to the source and the sum of their ci's is more than F?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the given flows are part of a valid maximum flow. So the sum of flows leaving the source must be equal to F, which is the maximum flow. So the sum of all edges directed away from the source should be exactly F. But how can we ensure that?\n\nWait, but in this approach, the current_net for the source is initially 0. Each time we direct an edge away from the source, we add ci to its current_net. So after directing all edges connected to the source, the current_net of the source would be sum of ci's of all edges connected to it. But according to the problem's setup, this sum should be F. But how?\n\nWait, the given flows are part of a maximum flow. So the sum of flows on edges leaving the source (after directing them) should be equal to the maximum flow F. But how can we know what F is?\n\nAh, right! We don't have F given. But the sum of flows leaving the source must be F, and the sum of flows entering the sink must be F. However, since the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow, the sum of flows on edges incident to the source (directed away) must be F. But how to compute F?\n\nWait, the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. So, the sum of flows on edges leaving the source (after directing them) is F, and the sum of flows on edges entering the sink (after directing them) is F. But how can we find F?\n\nBut since the flow is maximum, the sum of flows leaving the source is equal to the sum of flows entering the sink. However, since the given flows are the flow values, perhaps F is the sum of all flows leaving the source in the directed graph. But since we don't know the directions yet, how can we compute F?\n\nThis seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. We need to know F to determine the required_net for the source and sink, but F depends on the directions of the edges connected to the source and sink.\n\nThis suggests that this approach may not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the flow is a valid maximum flow, the sum of flows leaving the source equals the sum of flows entering the sink. Let's call this value F. However, since we don't know F, but the problem says that the solution exists, perhaps we can find F by considering the net flows.\n\nWait, but the problem gives us the flow values for each edge. The sum of flows on edges incident to the source (but directed away from it) is F. Similarly, the sum of flows on edges incident to the sink (directed into it) is F.\n\nBut since we don't know the directions, how to find F?\n\nThis seems impossible unless there's another way to compute F. However, the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. Therefore, the sum of flows on edges incident to the source (when directed away) must be F. But without knowing the directions, how can we compute F?\n\nThis seems like a dead end. So perhaps we need to find another approach.\n\nLet me think again about the net_flow for each node. The required_net for the source is F, and for the sink it's -F. For others, zero. But the sum of all required_nets is zero.\n\nBut how to find F? Well, F is the sum of flows leaving the source, which is also the sum of flows entering the sink.\n\nBut without knowing the directions, how can we find F? It seems that we cannot. Unless there's another way to derive F from the given data.\n\nWait, perhaps F can be derived from the flow conservation. For example, the sum of flows leaving the source is F. But the flow conservation for other nodes requires that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows leaving v equals the sum of flows entering v. This means that the sum of flows leaving the source is equal to the sum of flows entering the sink.\n\nBut how to find F?\n\nMaybe F can be computed as the sum of flows on edges incident to the source, but directed away. But again, without knowing the directions, this is not possible.\n\nBut perhaps F is determined by the flow conservation in the entire graph. Let me think about the entire graph.\n\nThe total flow leaving the source is F. The total flow entering the sink is F. All other nodes have zero net flow. So, the total flow leaving the source is F, which is also the total flow entering the sink. But how to find F?\n\nThis seems like a problem that requires knowing the flow values. However, the given flow values are the ones used in the maximum flow. But how?\n\nWait, the given flow values are the flows on each edge. The sum of flows on edges incident to the source (directed away) is F. The sum of flows on edges incident to the sink (directed into it) is F. But since the edges are undirected, each edge is counted once in either the source's or sink's incident edges, or not.\n\nBut this seems like a circular dependency.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the given flows form a valid maximum flow, the total flow F is equal to the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. But since we don't know the directions, how to calculate it? It seems impossible unless there's another way.\n\nWait, but the sum of flows on all edges incident to the source is equal to F plus the sum of flows on edges directed into the source. But since the source has no incoming edges, all edges incident to the source must be directed away from it. So, the sum of flows on edges incident to the source is F. Therefore, F is simply the sum of all flows on edges incident to the source. Because those edges must be directed away from the source, contributing to F.\n\nAh! This is a key insight. Because the source has no incoming edges, all edges incident to the source must be directed away from it. So, the sum of their flows is the total flow F.\n\nYes! Because the source's required_net is F. And since all edges incident to the source are directed away from it, their contribution to the net_flow of the source is +ci for each such edge. So the sum of these ci's is F.\n\nTherefore, F can be computed as the sum of ci for all edges incident to the source.\n\nThis is a crucial point. So, for example, if there are multiple edges connecting the source to other nodes, their flows are summed to give F. This allows us to compute F.\n\nOnce F is known, we can compute the required_net for each node.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute F as the sum of all flows on edges incident to the source (node 1).\n\n2. For each node v, required_net[v] is F if v is source, -F if v is sink, else 0.\n\nNow, with this, we can proceed to assign directions to edges.\n\nNow, the problem becomes to assign directions to edges such that the net_flow for each node is as required, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph, and for each edge, we need to assign a direction. To ensure that the directed graph is acyclic, we can perform a topological sort. But how to ensure that the flow conservation is satisfied during this process?\n\nHere's an idea inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic: build a directed tree structure where each node is processed in a topological order, and edges are directed from parent to child in the tree. For non-tree edges, we can direct them in a way that maintains the acyclic property.\n\nBut how to build such a tree while ensuring the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where we perform a DFS traversal, and for each edge, we direct it in a way that helps balance the net_flow of the nodes.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Compute F as the sum of flows on edges incident to the source.\n\n- Compute required_net for each node.\n\n- Initialize current_net for all nodes as 0.\n\n- For each edge incident to the source, direct it away from the source. This will add ci to the current_net of the source, and subtract ci from the current_net of the adjacent node.\n\n- Now, for the source, its current_net is F (since all edges are directed away from it), which matches required_net.\n\n- For other nodes, their current_net is initially adjusted by the edges connected to the source.\n\n- Proceed to process other nodes. For each node u (starting with those connected to the source), if its current_net is not equal to required_net, we need to adjust it by directing edges connected to it.\n\nLet me think of this as a BFS traversal. We can use a queue to process nodes whose current_net is not yet balanced. For each node u in the queue:\n\n- While current_net[u] != required_net[u]:\n\n   - Find an edge (u, v) that is not yet directed.\n\n   - If current_net[u] > required_net[u], we need to decrease it. This can be done by directing the edge from v to u (so that u's net_flow decreases by ci).\n\n   - Else, we need to increase current_net[u], so direct the edge from u to v (increasing current_net[u] by ci).\n\n   - After directing the edge, update current_net for u and v.\n\n   - Add v to the queue if its current_net is not balanced.\n\nBut how to choose which edge to process?\n\nThis seems like a viable approach. Let's think through an example.\n\nExample from the first input:\n\nInput:\n3 3\n3 2 10\n1 2 10\n3 1 5\n\nThe source is 1, sink is 3.\n\nEdges are:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2 with c=10\n\nEdge 2: 1-2 with c=10\n\nEdge 3: 3-1 with c=5\n\nF is the sum of flows on edges incident to source (node 1). These are edge 2 (1-2, c=10) and edge 3 (3-1, c=5). Wait, but edge 3 connects 3 and 1. Since the source is 1, this edge is incident to the source. So F = 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nRequired_net for source (1) is 15, sink (3) is -15, and node 2 is 0.\n\nInitially, current_net for all nodes is 0.\n\nProcess edges incident to source:\n\nFor edge 2 (between 1 and 2): direct from 1 to 2. This adds 10 to current_net[1], subtracts 10 from current_net[2]. Now current_net[1] = 10, current_net[2] = -10.\n\nFor edge 3 (between 3 and 1): direct from 1 to 3. Adds 5 to current_net[1], subtracts 5 from current_net[3]. Now current_net[1] is 15 (which matches required_net), current_net[3] is -5.\n\nNow, the queue contains node 2 and node 3.\n\nProcessing node 2: required_net is 0. current_net is -10. Need to increase by 10.\n\nLook for an edge incident to node 2 that is not yet directed. Edge 1 (3-2, c=10) is not directed yet.\n\nDirect it from 2 to 3. This increases current_net[2] by 10 (now 0), decreases current_net[3] by 10 (now -5 -10 = -15). Now, current_net[3] is -15, which matches required_net. So node 3 is processed.\n\nThus, the directions are:\n\nEdge 2: 1→2 (0), edge 3: 1→3 (0), edge 1: 2→3 (0). But wait, the output in the example is:\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nWait, the first example's output is:\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\nFor edge 3-2 (original input is first edge), output is 1, meaning direction is bi→ai (so 2→3).\n\nFor edge 1-2 (second edge), output is 0, meaning ai→bi (1→2).\n\nFor edge 3-1 (third edge), output is 1, meaning bi→",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the direction of each edge in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation constraints and is acyclic. The key steps involve computing the maximum flow value from the source to the sink, then using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to direct edges while maintaining flow conservation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Compute Maximum Flow Value (F)**: The maximum flow value from the source (vertex 1) to the sink (vertex n) can be determined by summing the flows of all edges incident to the source.\n2. **Flow Conservation Constraints**: For each vertex, except the source and sink, the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows. The source must have no incoming edges, and the sink must have no outgoing edges.\n3. **Direction Assignment Using BFS**: Using BFS, we process each node to adjust the direction of edges such that the flow conservation constraints are satisfied.
