    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, let's note that when you add k to both a and b, the two numbers become a + k and b + k. Let me denote x = a + k and y = b + k. Then, since x and y differ by (b - a), assuming a and b are given. Wait, but if a and b are different, then x and y will differ by (b - a) if a < b, or (a - b) otherwise. But maybe I should think about the difference between the two numbers. Let's say d = |a - b|. Then, when we add k, the difference between x and y is still d. Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So, the difference between the two numbers is fixed as d = |a - b|.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y, which differ by d, such that their LCM is minimized. And then find the minimal k that achieves this.\n\nBut how to find such x and y?\n\nThe LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). Since their difference is fixed, perhaps we can find the optimal x and y by considering their GCD. Because for a fixed difference, the LCM is minimized when the GCD is as large as possible.\n\nLet me think. Suppose x and y have a GCD of g. Then, x = g * m, y = g * n, where m and n are coprime. The difference between x and y is g*(m -n) = d. So, g must be a divisor of d. Because d is fixed, the maximum possible g is d. But if that's possible, then the LCM would be (g*m * g*n)/g = g*m*n. Since m and n are coprime. And since m -n = d/g. Let me think. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose d is 4. Then, if we can find x and y such that their GCD is 4. For example, x=4 and y=8. Then their LCM is 8. But if the difference is 4, then another possibility is x=6, y=2. Their LCM is 6. But here, the GCD is 2, which is less than 4. So in that case, the LCM is lower. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. So maybe my initial reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-examine. For two numbers with a fixed difference d, how to minimize their LCM.\n\nLet me think of x and y such that x = y + d. Then, their LCM is LCM(y +d, y) = LCM(y, d). Because LCM(y +d, y) = LCM(y, d) since y +d - y =d. So, LCM(y +d, y) = LCM(y, d). Therefore, the problem reduces to finding y such that LCM(y, d) is minimized. Then, the minimal LCM is achieved when y is chosen such that LCM(y, d) is as small as possible. But since d is fixed, perhaps we can find the optimal y.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the original problem is that x = a +k and y = b +k. Let me assume that a < b. Then, the difference between y and x is (b -a) = d. So, y = x + d. So, the LCM of x and x +d is LCM(x, x +d) = LCM(x, d). Because x and x +d have a difference of d, so their GCD is GCD(x, d). Therefore, LCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/GCD(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/GCD(x, d). But since x +d = x +d, and GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Therefore, the LCM is x*(x +d)/gcd(x, d). But since x +d = y, and d is fixed, perhaps we can find x such that this value is minimized.\n\nAlternatively, since the LCM of x and x +d is equal to LCM(x, d) multiplied by (x +d)/d? No, not sure. Let me think again. Let me take x and x +d. Let me call them m and n. Then, LCM(m, n) = m * n / GCD(m, n). But since m = x and n = x +d. So, GCD(m, n) = GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Therefore, LCM(m, n) = (x (x +d)) / GCD(x, d).\n\nBut since x +d = y, and d is fixed. So the problem reduces to choosing x such that (x (x +d)) / GCD(x, d) is minimized. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since d is fixed, perhaps we can think of x as being some number, and we want to minimize the LCM of x and x +d. But this seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal choice is to find x such that x is a multiple of d. Because then, GCD(x, d) is d. So LCM(x, x +d) is (x (x +d))/d. But if x is a multiple of d, then x = m*d. Then, x +d = (m+1)*d. So their LCM is m*(m+1)*d. Which is minimized when m is as small as possible. So for example, m=0 gives x=0, x +d =d. Then LCM is 0? No, but x can't be zero because x = a +k, and a is at least 1. So k can be negative? No, k must be non-negative. So x = a +k >= a >= 1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, a and b are given as positive integers. So x and y are positive integers as well. So, in the case where a and b are different, d is their absolute difference. Let me assume that a < b, so d = b -a. Then, x = a +k, and y = x +d. So, to find the minimal LCM of x and x +d.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x such that x is >= a (since k >=0), and then find the minimal LCM(x, x +d) for x >=a.\n\nBut how to find this x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is as small as possible. But that might not be the case. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample input: 6 and 10. So d = 4. So a=6, b=10. So x = 6 +k, and y = 10 +k. The difference is 4. We need to find x and y such that their LCM is minimized. \n\nIn the sample, k=2 gives x=8, y=12. LCM(8, 12) is 24. Let's see other possibilities. For example, if k=0: x=6, y=10. LCM is 30. If k=1: x=7, y=11. LCM is 77. If k=2: 8 and 12: LCM 24. If k=3: 9 and 13: LCM 117. If k=4: 10 and 14. LCM is 70. So the minimal is indeed 24. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because x is 8, which is a multiple of d=4. Then, x +d is 12, which is also a multiple of 4. So their LCM is 24. \n\nSo, perhaps the optimal approach is to find the minimal possible value of LCM(x, x +d), where x >= a, and d is the absolute difference between a and b. \n\nSo, how can we find this x? Well, the minimal LCM occurs when x is such that x and x +d share as large a GCD as possible. Because LCM(x, x +d) = (x * (x +d)) / GCD(x, x +d). So, if GCD(x, d) is large, then the denominator is large, leading to smaller LCM.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the optimal approach is to find the largest possible GCD between x and d. Let me think. Since GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). So, to maximize this GCD, we need to find x such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d. Let me think. For example, if d is 4, then the divisors are 1, 2, 4. The maximum possible GCD(x, d) is 4. So, if x is a multiple of 4, then the GCD is 4. Then, the LCM(x, x +d) is (x (x +d))/4. Which is (x (x +4))/4. For x = 8, this is 8*12/4 = 24. For x = 4, it would be 4*8/4=8. But x has to be at least a. In the sample, a is 6. So x can't be 4. So the next possible x is 8.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the minimal possible LCM by choosing x such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. \n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is 0, then a = b, so adding any k gives a +k and a +k, so LCM is a +k. To minimize this, choose k=0. So output 0.\n\n2. Otherwise, for d>0, we need to find x such that x is >= min(a, b) (since k is non-negative), and x +d is the other number. Wait, no. Let me clarify. Let's suppose a < b. Then, x = a +k, and y = x +d. So, x must be >=a. So, the minimal x is a (when k=0). \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Find all possible divisors of d, and for each divisor g, find the minimal x such that x is congruent to 0 mod g, and x >= a (if a is the smaller one). Then compute the LCM for that x, and find the minimal one.\n\nWait, but why? Because if x is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) is at least g. So, for each divisor g of d, we can try to find the minimal x that is a multiple of g, and then compute the corresponding LCM.\n\nBut how do we find the best g?\n\nFor example, for d=4, the divisors are 1, 2, 4. For each of these, we can find the minimal x that is a multiple of g and x >= a (assuming a is the smaller number). Then, compute LCM(x, x +d) for each such x and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, the optimal x is the one that makes x and x +d have the largest possible GCD, which is equivalent to finding the largest possible divisor g of d, and then find the minimal x that is a multiple of g and x >=a. \n\nWait, but for example, for d=4, if we take g=4, then x is the smallest multiple of 4 that is >=a. If a is 6, then x is 8. For g=2, the x would be the smallest multiple of 2 >=6, which is 6. Then, x=6, x +d=10. Their LCM is LCM(6,10) = 30. Which is larger than 24. So, taking the largest possible g gives better results.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFind all the divisors of d, sorted in descending order. For each divisor g, compute the minimal x which is a multiple of g and x >= a (assuming a is the smaller number). Then, compute the LCM for that x and x +d. Among all these possibilities, find the one with the minimal LCM, and if there are multiple, the minimal k.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a and b are not ordered? Let's say a is larger than b. Then, d = a -b, and the same logic applies, but x is b +k, and the other number is x +d. So, regardless of which is larger, the difference is d, and the same approach applies.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFirst, compute d = abs(a - b). If d is 0, then return 0.\n\nElse, find all divisors of d. Then for each divisor g (sorted in descending order), compute the minimal x that is a multiple of g and x >= min(a, b). Then, for that x, the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / g. Then, among all these possible candidates, find the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple candidates have the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest x (which would correspond to the smallest k).\n\nWait, but how do we get the minimal k? Because x is a +k (if a is the smaller one). So, for example, if a is the smaller one, then k = x -a. So, for each candidate x, we can compute k as x -a (assuming a is the smaller one). But if a is larger than b, then the minimal x is b +k, and x = b +k. Then, the other number is x +d = (b +k) + (a -b) = a +k. So, the same logic applies.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nLet m = min(a, b), M = max(a, b). Then, d = M - m.\n\nWe need to find x >= m such that x is a multiple of some divisor g of d. Then, the LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x +d))/g. The minimal LCM corresponds to the minimal value of this expression.\n\nBut how to find the best x for each divisor g of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d, the minimal x that is a multiple of g and >= m is:\n\nx = ceil(m / g) * g.\n\nBut if m is already a multiple of g, then x = m. Otherwise, x is the next multiple.\n\nOnce x is determined, then the corresponding k is x - m. Because m is the original min(a,b), and x = m +k.\n\nOnce we have all these candidates, we can compare their LCMs and select the best one.\n\nBut why do we need to check all divisors of d? Because the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So, by checking all possible divisors, we can find the optimal x.\n\nBut what about divisors that are not the maximum? For example, maybe a higher g gives a better LCM, but perhaps for some cases, a lower g could give a better LCM. However, since the LCM is (x*(x +d))/g, and for higher g, the denominator is bigger, which would lead to smaller LCM. So, perhaps the best approach is to check all divisors of d, sorted in descending order, and for each, compute the x and the corresponding LCM, and find the minimal one.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return 0.\n\nElse, generate all divisors of d. For each divisor g (sorted in descending order), compute x as the smallest multiple of g that is >= m (where m is min(a, b)). Then, compute the LCM for x and x +d, which is (x * (x +d)) // g. Then, among all these candidates, find the one with the minimal LCM. If there are multiple candidates with the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest x (so the smallest k).\n\nBut why do we need to check all divisors? Because for example, if d is 4, and m is 6. Then, the divisors are 4, 2, 1. For g=4, x is 8. For g=2, x is 6. For g=1, x is 6. So, the LCM for g=4 is 8*12/4 = 24. For g=2, it's 6*10 / 2 = 30. For g=1, it's 6*10 / 1 = 60. So the best is g=4.\n\nBut what if m is 5? Then for g=4, the x is 8. For g=2, x is 6. For g=1, x is 5. Then, for g=2, LCM is 6*10/2=30, for g=4, 8*12/4=24, for g=1, 5*9=45. So again, best is g=4.\n\nAnother example: suppose d=6. Suppose m is 4. Divisors are 6, 3, 2, 1. For g=6, x=6. LCM is (6*12)/6=12. For g=3, x is 6 (since 4/3 is 1.33, so next multiple is 3*2=6). LCM is (6*12)/3=24. For g=2, x is 4*2=4? Wait, m is 4, and g=2. So x is 4, which is a multiple of 2. Then, x +d = 4 +6=10. LCM(4, 10) is 20. Which is better than 24. Wait, but according to the formula, (x*(x +d))/g = (4*10)/2 = 20. Which is better than the 12 for g=6? No, 12 is better. So why is that?\n\nBecause for g=6, x is 6. LCM is 6 * 12 / 6 = 12. Which is better than 20. So, in this case, even though the g=3 and g=2 give higher x's, the higher g gives better LCM.\n\nSo, the idea is that for higher g's, even if the x is larger, the LCM may be smaller. Hence, we need to check all divisors of d, sorted in descending order, and find the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nGenerate all divisors of d, sorted in descending order. For each divisor, compute x as the minimal multiple of g that is >= m. Then compute the LCM for that x. Then, among all those candidates, find the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple candidates have the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest x (so the smallest k).\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. What if there exists a x not aligned with any divisor of d, but gives a better LCM? For example, let's say d=6, m=5. The divisors are 6,3,2,1.\n\nFor g=6, x is 6. LCM is (6 * 12)/6 = 12.\n\nFor g=3, x is 6. LCM is (6*12)/3=24.\n\nFor g=2, x is 6 (since 5//2 is 2.5, so next multiple is 6). LCM is (6 * 12)/2 = 36.\n\nFor g=1, x is 5. LCM is (5 * 11)/1 = 55.\n\nBut what if x is 5, which is not aligned with any divisor. Well, for x=5, the GCD(x, d) is GCD(5,6)=1. So the LCM is 5*11 /1=55. Which is worse than 12. So, the minimal is achieved with g=6.\n\nAnother example: suppose d=6, m=4. For g=3, x=6. LCM is 6*12/3=24. But what if x is 3? But x has to be >= m=4. So x can't be 3. So, the minimal x for g=3 is 6. \n\nAnother example: d=6, m=3. For g=6, x=6. LCM is 6*12/6=12. For g=3, x=3. LCM is 3*9/3=9. Which is better. So, here, the higher g (6) gives a worse LCM than a lower g (3). So why?\n\nBecause when x is chosen as the minimal multiple of g (which for g=3 is 3, which is >= m=3), and then the LCM is (3 * 9)/3 = 9. Which is better than 12. So, this shows that considering higher g's first isn't sufficient. Because in this case, even though 3 is a smaller divisor than 6, but it gives a better LCM.\n\nSo, this suggests that our approach of checking all divisors and comparing their corresponding LCMs is necessary, regardless of the order. But how to handle that?\n\nAh, but the way we generate the divisors is that we need to check all of them. So, even if we process them in descending order, but in this example, the higher g (6) gives a worse LCM than lower ones (like 3). So, we need to check all divisors, and find the minimal LCM.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to generate all divisors of d, compute for each the corresponding x and the LCM, and then select the minimal LCM among all these candidates. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|. If d ==0, return 0.\n\n- Else, generate all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g of d:\n\n   - compute x as the smallest multiple of g that is >= m (where m is min(a, b)).\n\n   - compute the corresponding LCM (x * (x +d)) // g.\n\n   - record (LCM, k) where k = x - m.\n\n- Also, we need to consider the case where x is m itself. Because maybe m is not a multiple of any g, but for some other reason, it's better. Wait, but m is included in the calculation for the divisors. For example, if m is a multiple of some g, then x will be m. Otherwise, x is the next multiple.\n\nBut perhaps there's another candidate. For example, suppose d=6, m=3. For g=3, x is 3. For g=6, x is 6. But what about x=3? For that x, the LCM is 3 * 9 / 3 = 9. For x=6, the LCM is 6 * 12 /6 = 12. So, the minimal is 9. So, considering all divisors is needed.\n\nThus, the code needs to generate all the divisors of d, process each one, and find the best candidate.\n\nNow, the problem is how to generate all the divisors of d efficiently. Since d can be up to 1e9, but generating all divisors can be done in O(sqrt(d)) time.\n\nOnce the divisors are generated, for each of them, compute x as the minimal multiple of g >= m. Then compute the LCM and track the minimal.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? For example, could there be a case where x is not a multiple of any divisor of d, but gives a better LCM?\n\nWell, since the GCD(x, d) must be a divisor of d, then for any x, the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. Therefore, the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is one of the divisors of d. Therefore, the optimal x (the one that gives the maximum possible GCD(x, d)) must be a multiple of some divisor of d. Hence, considering all the divisors of d and finding the best x for each is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute m = min(a, b), M = max(a, b). d = M - m.\n\nIf d is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, generate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\n   compute x = ((m + g -1) // g) * g. This is the ceiling division.\n\n   compute the LCM as (x * (x +d)) // g.\n\n   compute k_candidate = x - m.\n\n   keep track of the minimal LCM and the minimal k.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, select the candidate with the minimal LCM, and if there are ties, the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, what about other possible candidates? For example, if there is a x which is not aligned with any divisor of d, but gives a better LCM. But according to previous reasoning, this is not possible. Because the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d, so for that x, the GCD is a divisor of d, and hence, the candidate for that divisor would have been considered.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate all divisors of d.\n\nHow to generate all divisors of a number d?\n\nThe standard method is to factorize d into primes, then generate all combinations of exponents. But for d up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, we can find all divisors by checking up to sqrt(d). For each i from 1 to sqrt(d), if i divides d, add i and d/i to the list of divisors. Then, remove duplicates and sort.\n\nSo, code to generate all divisors:\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(d)) +1):\n\n        if d % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(d//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for the code, we need to generate all divisors, then process them.\n\nOnce we have the list of divisors, for each, compute x and the LCM.\n\nBut then, after processing all divisors, we have to find the candidate with the minimal LCM and the minimal k.\n\nBut what about the case when d is zero? That's handled first.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample 1: 6 and 10. m=6, M=10. d=4. divisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor each divisor:\n\ng=4: x = ((6 +4-1)//4)*4 = (9//4)=2 *4= 8. LCM is (8 * 12)/4 = 24. k=8-6=2.\n\ng=2: x is ((6 +2-1)/2)*2 = (7//2)=3*2=6. LCM is (6*10)/2 = 30. k=0.\n\ng=1: x is ((6 +1-1)/1)*1 = 6. LCM is (6*10)/1=60. k=0.\n\nSo the minimal is 24, with k=2. Correct.\n\nSample 2: input is 21 and 31. m=21, M=31. d=10. divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\nProcessing each:\n\ng=10: x = ((21 +10-1)//10)*10 = (30//10) =3 *10=30. LCM (30 *40)/10 = 120. k=30-21=9.\n\ng=5: x is ((21 +5-1)/5)*5 = (25//5)=5*5=25. LCM (25*35)/5 = 25*7=175. k=4.\n\ng=2: x is ((21 +2-1)/2)*2 = (22//2)=11*2=22. LCM (22 * 32)/2 = 22 * 16 = 352. k=1.\n\ng=1: x is 21. LCM (21 * 31)/1 = 651. k=0.\n\nThe minimal LCM is 120, achieved with k=9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample: input 5 and 10. m=5, M=10. d=5. divisors are 1,5.\n\ng=5: x is ((5 +5-1)/5)*5 = (9//5)=1*5=5. LCM (5*10)/5 = 10. k=0.\n\ng=1: x=5. LCM (5*10)/1=50. So the minimal is 10 with k=0. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where a = b. Output is 0.\n\nCase where d is 1. For example, a=2, b=3. d=1. divisors are 1. x is 2. LCM is 2*3/1=6. k=0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=5. d=2. divisors are 1, 2.\n\nFor g=2: x is ((3 +2-1)/2)*2 = (4//2)=2*2=4. LCM is (4*6)/2 = 12. k=1.\n\nFor g=1: x is 3. LCM is 3*5=15. So the minimal is 12 with k=1.\n\nAnother case: a=4, b=6. d=2. divisors are 1,2.\n\ng=2: x is ((4 +2-1)/2)*2 = (5//2) = 2*2=4. LCM (4*6)/2 = 12. k=0.\n\nWhich is better than for g=1, which gives x=4, LCM 4*6=24. So the answer is k=0.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAnother case: a=7, b=10. d=3. divisors are 1,3.\n\nFor g=3: x is ((7 +3-1)/3)*3 = (9//3)=3*3=9. LCM (9 * 12)/3 = 36. k=9-7=2.\n\nFor g=1: x=7. LCM is 7*10=70. So minimal is 36, k=2.\n\nBut what if there's another x that is not a multiple of 3 but gives a better LCM? For example, x=8. Then, LCM(8, 11) is 88. Which is worse than 36.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the code as follows:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute m = min(a, b), M = max(a, b). d = M - m.\n\nif d == 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   generate all divisors of d.\n\n   for each divisor g in divisors:\n\n      compute x = ((m + g -1) // g) * g\n\n      compute current_lcm = (x * (x +d)) // g\n\n      compute k_candidate = x - m\n\n      keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the minimal k.\n\n   after all divisors are processed, select the candidate with the smallest current_lcm. if multiple candidates have same lcm, select the one with smallest k.\n\nBut how to generate the divisors.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut first, the code needs to generate all divisors of d. Let's write a function for that.\n\nBut in Python, for d up to 1e9, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) +1):\n\n        if d % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n\n    return divisors\n\nBut note that math.isqrt is available in Python 3.8+, which returns the integer square root. Alternatively, use int(math.sqrt(d)) + 1.\n\nOnce we have the divisors, we can process them.\n\nNow, for each divisor, compute x.\n\nBut what about the case where the same divisor is processed multiple times? For example, if d is a perfect square, but the set takes care of that.\n\nOnce we have the set of divisors, we can iterate through them.\n\nBut for the code, we need to process all divisors, and for each, compute the x and the LCM.\n\nOnce all candidates are collected, find the one with minimal LCM, and minimal k.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nm = min(a, b)\n\nM = max(a, b)\n\nd = M - m\n\nif d == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = float('inf')\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        # compute x as the smallest multiple of g >= m\n\n        # x = ceil(m / g) * g\n\n        # which can be written as ((m + g -1) // g) * g\n\n        x = ((m + g -1) // g) * g\n\n        current_lcm = (x * (x + d)) // g\n\n        k_candidate = x - m\n\n        # compare with current min_lcm\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_k = k_candidate\n\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n            if k_candidate < best_k:\n\n                best_k = k_candidate\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but what about the case where there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? For example, two different divisors leading to same LCM but different k. The code checks for that.\n\nBut let's test the code on the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput 6 10: d=4. divisors are {1,2,4}.\n\nProcessing each:\n\nFor g=4: x=8, current_lcm= (8*12)/4=24. best_k=2.\n\nFor g=2: x=6, current_lcm= (6*10)/2=30. Not better.\n\nFor g=1: x=6, current_lcm=6*10=60. Not better. So best_k is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 21 31. d=10. divisors are {1,2,5,10}.\n\nProcessing:\n\ng=10: x = ((21 +10-1)//10)*10 = (30//10)*10=3*10=30. current_lcm= 30*40 /10 = 120. k=9.\n\ng=5: x = ((21 +5-1)/5)*5 = (25//5)*5=5*5=25. current_lcm=25*35 /5 = 175. So worse than 120.\n\ng=2: x is ((21 +2-1)/2)*2 = (22//2)*2=11*2=22. current_lcm= 22*32 /2 = 352. Worse.\n\ng=1: x=21. current_lcm=21*31=651. Worse. So best is 9.\n\nSample 3: 5 and 10. d=5. divisors are 1,5.\n\ng=5: x= ((5 +5-1)/5)*5 = (9//5)=1*5=5. current_lcm=5*10/5=10. k=0.\n\ng=1: x=5. current_lcm=5*10=50. So best is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=10. d=3. divisors are 1,3.\n\nFor g=3: x is ((7 +3-1)/3)*3 = (9//3)*3=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. If there are multiple values of $ k $ that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest $ k $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Difference**: Calculate the absolute difference $ d $ between the two integers $ a $ and $ b $. If $ a $ equals $ b $, the answer is trivially 0 because adding any $ k $ will result in the same value for both numbers.\n2. **Generate Divisors**: For the difference $ d $, generate all its divisors. These divisors help in determining potential values for $ k $ that might minimize the LCM.\n3. **Evaluate Candidates**: For each divisor $ g $ of $ d $, compute the smallest value $ x $ that is a multiple of $ g $ and is at least the minimum of $ a $ and $ b $. This value $ x $ helps in calculating the corresponding $ k $ and the LCM of $ x $ and $ x + d $.\n4. **Select Optimal $ k $**: Track the minimum LCM found and the corresponding $ k $, ensuring to handle ties by selecting the smallest $ k $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    return divisors\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    m = min(a, b)\n    M = max(a, b)\n    d = M - m\n    if d == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        # Compute x as the smallest multiple of g >= m\n        x = ((m + g - 1) // g) * g\n        current_lcm = (x * (x + d)) // g\n        k_candidate = x - m\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if k_candidate < best_k:\n                best_k = k_candidate\n    \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Divisors Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` generates all divisors of $ d $ by iterating up to the square root of $ d $, which ensures efficiency even for large values of $ d $.\n- **Candidate Evaluation**: For each divisor $ g $, we compute the smallest multiple of $ g $ that is at least the minimum of $ a $ and $ b $. This value is used to determine the corresponding $ k $ and the LCM of the adjusted values of $ a $ and $ b $.\n- **Optimal Selection**: By iterating through all divisors and evaluating their contributions, we ensure that we find the minimal LCM and the smallest $ k $ in case of ties.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down potential candidates for $ k $ using mathematical properties of divisors and LCM, ensuring optimal performance even for large input values.",
