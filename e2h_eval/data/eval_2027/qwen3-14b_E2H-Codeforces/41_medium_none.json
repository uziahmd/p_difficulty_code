There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the tallest house in a certain interval [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all restrictions.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Since n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is feasible. But even then, for each of the n houses, there are h+1 possibilities. For n=50 and h=50, that's 51^50 possibilities. Which is way too big. So brute-force is impossible here.\n\nAlternative idea: think of this as a constraint satisfaction problem where each restriction imposes a maximum on the maximum in a range. How can I model these constraints?\n\nAnother thought: for each house, the maximum possible height it can have is determined by the restrictions that apply to it. But since restrictions are about ranges, a single restriction might affect multiple houses. For example, if there's a restriction on [1,3], then the maximum of those three houses must be <= x. So each of them can be up to x, but at least one of them must be exactly x (if we want to maximize the profit). Wait, no. Actually, the maximum of the range is the maximum of all the houses in that range. So for the restriction to hold, the maximum of those houses must be <= x_i. So for each restriction, the maximum in that interval is constrained.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum of the houses in that interval must be <= x_i. So the problem is to assign heights to each house, such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nThis seems like an optimization problem with constraints. How can I model this?\n\nSince n is small (up to 50), perhaps a dynamic programming approach isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe we can model this with backtracking, trying possible heights for each house while checking constraints. But even with n=50, that's too slow unless we can prune the search effectively.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node represents a house, and the constraints are that certain ranges have their maximums limited. But I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nWait, another angle: For each house, the maximum possible height it can have is min(h, all x_i from restrictions that include this house in their interval). Wait, no. Because a restriction applies to a range. For example, a restriction on [1,3] with x=2 would mean that all houses in 1-3 can't be higher than 2. Because the max of that range has to be <= x. So if any of the houses in that range is higher than x, the restriction is violated. Therefore, for each restriction, all houses in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. Wait, no! Wait, that's not correct. Because the maximum of the range must be <= x_i. That means that all houses in that range must be <= x_i. Because if even one house is higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction. Therefore, each restriction implies that for all positions in [l_i, r_i], their height is <= x_i. Because if any of them is higher than x_i, the maximum would be higher than x_i. So each restriction is equivalent to imposing that each house in [l_i, r_i] has height <= x_i.\n\nWait, that's a crucial insight. Because if a restriction says that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is at most x_i, then each individual house in that interval must be at most x_i. Because if any of them is higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i. Therefore, the restriction can be converted into per-house constraints. For example, for each house j, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of h and all x_i from restrictions where j is in [l_i, r_i].\n\nWait, but that's only true if the restriction is applied. For example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then each house in 1-3 must be <= 2. However, if there's another restriction on [2,2] with x=3, then house 2 can be up to 3. But since the first restriction requires house 2 to be <=2, the effective maximum for house 2 is min(2,3) = 2. So for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum between h and all x_i of the restrictions that cover that house.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because each restriction that includes a house in its interval imposes an upper bound on that house's height. So for each house j, the maximum height it can have is the minimum between h and all x_i of the restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i] interval.\n\nIf this is correct, then the problem simplifies to: for each house j, compute its maximum possible height, which is the minimum of h and all x_i from restrictions that apply to it. Then, set each house to that maximum height, and sum their squares.\n\nBut wait, why is that correct? Because if we set each house to the maximum possible allowed by the restrictions, then all the restrictions are satisfied. Because for any restriction [l_i, r_i], each house in that interval is at most x_i (since that's part of the calculation for their maximum). Therefore, the maximum in the interval is <=x_i. So the restriction is satisfied.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each house, find the minimal x_i among all restrictions that cover that house, and then take the minimum between that and h. Then, set each house to that value. Then sum the squares.\n\nWait, but what if there are overlapping restrictions? For example, suppose there's a restriction [1,2] with x=3, and [1,1] with x=2. Then for house 1, the maximum allowed is min(2,3) = 2. House 2 is allowed up to 3. Then the maximum in [1,2] is 3, which is allowed. But if we set house 1 to 2, and house 2 to 3, that's okay.\n\nYes. So the approach would be: for each house j, collect all restrictions that include j in their interval. For each such restriction, the x_i is an upper bound on the height of j. So the maximum possible height for j is the minimum of h and the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include j. Then, set each house to that value. Then the total profit is the sum of squares.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no restrictions that cover a particular house? Then the maximum height is h, since there's no restriction on it. So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems like a straightforward approach. Let me test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput is 3 3 3, with restrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → house 1 must be ≤1.\n\n2 2 3 → house 2 ≤3.\n\n3 3 2 → house 3 ≤2.\n\nSo for each house, their max is 1, 3, 2. So the sum is 1² +3² +2² = 14. Which matches the example.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → houses 2 and 3 must be ≤8.\n\n3 4 7 → houses 3 and 4 must be ≤7.\n\nSo for house 1: no restrictions. So max is 10.\n\nHouse 2: only the first restriction applies, so 8.\n\nHouse 3: both restrictions apply. The min of 8 and 7 is 7.\n\nHouse 4: second restriction applies, so 7.\n\nSo the heights are [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach works for the examples.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each house, compute the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include that house. Then, take the minimum between that and h. Then sum the squares.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple restrictions that apply to a house. For example, if a house is covered by two restrictions with x_i=3 and x_i=5. Then the minimum is 3. So the house can be set to 3, which is allowed.\n\nSo this approach would work. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n- For each house j (from 1 to n), compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i]. If there are no such restrictions, then the maximum is h. Then, the height of j is min(max_x, h), where max_x is the minimal x_i from the restrictions covering j.\n\nThen sum the squares of all heights.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nFor each house j in 1..n:\n\n   collect all restrictions where l_i <= j <= r_i.\n\n   find the minimal x_i among those restrictions.\n\n   if there are no such restrictions, then the max is h.\n\n   else, the max is min( h, min_x )\n\nThen sum the squares.\n\nWait, but why is that sufficient? Because for any restriction [l_i, r_i], the maximum x_i for that restriction is the minimal x_i for the houses in that interval. So for each house in the interval, the max is <= x_i. Therefore, the maximum in the interval is <= x_i. Because all houses in the interval are <= x_i. Therefore, the restriction is satisfied.\n\nYes. So this approach works.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions, store l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nFor each house j in 1..n:\n\n   min_x = h (initial value, since if no restrictions apply, it's h)\n\n   for each restriction:\n\n      if l_i <= j <= r_i:\n\n          if x_i < min_x:\n\n              min_x = x_i\n\n   then, the height is min_x (since it's already min between h and the min x_i of the restrictions that apply to j).\n\nWait, no. Because the initial min_x is h, and then for each restriction that applies to j, we check if x_i is smaller than current min_x. So after processing all restrictions, min_x will be the minimum of all x_i of the restrictions that apply to j, and h. Because if there are no restrictions, then min_x remains h. Otherwise, it's the minimum of the x_i's and h? No, because h is the initial value. For example, if a restriction has x_i larger than h, then min_x would be h. Because the initial value is h, and then for each restriction that applies to j, x_i could be larger than h, but then min_x would remain h. So the code would be:\n\nfor each house j:\n\n   max_allowed = h\n\n   for each restriction:\n\n      if l_i <= j <= r_i:\n\n          if x_i < max_allowed:\n\n              max_allowed = x_i\n\n   height_j = max_allowed\n\nSo the height is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of the restrictions that cover j.\n\nYes. Because for each restriction that covers j, x_i is an upper bound. So the minimal x_i is the tightest upper bound. But if that minimal x_i is larger than h, then h is the upper bound. Because the house can't be higher than h anyway.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me test this with the first example.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → applies to j=1. So max_allowed for j=1 is min(3, 1) = 1.\n\nSecond restriction: 2 2 3 → applies to j=2. So max allowed is min(3, 3) = 3.\n\nThird restriction: 3 3 2 → applies to j=3. So max allowed is min(3, 2) = 2.\n\nSo sum 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → applies to j=2 and 3.\n\n3 4 7 → applies to j=3 and 4.\n\nFor j=1: no restrictions. So max allowed is 10.\n\nj=2: restriction 1 applies. x_i is 8. So max allowed is 8.\n\nj=3: both restrictions apply. The x_i's are 8 and 7. So min is 7. So max allowed is 7.\n\nj=4: restriction 2 applies. x_i is 7. So max allowed is 7.\n\nSo sum is 10^2 + 8^2 +7^2 +7^2 = 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if a restriction has x_i larger than h?\n\nFor example, n=1, h=2, m=1. Restriction is l=1, r=1, x=3. Then, the max allowed is min(2, 3) = 2. So the height is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: if there are two restrictions on the same interval. For example, n=2, h=5, m=2. Restrictions [1,2,3], [1,2,4]. Then for each house, the min x_i is 3. So both houses can be set to 3. Sum is 3^2 +3^2 = 18.\n\nAnother case: overlapping restrictions. Suppose n=3, h=5, m=2. Restriction 1: [1,3], x=4. Restriction 2: [2,2], x=5. So for j=1: restriction 1 applies, x=4. So max allowed is 4. For j=2: min between 4 and 5 is 4. So allowed is 4. For j=3: restriction 1 applies, allowed 4. So sum is 4^2 *3 = 48.\n\nBut what if the restriction is [1,3] x=4, and [1,3] x=5. Then for each house, the min x is 4. So the maximum allowed is 4.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nTherefore, the approach is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead the input. For each of the m restrictions, store them as a list. Then for each house j from 1 to n, check all restrictions to see if j is in [l_i, r_i]. For those that do, track the minimal x_i. Then the height is min between h and that minimal x_i.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, read the input. The first line is n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of inputs, like in the example. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of strings. But in reality, the code should read from stdin. Oh, the user provided the sample input as a list of strings, but the actual code should read from standard input.\n\nSo the code needs to read from stdin. Let me think about the input format.\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read the first line, split into n, h, m. Then read m lines.\n\nBut for the code, the input may be given via multiple lines. So the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\nThen, for each house j in 1..n:\n\nmax_allowed = h\n\nfor each restriction in restrictions:\n\n    l, r, x = restriction\n\n    if l <= j <= r:\n\n        if x < max_allowed:\n\n            max_allowed = x\n\nso the height for j is max_allowed.\n\nThen sum all (height)^2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nRead m restrictions.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor j in 1 to n:\n\n    current_max = h\n\n    for each restriction in restrictions:\n\n        l, r, x = restriction\n\n        if l <= j <= r:\n\n            if x < current_max:\n\n                current_max = x\n\n    total += current_max ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, that's all? Yes.\n\nSo let's test this code with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor j=1:\n\ncurrent_max = 3.\n\nCheck each restriction:\n\nFirst restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1. Since j=1 is in [1,1], x=1 < 3 → current_max becomes 1.\n\nOther restrictions don't apply. So current_max is 1. Add 1.\n\nFor j=2:\n\ncurrent_max = 3.\n\nCheck restrictions. Second restriction applies (l=2, r=2, x=3). So x is 3, which is same as current_max. So no change. So current_max remains 3. Add 9.\n\nFor j=3:\n\ncurrent_max = 3. Third restriction applies (l=3, r=3, x=2). So current_max becomes 2. Add 4. Total is 14. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nFor j=1:\n\nNo restrictions apply. current_max is 10. Add 100.\n\nj=2:\n\nCheck restrictions. First restriction applies (l=2, r=3). x=8. current_max is 8. So add 64.\n\nj=3:\n\nCheck both restrictions. First restriction (x=8) and second (x=7). So current_max is min(8,7) → 7. Add 49.\n\nj=4: check restrictions. Second restriction applies (l=3, r=4). x=7. So current_max is 7. Add 49. Total is 100 + 64 +49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=1. Restriction is 1 1 3. So the max allowed is 3. Sum is 9.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, h=5, m=1. Restriction is 1 2 3. Both houses are allowed up to 3. Sum is 3^2 * 2 = 18.\n\nAnother case: n=2, h=5, m=2. Restriction 1: 1 1 4, restriction 2: 2 2 3. So house 1 is allowed 4, house 2 allowed 3. Sum 16 +9 =25.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each restriction imposes a limit on the tallest house within a specific range. The goal is to determine the optimal heights for each house to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the house heights.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each restriction specifies that the tallest house within a given range must not exceed a certain height. This implies that every house within that range must be at most the specified height.\n2. **Determine Maximum Heights**: For each house, determine the minimum height restriction that applies to it. This is done by checking all restrictions that cover the house and taking the minimum value among them. If no restriction applies, the maximum height is simply the given maximum height.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once the maximum allowable height for each house is determined, compute the profit as the sum of the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    restrictions = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n    \n    total = 0\n    for j in range(1, n + 1):\n        current_max = h\n        for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n            if l <= j <= r:\n                if x < current_max:\n                    current_max = x\n        total += current_max ** 2\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, starting with the number of houses, the maximum allowed height, and the number of restrictions.\n2. **Storing Restrictions**: All restrictions are stored in a list for later processing.\n3. **Processing Each House**: For each house, determine the maximum allowable height by checking all restrictions that apply to it. The maximum allowable height for each house is the minimum value of the restrictions that include the house, or the given maximum height if no restrictions apply.\n4. **Calculating Total Profit**: The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the maximum allowable heights for each house.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the constraints efficiently. The complexity is manageable due to the small input size constraints (up to 50 houses and restrictions), making a straightforward check for each house feasible.",
