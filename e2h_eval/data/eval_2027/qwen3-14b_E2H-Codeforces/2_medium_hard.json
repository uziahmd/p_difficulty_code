Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is an n x n grid, where n is odd. For example, n=5, 3, etc.\n\nThe steps I need to perform:\n\n1. Check that all elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are the same.\n2. Check that all elements on the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n3. Also, check that the two diagonals have the same character. Because if the main diagonal is 'x' and the anti is 'y', then it's invalid.\n4. Then, check all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same, and that they are different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, find the characters on the diagonals.\n\nFor the main diagonal: positions (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal: positions (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut since n is odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking, we need to make sure that all elements in both diagonals are the same. However, since the center is part of both, the two diagonals must have the same character. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then that's okay. But if one is 'x' and the other is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo first step: collect all the characters from both diagonals and check that they are all the same. But wait, the two diagonals may have overlapping elements (the center cell). So, perhaps collect all the elements from both diagonals and check that they are all the same. But since the center is part of both, the main diagonal and anti-diagonal must have the same character.\n\nWait, but for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x' and the anti-diagonal has all 'x', then all elements in both diagonals are 'x'. So that's okay.\n\nSo the first check is: all elements on both diagonals are the same. How to do that?\n\nLet me collect all the elements from both diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. But since the center element is counted twice, but that's okay. For example, for n=3, the center cell is (1,1), which is part of both diagonals. So when collecting, the list would have 3 elements for the main diagonal (positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)), and 3 elements for the anti-diagonal (positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)). So combining them, the total elements would be 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 elements (since (1,1) is counted twice). But in that case, the combined list would have all elements from both diagonals. But for checking, all elements in that combined list must be the same. Wait, but the main diagonal and anti-diagonal may have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti is all 'y', then the combined list would have x, x, x, y, y, y (but overlapping at the center). Wait no, in the case of n=3, the main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the combined list would be [ (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) ]? Or maybe collect all unique positions. But perhaps the easiest way is to collect all the elements in both diagonals, and check that they are all the same. However, in the case of the center cell, it's part of both diagonals. So for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x', and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then all elements are x. So that's correct.\n\nSo the first step is to check that all elements in both diagonals are the same. How?\n\nLet me collect all the elements from the main diagonal and anti-diagonal. Then check that all of them are the same.\n\nBut how to collect them? For each cell in the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, collect their characters. Then check that all are equal.\n\nBut for example, in the case of n=3, the main diagonal is 3 elements, the anti-diagonal is 3 elements, but the center is part of both. So the combined list would have 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 elements. But perhaps it's easier to collect all elements from the main diagonal and then all elements from the anti-diagonal, and check that all of them are the same. However, for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, the center is included in both. So for example, in the case where the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then all elements are 'x'.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nCollect all the elements in the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal. Then check that all of them are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n\nOnce that is done, then check all the other cells (those not on the diagonals) are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nSo how to check that?\n\nFirst, for each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it is on either of the two diagonals. If not, then check that it's equal to 'other_char', which is different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to find 'other_char'? Well, all non-diagonal cells must be the same. So collect all non-diagonal cells and check that they are all the same, and also that they are different from d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 cells. The total cells is 9, so non-diagonal is 4. So there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Collect all the diagonal elements (main and anti) into a list. Check that all elements in this list are the same. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Collect all non-diagonal elements into another list. Check that all elements in this list are the same. Also check that this value is different from the diagonal's value.\n\nIf both conditions are met, then output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this.\n\nSo, how to collect the diagonal elements and non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to check if a cell is on either diagonal.\n\nFor a cell (i,j):\n\nIt is on the main diagonal if i == j.\n\nIt is on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. Else, it's not.\n\nSo for each cell, check if it is on either of the diagonals.\n\nSo, for the first part, collect all the elements that are on either diagonal. Then check that all of them are same.\n\nBut perhaps, for the first part, we can check all the elements in the main diagonal and anti-diagonal. However, for the main diagonal, we can iterate i from 0 to n-1, and take (i,i). For the anti-diagonal, iterate i from 0 to n-1, and take (i, n-1 -i). Then collect all those elements. But since the center is part of both, we can collect all of them and check that they are all same.\n\nBut for example, in the case where the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then all elements are 'x'.\n\nSo, the code for step 1:\n\nCheck that all elements in the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are same.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me create a set for the diagonal elements. For example, for each cell in the main and anti diagonals, collect their characters. Then check that the length of the set is 1.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][i])\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][n-1 -i])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    return NO\n\nBut wait, this would collect all the elements from both diagonals. So for example, in the case where the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then the set will have size 1. So that's correct.\n\nBut if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'y', then the set would have size 2. So that's invalid.\n\nBut what if the main diagonal has some 'x' and 'y', but the anti-diagonal has 'x's? For example, if the main diagonal has some variation, then the set would have multiple elements. So the code would catch that.\n\nYes. So that's the first check.\n\nOnce that is done, we need to check the non-diagonal elements.\n\nSo, for all cells (i,j) not on either diagonal, collect their characters. Check that all are same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, for that, first, collect all non-diagonal elements. Then check that all are same. Also, check that they are different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to get the diagonal's character. Since the set is of size 1, we can take any element from the set. For example, d_char = grid[0][0], but perhaps better to take the first element of the set.\n\nBut in code, for example:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nBut wait, in the case where the main and anti-diagonal have same elements, but maybe the first element is not part of the diagonals? No, because grid[0][0] is part of the main diagonal. So yes.\n\nSo, once the first check passes, the diagonal characters are all same. So, d_char is the character of the diagonals.\n\nThen, collect all non-diagonal characters. Let's create another set, non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut for that, for each cell (i,j), check if it's not on the diagonals. Then collect their characters.\n\nBut for that, for each i and j:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        else:\n            add grid[i][j] to non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut then, check that len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1, and that the only element is different from d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal elements? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are 9 - 5 = 4 non-diagonal elements. So for all n >=3, there are non-diagonal elements.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n            continue\n        non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    return NO\n\nelse:\n    other_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n    if other_char == d_char:\n        return NO\n    else:\n        return YES\n\nBut wait, how to get d_char? Because in the first step, we have a set of diagonal_chars, which has only one element. So, d_char can be taken as diagonal_chars.pop().\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the grid as a list of strings.\n\nCheck:\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal elements (main and anti) into a set. If the size is not 1, return NO.\n\nElse, d_char is the element in that set.\n\nThen collect all non-diagonal elements into another set. If the size is not 1, return NO.\n\nElse, check if that element is different from d_char. If yes, return YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, in the first step, the code may have a problem. For example, when the grid is:\n\nn=3, and the main diagonal is all 'x', and the anti-diagonal is all 'x'. So the set for the diagonals is {'x'}, which is correct.\n\nBut what if the code for the first step is:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][i])\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][n-1 -i])\n\nBut for n=3, the main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So for each i, adding grid[i][i] and grid[i][n-1 -i]. So for i=0, adding (0,0) and (0,2). For i=1, adding (1,1) and (1,1) (since n-1 -1 is 1). For i=2, adding (2,2) and (2,0). So the set includes all the elements of both diagonals. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the first step is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about possible test cases.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal:\n\n(0,0) x; (1,1) x; (2,2) x; (3,3) x; (4,4) x. All x?\n\nBut row 2, column 2 is x. So main diagonal is all x.\n\nAnti-diagonal:\n\n(0,4) x; (1,3) x; (2,2) x; (3,1) x; (4,0) x. All x. So the diagonals are all x. So the first check passes.\n\nThen check non-diagonal elements.\n\nLooking at row 0: positions (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are o, o, o. Are they part of the non-diagonal?\n\nYes. For row 0, j=0 is diagonal (i==j). j=4 is diagonal (i +j = 0+4=4 = 5-1? n is 5. So n-1 is 4. So 0+4=4 equals 4. So yes. So (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are non-diagonal. Their values are o, o, o.\n\nRow 1: (1,0) is non-diagonal (i=1, j=0: 1+0=1 !=4, and i !=j). So the value is o. (1,2) is o. (1,4) is o. So those are non-diagonal. But the row 1 is o x o x o. So for j=0, 2, 4 are non-diagonal? Let me check:\n\nFor i=1, j=0: i +j = 1, which is not 4. And i != j. So yes, non-diagonal. Similarly j=2: 1+2=3 !=4. So yes. j=4: 1+4=5 !=4. So yes. So for row 1, the non-diagonal elements are o, o, o.\n\nRow 2: the row is s o x o o.\n\nFor i=2, j=0: i +j = 2+0=2 !=4. So non-diagonal. Value is s. j=1: i=2, j=1. i !=j, i+j=3 !=4. So non-diagonal. value o. j=3: i +j = 2+3=5 !=4. So non-diagonal. value o. j=4: i=2, j=4: i +j =6 !=4. So non-diagonal. value o. So in row 2, the non-diagonal elements are s, o, o, o. So the non-diagonal set would have s and o. Thus, the non-diagonal set would have size 2, so the code returns NO. Which matches the example's first input output of NO.\n\nYes. So that's why the first example outputs NO.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 3, with:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) w; (1,1) w; (2,2) w. So all w.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2) w; (1,1) w; (2,0) w. All w. So diagonals are all same. So first check passes.\n\nNon-diagonal elements:\n\nFor each cell not on the diagonals. For n=3, the cells not on diagonals are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nIn row 0, j=1: s. row 1, j=0: s. row 1, j=2: s. row 2, j=1: s. So all are s. So non-diagonal set is {s}, which is different from w. So returns YES. Which matches the example.\n\nThird example: 3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) x; (1,1) x; (2,2) e. So the set for diagonals is {x, e} → size 2. So first check fails. So output is NO. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where the diagonals are all same, but non-diagonal elements are same as diagonals.\n\nLike n=3, all cells are x. Then the diagonals are x, and the non-diagonal elements are x. So the code would check that the non-diagonal set is {x}, same as d_char. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are x, non-diagonal elements are y. So returns YES.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, diagonals are x, and non-diagonal elements are x. Then returns NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have all same, but non-diagonal elements have more than one character.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string of length n.\n\nSo in Python, perhaps read the input as follows.\n\nBut the input is given as, for example, the first sample input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut the actual input is given via standard input. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo for example, the first input in the sample is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nBut the sample input is given as a list of strings. But in the actual code, the code needs to read from stdin. So the code will read n, then read n lines.\n\nSo in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut need to be careful about possible leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters.\n\nSo, assuming that the input is properly formatted.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the steps as discussed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then read grid.\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][i])\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][n-1 -i])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    # check non-diagonal\n    non_diag = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n                continue\n            non_diag.add(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diag) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        other_char = non_diag.pop()\n        if other_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code for reading the input may have some issues. For example, when reading lines, sometimes there may be trailing newlines or other issues. So, perhaps using input().strip() would be better.\n\nBut in the code, when reading the grid, perhaps using:\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut for the first line, n is read via input(). But in some cases, when the input is given with multiple lines, perhaps the code needs to read correctly.\n\nBut assuming that the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code would process:\n\ndiagonal_chars:\n\nfor i in 0 to 4:\n\ni=0:\n\ngrid[0][0] = 'x', grid[0][4] = 'x' → added.\n\ni=1:\n\ngrid[1][1] = 'x', grid[1][3] = 'x' → added.\n\ni=2:\n\ngrid[2][2] = 'x', grid[2][2] = 'x' → added.\n\ni=3:\n\ngrid[3][3] = 'x', grid[3][1] = 'x' → added.\n\ni=4:\n\ngrid[4][4] = 'x', grid[4][0] = 'x' → added.\n\nSo diagonal_chars is {'x'}, so len is 1. Then proceed.\n\nnon_diag is collected by checking all cells not on diagonals.\n\nIn row 2, cell (2,0) is i=2, j=0. i +j = 2 +0 = 2 !=4. So not on diagonal. So grid[2][0] is 's' → added to non_diag.\n\nSimilarly, other cells. So the non_diag set will contain 's' and 'o' (from the example earlier). So len(non_diag) is 2 → print NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ngrid is:\n\nrow 0: 'wsw'\n\nrow 1: 'sws'\n\nrow 2: 'wsw'\n\ndiagonal_chars:\n\ni=0: grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[0][2] = 'w'.\n\ni=1: grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w'.\n\ni=2: grid[2][2] = 'w', grid[2][0] = 'w'.\n\nSo diagonal_chars is {'w'}, len is 1. Then check non-diagonal.\n\nnon_diag:\n\ncells not on diagonals are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\ngrid[0][1] = 's', grid[1][0] = 's', grid[1][2] = 's', grid[2][1] = 's'. So non_diag is {'s'}, len is 1. other_char is 's' which is different from 'w' → YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ngrid:\n\nrow0: x p x\n\nrow1: p x p\n\nrow2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nfor i=0: grid[0][0] is x, grid[0][2] is x → added.\n\ni=1: grid[1][1] is x, grid[1][1] is x → added.\n\ni=2: grid[2][2] is e, grid[2][0] is x → added.\n\nSo diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2 → print NO.\n\nSo code works for the samples.\n\nNow, think about possible edge cases.\n\nTest case where non-diagonal elements are same as diagonal. Like:\n\nn=3\n\nall cells are x. Then diagonals are x, non-diagonal elements are x. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal elements are same, but different from diagonal. So returns YES.\n\nAnother case where the diagonals have different characters. For example, n=3, main diagonal is x, anti is y. So the code returns NO.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the grid is:\n\nn=3\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: main is a, b, a. So the first check would collect a, a, b, a, a, ... ?\n\nWait:\n\nFor i=0, grid[0][0] is a, grid[0][2] is a → added.\n\ni=1: grid[1][1] is a, grid[1][1] is a → added.\n\ni=2: grid[2][2] is a, grid[2][0] is a → added.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars is {a} → len 1. Then non-diagonal elements are:\n\ncells (0,1) = b, (1,0) = b, (1,2) = a, (2,1) = b.\n\nSo non_diag is {b, a} → len 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case where non-diagonal elements are same but different from diagonal. For example:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naab\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals:\n\nmain diagonal: a (0,0), a (1,1), a (2,2). Anti-diagonal: a (0,2), a (1,1), a (2,0). So diagonals are all a. Non-diagonal elements:\n\ncells (0,1) is a, (1,0) is a, (1,2) is b, (2,1) is a. So non_diag is {a, b} → len 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal elements are same but different from diagonal. For example:\n\nn=3:\n\nxxx\n\nxyx\n\nxxx\n\nThen diagonals are x. non-diagonal elements are y (cell (1,0), (1,2), and others? Let's see:\n\ncells not on diagonals are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). In this case, (0,1) is x, (1,0) is x, (1,2) is x, (2,1) is x. So non-diag set is {x} → same as diagonal. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal elements are all same and different. Like:\n\nn=3:\n\nxxx\n\nxyx\n\nxxx\n\nNo, the non-diagonal elements are x. So same as diagonal. So returns NO.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3:\n\nxxx\n\nxyy\n\nxxx\n\nThen, non-diagonal elements are:\n\n(0,1) x, (1,0) x, (1,2) y, (2,1) x. So non_diag is {x, y} → len 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement it in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, the code needs to read from stdin. Also, for the case where the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains exactly n letters. So the code can safely read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is read via sys.stdin, perhaps there are trailing newlines. But using input().strip() may not be needed. For example, if the input is given as:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen, each line after the first is read as a string of length 5.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, the code can read the lines as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing whitespace, but according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps using input().strip() is safe.\n\nBut for example, if a line is read as 'xooox\\n', then .strip() would remove the newline, leaving 'xooox'.\n\nBut in code, perhaps better to read as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps the code can just read as input().strip().\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is input().strip().\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo the code in Python:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][i])\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][n-1 -i])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    non_diag = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n                continue\n            non_diag.add(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diag) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        other_char = non_diag.pop()\n        if other_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code would process the grid as:\n\ngrid[0] = 'xooox'\n\ngrid[1] = 'oxoxo'\n\ngrid[2] = 'soxoo'\n\ngrid[3] = 'oxoxo'\n\ngrid[4] = 'xooox'\n\nThen, the diagonal checks:\n\nfor i=0: grid[0][0] is 'x', grid[0][4] is 'x'.\n\ni=1: grid[1][1] is 'x', grid[1][3] is 'x'.\n\ni=2: grid[2][2] is 'x', grid[2][2] is 'x'.\n\ni=3: grid[3][3] is 'x', grid[3][1] is 'x'.\n\ni=4: grid[4][4] is 'x', grid[4][0] is 'x'.\n\nSo diagonal_chars is {'x'}, len 1.\n\nThen, check non-diagonal. For example, in grid[2][0], which is 's' (i=2, j=0). i +j = 2 +0 = 2 != 4 (n-1=4). So added to non_diag. So non_diag includes 's', 'o', etc.\n\nSo non_diag set has 's' and 'o', so len is 2. So print 'NO'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw → returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe → returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the non-diagonal elements are empty? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal elements. So the code is safe.\n\nWhat about when the non-diagonal elements are all same, but same as diagonal? For example, all cells are same. Then code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all elements on both diagonals must be the same, and all other elements (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Collect all elements from both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Ensure all these elements are the same.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Collect all elements that are not on either of the diagonals. Ensure all these elements are the same and different from the elements on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][i])\n    diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    non_diag = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            non_diag.add(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diag) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        other_char = non_diag.pop()\n        if other_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each row and column to collect characters from both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal into a set. If the set size is not 1, it means the diagonal elements are not all the same, and we print \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For each cell not on either diagonal, we collect characters into another set. If this set size is not 1, it means the non-diagonal elements are not all the same, and we print \"NO\". If they are the same, we check if they are different from the diagonal characters. If they are the same, we print \"NO\"; otherwise, we print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both conditions using sets to verify uniformity, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is suitable given the constraints.",
