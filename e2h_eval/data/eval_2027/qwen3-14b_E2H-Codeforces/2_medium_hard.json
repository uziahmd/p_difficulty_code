Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X or not. The conditions are that both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. Hmm.\n\nSo first, the input is a square grid of size n x n, where n is odd. The task is to check two main things:\n\n1. All the cells on the two diagonals must be the same. Wait, but the two diagonals might have different letters? No, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. Wait, the first condition says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". Oh right, so both diagonals must have the same letter. Like, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is also all 'x', then that's okay. But if one is 'x' and the other is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nWait no, the problem says that all letters on both diagonals are the same. So the two diagonals must have the same letter. So all cells on the two diagonals must be the same as each other. Because if the first diagonal has all 'a's and the second has all 'a's, that's okay. But if one has 'a' and the other has 'b', that's invalid.\n\nThen, the second condition is that all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\nFirst, check all the cells on the two diagonals. Let's collect all those cells and check if they are all the same. Also, collect the other cells and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nBut how to find the cells on the diagonals?\n\nFor a square grid of size n, the main diagonal is cells where row index equals column index (i == j). The anti-diagonal is cells where row + column equals n-1 (since indices start at 0). For example, in a 3x3 grid, the anti-diagonal cells are (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nBut wait, for the anti-diagonal, the sum i + j = n - 1. So for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo first, I need to collect all the cells that are on either of the two diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same character.\n\nThen, collect all the other cells (those not on the diagonals) and check that they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Let's first get the diagonal characters. Let's take the first cell of the main diagonal (0,0), and check that all other diagonal cells (both main and anti) are equal to it. Also, for the anti-diagonal, but maybe the first cell of the anti-diagonal is (0, n-1). Wait, but for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, there's an overlap at the center cell when n is odd. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. So when checking all the diagonal cells, we need to make sure that all of them are the same. So perhaps collect all the cells in the diagonals, then check if they are all the same.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j) in the grid, if it is on either diagonal, collect its character. Then check that all of these are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n\nThen, for all other cells (those not on the diagonals), collect their characters. Check that all of them are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Collect all diagonal characters and check they are all same.\n\n3. Collect all non-diagonal characters and check they are all same and different from diagonal's.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, then read n lines, each line being a string. So for example, grid is a list of lists.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's part of the diagonals.\n\nElse: part of the others.\n\nSo first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal character (for example, grid[0][0]) and check that all other diagonal cells are equal to it. But perhaps there's a case where the first cell is not part of the diagonals? No, because for n >= 3, the first cell (0,0) is on the main diagonal. So for the first cell, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nBut maybe the code can collect all the diagonal characters, then check that they are all the same. For example, collect all the characters in the diagonals into a set. If the length of the set is 1, then they are all same. But then, for the non-diagonal cells, collect them into another set, check that their set has length 1 and that their element is different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal characters?\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i, j) in the grid:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: add to diagonal_chars.\n\nElse: add to other_chars.\n\nOnce I have these two lists, then:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1 → return NO.\n\nElse, check that len(set(other_chars)) == 1, and that the first element of other_chars is not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no other_chars? For example, when n=1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 3, so n is 3 or more. So for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 cells (since the center cell is counted in both). So for n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 2n - 1. For example, 3*2-1=5. So for n=3, the other cells are 9-5=4. So for n=3, other_chars will have 4 elements. So in the code, when n is 3, other_chars is not empty.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the grid as a list of strings.\n\nCollect diagonal_chars and other_chars.\n\nCheck that all diagonal_chars are same.\n\nCheck that all other_chars are same.\n\nCheck that the other_chars' value is different from diagonal_chars' value.\n\nIf all conditions met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nIn Python, for each line in the input, read the string, then for each character in the string, check if it's on the diagonal.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n    if len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        o_char = other_chars[0]\n        if o_char != d_char:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, other_chars has 4 elements. For n=5, the number of diagonal cells is 2*5-1 =9. So total cells is 25. Other cells is 25 -9 = 16. So for n≥3, other_chars is not empty. So no problem.\n\nBut what if all the non-diagonal cells are same but same as diagonal? Then the code would check o_char != d_char. So in that case, it would return NO.\n\nBut what about when other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but the input constraints say n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut wait, for n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells. So the other_chars is 4 cells. So the code is okay.\n\nBut what about the case where the other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut let's test with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are positions where i == j or i + j =4 (since n=5, n-1=4).\n\nLet's check the diagonals:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: main diagonal. Also, i + j =0, which is not 4. So part of main diagonal.\n\nFor i=0, j=4: i + j =4 → part of anti-diagonal.\n\nSo for each cell:\n\nLooking at the main diagonal (i==j):\n\n(0,0) → x\n\n(1,1) → x\n\n(2,2) → x\n\n(3,3) → x\n\n(4,4) → x\n\nAnti-diagonal (i +j =4):\n\n(0,4) → x\n\n(1,3) → x\n\n(2,2) → x (already counted in main diagonal)\n\n(3,1) → x\n\n(4,0) → x\n\nSo all the diagonal cells are x. So diagonal_chars is [x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x] (since the center cell is counted once, but in the code, for i=2, j=2, it's added once. So the code checks all cells on either diagonal. So the diagonal_chars would have 2n-1 elements. For n=5, 2*5-1=9 elements. So in this case, all are x. So the first check passes.\n\nThen, other_chars is all the other cells. Let's look for any cell not on the diagonals. For example, row 0, column 1: o. Row 0, column 2: o. Row 0, column 3: o. Row 1, column 0: o. Row 1, column 2: o. Row 1, column 4: o. Row 2, column 0: s. Row 2, column 1: o. Row 2, column 3: o. Row 2, column 4: o. Row 3, column 0: o. Row 3, column 2: o. Row 3, column 4: o. Row 4, column 1: o. Row 4, column 2: o. Row 4, column 3: o.\n\nWait, in row 2, column 0 is s. Which is part of other_chars. So the other_chars includes s. So the other_chars would have some s and o. So the set of other_chars would have two elements. So len(set(other_chars)) is not 1. So the code returns NO. Which matches the first example's output of NO.\n\nSecond example input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni==j: (0,0) → w; (1,1) →w; (2,2) →w.\n\ni +j = 2 (since n-1=2):\n\n(0,2) → w; (1,1) →w; (2,0) →w.\n\nSo diagonal_chars are [w, w, w, w, w]. All same.\n\nOther_chars are the cells not on diagonals. Let's see:\n\nFor row 0, column 1 → s.\n\nRow 1, column 0 → s; row 1, column 2 → s.\n\nRow 2, column 1 → s.\n\nSo other_chars is [s, s, s, s]. So set is {s}, which is same as diagonal's w? No. So o_char is s, which is different from d_char w. So returns YES. Which matches the example.\n\nThird example input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nmain diagonal: (0,0) x, (1,1) x, (2,2) e.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars are x, x, e, and the anti-diagonal cells:\n\n(0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x. So the diagonal_chars would be [x, x, x, x, e]. So the set of diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2. So the first check fails, returns NO. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nBut wait, in the third example, the code would collect all the diagonal cells. Let's see:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 → main diagonal. i+j=0+0=0 != 2 (n-1=2 for n=3). So added to diagonal. For i=0, j=2 → i +j = 2 → added to diagonal. So for the first row, the cells (0,0) and (0,2) are part of diagonals. For row 1, (1,1) is main diagonal, and (1,1) is also part of anti-diagonal (i +j = 2). So for row 1, j=1: i==j and i +j =2 → yes. So added once. For row 2, j=2 → i==j. i +j = 2+2=4 != 2. So added to diagonal. Also, (2,0) is part of anti-diagonal (2+0=2). So the diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So the diagonal_chars are:\n\ngrid[0][0] = x, grid[0][2] = x, grid[1][1] = x, grid[2][0] = x, grid[2][2] = e. So the diagonal_chars list is [x, x, x, x, e]. So the set is {x, e} → len 2. So the code returns NO. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a' and others are 'b'. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', others are 'a' → output NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have different letters. Like, main diagonal is 'a's and anti is 'b's. Then the diagonal_chars would have a mix, so code returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input is read from stdin. However, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as the first line is n, then n lines of n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut in reality, the code needs to read from standard input. So for example, when the code is run, it's supposed to read multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line contains integer n, then n lines of letters. But the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. Wait, no. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is a list of three test cases. But the problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, no, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of inputs for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from standard input. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo each test case is a single n followed by n lines. But in the sample input, the input is given as three separate test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nWhich is one test case. The sample input shows that the code is given multiple test cases. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut this is probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, in actual programming competition problems, the input is given as a single test case. Wait, but the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or is the sample input just a way to show that for three different inputs, the outputs are as given?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line contains integer n, then n lines. So the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows three different test cases. But in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of three inputs, but perhaps that's just for the purpose of showing examples. However, the actual code needs to read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is usually one test case. But perhaps the problem is expecting to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement, the sample input is written as a list of three different inputs, but the actual input for the code is one test case. Wait, no. The problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample output shows that for each input, the code produces an output. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases? But that's not clear from the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line contains integer n, then n lines. So for each run of the program, there is one test case. However, in the sample input, there are three test cases. So perhaps the problem is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from standard input and print to standard output. So for example, in the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. But the sample output is given as a list of three outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the first line contains integer n. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each starting with an n. But the problem statement doesn't mention that. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters. So the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample output shows that the code must process multiple test cases. But this is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut this is probably a way to represent that the code is given three test cases, and for each, the output is as shown. However, in programming competitions, the code is expected to read from stdin, which for multiple test cases would be handled by reading until EOF. But the problem statement does not mention that. However, the original problem statement's input is likely to be a single test case. But the sample shows multiple test cases. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the input is described as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo it's a single test case. Therefore, the sample input is probably a list of three test cases, but the actual code should process one test case. But why does the sample input show three test cases?\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents the three test cases as separate inputs. For example, in the problem statement's example, the input is given as three separate test cases, and the output is three corresponding outputs. However, in practice, the code is supposed to process one test case. But that's not possible. So perhaps the problem statement's sample input is not formatted correctly, and the actual code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But this is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is given as three separate test cases, each with their own n and grid. The output is three lines of answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given as per the input format.\n\nBut the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n. So how to know whether there are multiple test cases?\n\nThis is a critical point. If the code is supposed to process a single test case, then the code is straightforward. But if it's supposed to process multiple test cases, then the code needs to read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the sample input has three test cases and the output has three answers. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description is ambiguous. However, looking back at the original problem statement, the user provided the sample input as a list of three inputs, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem statement says:\n\n\"Input: The first line contains integer n ...\".\n\nBut that would suggest that the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input suggests otherwise.\n\nThis is a problem. How to resolve this?\n\nWait, looking at the problem's original source, perhaps it's from Codeforces or similar. For example, the problem may have multiple test cases. But since the problem statement says nothing about that, perhaps it's a mistake in the sample input representation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should read one test case. But then why the sample output is a list of three answers?\n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich is one test case. The output is NO.\n\nThe second input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nOutput is YES.\n\nThird input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nOutput is NO.\n\nSo the sample input is three separate test cases. But the problem statement's input description says that the first line is n, etc. So the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement doesn't say anything about multiple test cases. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three test cases, and the output shows three answers, the code must process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nIn programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read until EOF. For example, the code should read all test cases until there is no more input.\n\nBut how to read that in Python?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how to parse that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input was written in a way that represents three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But that would not explain the sample output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is given in a way that the first line is the number of test cases, but that is not mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is given as the first line contains n, then n lines, it's likely that the code is supposed to process a single test case. But then why the sample input shows three test cases?\n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is written as a list of three test cases, and the sample output is a list of three answers. But perhaps the problem is written in a way that the code should read multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from stdin, and process them as multiple test cases. But how to parse them?\n\nFor example, for each test case, the first line is n, then n lines follow. So the code can read all lines, then process them in groups.\n\nBut for the code to work, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases, and the code should process each one.\n\nBut the original problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output have multiple test cases, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code should read all test cases until EOF.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, then process them in groups. For example, for each test case, read n, then read n lines.\n\nSo in Python, the code could read all lines from stdin, then process them in order.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nFor example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, process the lines as follows:\n\ncurrent = 0\n\nwhile current < len(lines):\n\n    n = int(lines[current])\n\n    current += 1\n\n    grid = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        grid.append(lines[current])\n\n        current += 1\n\n    # process grid\n\nBut this would handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to know that the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases?\n\nWell, the sample input and output suggest that. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n. So perhaps the problem has a mistake in the sample input. Or perhaps the problem expects that there are multiple test cases.\n\nBut since the user provided the sample input and output as lists, it's likely that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input may be only one test case. However, given that the sample input has three test cases, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's sample input shows that the code is given multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description is ambiguous. However, the user's note says that the code must read input from standard input and print to standard output. So the code must process all test cases present in the input.\n\nTherefore, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut in that case, the code needs to read multiple test cases. For example, the code will read n, then read n lines for the grid, then repeat until there is no more input.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, stripping whitespace.\n\nThen, process them as follows:\n\ncurrent = 0\n\nwhile current < len(lines):\n\n   n = int(lines[current])\n\n   current += 1\n\n   grid = []\n\n   for _ in range(n):\n\n       grid.append(lines[current])\n\n       current += 1\n\n   process the grid and print the result.\n\nSo, for example, for the sample input, the lines would be:\n\n['5', 'xooox', 'oxoxo', 'soxoo', 'oxoxo', 'xooox', '3', 'wsw', 'sws', 'wsw', '3', 'xpx', 'pxp', 'xpe']\n\nProcessing the first test case:\n\nn=5, then 5 lines.\n\nThen current is at 6.\n\nNext test case: n=3, then 3 lines. current becomes 6+1+3=10.\n\nNext test case: n=3, then 3 lines. current becomes 10+1+3=14.\n\nThus, the code would process all three test cases.\n\nSo, the code must be written with that logic.\n\nBut the original problem's input description may not mention multiple test cases. However, the sample input and output suggest that.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the code must be written to read multiple test cases.\n\nSo, combining the previous logic with this.\n\nNow, the code will be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCollect the grid.\n\nCheck the diagonals and other cells.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    current = 0\n\n    while current < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[current])\n\n        current += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[current])\n\n            current += 1\n\n        # process grid\n\n        diagonal_chars = []\n\n        other_chars = []\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n                    diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n                else:\n\n                    other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        # check diagonals\n\n        if len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n\n        if len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        o_char = other_chars[0]\n\n        if o_char != d_char:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n ≥3, other_chars is not empty.\n\nBut for example, when n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 5, and other_chars is 4.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen, the first test case:\n\ndiagonal_chars is [x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x] ?\n\nWait, for n=5, the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x, and (2, 2) is part of both diagonals. Also, (2, 2) is part of main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) is x? No, (3,1) is x? Let me recheck.\n\nRow 3 is \"oxoxo\", so indexes 0: o, 1: x, 2: o, 3: x, 4: o. So (3,1) is x, which is part of anti-diagonal (i +j =3+1=4 =n-1=5-1=4. Yes. And (3,3) is x, which is part of main diagonal (i==j). So the diagonal_chars for this case includes:\n\nAll the main diagonal and anti-diagonal cells. But for row 2, column 0: i=2, j=0 → i +j =2 +0 =2 !=4. So it's not part of the diagonals. So in row 2, column 0 is 's', which is part of other_chars.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars would include:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,4) x.\n\n(1,1) x, (1,3) x.\n\n(2,2) x.\n\n(3,1) x, (3,3) x.\n\n(4,0) x, (4,4) x.\n\nSo total of 2*5 -1 =9 elements. So diagonal_chars is [x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x]?\n\nNo, for row 2, j=2 is part of the main diagonal. So the diagonal_chars for row 2, j=2 is x. So yes.\n\nBut in the sample input, row 2 is 'soxoo', which is s o x o o. So (2,2) is x. So yes, all the diagonal cells are x. But other_chars includes s (from row 2, column 0), so other_chars has s and o's. So len(set(other_chars)) is more than 1. Hence, output is NO.\n\nSo the code would print NO for the first test case.\n\nThe second test case is:\n\nn=3\n\ngrid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w → (0,0) w, (0,2) w.\n\nRow 1: s w s → (1,1) w.\n\nRow 2: w s w → (2,0) w, (2,2) w.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars are [w, w, w, w, w]. All same. The other_chars are the cells not on diagonals:\n\nRow 0, column 1: s.\n\nRow 1, column 0: s, row 1, column 2: s.\n\nRow 2, column 1: s.\n\nSo other_chars is [s, s, s, s]. So len(set) is 1. o_char is s, which is different from d_char w → YES.\n\nThird test case: n=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nRow 0: x p x → (0,0) x, (0,2) x.\n\nRow 1: p x p → (1,1) x.\n\nRow 2: x p e → (2,0) x, (2,2) e.\n\nSo diagonal_chars are x, x, x, x, e. So set is {x, e} → len 2 → print NO.\n\nSo the code would output NO, YES, NO as in the sample.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in the code, the lines are read from stdin. Also, note that the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, but the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the code uses line.strip() to remove any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nBut for the grid lines, the code appends lines[current], which is stripped. So for example, if a line is 'xooox\\n', then after stripping, it becomes 'xooox'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nAlso, note that in Python, the code must read from stdin. So the code will be as follows.\n\nBut what about when the input is given as multiple test cases, and the code is run in a programming competition setting. The code should handle that.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    current = 0\n    while current < len(lines):\n        n = int(lines[current])\n        current += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(lines[current])\n            current += 1\n        diagonal_chars = []\n        other_chars = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n                else:\n                    other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        # Check diagonals\n        if len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n        if len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        o_char = other_chars[0]\n        if o_char != d_char:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" as defined by specific conditions.
