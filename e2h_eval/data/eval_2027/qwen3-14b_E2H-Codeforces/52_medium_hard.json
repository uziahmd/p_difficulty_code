Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm. So the initial number of candles is 'a', and each time he burns a candle, it becomes a used one. Then, whenever he has 'b' used candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be burned again, adding more hours and more used candles. The question is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down. Initially, he has 4 candles. He burns them all, which takes 4 hours. Now he has 4 used candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used candles. He can make another 1 candle (since 2 / 2 = 1). Burn that, adding 1 hour. Now he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough for another. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Right.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's check. Initial 6 candles: 6 hours. Then 6 used, divided by 3 gives 2 new. Burn them: +2 hours. Now 2 used. Not enough for 3. Wait, but maybe there's another way? Or maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, 6 /3 is 2, then after burning those two, you have 2 used. But then you can't make any more. So total is 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the example. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how do we model this?\n\nThe key is to track the total hours and the number of used candles. Let me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, total_hours = a. Because he uses all the initial candles. Then, the used_candles = a.\n\nThen, while used_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used_candles // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles \n\nBecause after making new candles, the remaining used ones are the remainder (used_candles % b) plus the new ones that are now used after being burned.\n\nWait, right. Because when you take used_candles and make new ones, each new candle is made from b used ones. So the number of new candles is floor(used_candles / b). Then, after burning those new candles, each adds 1 hour. But the used_candles for the next step would be the leftover (used_candles % b) plus the new_candles (because after burning them, they become used again).\n\nSo this seems like a loop that can be done until the used_candles is less than b.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize total_hours = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total_hours += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new \n\nRepeat until used < b.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4. used =4.\n\nLoop:\n\nused >=2: yes.\n\nnew =4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. used = (4%2=0) +2=2.\n\nAgain, used=2 >=2. new=2//2=1. total is 6+1=7. used = 0 +1=1. Now, loop ends.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours =6. used=6.\n\nloop: 6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So done. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. used=5. 5//5=1. total becomes 6. used is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial total=5, used=5.\n\nLoop:\n\n5//2=2. total becomes 5+2=7. used is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nAgain, 3 >=2. 3//2=1. total 7+1=8. used is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nAgain, 2//2=1. total 8+1=9. used is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually:\n\nStart with 5 candles. Burn all, 5 hours. 5 used. Make 2 new (using 4 used), 1 left. Burn 2, add 2 hours. Now used is 1 + 2 =3. Make 1 new (using 2 of the 3). Burn it, add 1 hour. Now used is 1 (from previous 3-2=1) +1=2. Make 1 new. Burn it, add 1. Now used is 0 +1=1. So total is 5+2+1+1=9. Correct. So the algorithm works.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new \n\nreturn total.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is a single line with two integers, but in the example given, the input is given as ['4 2', '6 3'] which is two test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is a single line with two integers. But in the sample input, it's given as two lines? Or perhaps the user provided multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\nOutput\n['7', '8']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. Wait, perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases, but the input is given as a single line. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but in the actual code, each input is a single line. So for example, the user may have to read multiple lines, but according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b.\n\nSo the code should read a single line with two integers. But in the sample input, it's given as two lines. That's probably a mistake in the problem statement. For example, the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps the actual code should process multiple test cases. However, looking back, the original problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is showing two examples, but each is a separate test case. But the code should read one line, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as two lines, but perhaps that's a formatting mistake. For example, the user may have to read multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is just two examples, not that the code needs to process multiple lines. So the code should read a single line, split into two integers, and output the answer.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read from stdin, split into a and b, compute the answer, and print.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead a and b from input. For example:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, compute total as explained.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = used % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if b is 1? Wait, no, according to the input constraints, b is between 2 and 1000. So the code is safe.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input 4 2: returns 7. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input 6 3: returns 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2. Output 9. Correct.\n\nWhat about when a=0? Well, according to the input constraints, a is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nEdge case: a=1, b=2. Then, initial total is 1. used=1. Since 1 <2, loop doesn't run. Output is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: a=2, b=2. Initial total 2. used=2. new=1. total becomes 3. used is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. So output is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out candles to create new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and reusing the remnants optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`. Each candle burns for one hour, contributing directly to the total hours.\n2. **Track Used Candles**: After burning all initial candles, keep track of the used candles. These used candles can be converted into new ones if there are enough of them.\n3. **Conversion Process**: Continuously convert groups of `b` used candles into new ones. Each conversion adds to the total hours and updates the count of used candles.\n4. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Repeat the conversion process until there are not enough used candles left to form a new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = used % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` since each candle burns for one hour.\n2. **Used Candles Tracking**: After burning all initial candles, we start with `a` used candles.\n3. **Conversion Loop**: While there are enough used candles to form a new one (i.e., `used >= b`):\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the used ones.\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the count of used candles to include the leftover used candles and the newly burned ones.\n4. **Termination**: The loop stops when there are not enough used candles left to form another new candle, ensuring we have maximized the usage of available candles.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of converting used candles into new ones, ensuring optimal use of resources and providing the correct total number of hours the room can be illuminated.",
