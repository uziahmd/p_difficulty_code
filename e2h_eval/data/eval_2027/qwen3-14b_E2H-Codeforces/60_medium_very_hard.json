Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about Morse code representations and counting the number of valid sequences of English letters that can be formed from substrings of a growing string S. Each modification appends a 0 or 1 to S, and after each step, I have to compute the number of such sequences.\n\nFirst, the key points:\n\n- Each English letter is represented by a Morse code string of length 1-4, made up of 0s and 1s. However, four specific strings are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". All other strings of length 1-4 are valid and correspond to a unique letter.\n\nThe task is, after each append operation to S, find the number of non-empty sequences of letters that can be formed by some substring of S. Each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring of S into valid Morse code letters. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", \"1\", \"11\", \"1\" (but considering all possible substrings). Each of these substrings can be split into valid letters. But since the letters are distinct, each split into letters counts as a sequence. For example, \"11\" could be one letter (M) or two letters (T and T), so the total sequences would include both possibilities.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each such sequence is a way of breaking down a substring of S into valid Morse code letters. So for example, if a substring is \"11\", which is a valid letter (M), then that's one sequence. Also, if that same substring can be split into two letters (like \"1\" and \"1\"), then that's another sequence. So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how do we compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. The problem requires that after each step, we process the current S and calculate the total number of such sequences. Since m can be up to 3000, and each step appends a character, we need an efficient way to compute this incrementally.\n\nLet's consider dynamic programming. Because for each new character added to S, we can track some state that allows us to compute the new total based on previous values.\n\nLet me think about the possible states. For each position in the string, we can track the number of ways to split the substring ending at that position into valid letters. Then, the total answer would be the sum of all these counts for all positions.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid sequences that can be formed from the first i characters of S. Then, when adding a new character, we can look back at positions where a valid Morse code string ends, and add the corresponding counts.\n\nBut wait, the total number of sequences is the sum for all possible substrings of S of the number of ways to split that substring into valid letters. So for example, if the entire string is \"11\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"11\". Each of these substrings contributes their own counts. For \"1\", it's 1 way. For the second \"1\", another 1 way. For \"11\", it's 2 ways (as one letter or two letters). So total is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Which matches the sample input's second case where after two 1s, the output is 3? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the first sample input given:\n\nIn the first example input, the input is 3 lines of '1's. The output is 1, 3, 7.\n\nAfter first step, S is \"1\". The only substring is \"1\" which is valid. So answer is 1.\n\nAfter second step, S is \"11\". The substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 1)\n- \"1\" (positions 2)\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2)\n\nEach of these substrings contributes:\n\nFor \"1\" (twice): 1 each. For \"11\": 2 (as one letter or two letters). So total is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4? But the sample output after two steps is 3. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nSample Output is 1, 3, 7.\n\nWait, after the second step, the output is 3. But according to my calculation, it should be 4. What's wrong here?\n\nWait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me recheck the note.\n\nIn the note, after appending three 1s, the S is \"111\". The answer is 7. Let me see how that comes.\n\nThe note says that the sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\" (111), \"TT\" (1+1), \"TM\" (1+11), \"MT\" (11+1), \"TTT\" (1+1+1). So total 7 sequences.\n\nBut according to the approach where each substring is considered and the number of splits for that substring is counted, how does that work?\n\nFor S = \"111\", the substrings are:\n\nAll possible substrings:\n\nLength 1: 3 substrings (\"1\", \"1\", \"1\") → each contributes 1 → total 3.\n\nLength 2: 2 substrings (\"11\", \"11\") → each contributes 2 (split as one letter or two letters) → 2*2=4.\n\nLength 3: 1 substring (\"111\") → which can be split as one letter (111) or 1+1+1 (three letters) or 1+11 (two letters) or 11+1 (two letters). Wait, how many ways are there to split \"111\"?\n\nWait the number of ways to split a string into valid Morse code letters. Let's think recursively. For a string s, the number of ways is the sum of the number of ways for s[1..i] where the prefix s[0..i] is a valid code. For example, for \"111\", the possible splits:\n\n- Take the first character as a valid code (length 1) and then split the remaining \"11\" (which has 2 ways). So 2 ways here.\n\n- Take the first two characters as a valid code (length 2) and then split the remaining \"1\" (1 way). So 1 way.\n\n- Take the first three characters as a valid code (length 3) → 1 way.\n\nTotal ways: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4? But according to the note, the total sequences for \"111\" is 7. Wait, but in the note, the answer for the entire S is 7. But according to the approach of summing over all substrings, how does that add up?\n\nLet me re-calculate for S = \"111\".\n\nAll substrings:\n\nFor each substring, count the number of ways to split into valid letters.\n\nSubstrings:\n\n1. \"1\" → 1 way.\n2. \"1\" → 1.\n3. \"1\" → 1.\n4. \"11\" (positions 1-2) → 2 ways.\n5. \"11\" (positions 2-3) → 2.\n6. \"111\" (positions 1-3) → 4 ways (as above? Or is it different?)\n\nWait, but according to the note, the total sequences for S = \"111\" is 7. Let's see how that comes from the sum of all substrings' ways.\n\nEach substring contributes its number of splits. Let's list all substrings and their counts:\n\nSubstrings of length 1: 3 → 1 each → 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2: 2 → each contributes 2 → 4.\n\nSubstring of length 3: 1 → contributes 4? Then total is 3 + 4 + 4 = 11? But the note says 7. That's conflicting. So clearly, my understanding of the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait the note says that the answer after three steps is 7. How?\n\nThe note says that the sequences are:\n\n- \"T\" (from 1)\n\n- \"M\" (from 11)\n\n- \"O\" (from 111)\n\n- \"TT\" (from 11 → split into two Ts)\n\n- \"TM\" (from 111 → split into T and M)\n\n- \"MT\" (from 111 → split into M and T)\n\n- \"TTT\" (from 111 → split into three Ts)\n\nSo that's 7 sequences. But according to the approach of summing over all substrings, how does that match?\n\nBecause each of those sequences is a way to split a substring into letters. For example, the sequence \"TT\" comes from the substring \"11\" (split into two Ts). Similarly, \"TM\" comes from the substring \"111\" (split into T and M). So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible splits of all possible substrings.\n\nBut in that case, for S = \"111\", the substrings are:\n\nEach individual character (3 substrings), each contributing 1 → 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2 (two of them): each can be split into 1 way (as one letter) or two ways (split into two letters). So each contributes 2 → 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSubstring of length 3: can be split into:\n\n- 1 way (as O)\n\n- 2 ways (split into T + M, or M + T)\n\n- 3 ways (split into T + T + T)\n\nWait, how many splits are there?\n\nThe number of ways to split a string into valid codes is the same as the number of ways to partition the string into parts where each part is a valid code. So for the string \"111\", the valid codes are:\n\nPossible splits:\n\n1. Split into 1, 1, 1 → 3 letters.\n\n2. Split into 1, 11 → 2 letters.\n\n3. Split into 11, 1 → 2 letters.\n\n4. Split into 111 → 1 letter.\n\nSo total of 1 (for 111) + 2 (for 1+11 and 11+1) + 1 (for 1+1+1) → total 4 ways. So the substring \"111\" contributes 4.\n\nSo total sequences would be 3 (from length 1) + 2*2 (from length 2) + 4 (from length 3) = 3 + 4 +4 = 11. But according to the note, the answer is 7. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh wait! Because the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem counts each sequence once, regardless of which substring it comes from. Wait, but that can't be. Because the same sequence can be formed from different substrings. For example, in the case of \"11\", the sequence \"TT\" is formed by splitting the substring \"11\" into two Ts. But also, if there are other substrings that can form the same sequence, they would be counted again. But according to the note, the answer is 7, not 11. So my initial understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, what's the actual problem statement? The problem says:\n\nthe number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the problem is not counting the number of ways to split the substrings, but the number of distinct sequences of letters. For example, in the first sample, the sequences are T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT. So 7 distinct sequences. However, the same sequence may come from multiple substrings. But the problem counts them once. But that would make the problem very different, and the sample makes sense.\n\nBut that's not possible, because in that case, the problem would require tracking all unique sequences, which is impossible for large m (since the number of sequences could be exponential). However, the sample output after 3 steps is 7, which is exactly the number of unique sequences. So this suggests that the problem is not counting the number of splits, but the number of unique sequences that can be formed by any substring. However, that seems computationally challenging.\n\nBut that contradicts the note's explanation. Let me read the note again:\n\n\"In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows. \"T\" (translates into \"1\") \"M\" (translates into \"11\") \"O\" (translates into \"111\") \"TT\" (translates into \"11\") \"TM\" (translates into \"111\") \"MT\" (translates into \"111\") \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\"\n\nSo the sequences are T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT. These are 7 sequences. Each of these sequences is formed by a substring of S (e.g., \"TT\" is formed by the substring \"11\", which is split into two Ts. So the problem is counting the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting some substring of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut then, how do we compute that? Because for example, the same sequence can be formed from multiple substrings. However, the problem counts each unique sequence once. But that seems difficult, because for large m, the number of possible sequences can be huge, and we need to avoid duplicates.\n\nBut that's impossible with the given constraints. For example, if the string is long, the number of possible sequences would be exponential, and tracking unique sequences would be impossible for m=3000.\n\nTherefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is ambiguous. But looking at the example explanation, the answer is 7. Which is the number of distinct sequences. However, in that case, the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by splitting any substring into valid Morse code letters. However, that seems computationally impossible for large m. So why is the sample output 7 for the first case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to count the number of ways to split the entire string into valid letters, but that doesn't fit the sample either. For example, the first sample after 3 steps has S as \"111\", which can be split into 4 ways, but the answer is 7. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about sequences of letters, but the number of substrings that are valid Morse code letters. But in the first sample, after three steps, there are three substrings of length 1 (each valid), two of length 2 (each valid?), and one of length 3 (valid). But the sample answer is 7, which would be 3+2+1=6, but the sample says 7. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts all possible ways to split any substring into valid letters. For example, for each substring, the number of ways to split it into valid letters. Then the total answer is the sum over all substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid letters.\n\nIn the first sample case after three steps, the total would be:\n\nFor each substring:\n\nSubstrings of length 1: 3 → each contributes 1 → 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2: 2 → each contributes 2 → 4.\n\nSubstring of length 3: contributes 4 → total 3+4+4 = 11. But sample says 7. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the problem is not about splitting the substring into letters, but about the substring being a valid Morse code representation of some letter. In that case, each such substring would represent a single letter. So the number of such substrings would be the answer.\n\nBut for the first sample, after three steps, the answer is 7. Let's count the number of valid substrings.\n\nS is \"111\".\n\nValid substrings (each of length 1-4, except the forbidden ones):\n\nAll substrings of length 1: \"1\" (valid) → 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2: \"11\" (valid) → 2.\n\nSubstring of length 3: \"111\" (valid) → 1.\n\nTotal is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. But sample says 7. Hmm, no. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, but the forbidden strings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So \"111\" is allowed. So the total is 6, but sample says 7. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by concatenating any number of valid Morse code letters, where the concatenation's Morse code is a substring of S. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split into two Ts (so the sequence TT), or as one M. So each split contributes a sequence. The total answer is the number of all such possible sequences across all substrings.\n\nIn that case, for the first sample, the answer is 7. Let's see:\n\nFor S = \"111\", the substrings are:\n\nEach individual character (3) → each contributes 1 sequence (the single letter).\n\nEach pair (positions 1-2, 2-3) → each can be split into 2 sequences (one letter, two letters). So 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nThe full substring (1-3) can be split into 4 sequences (as discussed earlier). So 3 + 4 + 4 = 11. But the sample says 7. So that's not matching.\n\nThis suggests that my understanding is still wrong. Let me look back at the note.\n\nIn the note, after three steps, the answer is 7. The explanation lists seven sequences. Each of these sequences is formed by a way to split a substring into letters. For example, \"TT\" comes from splitting the substring \"11\" into two Ts. However, the same sequence can be formed from multiple substrings. For example, if there are multiple \"11\" substrings, each would contribute a \"TT\" sequence. However, the note lists \"TT\" only once. So perhaps the problem counts each unique sequence once, regardless of how many times it appears in different substrings.\n\nBut that would mean that the answer is the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by splitting any substring into valid letters. However, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" The wording is ambiguous. But according to the note, the answer is 7, which is the number of unique sequences, not the total number of splits.\n\nBut that would make the problem very hard, especially for large m. For example, with m=3000, the number of possible sequences could be exponential, and tracking unique sequences is not feasible with standard methods.\n\nBut given that the sample output is 7 for the first case, which matches the count of unique sequences, perhaps that's what the problem is asking. However, how can we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of possible ways to split the entire string into valid letters, but that doesn't fit the sample either.\n\nWait, looking back at the first sample explanation:\n\nThe answer is 7, which is the number of distinct sequences formed by splitting the substrings. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split into \"M\" (sequence of one letter) or \"TT\" (sequence of two letters). Both are counted as separate sequences. However, the note lists them as separate entries. So in the note, the answer is 7, which includes all the distinct sequences generated by all possible splits of all substrings.\n\nSo the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nThis seems extremely challenging. For example, for a string of length m, the number of substrings is O(m^2), and for each substring, the number of possible splits is exponential in the length of the substring. So for m=3000, this approach is impossible.\n\nBut the sample shows that for S=\"111\", the answer is 7. How to get that number?\n\nLet me think of all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid letters.\n\nFor S = \"111\", the substrings are:\n\nAll substrings:\n\n1. \"1\" → [T]\n\n2. \"1\" → [T]\n\n3. \"1\" → [T]\n\n4. \"11\" → [M, TT]\n\n5. \"11\" → [M, TT]\n\n6. \"111\" → [O, TM, MT, TTT]\n\nSo the distinct sequences are T, M, TT, O, TM, MT, TTT → total 7. Hence, the answer is 7.\n\nSo the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThis seems like a problem that requires maintaining a set of all possible sequences generated by the current S. However, for m=3000, this approach would be too slow. For example, each step appends a character, and for each new character, you have to consider all new substrings that end at this position, and for each of those substrings, generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting them into valid Morse code letters, and add them to the set.\n\nBut even generating all possible sequences for each new substring is computationally expensive. However, given that m is 3000, and each step adds one character, and for each new character, the number of new substrings is O(m), and for each of those substrings, the number of sequences is O(2^k), where k is the length of the substring. For m=3000, this would be impossible.\n\nBut the sample outputs suggest that for small cases, this is manageable. However, for m=3000, this approach is not feasible.\n\nSo there must be another way to model this.\n\nAlternative idea: for each position i in the string, track all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting the substring ending at i. Then, the total number of distinct sequences is the union of all these sequences.\n\nBut how to manage this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the set of all sequences that can be formed by splitting the substring ending at position i. Then, for each new character added to the string, we can look back at positions j < i, and check if the substring from j+1 to i forms a valid Morse code letter. If so, then we can take the sequences in dp[j] and append the new letter to them, and also add the new letter as a sequence by itself.\n\nBut this seems manageable. For example, when adding a new character at position i, we look for all possible positions j where the substring from j+1 to i is a valid Morse code letter. For each such j, we take the sequences in dp[j], append the new letter to them, and add those to dp[i]. Additionally, we add the new letter as a single-element sequence.\n\nThen, the total number of distinct sequences is the size of the union of all dp[i] for all i from 1 to current length.\n\nBut with m=3000, and each dp[i] possibly containing many sequences, this could be feasible if we can represent the sequences in a way that avoids duplication.\n\nBut how to represent the sequences? Each sequence is a series of letters. However, since the letters are determined by their Morse code strings, perhaps we can map each valid Morse code string to a unique letter (though the exact mapping isn't needed for the problem; what matters is that each valid Morse code string represents a unique letter). Therefore, each sequence is a sequence of these unique letters.\n\nBut storing the sequences themselves would be too memory-intensive. However, we can represent the sequences using a trie or some kind of hash, but even that might not be feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: instead of tracking the actual sequences, track the number of distinct sequences using a dynamic programming approach where we use a set of hashes or something similar.\n\nBut even then, for each new character, we need to process all possible valid Morse code substrings ending at that position and combine them with previous sequences.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that we count the number of distinct sequences. So for example, if two different substrings generate the same sequence, it's only counted once.\n\nSo the key is to track all unique sequences that have been generated up to each step.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe maintain a global set (or a hash set) that contains all the unique sequences generated so far. For each new character appended to S, we consider all new substrings that end at this position. For each such substring, we generate all possible sequences that can be formed by splitting it into valid Morse code letters, and add those sequences to the global set.\n\nBut for large m, this could be very slow. However, given that m is up to 3000 and each step involves processing O(m) substrings, and for each substring, generating O(2^k) sequences (where k is the length of the substring), this might not be feasible. However, perhaps the number of valid Morse code substrings is limited, and the number of sequences generated per step is manageable.\n\nLet me think of the maximum possible number of sequences. Each time we add a new character, the new substrings that end at this position are of lengths 1 to current length. For each of these substrings, if they are valid Morse code strings, then they can be split in various ways.\n\nBut for each such substring, the number of ways to split it into valid letters is equal to the number of ways to split it, which can be computed with dynamic programming. However, the sequences generated by these splits are the combinations of letters. So for example, a substring of length 3 can be split into one letter, two letters, or three letters, depending on the valid codes.\n\nBut how to generate the actual sequences of letters for each split? Well, we need to know what each valid Morse code string maps to. However, the problem doesn't provide this mapping. It only says that four specific strings are invalid. But the rest are valid and correspond to unique letters. Therefore, for the purpose of counting distinct sequences, the actual letters don't matter, only the fact that each valid Morse code string corresponds to a unique letter. Thus, the sequences can be uniquely identified by the sequence of valid Morse code strings used to form them.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each valid Morse code string corresponds to a unique letter. So, for example, the string \"1\" corresponds to a unique letter (say, T), \"11\" to another (say, M), etc. So the sequence of Morse code strings is directly mapped to a sequence of letters. Therefore, the sequences of letters are uniquely determined by the sequences of Morse code strings. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct sequences of valid Morse code strings that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code strings.\n\nThus, the problem becomes equivalent to counting the number of distinct sequences of valid Morse code strings that are formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code strings. This is because each such sequence of Morse code strings corresponds to a unique sequence of letters.\n\nSo, for example, the sequence of Morse code strings [\"1\", \"1\"] corresponds to the letter sequence \"TT\", and [\"11\"] corresponds to \"M\".\n\nNow, the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences of valid Morse code strings that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code strings.\n\nThis changes the approach. Now, the problem is to count the number of unique sequences of valid Morse code strings (each of length between 1 and 4, not in the forbidden list) that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into such strings.\n\nThis seems more manageable. For example, for the first sample, the sequences are:\n\n[\"1\"], [\"11\"], [\"111\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"11\"], [\"11\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\n\nThese are 7 unique sequences.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find all such sequences generated by any substring of S, and count how many unique ones there are.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAn approach could be to use dynamic programming to track for each position i, all possible sequences that end at i. For example, for each i, we can keep a set of sequences that can be formed by splitting the substring ending at i.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's define dp[i] as the set of all sequences of valid Morse code strings that can be formed by splitting the substring S[0..i-1] (assuming 0-based indices). Wait, no. Wait, when we process the string S, for each position i (current length of the string), we can consider all possible ways to split the substring ending at i. For example, for the current string S of length n, when we add the new character, we look back at positions j where the substring from j to n-1 is a valid Morse code string. For each such j, we can take the sequences from dp[j] and append the current valid string to them, and also add the current valid string as a new sequence.\n\nBut how to manage this for all possible substrings?\n\nLet's think step by step. Suppose we have built the string S up to length k. When we add a new character (say, the k+1-th character), we can look back for all possible positions where the substring ending at k+1 is a valid Morse code string. For each such valid substring, we can generate new sequences by combining existing sequences from before the start of this substring with this new valid string.\n\nFor example, suppose the new character makes the substring ending at position k+1 of length l (1 ≤ l ≤4). We check if this substring is valid. If it is, then we can take all sequences in dp[k+1 - l], and append this new valid string to each of them. Also, we can add the new valid string as a sequence by itself.\n\nSo, the recurrence would be:\n\nFor each new character added to S, making the current length n:\n\nFor l in 1 to 4:\n\n   if the last l characters form a valid Morse code string:\n\n       then, take the sequences from dp[n - l] and append this string to each of them, and add these to dp[n].\n\n       also, add the single string as a new sequence.\n\nThen, the total number of unique sequences is the size of the union of all sequences generated in all dp[i] for i from 1 to current n.\n\nBut how to represent these sequences? Since the sequences are made of valid Morse code strings, and each such string is unique, we can represent each sequence as a tuple of strings. However, for large n, this could be memory-intensive.\n\nBut given that m is up to 3000, and for each step, the number of new sequences added is manageable, perhaps this approach is feasible.\n\nLet's think about the data structures. For each position i, we can store a set of tuples representing the sequences that end at i. Then, the global set of all sequences is the union of all these sets.\n\nBut for each step, when adding a new character, we need to check all possible l (1-4) where the last l characters form a valid string. For each valid l, we take the sequences from dp[n-l], append the current valid string, and add them to dp[n]. Also, add the current valid string as a new sequence.\n\nBut how to check if the last l characters form a valid string? We can precompute for all possible strings of length 1-4 whether they are valid.\n\nSo first, let's create a set of valid strings. The valid strings are all binary strings of length 1-4, except the four forbidden ones. Let's generate this set.\n\nThe forbidden strings are:\n\n\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\nSo the valid strings are all binary strings of length 1-4 except these four.\n\nSo for any given string of length 1-4, we can check if it's in the forbidden list. If not, it's valid.\n\nNow, during processing, for each new character added to S, we can check the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters (depending on the current length) and see if they form a valid string.\n\nOnce we have that, for each valid l, we can generate new sequences.\n\nBut for this approach, we need to track for each position i, the set of sequences ending at i.\n\nBut how to manage this efficiently. For example, for the current string of length n, when we check l=1, we look at the last character. If it's valid, then we take the sequences from dp[n-1] and append the current string (which is the last character), and also add the current string as a new sequence.\n\nBut the problem is that for each new character, the sequences generated can be very large. However, given that m is 3000 and each step appends a character, perhaps the number of sequences is manageable.\n\nLet me test this approach with the first sample.\n\nSample Input: 3 steps, all '1's.\n\nStep 1: S is \"1\".\n\nCheck l=1: the string is \"1\", which is valid (not in forbidden list). So for dp[1], we take sequences from dp[0] (which is empty) and append \"1\", resulting in [\"1\"], plus adding \"1\" as a new sequence. So dp[1] = { (\"1\",) }.\n\nGlobal set: { (\"1\",) }, count 1 → output 1.\n\nStep 2: S is \"11\".\n\nCheck l=1: last 1 char is \"1\" → valid. Take sequences from dp[1] (which is {(\"1\",)}), append \"1\" → (\"1\", \"1\"). Also add \"1\" as a new sequence. So for l=1, we have sequences (\"1\", \"1\") and (\"1\",).\n\nCheck l=2: last 2 chars is \"11\" → valid. Take sequences from dp[0] (empty) → append \"11\" → (\"11\",). Also add \"11\" as a new sequence.\n\nSo dp[2] will have the sequences generated from l=1 and l=2.\n\nSo sequences added from l=1: (\"1\", \"1\") and (\"1\",) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, for l=1, the current string is \"1\" (last character). The sequences from dp[n - l] = dp[2-1=1]. So dp[1] has (\"1\",). So appending the current valid string (which is \"1\") gives (\"1\", \"1\"). Also, the current valid string is added as a new sequence, which is (\"1\",). But wait, isn't that already in dp[1]?\n\nWait, no. The new sequences generated for dp[2] from l=1 are:\n\nTake sequences from dp[1] (which is {(\"1\",)}), append the current valid string (\"1\") → (\"1\", \"1\").\n\nPlus, the current valid string (\"1\") is added as a new sequence. Wait, but that would be adding (\"1\",) again. However, the global set is supposed to collect all sequences from all positions. So for the current step, the sequences added to dp[2] are (\"1\", \"1\") and (\"1\",). But (\"1\",) was already added in step 1. However, in this approach, the global set would accumulate all sequences from all dp[i]s.\n\nBut for the current step, the new sequences generated are (\"1\", \"1\") and (\"1\",). However, the (\"1\",) was already present in dp[1], but the global set would have it counted once. So the total after step 2 would be the union of sequences from dp[1] and dp[2], which includes (\"1\",), (\"1\", \"1\"), and (\"11\",). So total of 3 sequences. Which matches the sample output of 3 for step 2.\n\nYes! So the sample output for step 2 is 3, which aligns with this approach.\n\nThen, step 3: S is \"111\".\n\nCheck l=1: last 1 char is \"1\" → valid. Take sequences from dp[2] (which has (\"1\",), (\"1\", \"1\"), (\"11\",)). Appending \"1\" gives (\"1\", \"1\", \"1\"), (\"1\", \"1\", \"1\")?",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a growing string `S` in Morse code.

For each new character appended to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position and generate new sequences by combining existing sequences with the new valid Morse code strings.\n4. **Efficient Updates**: For each new character, check substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position.
