There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions.

The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$.

The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about building houses on a street with n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit under these constraints.\n\nHmm. The constraints are that for each restriction, the maximum in the interval [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. And I need to choose heights for each spot such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nSince n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible? But even then, for n=50, trying all possibilities would be impossible because each house can have up to h+1 options (from 0 to h). So 50^50 possibilities? That's way too big.\n\nSo brute force isn't feasible. Need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model this as an optimization problem with constraints. How can we model the constraints?\n\nEach restriction requires that the maximum in a certain interval is at most x_i. So for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum of the heights in that interval is <= x_i.\n\nThe problem is similar to some kind of constraint satisfaction problem where we need to assign values to variables (the house heights) such that all constraints are met, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut how to find such an assignment?\n\nAn alternative approach: think of each house's height as being constrained by the restrictions that apply to it. For example, if there are multiple restrictions that include a particular house, the maximum allowed height for that house is the minimum of all the restrictions that apply to it. Wait, no. Because a restriction applies to a range. For example, a restriction on [1,3] with x=2 would imply that each house in 1,2,3 can't be higher than 2. But also, if there's another restriction on [2,4] with x=3, then house 2 and 3 are constrained by both. But the maximum in [1,3] must be <=2, so house 2 and 3 can't be higher than 2, even though the second restriction allows up to 3. So the constraints are not per-house, but per-interval. So for each interval, the maximum in that interval is bounded.\n\nBut how do I model that?\n\nThis seems tricky. One approach is to model this as a problem where for each house, we can determine the maximum possible height it can have, considering all the restrictions that cover it. However, that's not straightforward because the maximum in an interval depends on all houses in that interval. For example, a restriction on [1,3] with x=2 means that all houses in that interval can be at most 2, but if one of them is 2, others can be lower. But if there's a restriction that allows higher values, but overlapping intervals, it's not clear.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the optimal solution is to set each house as high as possible, but considering all the constraints. But how to find that?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum of the houses in that interval must be <=x_i. So, for each such interval, there's a constraint that the maximum of that interval is <=x_i. So, for any interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum of the houses in that interval must be <=x_i.\n\nNow, the problem is similar to a problem where we need to assign values to each house, such that for all the given intervals, their maxima are within the given x_i. And we want to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nHow can we model this? One approach is to find for each house, the maximum possible height it can have, given all constraints. However, since the constraints are on intervals, this is not straightforward.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find for each position i, the minimal maximum allowed by the constraints. For example, if there are multiple constraints that include position i, but each constraint applies to different ranges. For example, if there is a constraint that says that in [1,3], the max is <=2, and another that says in [2,4], the max is <=3. Then for house 2, the maximum allowed is 2 (since in [1,3], the max must be <=2, which includes house 2). So even though the second constraint allows up to 3, the first one restricts it to 2.\n\nSo for each house, the maximum possible height it can have is the minimum of all x_i for which the house is in [l_i, r_i]. But wait, no. Because even if a house is in multiple intervals, the constraints may not directly limit that house's height. For example, suppose there's a constraint that [1,2] has max <=3, and another that [2,3] has max <=2. Then the house 2's height can't be more than 2 (since in the second constraint, the max of [2,3] must be <=2). So house 2 can be at most 2. But the first constraint allows up to 3 for house 2. But the second constraint is more restrictive.\n\nSo, for each house, the maximum possible height it can have is the minimum x_i among all constraints that include that house in their interval. Wait, no. Because even if a house is in a constraint, but that constraint's x_i is not the tightest for that house. For example, if there's a constraint that [1,3] must have max <=5, and another that [2,2] must have max <=3. Then house 2 can be at most 3. Because the second constraint is more restrictive. But the first constraint allows up to 5. So the maximum allowed for house 2 is 3. But if there's no constraints on house 2, then it can be up to h.\n\nBut if a house is part of multiple constraints, then the maximum allowed for that house is the minimal x_i among all constraints that cover that house. Because, for example, if there's a constraint that says the max in [1,2] is <=x, and another that says the max in [1,3] is <=y. If x < y, then the first constraint requires that the max in [1,2] is <=x. Which implies that house 2 can be at most x. So the maximum possible height for house 2 is the minimum of all x_i from constraints that include it in their interval.\n\nWait, but what if there's a constraint on a larger interval that allows higher x_i? For example, suppose there is a constraint that [1,3] must have max <=5, and another that [2,2] must have max <=3. Then the house 2 can be at most 3. Because the second constraint applies to the interval [2,2], which is just house 2. So the maximum in that interval is the height of house 2, which must be <=3. So that's correct. So for any house, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_i from constraints that include that house in their interval. But also, the global maximum h.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. Because even if a house is not covered by any constraints, it can be up to h. But if a house is covered by some constraints, then the maximum allowed for that house is the minimum of the x_i of all constraints that include that house. Because, for example, if there's a constraint that [1,2] must have max <=3. Then house 1 can be up to 3. But if there's another constraint that [1,3] must have max <=5. Then the house 1 can be up to 3 (due to the first constraint), but the second constraint allows up to 5. So the minimum of the x_i's for the constraints that include the house is the limiting factor.\n\nBut this seems like a way to compute for each house, the maximum possible value it can take. Because if we set each house to that maximum, then all constraints are satisfied. Because for any constraint [l_i, r_i], the maximum in that interval is the maximum of the houses in that interval. Since each house in that interval is limited to at most x_i (if that constraint is one of the ones that applies to that house), but wait, no. Because for example, consider a constraint that [1,3] must have max <=5. Suppose that for house 1, there's another constraint that [1,1] must have max <=3. Then the house 1 can be at most 3. House 2 is not covered by any constraints. So the maximum for house 2 is h. Then the maximum in [1,3] is max(3, h, ...). If h is larger than 5, then this would violate the constraint. So in this case, even though each house is set to its maximum according to the constraints that include it, the overall constraint is not satisfied. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh! So this approach is wrong. Because even if each house is set to the minimal x_i from the constraints that include it, the constraints on intervals might not be satisfied. For example, if there's a constraint that the max of [1,3] is <=5, and house 2 has a maximum allowed of 6 (because no constraints on it), but house 1 and 3 have maximum allowed of 3. Then the max of the interval [1,3] would be 6 (house 2's height), which exceeds the constraint of 5. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nSo that's a problem. Therefore, the maximum allowed for each individual house is not sufficient. Because the constraints on intervals can require that the maximum in the interval is <=x_i, which may not be enforced by the individual house constraints.\n\nTherefore, how can we model this correctly?\n\nAlternative idea: The problem is to assign heights to each house such that for every constraint [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that interval is <=x_i. And we need to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with constraints, and we can try to find the optimal solution using some form of dynamic programming or backtracking. However, given the small constraints (n up to 50, h up to 50), perhaps a backtracking approach with pruning is feasible. But even 50^50 possibilities is way too big. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternative approach: think of this as an optimization problem with constraints, and use some form of mathematical programming. However, since the variables are integers, perhaps we can model it as an integer linear programming problem, but that's probably not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For each interval constraint, the maximum of the interval must be <=x_i. To ensure that, for each such interval, all houses in that interval must be <=x_i. Because if all houses in the interval are <=x_i, then the maximum is also <=x_i. However, the converse is not true. If the maximum is <=x_i, then all houses are <=x_i. So the constraints can be transformed into: for each constraint [l_i, r_i], all houses in that interval must be <=x_i. Because that's equivalent to the maximum being <=x_i.\n\nWait, yes! Because if all houses in [l_i, r_i] are <=x_i, then the maximum is <=x_i. Conversely, if the maximum is <=x_i, then all houses are <=x_i. So the original constraints can be transformed into a set of constraints that each house in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i. But that's not correct. Wait, no. Because the original constraint is that the maximum in the interval is <=x_i. Which is equivalent to saying that each house in the interval is <=x_i. So, for each constraint, we can replace it with a set of constraints that each house in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i. Because the maximum is the largest among them. So, for example, if the constraint says that the maximum in [1,3] is <=5, then each house in that interval must be <=5. Therefore, the original problem can be transformed into a problem where for each constraint, we add constraints that each house in [l_i, r_i] must be <=x_i. Then, the problem becomes: assign to each house a height between 0 and h, such that for each constraint, all houses in the interval are <=x_i. And maximize the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but that's a huge simplification. Because if that's the case, then the problem reduces to finding for each house, the maximum possible height it can have, which is the minimum between h and all x_i of constraints that include that house in their interval. Because each constraint that includes the house in its interval imposes that the house must be <=x_i. Therefore, the maximum possible for each house is min(h, min of x_i for all constraints that cover the house).\n\nIf that's the case, then the solution is to compute for each house the maximum allowed value, which is the minimum between h and all x_i of constraints that include that house. Then, set each house to that value, and the sum of squares would be the maximum possible.\n\nBut wait, why? Because each constraint is converted into per-house constraints. So, for example, if a constraint says that [1,3] must have maximum <=5, then each of the houses 1, 2, 3 must be <=5. So, in this case, the maximum for each house is the minimum between h and all x_i's from constraints that include that house. Then, setting each house to that value will satisfy all constraints, and since we're maximizing each house's height (as much as possible), the sum of squares will be maximum.\n\nBut then why in the first example, the answer is [1,3,2], which fits the constraints. Let's check:\n\nIn the first example, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 1 1 → house 1 must be ≤1\n\n2 2 3 → house 2 must be ≤3\n\n3 3 2 → house 3 must be ≤2.\n\nSo, for each house:\n\nhouse 1: min(3, 1) → 1.\n\nhouse 2: min(3, 3) → 3.\n\nhouse 3: min(3, 2) → 2.\n\nWhich gives sum 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 = 14, which matches the example. So that works.\n\nAnother example: the second example input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\nConstraints:\n\n2 3 8 → houses 2 and 3 must be ≤8.\n\n3 4 7 → houses 3 and 4 must be ≤7.\n\nSo for each house:\n\nhouse 1: no constraints. So max is 10.\n\nhouse 2: constraints from first restriction, so 8.\n\nhouse 3: min(8,7) =7.\n\nhouse 4: 7.\n\nSo the heights are [10,8,7,7], sum is 10²+8²+7²+7² = 100+64+49+49= 262, which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for these examples. But why does this approach work in general?\n\nBecause each constraint [l_i, r_i] is converted into per-house constraints that each house in that interval must be <=x_i. Therefore, all constraints are satisfied. And since each house is set to the maximum possible (given all constraints that affect it), the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because if you set each house to the maximum allowed by all constraints, then you can't increase any house's height without violating some constraint. Therefore, this must be the optimal solution.\n\nSo this seems to be a valid approach. Therefore, the problem can be solved by:\n\nFor each house, compute the minimal x_i among all constraints that include that house in their interval. Then, the maximum allowed for the house is min(h, that minimal x_i). If there are no constraints that include the house, then it's h.\n\nOnce we compute that for each house, the sum of squares is the answer.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute for each house the minimal x_i among all constraints that include it in their interval?\n\nSo for each house i (from 1 to n), we need to check all m constraints. For each constraint, if l_i <= current house <= r_i, then the x_i of that constraint is a candidate for the minimal value. Then, the maximum allowed for the house is the minimum of all such x_i's, and h.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize for each house, the maximum allowed is h.\n\nThen, for each constraint (l, r, x):\n\n   for each house in l to r:\n\n       if current maximum allowed for the house is larger than x, set it to x.\n\nOnce all constraints are processed, the maximum allowed for each house is determined. Then, sum the squares.\n\nYes! So this seems to be the solution.\n\nBut why is this correct?\n\nBecause each constraint requires that in the interval [l, r], the maximum is <=x. Which is equivalent to requiring that each house in [l, r] is <=x. So by applying for each house in [l, r], the maximum allowed is the minimum between its current value and x, we ensure that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the approach is to process all constraints, and for each constraint, for each house in [l_i, r_i], set the maximum allowed for that house to be the minimum between its current value and x_i.\n\nOnce that is done, the maximum allowed for each house is the minimal x_i of all constraints that cover it, and h. Then, setting each house to that value will satisfy all constraints, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nThis seems very straightforward and efficient. For n and m up to 50, the total processing is O(m * n), which is acceptable.\n\nLet me test this approach against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 1 1 → house 1 is set to min(3, 1) → 1.\n\n2 2 3 → house 2 is set to min(3, 3) → 3.\n\n3 3 2 → house 3 is set to min(3, 2) → 2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nConstraints:\n\n2 3 8 → for houses 2 and 3, set their max to min(current, 8). Initially, they are 10. So after first constraint, house 2 is 8, house 3 is 8.\n\nSecond constraint: 3-4, 7. So for house 3: min(8,7) →7. For house4: min(10,7) →7.\n\nSo the houses are 10,8,7,7. Sum is 100+64+49+49=262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's imagine a scenario where two constraints overlap. Suppose n=2, h=5, m=2.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 2 3 → so for house 1 and 2, max is 3.\n\nThen another constraint 1 1 4. So for house 1, the max is min(3,4) →3. So house 1 is 3, house 2 is 3. Sum 9+9=18.\n\nBut if the first constraint was 1 2 5, and the second constraint is 1 1 4. Then house 1 is min(5,4)=4. House 2 is 5. So sum is 16+25=41. Which is better.\n\nBut the constraints are that the first constraint says the max in [1,2] must be <=5. The second says the max in [1,1] must be <=4. Which is satisfied by house 1=4 and house 2=5. So the approach works.\n\nAnother example: if there's a constraint that [1,3] must be <=2, and another constraint [2,2] must be <=3. Then, for house 2, the maximum allowed is min(2, 3) = 2. So the approach sets house 2 to 2. Which satisfies the first constraint (max in [1,3] is 2). So that's correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize an array max_heights of size n, with all elements set to h.\n\nFor each of the m constraints:\n\n   l, r, x = ... \n\n   for i from l-1 to r-1 (assuming 0-based index):\n\n       if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n           max_heights[i] = x\n\nOnce all constraints are processed, calculate the sum of squares of each element in max_heights.\n\nSo that's the plan. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe input is given as a list of strings, but in the actual problem, the input is read from stdin. Wait, the user provided sample input shows two test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. For example, the first line of input is n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then perhaps another test case?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, perhaps multiple test cases?\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then the output is a single integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples, but perhaps the actual code needs to handle multiple test cases? Or is that a mistake in the problem description?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input section:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But that's probably because the user provided two examples. But the actual code should read one test case.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list of two examples. But in reality, the code should read from stdin. So, for example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich outputs 14.\n\nIn the second example, input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich outputs 262.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the answer. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. For example, the sample input is given as a list of two inputs, but in reality, the code should process one test case. So the code should read the first line as n, h, m, then m lines, then output the answer.\n\nTherefore, the code should process a single test case.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n, h, m from input.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nInitialize max_heights as [h] * n.\n\nFor each constraint:\n\n   l, r, x = ... \n\n   for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n       if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n           max_heights[i] = x\n\nThen compute the sum of squares.\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nWait, but in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_heights = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\nsum_sq = sum( [h*h for h in max_heights] )\n\nprint(sum_sq)\n\nWait, but for the first example, the code would process the constraints:\n\nFirst constraint is l=1, r=1, x=1. So for i in 0 to 0 (since range(0, 1) is [0]. So the first element is set to 1.\n\nSecond constraint l=2, r=2, x=3. So i=1. The value is 3 (original h=3). So no change.\n\nThird constraint l=3, r=3, x=2. So i=2. Set to 2.\n\nThus sum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 = 14. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nConstraints:\n\n2 3 8 → l=2, r=3. So indexes 1 and 2. So for those positions, set to 8.\n\nThen 3 4 7 → indexes 2 and 3. So for index 2, current value is 8. Set to 7. For index 3, set to 7.\n\nSo the max_heights array is [10, 8, 7, 7]. Sum of squares is 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262. Correct.\n\nSo this code would work.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping constraints? Let's say a constraint that covers a range and another that covers a subset. For example, a constraint [1,3] with x=5, and then [2,2] with x=3. Then for house 2, the code would first set it to 5 (from the first constraint), then set it to 3 (from the second). Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about if a constraint has x_i larger than h? For example, if h is 3, and a constraint says that [1,1] must be <=4. Then, since the maximum allowed is h, which is 3, the code would leave it as 3. Because during initialization, it's set to h. And since the constraint's x is 4, which is larger than current value (3), no change. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are no constraints. Then all houses are set to h, sum is n * h².\n\nAnother case: multiple constraints on the same interval. For example, two constraints on [1,2], x=2 and x=3. The code would process both. The first would set the houses to 2, then the second would check if they are larger than 3. Since they are 2, which is less than 3, no change. So the maximum is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, because the first constraint requires that the maximum in [1,2] is <=2. The second constraint allows up to 3, but the first is more restrictive.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input reading part. The problem says that the input is given as per the first line with n, h, m, then m lines. So the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nThen process as above.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead from stdin. So in Python:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_heights = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum( [a*a for a in max_heights] )\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in Python, the range is exclusive on the upper bound. So for example, if l=2, r=3, then range(l-1, r) is range(1,3) which is 1, 2. Which are the indexes for positions 2 and 3 (since 0-based). So that's correct.\n\nYes. Because for l and r in the problem, which are inclusive, the code converts l to l-1 (starting index) and r is the end index (exclusive). So for example, l=2, r=3 → indexes 1 to 2 (inclusive), which is achieved by range(1, 3) → 1, 2.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1 → l=1, r=1 → range(0, 1) → [0]\n\nso index 0 is set to 1.\n\nThen 2 2 3 → range(1, 2) → index 1 → set to 3.\n\nThen 3 3 2 → range(2,3) → index 2 → set to 2.\n\nsum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8 → l=2, r=3 → indexes 1, 2.\n\nso set those to 8.\n\nThen 3 4 7 → l=3, r=4 → indexes 2, 3.\n\nso for index 2: 8 → 7. index 3: 10 →7.\n\nso the array is [10,8,7,7]. sum is 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code works.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a specific range must not exceed a given height. The goal is to determine the optimal heights for each house to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing an array where each element represents the maximum possible height for each house, initially set to the global maximum height `h`.\n2. **Apply Restrictions**: For each zoning restriction, adjust the maximum possible height for each house within the specified range to ensure it does not exceed the restriction's limit.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the adjusted maximum heights for each house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmax_heights = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l-1, r):\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum(a * a for a in max_heights)\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The array `max_heights` is initialized with the value `h` for each house, representing the highest possible height without any restrictions.\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, iterate over the range of houses specified by the restriction and update their maximum allowed height to be the minimum of their current value and the restriction's height limit. This ensures that all constraints are satisfied.\n3. **Profit Calculation**: The total profit is computed by summing the squares of the adjusted heights, which gives the maximum possible profit under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each restriction and ensures that all constraints are met while maximizing the profit through straightforward iteration and adjustment of house heights. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of restrictions and houses, making it efficient for the given problem constraints.",
