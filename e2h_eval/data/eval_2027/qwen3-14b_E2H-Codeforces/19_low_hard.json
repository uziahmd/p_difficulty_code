The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every two districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we have to output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nSo, the key here is to maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, we want to keep the districts with the highest possible numbers. However, there's a catch: removing certain districts might disconnect the tree, so we can't just remove the smallest k districts. Wait, but how do we ensure that the remaining districts are connected?\n\nLet me think. The optimal strategy would be to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. But since the tree is connected, we need to make sure that after removing k districts, the remaining ones form a connected subtree. So perhaps we need to find a subtree with (n - k) nodes that has the maximum sum of 2^i, and then remove the other nodes.\n\nBut how do we find such a subtree? Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible nodes, maybe we should prioritize keeping the largest nodes. However, the problem is that those nodes might be scattered in the tree and not connected. So we need to select a connected subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to perform some kind of greedy selection. Let's think about the following idea: start with the highest-numbered node (n), and then include as many higher-numbered nodes as possible while maintaining connectivity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as choosing which nodes to keep. Since the sum depends on the nodes kept, we need to choose (n - k) nodes that form a connected subtree, and have the maximum possible sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes kept, and since 2^i increases with i, we want to keep the largest possible nodes. However, the challenge is ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo maybe the optimal way is to select the largest (n -k) nodes, but check if they form a connected subtree. If not, then we need to adjust by including some lower-numbered nodes that connect them.\n\nBut how can we efficiently check that? For example, suppose n is 6, k is 3. Then we need to keep 3 nodes. The largest three are 6,5,4. Are they connected? Well, in the first sample input, the tree structure is such that 6 is connected to 2, which is connected to 1, 3, 4. So 4 is connected to 2. 5 is connected to 6. So 6,5,4 are connected through 6-2-4 and 6-5. So yes, they are connected. But in that case, why does the sample solution remove 1,3,4? Because the sample output is removing 1,3,4, leaving 2,5,6. Oh wait, the sample's answer is 1,3,4. Wait, the sample says that the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. But if you kept 4,5,6, that would be 16+32+64=112, which is higher. So why isn't that the case? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait the first input is:\n\n6 3\n\nThen the edges are:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the tree is structured like this:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. District 6 is connected to 5. So the tree looks like:\n\n- 2 is central. Its children are 1, 3, 4, 6. 6 has child 5.\n\nSo the districts are 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nIf the president removes 3 districts, and wants to keep 3 districts. The sample output is removing 1,3,4. So the remaining are 2,5,6. Their sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4+32+64=100. But what if we kept 4,5,6? Then the sum is 16+32+64=112. But how are they connected? 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6. 6 is connected to 5. So 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to remove `k` districts from a tree such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the sum of fans (2^i for each district) is maximized. The key insight is to prioritize keeping the districts with the highest numbers while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: Since the value of each district increases exponentially with its number, we aim to keep the highest-numbered districts possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the selected districts form a connected subtree. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered node and iteratively adding the next highest-numbered nodes while maintaining connectivity using a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n\n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts\n    target = n - k\n\n    # We will use a priority queue (max heap) approach, but since Python's heapq is min-heap,\n    # we'll invert the values.\n    # Start with the highest node, and then add children in a way that maintains connectivity.\n\n    # We'll use BFS or DFS to find the necessary nodes to keep.\n    # However, to maximize the sum, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\n    # Let's think of it as selecting the highest nodes and checking if they are connected.\n    # To do that efficiently, we can perform a reverse process: starting from the highest node,\n    # and greedily adding nodes in descending order, using Union-Find to check connectivity.\n\n    # First, we need to process nodes in descending order.\n    # We'll use a priority queue (max heap) to process nodes from largest to smallest.\n\n    # However, since we need to process nodes in order and check their connectivity,\n    # we can use a BFS/DFS approach starting from the highest node and expanding to the next highest nodes.\n\n    # Another approach is to realize that the optimal set of nodes to keep is the largest (n - k) nodes\n    # that form a connected subtree. So we can start with the highest node and then add the next highest\n    # nodes that are connected to the current set.\n\n    # Let's use a BFS approach where we start with the highest node, and then for each subsequent step,\n    # we add the next highest node that is connected to the current set.\n\n    # To implement this, we can use a priority queue (max heap) of nodes not yet included, and a set\n    # of nodes that are part of the connected component.\n\n    # But how to efficiently check connectivity? Maybe we can use BFS or DFS to check if the next node\n    # is connected to the current set.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can use a Union-Find (DSU) structure to track connected components.\n\n    # Here's the plan:\n    # 1. Sort all nodes in descending order.\n    # 2. Initialize DSU.\n    # 3. For each node in this sorted list, check if it's connected to the current set. If yes, add it.\n    # 4. Continue until we have added (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # Wait, but how to check if a node is connected to the current set? Because DSU can only tell us if two nodes are connected.\n\n    # Maybe another approach: start with the highest node. Then, for each next node in descending order,\n    # check if it is connected to the current set. If yes, add it. Otherwise, skip. But how to check connectivity?\n\n    # A better idea: use BFS/DFS to explore the tree, starting from the highest node, and include all nodes\n    # that are reachable through higher-numbered nodes.\n\n    # Wait, but this might not work because the higher-numbered nodes may not be connected directly.\n\n    # Let's try this approach:\n    # 1. Sort the nodes in descending order.\n    # 2. Start with the highest node, mark it as included.\n    # 3. For each subsequent node in the sorted list, check if it is connected to the included set.\n    # 4. If yes, include it. Repeat until we have included (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # To check if a node is connected to the included set, we can perform a BFS or DFS on the included nodes.\n\n    # However, this could be inefficient for large n. So we need an efficient way.\n\n    # Let's think about building a graph where we only include nodes that are part of the included set. As we process nodes in descending order, we can check if the node is connected to the included set via existing edges.\n\n    # Here's the algorithm:\n    # - Create a visited array to track included nodes.\n    # - Start with the highest node (n), mark it as visited.\n    # - Use a priority queue (max heap) of nodes not yet processed, sorted in descending order.\n    # - For each node in the priority queue:\n    #   - If it's already visited, skip.\n    #   - Otherwise, check if any of its neighbors are visited. If yes, add it to the visited set.\n    #   - Repeat this until we have visited (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # Wait, but this approach may not work because even if a node has a neighbor that is visited, it might not be part of the connected component. However, since we're processing nodes in descending order, once we include a node, we can check its neighbors and add them if they are higher than others.\n\n    # Alternatively, here's a more efficient approach inspired by Krusky's algorithm:\n    # 1. Sort all the nodes in descending order.\n    # 2. Use a Union-Find (DSU) structure.\n    # 3. For each node in the sorted list, check if it is connected to the current set of included nodes. If not, skip. If yes, include it.\n    # 4. Continue until we have included (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # But again, how to check if a node is connected to the current set? The DSU would need to track which nodes are included. So perhaps we can process the nodes in descending order and for each node, check if any of its neighbors are already in the DSU. If yes, we can union them.\n\n    # Here's the detailed plan:\n    # - Initialize DSU.\n    # - Sort all nodes in descending order.\n    # - For each node in this sorted list:\n    #   - If the node is already in the DSU, skip.\n    #   - Check all its neighbors.

But how to check connectivity?\n\n    # A better idea: use BFS/DFS to explore the tree, starting from the highest node, and include all nodes\n    # that are reachable through higher-numbered nodes.\n\n    # Wait, but this might not work because the higher-numbered nodes may not be connected directly.\n\n    # Let's try this approach:\n    # 1. Sort the nodes in descending order.\n    # 2. Start with the highest node, mark it as included.\n    # 3. For each subsequent node in the sorted list, check if it is connected to the included set.\n    # 4. If yes, include it. Repeat until we have included (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # To check if a node is connected to the included set, we can perform a BFS or DFS on the included nodes.\n\n    # However, this could be inefficient for large n. So we need an efficient way.\n\n    # Let's think about building a graph where we only include nodes that are part of the included set. As we process nodes in descending order, we can check if the node is connected to the included set via existing edges.\n\n    # Here's the algorithm:\n    # - Create a visited array to track included nodes.\n    # - Start with the highest node (n), mark it as visited.\n    # - Use a priority queue (max heap) of nodes not yet processed, sorted in descending order.\n    # - For each node in the priority queue:\n    #   - If it's already visited, skip.\n    #   - Otherwise, check if any of its neighbors are visited. If yes, add it to the visited set.\n    #   - Repeat this until we have visited (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # Wait, but this approach may not work because even if a node has a neighbor that is visited, it might not be part of the connected component. However, since we're processing nodes in descending order, once we include a node, we can check its neighbors and add them if they are higher than others.\n\n    # Alternatively, here's a more efficient approach inspired by Krusky's algorithm:\n    # 1. Sort all the nodes in descending order.\n    # 2. Use a Union-Find (DSU) structure.\n    # 3. For each node in the sorted list, check if it is connected to the current set of included nodes. If not, skip. If yes, include it.\n    # 4. Continue until we have included (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # But again, how to check if a node is connected to the current set? The DSU would need to track which nodes are included. So perhaps we can process the nodes in descending order and for each node, check if any of its neighbors are already in the DSU. If yes, we can union them.\n\n    # Here's the detailed plan:\n    # - Initialize DSU.\n    # - Sort all nodes in descending order.\n    # - For each node in this sorted list:\n    #   - If the node is already in the DSU, skip.\n    #   - Check all its neighbors. If any neighbor is in the DSU, then add this node to the DSU.\n    #   - Repeat until we have added (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # This approach ensures that we always add the highest possible nodes first, and connect them with their neighbors if they are already in the DSU.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this.\n\n    # DSU implementation\n    class DSU:\n        def __init__(self, size):\n            self.parent = list(range(size + 1))\n            self.rank = [0] * (size + 1)\n        \n        def find(self, x):\n            if self.parent[x] != x:\n                self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])\n            return self.parent[x]\n        \n        def union(self, x, y):\n            x_root = self.find(x)\n            y_root = self.find(y)\n            if x_root == y_root:\n                return False\n            if self.rank[x_root] < self.rank[y_root]:\n                self.parent[x_root] = y_root\n            else:\n                self.parent[y_root] = x_root\n                if self.rank[x_root] == self.rank[y_root]:\n                    self.rank[x_root] += 1\n            return True\n\n    dsu = DSU(n)\n    nodes = list(range(n, 0, -1))  # Descending order\n    included = set()\n    count = 0\n\n    for node in nodes:\n        if count >= target:\n            break\n        # Check if any neighbor is already in the DSU\n        # To check this, we can look at all neighbors and see if any of them is in the DSU\n        # However, the DSU is initially empty.

Because the DSU is built incrementally, and we can track whether a node is included by checking if it's in the included set.\n        # Alternatively, we can check if the DSU's parent of the neighbor is itself (but that's not reliable unless we track).\n\n        # So we can maintain a set of included nodes.

The rest are to be removed.\n    # However, we might not have enough nodes in 'included' yet. So we need to continue processing.\n\n    # Wait, the above approach might not work correctly. Because after adding the first node, we need to process other nodes and check their neighbors.
