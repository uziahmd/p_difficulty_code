Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to select souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding a weight limit. The constraints are that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Also, each souvenir's weight is between 1 and 3. Hmm, so the weights are small. That probably suggests some kind of dynamic programming approach optimized for the small weights.\n\nThe classic knapsack problem is O(nm), but with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, that would be 3e10 operations, which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach here.\n\nSince the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can group items by their weight and then find an optimal way to select them. Let me think about how to handle each weight group.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items: we can take as many as possible, but since they have different costs, we should take the ones with the highest cost first. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nBut how do we combine them optimally? Because choosing more of one weight might affect the number of others we can take.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have all the items sorted in descending order of cost per weight. But maybe that's not directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, for each weight group (1, 2, 3), we can sort their items in descending order of cost, and then for each group, we can precompute prefix sums. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each group, we can calculate the total cost and weight, and find the maximum.\n\nBut how to combine these groups efficiently?\n\nLet me consider that the maximum number of items for each weight:\n\nFor weight 1: the maximum possible is m, but since each item has weight 1, taking the top k items (sorted by cost) gives total weight k and cost sum of top k.\n\nSame for weight 2: max possible is floor(m/2) items.\n\nWeight 3: floor(m/3) items.\n\nBut the problem is that when combining different weights, the total weight must not exceed m. So perhaps we can iterate over the number of weight 3 items taken, then for each possible number, compute the remaining weight and decide how to split between weight 1 and 2.\n\nWait, but even that could be expensive if done naively. However, since the weight of 3 items is limited, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me think. For example, let's say we have sorted all weight 1 items in descending order, and compute prefix sums. Same for weight 2 and 3.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items taken (let's say x), we can take up to x_max = min( (m // 3), len(weight3_items) ). Then, for each x, the remaining weight is m - 3*x. Now, for this remaining weight, we need to choose the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nFor the remaining weight W = m - 3x, we can think of choosing some number of weight 2 items and the rest as weight 1 items. Let's say we take y weight 2 items. Then the total weight is 2y + z, where z is the number of weight 1 items. And 2y + z <= W. But since we want to maximize the total cost, perhaps for each possible y (up to min(W//2, len(weight2_items)), we can take the maximum possible y and then take the remaining weight as z.\n\nBut again, trying all possible y for each x would be O(m) time, which may not be feasible if x can be up to m/3.\n\nAlternatively, for the remaining weight W, we can find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items. How?\n\nLet me think: For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (y), the maximum number of weight 1 items is W - 2y. But since we can't take more than the available weight 1 items, and the same for weight 2. So for each possible y, we can compute the maximum possible sum as sum_2[y] + sum_1[ (W - 2y) ].\n\nBut how to find the optimal y here?\n\nThe key is that for each W, we can iterate through all possible y in the range [max(0, (W - (len_1)) // 2 ), ... ] ?\n\nWait, but the maximum possible y is min( (W // 2), len_2 ). So for each W, we can try all possible y in that range. However, if W is up to 3e5, then for each x, this could be O(W) steps. Which would be O(m^2) steps overall, which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the case where we have two groups: weight 1 and weight 2. For a given total weight W, what is the best combination?\n\nSuppose we have prefix sums for weight 1 (s1) and weight 2 (s2). For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (y), the maximum number of weight 1 items is (W - 2y). However, since we can't take more than the available items in each group, we need to cap it.\n\nBut how to find the optimal y quickly?\n\nLet me think of it as for each possible y (number of weight 2 items), we can take up to y_max = min( (W // 2), len2 ). Then, for each y, the number of weight 1 items is min( (W - 2y), len1 ). But how to find the maximum s2[y] + s1[ min( (W - 2y), len1 ) ] ?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with binary search or by finding the optimal y in some way.\n\nAlternatively, since for a given W, the optimal y could be found by considering that for each possible y, the total weight is 2y + z = W, but z can be up to W - 2y. However, since we have sorted the items in descending order of cost, the prefix sums for each group are non-decreasing.\n\nSo, for each possible y, the maximum possible contribution is s2[y] + s1[ min( (W - 2y), len1 ) ].\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this function over all possible y?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each W, the optimal y is such that 2y is as large as possible, but not exceeding W. However, since the sum of s2[y] and s1[W-2y] may not be maximized at the extremes.\n\nBut perhaps for each W, the optimal y can be found by checking a few candidates. For example, the maximum between taking as many weight 2 items as possible, or as many weight 1 items as possible, or something in between. However, this approach may not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight of the 2 items is larger, perhaps we can find that for each possible W, the optimal y is around (W - k) / 2, where k is the number of weight 1 items.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to note that for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection is to take the best possible items, regardless of their weight. But how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible total weight up to m, the maximum value. But since m is up to 3e5, and for each possible W, we can compute this in O(1) time using the prefix sums.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the problem reduces to a knapsack with items of weight 1 and 2. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible total weight W, the maximum value by considering the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: For a given W, the maximum value is the maximum between taking y weight 2 items and (W - 2y) weight 1 items, for all possible y in 0 ≤ y ≤ min(W//2, len2).\n\nBut since the number of weight 2 items is limited, and the number of weight 1 items is also limited, perhaps we can find the optimal y by iterating through all possible y in a certain range. However, this could be O(W) for each W, which would be too slow if done for each x.\n\nBut considering that the weight of the 3 items is up to m, and for each x, the W is m - 3x, which could be up to m. So for x up to m/3, this would be O(m * m) time, which is not feasible for m=3e5.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So I need a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the weight of the items is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can use a dynamic programming approach with the weight up to m, but optimize it for the small weights.\n\nLet me think: For each weight class, process them in a way that allows us to update the DP efficiently.\n\nThe standard unbounded knapsack is O(nm), but here n is 1e5. But since the weights are small, maybe we can process all items of the same weight together.\n\nWait, for example, for all items of weight 1, since they can be taken any number of times (but in this problem, each item is unique, so it's 0-1 knapsack). So the standard 0-1 knapsack approach is needed.\n\nBut for 0-1 knapsack, even with n=1e5, it's impossible to do O(nm) time. Therefore, we need another approach.\n\nBut given that the weights are only 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can find a way to process each group (weight 1, 2, 3) in a way that allows us to compute the best possible selection.\n\nLet me think again. Let's separate the items into three groups: w1, w2, w3.\n\nFor each group, we can sort them in descending order of cost. Then, compute prefix sums for each group.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem becomes selecting x items from w3, y items from w2, and z items from w1, such that 3x + 2y + z ≤ m, and the sum of the prefix sums is maximized.\n\nSo the challenge is to find x, y, z that satisfy the constraint and maximize the sum.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nLoop over all possible x (number of w3 items taken). For each x, the maximum possible x is min( (m // 3), len(w3) ). For each x, the remaining weight is rem = m - 3x.\n\nNow, for rem, we need to select y items from w2 and z items from w1 such that 2y + z ≤ rem. And we want to maximize s2[y] + s1[z].\n\nBut how to compute this maximum for rem quickly.\n\nLet me think about rem. For rem, the maximum possible y is min( (rem // 2), len(w2) ). Let's denote that as y_max. Then, for each possible y in 0 to y_max, we can take up to z = rem - 2y items from w1. But since z can't exceed len(w1), we take min(rem - 2y, len(w1)).\n\nSo for each x, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y of s2[y] + s1[ min(rem - 2y, len1) ].\n\nBut how to compute this maximum efficiently.\n\nIf I can find for a given rem, the optimal y quickly, then this approach would work.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min(rem - 2y, len1) ].\n\nWe can note that s2 is a non-decreasing function (since we take the top y items), and s1 is also non-decreasing. However, rem - 2y decreases as y increases. So for higher y, the term rem - 2y decreases, which may decrease the value of s1[...], but s2[y] increases.\n\nSo the function f(y) could have a single peak, which suggests that we can find the optimal y using ternary search. However, since y is an integer, ternary search could be applied here. But I need to confirm whether the function is unimodal.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible rem, the optimal y is in the vicinity of (rem - k)/2, where k is the number of weight 1 items. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, the optimal y can be found by considering the possible candidates where 2y is as close as possible to rem - (some value). But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For a given rem, the optimal y is either floor( (rem) / 2 ), or floor( (rem - 1) / 2 ), or some similar value. However, this is not necessarily true.\n\nBut given that the maximum possible y is y_max, which is up to rem//2, which for rem up to 3e5, and x up to m/3, this would be O( (m/3) * (m/2) ) = O(m^2) time, which is too slow.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible rem, precompute the best combination of y and z. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible total weight up to m, the maximum value. Then, during the main loop over x, we can just query this precomputed array for the rem value.\n\nBut how to compute this for weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think. Let's create a dp array for the weight 1 and 2 items. The size of the dp array is up to m. For each weight w in 1..m, dp[w] represents the maximum value achievable with total weight w using only weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nHow to compute this dp array?\n\nBut the items are of weight 1 and 2. So for each possible weight, we can process the items of weight 1 and 2.\n\nBut since the items are sorted in descending order, and we can take each item once, perhaps we can compute the dp array efficiently.\n\nWait, but the standard 0-1 knapsack approach for this would be O(m * (n1 + n2)), which is again too slow for n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute this dp array more efficiently, given that the items are sorted.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, we can take as many as possible. Since they are sorted, the best is to take the top k items where k is as large as possible.\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 items.\n\nSo, for the combined problem of weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps the optimal selection is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible weights.\n\nLet me think. For a given weight capacity W, the optimal selection is to take as many of the highest-value weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the rest with weight 1 items. Or take one less weight 2 item and fill with more weight 1 items, etc. But how to find the best between these options.\n\nBut this sounds similar to the earlier approach where for each W, we try all possible y (number of weight 2 items) and find the best combination.\n\nBut again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for a given weight W can be computed as follows:\n\nLet’s suppose we have all weight 1 items sorted in descending order, and all weight 2 items sorted in descending order. For each possible number of weight 2 items y (from 0 to min(len(w2), W//2)), the maximum number of weight 1 items is W - 2y, but cannot exceed the number of available weight 1 items. Then, the maximum value is s2[y] + s1[min(W - 2y, len1)].\n\nBut to compute this for all W up to m, we can precompute for each W the maximum of this expression over all possible y.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nLet me think: For each possible W, we can find the optimal y by considering that y can be up to min(W//2, len2). But for each W, this would take O(len2) time. However, if len2 is up to 1e5, and W is up to 3e5, this would be O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible y (number of weight 2 items taken), and then for each possible weight 2y, we can add the corresponding s2[y] and then fill the rest with weight 1 items. But again, how to manage this.\n\nWait, but for each y, the weight used is 2y. Then, for any W >= 2y, we can add s2[y] + s1[ min(W - 2y, len1) ].\n\nSo for all W >= 2y, this is a candidate value. However, how to find for each W the maximum among all possible y.\n\nThis seems like a range update problem. For each y, we can generate a range [2y, m], and for each W in that range, we can consider the value s2[y] + s1[ min(W - 2y, len1) ].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible y, we can compute the maximum W that can be covered by this y. For example, if W is large enough to accommodate 2y, then the contribution is s2[y] + s1[ min(W - 2y, len1) ].\n\nBut how to find for each W the maximum value across all possible y.\n\nThis feels complex. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me consider that for the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum possible value for any W is the maximum between:\n\n1. Taking as many weight 2 items as possible, then filling with weight 1 items.\n\n2. Taking one less weight 2 item, and filling with more weight 1 items.\n\n3. Etc.\n\nBut since the weight 2 items are sorted, the best choice is to take as many as possible of the highest value ones. However, sometimes taking fewer weight 2 items and more weight 1 items could give a better total.\n\nBut how to find the optimal point.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose W is 5. We can take 2 weight 2 items (total weight 4) and 1 weight 1 item (total 5). Or take 1 weight 2 item (weight 2) and 3 weight 1 items (total 5). Which is better depends on the values.\n\nBut how to find this quickly.\n\nMaybe for each possible W, the optimal y is around floor((W * c2)/ (2c1 + c2)) ), but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, their prefix sums are increasing. So for a fixed y, the more weight 1 items we can take, the better. So for a given y, the value is s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ].\n\nNow, for a given W, the function f(y) is s2[y] + s1[ min(W - 2y, len1) ].\n\nAs y increases, s2[y] increases, but W - 2y decreases, so s1[...] decreases. The optimal y is where the sum is maximized.\n\nBut since s2 and s1 are both non-decreasing, the function f(y) may have a single maximum point. If this is true, we can perform a binary search to find the optimal y for a given W.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nLet me imagine that for a given W, as y increases from 0 to y_max, the function f(y) first increases and then decreases. This would make it unimodal, allowing binary search.\n\nAlternatively, it could increase and then stay flat, or have multiple peaks. But assuming it's unimodal would allow us to find the optimal y via ternary search.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for a given W: perform a ternary search on y in [0, y_max], and find the y that maximizes f(y).\n\nBut how to determine if the function is indeed unimodal. Well, it's possible that it's not, but perhaps in practice, this approach would work.\n\nAlternatively, we can try all possible y in a small range around the optimal candidate.\n\nBut how to find that candidate.\n\nLet me think for a given W, the optimal y is approximately (W * average value per unit weight of weight 2 items) divided by (average value per unit weight of weight 2 items + ...). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, the optimal y for a given W could be either the maximum possible y (floor(W/2)), or the maximum possible y minus some small number (like 0, 1, 2, etc.), or the maximum y where 2y is less than W.\n\nBut how many possibilities would that be?\n\nFor example, for each W, we can check all possible y in the range [max(0, y_max - K), y_max], where K is a small constant like 100. If K is small, then for each W, this would be O(K) time.\n\nBut what is K? Well, since the weight 1 items are sorted, if we have a lot of high-value items, it might be better to take fewer weight 2 items and more weight 1 items. However, since the weight 2 items have higher weight, the number of possibilities is limited.\n\nBut how to choose K. For example, if K is 300, then for each W, it's O(300) operations, which multiplied by m (say 3e5) gives 9e7 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut why would this work?\n\nWell, for a given W, the optimal y is likely to be in the vicinity of the y that makes 2y as close as possible to W - z, where z is the number of weight 1 items. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the weight 1 items are sorted, the marginal gain of adding one more weight 1 item is the next item's cost. Similarly for weight 2 items. So the optimal y would be where the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item is higher than the marginal gain of adding weight 1 items.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For each possible W, iterate y from max(0, y_max - 200) to y_max, and take the maximum value. This would cover all possible cases where the optimal y is within 200 steps of the maximum possible y. This is a heuristic, but perhaps it works for the problem's constraints.\n\nWhy would this work? Because the weight 1 items have higher density (cost per weight) than the weight 2 items, or vice versa. But since the items are sorted, the highest-value items are taken first. So, for example, if the weight 2 items have higher value per unit weight than weight 1 items, then taking as many weight 2 items as possible would be better. But if the weight 1 items are more valuable per unit weight, then taking more weight 1 items is better.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, the prefix sums are maximized for the first k items.\n\nSo, for a given W, the optimal y is somewhere near the point where the value of the next weight 2 item is less than the value of the next weight 1 item.\n\nBut how to find this point.\n\nAlternatively, for the given W, the optimal y is the largest possible y such that the cost of the (y+1)th weight 2 item is less than the cost of the (W - 2y)th weight 1 item.\n\nBut this requires knowing the individual items, not just the prefix sums.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nLet me return to the initial idea of handling the weight 3 items first. For each x (number of weight 3 items taken), we can compute the remaining weight and then find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items. \n\nAssuming that for each x, the rem is m - 3x. And for this rem, we can find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items in O(1) or O(k) time with some pre-processing.\n\nLet me think: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute two arrays: the prefix sums for weight 1 (s1) and for weight 2 (s2). Then, for any given rem, the optimal combination is to take y weight 2 items and as many weight 1 items as possible (up to rem - 2y). \n\nBut how to find the optimal y for this rem.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor the given rem, we can take y_max = min(rem // 2, len2). Then, the optimal y is either y_max, or y_max - 1, or ..., down to some lower bound. However, how far do we need to go?\n\nFor example, if we take y_max, then we have rem - 2*y_max weight left for weight 1 items. But if there are many high-value weight 1 items, maybe taking fewer y_max and more weight 1 items is better.\n\nBut how to find this quickly.\n\nLet me consider that for each possible rem, the optimal y is either y_max, y_max - 1, or y_max - 2, etc., up to a certain number of steps. For example, try all possible y in the range [max(0, y_max - 200), y_max]. This is a heuristic, but with 200 steps per rem, and with x up to m/3, this would be O( (m/3) * 200 ) = 2e5 * 200 = 4e7 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut why would this work?\n\nBecause the difference between taking y and y-1 is that you lose one weight 2 item (cost s2[y] - s2[y-1]) and gain 2 weight 1 items (cost s1[rem - 2(y-1)] - s1[rem - 2y]). So, if the value of the lost weight 2 item is less than the value gained from the added weight 1 items, then taking y-1 is better.\n\nBut since the weight 1 items are sorted, the added items are the next ones. So, for example, if you take y-1 instead of y, you have 2 more weight units to allocate to weight 1 items. So you can take two more items, or one if the remaining weight is less.\n\nBut this depends on the specific items. However, since the items are sorted, the marginal gain of adding a weight 1 item is decreasing. So, the optimal y is likely to be near y_max, and trying a few steps around it would capture the maximum.\n\nSo, with this in mind, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight (w1, w2, w3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. Iterate over all possible x (number of weight 3 items taken). For each x:\n\n   a. Calculate rem = m - 3x. If rem < 0, skip.\n\n   b. For this rem, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items. To do this:\n\n      i. Compute y_max = min(rem // 2, len(w2)).\n\n      ii. Try y in the range from max(0, y_max - 200) to y_max.\n\n      iii. For each y in this range, compute the number of weight 1 items as z = min(rem - 2y, len(w1)).\n\n      iv. Compute the total cost as s3[x] + s2[y] + s1[z].\n\n      v. Keep track of the maximum value found.\n\n5. The overall maximum is the maximum value found across all x and their corresponding y ranges.\n\nNow, the question is: what value of the range (like 200) is sufficient to cover all possible cases?\n\nWell, for example, if there are 200 weight 1 items that are very valuable, and the weight 2 items are less valuable, then taking fewer y and more z could be better. Trying up to 200 steps back from y_max would cover this scenario.\n\nBut how to choose the number of steps? Well, given that the weight of the items is small (1, 2, 3), and the maximum possible value of ci is 1e9, it's possible that even a few steps could be sufficient. However, this is a heuristic and may not work for all cases. But given the time constraints, this seems like the most feasible approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then, for each of the n items, group them into w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each group in descending order.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group. For example, s1[i] is the sum of the first i items in w1. Similarly for s2 and s3.\n\nThen, for x in 0 to min(len(w3), m//3):\n\n   rem = m - 3*x\n\n   if rem < 0: continue\n\n   compute the best for rem, as discussed.\n\nNow, for the best for rem:\n\n   y_max = min(rem // 2, len(w2))\n\n   start_y = max(0, y_max - 200)\n\n   for y in start_y ... y_max:\n\n       z = rem - 2*y\n\n       if z < 0: continue\n\n       z = min(z, len(w1))\n\n       current_sum = s3[x] + s2[y] + s1[z]\n\n       keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut wait, for the case where rem is large, but y_max could be large. For example, if rem is 3e5, then y_max could be 1.5e5, and trying 200 steps around it would be manageable.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is further away from y_max? For example, if the optimal y is much smaller than y_max. In that case, this approach would miss it.\n\nBut given the time constraints, this seems like the best option. Perhaps in practice, the test cases will pass with this approach.\n\nAlternatively, what if we set the range to be up to len(w2)? That would be O(len(w2)) per x, which is again too slow.\n\nBut for the given constraints, perhaps the code can be optimized further. For example, what if we precompute for all possible rem, the best combination of y and z? But I don't see a way to do that.\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the best combination can be found by taking all possible weight 2 items up to y_max, and then filling the rest with weight 1 items. However, there might be cases where taking fewer weight 2 items and more weight 1 items gives a better result. But how often does that happen?\n\nFor example, suppose rem is 5. If the weight 2 items are [5, 5], and the weight 1 items are [6, 6, 6]. Then taking y=2 (total weight 4) and z=1 (total cost 5+5 +6=16) is worse than taking y=1 (weight 2), z=3 (cost 5 + 6*3= 23). So, in this case, the optimal y is y_max - 1.\n\nSo, trying a few steps below y_max would capture this.\n\nSo, setting the range to 200 steps seems reasonable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, group into w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each group in descending order.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group. For example:\n\ns1 = [0]\nfor i in range(len(w1)):\n    s1.append(s1[-1] + w1[i])\n\nSimilarly for s2 and s3.\n\nThen, initialize max_total to 0.\n\nFor x in 0 to min(len(w3), m // 3):\n\n   current_weight_3 = 3 * x\n\n   if current_weight_3 > m: continue\n\n   rem = m - current_weight_3\n\n   # Now handle rem with w1 and w2.\n\n   len_w2 = len(w2)\n\n   y_max = min(rem // 2, len_w2)\n\n   start_y = max(0, y_max - 200)\n\n   current_max = 0\n\n   for y in range(start_y, y_max + 1):\n\n       # compute z\n\n       remaining_weight = rem - 2*y\n\n       if remaining_weight < 0:\n\n           continue\n\n       z = min(remaining_weight, len(w1))\n\n       total = s3[x] + s2[y] + s1[z]\n\n       if total > current_max:\n\n           current_max = total\n\n   if current_max > max_total:\n\n       max_total = current_max\n\nSo, after processing all x, output max_total.\n\nBut what about when rem is small, and y_max is zero? Then the loop runs from 0 to 0.\n\nThis seems okay.\n\nBut what about when the optimal y is not in the range [y_max - 200, y_max]? For example, if the optimal y is y_max - 300. Then the code would miss it. But with the given constraints, perhaps this is unlikely, or the problem's test cases are designed to allow this.\n\nBut what is the worst-case scenario? For example, if all weight 2 items have very low value, and weight 1 items have very high value. Then, for rem = 1e5, y_max is 5e4, but the optimal y is 0. Trying 200 steps around y_max would not reach that.\n\nIn that case, the code would fail. So, this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. So, what's another way?\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nFor the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, for a given rem, the optimal selection is to take as many weight 1 items as possible, and then fill with weight 2 items. Or the other way around. But how to find the best between these two.\n\nBut again, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible rem, the optimal number of weight 2 items is either floor( (rem) / 2 ), floor( (rem - 1)/2 ), ..., down to 0. But again, this is too slow.\n\nBut given that the weight of the items is small, perhaps we can find for each possible rem, the optimal y by considering the following:\n\nThe optimal y is the one that maximizes s2[y] + s1[ min(rem - 2y, len1) ].\n\nLet me think about rem as fixed. Let's define for each y, the value of s2[y] + s1[ min(rem - 2y, len1) ].\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(y). Now, since s2 is non-decreasing, and s1 is non-decreasing, but the term rem - 2y is decreasing, it's possible that this function is unimodal. If it is, then we can perform ternary search on y to find the maximum.\n\nBut how to confirm that.\n\nLet me imagine that as y increases, initially, the increase in s2[y] dominates the decrease in s1[...], leading to an increase in f(y). After some point, the decrease in s1[...] dominates, leading to a decrease in f(y). Thus, the function is unimodal, and ternary search can be applied.\n\nIf this is true, then for each rem, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max], and find the optimal y.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the ternary search steps. For a given range [low, high], we compute mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3, mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3. Compare f(mid1) and f(mid2), and narrow the search range accordingly.\n\nBut since y must be an integer, and the function may not be strictly unimodal, there's a chance that this approach could fail. However, given that the function is likely to be unimodal in practice, this approach might work.\n\nLet me try to implement this.\n\nFor each rem, perform a ternary search on y in [0, y_max], and find the maximum f(y).\n\nBut how to handle the min(rem - 2y, len1) part. For example, if rem - 2y is larger than len1, then we can't take more than len1 items. So, the actual value is s1[len1].\n\nBut since",
