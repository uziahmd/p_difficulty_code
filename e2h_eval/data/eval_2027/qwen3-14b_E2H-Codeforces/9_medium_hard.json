Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (which is 1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are pretty tight: n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So we need an efficient solution.\n\nHmm, the classic knapsack problem, but with the twist that the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3. That must be exploitable for a more efficient approach than the standard DP which would be O(nm) and not feasible here.\n\nLet me think. For standard knapsack with large m, we can't use the O(nm) DP approach because 1e5 * 3e5 is way too big. So we need a smarter way.\n\nSince the weights are only 1, 2, 3, maybe we can group the items by their weight and then find the optimal way to select items from each group.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFor each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, we can precompute the prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from that group, we can quickly compute the total cost.\n\nBut how do we combine these groups optimally?\n\nThe idea is that for each weight group, we can take some number of items, and then combine them in such a way that the total weight doesn't exceed m.\n\nSo for example, let's say we have all items sorted for weight 1, 2, 3. Then for each possible number of weight 1 items taken, we can compute how many weight 2 and 3 items can be taken, but that might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can iterate over the possible number of weight 3 items, then for each, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nWait, but even that could be expensive if done naively. Let me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, process each weight group:\n\n- For weight 1: sort in descending order of cost. Compute prefix sums. Let's say we have a list s1 where s1[k] is the sum of the first k items. Similarly for s2 (weight 2) and s3 (weight 3).\n\nOnce we have these, the problem becomes choosing how many items to take from each group, such that total weight is <= m, and total cost is maximized.\n\nBut how to efficiently combine these choices.\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nWe can iterate through the number of weight 3 items taken. Let's say we take x items from weight 3. Then, the remaining weight capacity is m - 3x. Then, we need to maximize the sum of taking items from weight 1 and 2, given that their total weight is <= (m - 3x). However, even this approach may not be efficient enough if x can be up to m/3 (which for m=3e5 is 1e5). But since for each x, we need to compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items, which can be done with a two-pointer approach or preprocessed data.\n\nWait, but how do we find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items for a given remaining capacity?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a total capacity of W. We need to choose some number of weight 1 and 2 items. How to maximize the sum? Since the items are sorted, for each weight group, we can take as many as possible of the highest value items.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of combining two knapsacks (each with items of weight 1 and 2). But how to compute this quickly.\n\nAn alternative idea is to precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value achievable using only weight 1 and 2 items. Then, for each x (number of weight 3 items taken), we can compute the remaining capacity and look up the precomputed value for that capacity. But how to compute that precomputed value.\n\nBut how to compute the max value for weight 1 and 2 items. Let's think: since weight 1 items can be taken as many as possible, and weight 2 items can be taken as many as possible. But the optimal choice depends on which gives higher value per unit weight.\n\nWait, but for weight 1 and 2 items, since they are sorted in descending order, the optimal way is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. However, the problem is that for a given capacity W, you can take some combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nLet me think: suppose we have the prefix sums for weight 1 and weight 2. Let's say for weight 1, the prefix sum is s1, and for weight 2, it's s2. For a given capacity W, the best way is to take some number of weight 1 items (a) and some number of weight 2 items (b), such that a + 2b ≤ W. We need to find the maximum s1[a] + s2[b].\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly for any W?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a two-pointer approach. Let me think: For each possible b (number of weight 2 items), the maximum a is W - 2b. So for each b, we can take the maximum a as min( (W - 2b), len(s1) ), and then take the sum s1[a] + s2[b]. But trying all possible b for each W would be O(W) per query, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, since the prefix sums are sorted in non-decreasing order (since we take the highest value items first), we can find for each possible number of weight 2 items, the best possible number of weight 1 items.\n\nBut again, how to precompute this.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible total capacity W, we can find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items. Let me consider that for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum number of weight 1 items is W - 2*b. Since the weight 1 items are sorted, the maximum number of items is the minimum between the total possible (say, len1) and (W - 2b). So for each possible b (up to min(len2, W//2)), we can compute the sum s2[b] + s1[ min( len1, W - 2b ) ].\n\nBut for each W, trying all possible b is O(W) time, which is not feasible if W is up to 3e5.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for all possible W (from 0 to m) the maximum value for weight 1 and 2 items. How?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have the sorted lists for weight 1 and 2. For each possible number of weight 2 items (b), we can take up to (W - 2b) weight 1 items. But since W varies, perhaps we can precompute for all possible W, the best combination.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, we can find the best b (number of weight 2 items) that can be taken, and then take the corresponding a (number of weight 1 items) as W - 2b. But how?\n\nAnother idea: for each possible W, the maximum value is the maximum between taking some number of weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items. Let's consider that the optimal choice is to take as many as possible of the higher-value items. Since the weight 2 items are sorted, and the weight 1 items are sorted, perhaps for a given W, the optimal is to take some number of weight 2 items (say, up to W//2) and then fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find that quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute their prefix sums. Then for each possible W, we can iterate through all possible numbers of weight 2 items (say, up to min( len2, W//2 )) and for each, calculate how many weight 1 items can be taken. But again, this would be O(W) per W, which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can find for each possible W, the optimal number of weight 2 items to take. For example, considering that the weight 2 items are sorted, and the weight 1 items are sorted. For each W, the optimal number of weight 2 items is such that taking more weight 2 items (if they are high value) is better than taking weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items have higher value per unit weight (maybe?), but not necessarily. For example, if a weight 2 item has higher cost than two weight 1 items, then it's better to take that weight 2 item instead of two weight 1 items.\n\nSo the optimal selection is to take as many as possible of the highest value items, regardless of their weight. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can model this as taking the top k items (regardless of weight) and then considering their weights.\n\nBut that's not directly applicable here. Because the weight is fixed (either 1 or 2). So perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nWe can think of the combined list of weight 1 and 2 items as a list of items, each with their own weight and cost. Then the problem is to select items with total weight <= W, maximizing the cost. But with the constraint that the items are grouped into weight 1 and 2. However, this is the same as the original knapsack problem, but with only two types of items. However, for large W, this would be too slow.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to compute for all possible W the maximum value using weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each possible W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many weight 1 items as possible (i.e., W items) and no weight 2 items.\n\nOR\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible (i.e., W//2 items) and no weight 1 items.\n\nOR\n\n- Some combination of both.\n\nBut how to find that combination.\n\nBut given that the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, maybe we can find for each W the optimal number of weight 2 items to take, and then take the maximum possible weight 1 items.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each W, the maximum value is the maximum of s1[a] + s2[b], where a + 2b ≤ W. To find this, we can consider for each possible b (number of weight 2 items taken), the maximum a is W - 2b. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking as many as possible (up to the number of available items) gives the maximum sum.\n\nSo for each W, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible b (0 ≤ b ≤ min(len2, W//2)) of (s2[b] + s1[ min( W - 2b, len1 ) ] )\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all W.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, we can precompute this maximum. However, doing this for all W up to m would be O(m * len2), which is not feasible if m is 3e5 and len2 is 1e5.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative plan: Since the weight of items is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can handle each weight group separately and find a way to combine them.\n\nLet me think again. Let's process the three weight groups:\n\n- For weight 1: sort in descending order, compute prefix sums s1. Similarly for weight 2 (prefix s2) and weight 3 (prefix s3).\n\nThen, the problem becomes selecting x items from weight 3, y items from weight 2, z items from weight 1, such that 3x + 2y + z ≤ m, and the sum s3[x] + s2[y] + s1[z] is maximized.\n\nBut how to find x, y, z.\n\nBut since the weight of 3 is bigger, perhaps we can iterate over x (the number of weight 3 items taken), and for each x, compute the maximum possible sum of weight 1 and 2 items for the remaining capacity (m - 3x). Then take the maximum over all x.\n\nNow, the key is how to compute for a given capacity (let's call it rem = m - 3x) the maximum sum of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nIf we can compute this quickly for any rem, then the overall algorithm would be O(n log n) for sorting and O(m) for the rest.\n\nBut how to compute that for any rem.\n\nLet me think again about the weight 1 and 2 problem. Let's say we have rem capacity. How to compute the maximum sum of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think of this as a two-dimensional knapsack problem, but with only two types of items. But with the items sorted, perhaps we can find an efficient way.\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection can be found by considering for each possible number of weight 2 items (b), the maximum possible number of weight 1 items (a) that can be taken. Since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking as many as possible (up to rem - 2b) is optimal. So for each possible b (number of weight 2 items), the maximum a is min(rem - 2b, len1). Then, the total is s2[b] + s1[a]. The maximum over all possible b is the answer.\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly.\n\nThe number of possible b is up to min( len2, rem // 2 ). For each x (number of weight 3 items), rem can be up to m. So for each x, we would need to loop through all possible b, which would be O(len2) per x. If x can be up to m//3, which is 1e5, then this would be O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not going to work.\n\nSo we need a better way to compute the maximum value for the weight 1 and 2 items given a capacity rem.\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute for all possible numbers of weight 2 items, the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken for each possible capacity. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's another thought: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for a given capacity can be found by considering that the best combination is either:\n\n- Take as many weight 2 items as possible (up to rem//2) and fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nOR\n\n- Take as many weight 1 items as possible (up to rem) and fill the rest with weight 2 items.\n\nBut that's not necessarily correct. For example, maybe taking some combination of both gives a better result.\n\nBut perhaps we can find for each capacity rem, the optimal number of weight 2 items to take is around rem//2, and we can check a few possibilities around that.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can find the optimal number of weight 2 items to take by using a two-pointer approach.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for a given rem. Let's say we have the sorted lists for weight 1 and 2. Let's say we have len1 items of weight 1 and len2 items of weight 2.\n\nWe can start with taking 0 weight 2 items and as many weight 1 as possible. Then, we can try taking one more weight 2 item, and reduce the number of weight 1 items accordingly. But how to find the best balance.\n\nLet me think of the following: for the given rem, the maximum possible number of weight 2 items is b_max = min( len2, rem // 2 ). For each possible b in 0 to b_max, the corresponding a is min( len1, rem - 2*b ). The total cost is s2[b] + s1[a].\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this function over b in [0, b_max].\n\nNow, note that the function s2[b] + s1[ min( len1, rem - 2b ) ] is not necessarily unimodal, but perhaps for a fixed rem, we can find the optimal b quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since the s2 is increasing (because we take higher cost items first), and s1 is also increasing, the function may have a single peak. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a given rem, the optimal b is somewhere in the range [max(0, b_max - k), b_max], where k is a small number. For example, if we take the top 100 values of b around the possible maximum, then we can check those and find the best one.\n\nBut what is the value of k? Well, for example, if we take the top 300 values of b, then for each rem, we check 300 possibilities. That would be manageable, since for each x (number of weight 3 items), we check 300 possibilities.\n\nBut how to determine the value of k. Alternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, the best b is probably in the vicinity of the maximum possible, but maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, the optimal b is either the maximum possible (b_max) or the one where the next weight 2 item is better than two weight 1 items. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps for a given rem, the optimal b is either:\n\n- the maximum possible (b_max), or\n\n- the b that allows taking as many weight 1 items as possible (but that would be when b is 0), or\n\n- some value in between where the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item is better than two weight 1 items.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose rem is 5, and we have:\n\nweight 1 items: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\nweight 2 items: [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]\n\nSo for rem=5, the possible b ranges from 0 to 2 (since 5//2 = 2).\n\nFor b=0: a=5 → sum is 5+4+3+2+1=15.\n\nFor b=1: 2*1=2. rem-2=3 → a=3 → sum is 9 + (5+4+3) = 9+12=21.\n\nFor b=2: 2*2=4 → rem-4=1 → a=1 → sum is 8+6 + 5 = 19. So the best is b=1.\n\nIn this case, the optimal is somewhere in the middle.\n\nSo how to find this quickly?\n\nAnother approach: For each possible rem, the optimal number of weight 2 items is the maximum between 0 and (some value) that balances the value of taking a weight 2 item versus two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken for any rem. But I don't see a way to do that.\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, we can compute the maximum between taking all possible weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1, and taking all possible weight 1 items and filling the rest with weight 2. But this is not sufficient as shown in the previous example.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate that the optimal is either taking as many weight 2 items as possible, or as many weight 1 items as possible, or some number of weight 2 items close to the maximum possible. So for each rem, we can check a few possibilities around the maximum possible b.\n\nFor example, for each rem, we can check all b in the range [max(0, b_max - 300), b_max], and take the maximum among these. Since the number of weight 2 items is up to len2, which is O(n), but for each x (number of weight 3 items), we can check a fixed number of possibilities (like 300), then the total time would be acceptable.\n\nBut what is the value of 300? Well, considering that for each x, the rem can be up to m, and for each x, checking 300 possibilities, the total time would be O( (m/3) * 300 ) = 3e5 /3 * 300 = 1e5 * 300 = 3e7 operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut how to choose the number of possibilities to check. Maybe 300 is arbitrary, but in practice, for the given constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nBut why would this work? Because the optimal b is likely to be near the maximum possible, or near the point where adding another weight 2 item would require reducing the number of weight 1 items by two. So by checking a few possibilities around the maximum possible b, we can find the optimal.\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, we can check all possible b in the range [0, min(b_max, len2)], but only up to a certain number. But how to ensure that this covers the optimal value.\n\nBut given that the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, and the weight 1 items are also sorted in descending order, perhaps the optimal b is not too far from the maximum possible.\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose rem is 100, and we have 100 weight 1 items each with value 1, and 50 weight 2 items each with value 1. Then, the optimal is to take all weight 2 items (50 items, value 50) and then 0 weight 1 items. Or take 100 weight 1 items (value 100). So in this case, the optimal is to take all weight 1 items. So for this case, checking the maximum possible b (50) would give a lower value than checking b=0. Thus, our approach of checking only around the maximum possible b would miss this case.\n\nSo that approach is flawed.\n\nHmm, this suggests that checking only around the maximum possible b is not sufficient. What's another way?\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value. How?\n\nLet me think of this as a dynamic programming problem. Let's define dp[w] as the maximum value achievable with capacity w using only weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut since the weight is up to 3e5, and m is up to 3e5, this would be feasible if we can compute it efficiently.\n\nBut how to compute dp[w]?\n\nFor each weight 1 and 2 items, we can process them in a way similar to the knapsack problem.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, perhaps we can optimize this.\n\nWait, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted in descending order, taking as many as possible is optimal. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nBut how to combine them.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For the weight 1 items, we can take up to k items, where k is the number of items available. So the maximum for weight 1 is s1[k], and the weight is k * 1. Similarly for weight 2, taking up to l items, weight is 2*l, cost s2[l].\n\nSo for each possible capacity w, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible combinations of a and b where a + 2b ≤ w.\n\nBut how to compute this for all w up to m.\n\nBut for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible w, the maximum value.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can precompute for all possible a (number of weight 1 items taken) and b (number of weight 2 items taken), and then for each possible total weight w = a + 2b, keep track of the maximum value. But this would be O(len1 * len2) which is up to (1e5)^2 = 1e10, which is way too big.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (b), we can compute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken for each possible w. For example, for a fixed b, the weight used is 2b. The remaining capacity is w - 2b, so the maximum number of weight 1 items is min(w - 2b, len1). The value is s2[b] + s1[ min(w - 2b, len1) ].\n\nSo for each possible w, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible b (number of weight 2 items taken) of this value.\n\nBut how to compute this for all w up to m.\n\nThis seems like a convolution-like problem. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible b, we can iterate over all possible w ≥ 2b, and update dp[w] = max(dp[w], s2[b] + s1[ min(w - 2b, len1) ]). But this would be O(len2 * m), which is again 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for capacity w is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking all possible weight 1 items (a = min(w, len1)), and then nothing else.\n\nOR\n\n- Taking some number of weight 2 items, and then filling the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut again, how to compute this.\n\nLet me think: For a given capacity w, the maximum number of weight 2 items is b_max = min(len2, w // 2). For each b in 0 to b_max, the corresponding a is min(w - 2b, len1). So the total value is s2[b] + s1[a].\n\nBut to find the maximum of this over all b.\n\nBut for a given w, the maximum value can be found by iterating all possible b in 0 to b_max. However, for large w and large len2, this would be too slow.\n\nBut what if we precompute for each possible b, the value of s2[b] + s1[ min(w - 2b, len1) ] for all w >= 2b?\n\nNo, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the weight 1 items are sorted, and their prefix sums are non-decreasing, for a fixed b, the contribution s1[ min(w - 2b, len1) ] increases as w increases. So for a fixed b, the contribution increases with w.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nMaybe for each possible w, the optimal b is the one that maximizes s2[b] + s1[ ... ].\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nLet me think back to the original problem. Since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can handle the weight 3 items in a similar way to the others.\n\nLet me think of the following plan:\n\nFor each of the three weight groups, sort them in descending order of cost, and compute their prefix sums.\n\nThen, for the weight 3 items, we can iterate through all possible x (number of items taken). For each x, the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3x. If rem < 0, skip.\n\nThen, for this rem, we need to find the maximum value of combining weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding for each rem, the maximum value of combining weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can precompute for all possible rem the maximum value of combining weight 1 and 2 items. How?\n\nLet me think of it as follows: for all possible rem, we can precompute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items. This can be done by iterating through all possible b (number of weight 2 items) and for each, compute the maximum possible a (number of weight 1 items) for all possible rem >= 2b.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but what if we precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken for any rem. But I don't see how.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's precompute for the weight 1 and 2 items, for each possible number of weight 2 items (b), the maximum possible weight 1 items that can be taken for any capacity. Then, for a given rem, we can iterate over all possible b up to min(b_max, len2), and for each, calculate the value.\n\nBut again, for each x, this is O(len2) time, which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but what if the number of weight 2 items is small? For example, if the number of weight 2 items is small, then for each x, it's manageable. But in the worst case, len2 can be up to 1e5.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize for the cases where the weight 2 items are numerous.\n\nLet me think of the following: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for a given rem can be computed as the maximum between:\n\n- The maximum value for weight 1 items only (take as many as possible).\n\n- The maximum value for weight 2 items only (take as many as possible).\n\n- The maximum value for taking some combination of both.\n\nBut how to find this combination.\n\nWait, for the combination of both, it's possible that taking some weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items is better than taking all of one type.\n\nBut how to find this quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following: For a given rem, the optimal number of weight 2 items to take is the one that maximizes s2[b] + s1[ min(rem - 2b, len1) ].\n\nBut since s2 is non-decreasing and s1 is non-decreasing, this function might have a single maximum point, and we can perform a binary search to find it.\n\nBut how to determine whether the function is unimodal.\n\nAssume that the function increases to a certain point and then decreases. If this is true, then we can perform ternary search to find the maximum.\n\nLet me think of an example where this is true.\n\nSuppose rem is 10, and we have:\n\ns2[b] = [0, 10, 19, 27, 34, ...] (each additional b adds a new item of weight 2 with cost 10, 9, 8, 7, etc.)\n\ns1[a] = [0, 5, 9, 12, 14, ...] (each additional a adds a new item of weight 1 with cost 5, 4, 3, 2, etc.)\n\nFor b=0: a=10 → sum is 0 + s1[10] = 14 (assuming len1 is at least 10).\n\nFor b=1: a=10-2=8 → sum is 10 + s1[8] = 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nFor b=2: a=10-4=6 → sum is 19 + s1[6] = 19 + 9 (assuming s1[6] is 9) → 28?\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of a simpler example.\n\nLet's say weight 1 items are [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and weight 2 items are [10, 9, 8, 7, 6].\n\nFor rem=5, the possible b is 0, 1, 2.\n\nFor b=0: a=5 → sum 15.\n\nFor b=1: a=3 → sum 9 + (5+4+3) = 21.\n\nFor b=2: a=1 → sum 8+6 +5 = 19.\n\nSo the function increases from b=0 to b=1, then decreases from b=1 to b=2. So the maximum is at b=1.\n\nAnother example: rem=6.\n\nPossible b=0: a=6 → sum 5+4+3+2+1+0 (wait, no, the s1 is prefix sum. Let's say len1 is 5 items. Then for a=5, sum is 15. For a=6, it's still 15 since we can't take more than 5 items. So for rem=6, b=0: a=6 → min(6,5)=5 → sum 15.\n\nb=1: 2*1=2 → rem-2=4 → a=4 → sum 9 + (5+4+3+2) = 9+14=23.\n\nb=2: 2*2=4 → rem-4=2 → a=2 → sum 8+6 + (5+4) = 14 +9 = 23.\n\nb=3: 2*3=6 → rem-6=0 → a=0 → sum 7+6+8+...? Wait, wait, the s2[b] is the sum of the first b items of weight 2. So for b=3, it's 10+9+8=27. And a=0 → sum is 27 + 0 = 27. Which is higher than the previous values.\n\nSo in this case, the function increases from b=0 to b=3, and the maximum is at b=3.\n\nSo the function is not unimodal. It increases, then increases further. So binary search or ternary search might not work.\n\nThis makes it difficult to find a general approach.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me think of other approaches.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), maybe we can use a greedy approach. For example, for each weight group, take the items with the highest value per unit weight.\n\nBut this is not always optimal. For example, if there is a weight 2 item with value 3, and two weight 1 items with value 1.5 each, then the value per unit weight is the same. But taking the weight 2 item is better, as it takes less space. But if there is a weight 2 item with value 3, and two weight 1 items with value 2 each, then taking the two weight 1 items gives a higher total value (4 vs 3).\n\nSo the greedy approach based on value per unit weight might not work.\n\nBut perhaps we can combine the items in a way that for each weight group, we take the items in a certain order.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the following: since the weight of items is small, for each weight group, we can take as many as possible of the highest value items, and then proceed to the next group.\n\nBut how to combine this.\n\nLet me try to think of the following approach:\n\nSort all items in descending order of value per unit weight. For items with the same value per unit weight, prioritize those with smaller weight. Then, take items in this order until the capacity is filled.\n\nBut again, this is not guaranteed to be optimal. But perhaps it's a heuristic that works for this particular problem.\n\nHowever, since this is a competitive programming problem, and the test cases may be designed to pass such an approach, but I'm not sure. Also, it's not clear how to implement this for the given constraints.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me go back to the initial idea of iterating over x (number of weight 3 items taken), and for each x, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for the remaining capacity.\n\nBut to make this feasible, I need to find a way to compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for a given capacity quickly.\n\nHere's an alternative idea: for each possible capacity rem, the best combination is to take as many as possible of the highest value items, regardless of their weight. But how to do this.\n\nWait, the items are already sorted within their weight groups. So for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can create a merged list of all items, sorted by their value per unit weight, and then take the top items. But this is not possible because we have to respect the weight constraints.\n\nBut if we can merge the weight 1 and 2 items into a single list sorted by value per unit weight, then for a given capacity, we can take as many as possible from this list, ensuring that the total weight doesn't exceed the capacity.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nLet me think. For example, for weight 1 items, the value per unit weight is c_i / 1 = c_i. For weight 2 items, it's c_i / 2. So we can compare these values and take the items with higher value per unit weight first.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach. Let's say we create a combined list of all weight 1 and 2 items, sorted in descending order of value per unit weight. Then, for a given capacity, we take items from this list until the",
