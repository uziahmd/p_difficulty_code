They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about restoring the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the given GCD and LCM values on the edges. Each edge connects two lawns (vertices), and for each edge, we have the GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts of those two vertices. Our task is to determine if there's a valid assignment of numbers to each vertex that satisfies all the given edges, and if so, output one such assignment.\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. For each edge between u and v, the GCD and LCM must satisfy certain properties. For example, the GCD must divide the LCM. Because the LCM of two numbers is always a multiple of their GCD. Wait, yes. Because LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So, for any two numbers, LCM(a,b) must be divisible by GCD(a,b). Therefore, if the input gives a pair where LCM is not divisible by GCD, then it's impossible. But according to the problem statement, the original numbers were valid, but after tearing, the given roads might have invalid data? Wait, no. The problem says that the original map had numbers that were valid, but when Pasha has some part of it, maybe the given data could be inconsistent. So in our solution, we need to check that for each edge, the given GCD and LCM are compatible. For example, if the given GCD is g and LCM is l, then l must be a multiple of g. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the original numbers were valid. However, the input here is the roads that Pasha has. So, the input may have invalid data. For example, if someone provided a road with GCD=2 and LCM=3, which is impossible because LCM must be a multiple of GCD. So, our first step is to check that for each edge, the LCM is a multiple of the GCD. If any of them isn't, we can immediately output NO.\n\nSo first, for each edge, check if LCM % GCD != 0. If yes, return NO.\n\nBut that's just one check. Then, we need to assign values to each node such that for each edge (u, v) with GCD g and LCM l, the GCD of the node values is g, and their LCM is l.\n\nNow, how to model this. Let's think about the relationship between a and b. Let's say for two numbers a and b, their GCD is g, and their LCM is l. Then, we know that a = g * x, b = g * y, where x and y are coprime (since any common divisor would be part of the GCD). Also, the LCM of a and b is g * x * y. So, l = g * x * y. Therefore, x * y = l / g. Since x and y are coprime, then x and y must be divisors of l/g, and their product is exactly l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime, they must be factors of l/g that are coprime.\n\nBut for the problem, given that for an edge between u and v, the GCD is g and LCM is l, we can model that the values of u and v must be multiples of g, and their product divided by g must be l. So, the product of u and v is g * l. Because LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a*b. So, that's a key formula.\n\nSo, for each edge between u and v, we have that:\n\na_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nBut also, GCD(a_u, a_v) = g. Which implies that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where GCD(x, y) = 1, and x*y = l/g. So, that's the same as before.\n\nBut how do we model this for the entire graph?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to assign variables to nodes, such that for each edge, the product of the two nodes equals g*l, and their GCD is g. But how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each edge, the two nodes must be multiples of g. So, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node has a value that is a multiple of some factors. But how to find such values.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a graph where each edge imposes a relation between two nodes. Let me think of it as a system of equations. However, since the values are integers, and the relations are multiplicative, perhaps we can model this using a union-find structure with some",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the given GCD and LCM values on the edges of a graph. If possible, we should output one valid configuration; otherwise, we should report that it's impossible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Validity of Input**: For each edge, ensure that the LCM is a multiple of the GCD. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n2. **Graph Representation**: Use a graph where each node represents a lawn and each edge represents a connection between two lawns with given GCD and LCM values.\n3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use a union-find (disjoint set union) structure to manage connected components and ensure consistency in assignments.\n4. **Assign Values Using BFS/DFS**: Traverse the graph using BFS or DFS to assign values to nodes while respecting the constraints imposed by the GCD and LCM values on the edges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx]) -
