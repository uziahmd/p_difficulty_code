He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the given prefixes and suffixes. And our job is to assign P or S to each input string such that there exists some s that matches.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the correct assignments. Let's think about the possible approach.\n\nLet me think: For a string s of length n, all its prefixes of length 1 to n-1 and all suffixes of length 1 to n-1 are given. But we don't know which is which. However, the original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1, and similarly for suffixes. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input has exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. Because for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there's exactly one prefix and one suffix. So for each l, there are two strings of length l in the input. But the problem says that the input is given in arbitrary order, and we have to assign which is prefix and which is suffix.\n\nBut how can we find the correct assignment?\n\nThe key idea here is that the original string s must have a certain structure. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap in a way that allows them to form the original string. Also, the original string's full length is n, so for example, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must share a common part. So their concatenation would have overlapping parts. \n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find which two strings of length n-1 are present. Then, the original string s must be such that one of them is the prefix (so the original string is that string plus one character), and the other is the suffix (so the original string is that string with one character prepended). But how do we find which one is which?\n\nWait, but the original string s is of length n. Let's say that the two strings of length n-1 are A and B. Then, if A is the prefix, then s is A + c (for some character c). But then B must be the suffix of s. Since the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n], which is the original string without the first character. So B must be equal to s[1...n], which is A[1...n-1] + c. Therefore, B must be equal to A[1...n-1] + c. But since A is of length n-1, then A[1...n-1] is A[1:] (assuming 0-based index). So B must be A[1:] + c. But since s is A + c, then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:] = A[1:] + c. Therefore, B must be equal to that. So B is A[1:] + c. But since A is the prefix, and B is the suffix, then B must be A[1:] + c. But also, the original string s is A + c. So the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:] which is A[1:] + c. Therefore, B must be equal to that. Which implies that B's first n-2 characters are A[1...n-2], and the last character is c. But since B is of length n-1, then B's first n-2 characters must be A[1...n-2], and the last character is the same as the last character of s (which is c). \n\nAlternatively, if B is the suffix, then s is B's prefix plus some character. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's think of an example. Take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n5\nba\na\nabab\na\naba\nbaba\nab\naba\n\nThe output is SPPSPSPS. The correct string is ababa. Let's see the prefixes and suffixes of ababa:\n\nPrefixes of lengths 1-4:\na, ab, aba, abab\nSuffixes of lengths 1-4:\na, ba, aba, baba\n\nWait, the input has the strings: ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba. Let's list all the input strings for the first case. The input has 2*5-2=8 strings. The lengths are 1, 2, 3, 4. For each length, two strings. Let's see:\n\nLength 1: 'ba'? No. Wait, the first input line is 5, then the next lines are the strings. Let me recheck:\n\nIn the first example, the input is:\n\n5\nba\na\nabab\na\naba\nbaba\nab\naba\n\nSo the strings are:\n\nLength 1: \"ba\" (no, wait, \"ba\" has length 2. Oh, sorry. Let me check each string's length:\n\nLooking at the first example's input:\n\nThe strings are:\n\n\"ba\" (length 2)\n\"a\" (length 1)\n\"abab\" (length 4)\n\"a\" (length 1)\n\"aba\" (length 3)\n\"baba\" (length 4)\n\"ab\" (length 2)\n\"aba\" (length 3)\n\nSo for n=5, the lengths of the input strings are from 1 to 4. For each length l (1-4), there are exactly two strings. For example, length 1: two \"a\" strings? Wait, no. The input has two strings of length 1: \"a\" and \"a\". So two \"a\"s. That's allowed. \n\nSo for the first example, the correct string is ababa. Its prefixes of lengths 1-4 are:\n\n1: a\n2: ab\n3: aba\n4: abab\n\nIts suffixes of lengths 1-4 are:\n\n1: a\n2: ba\n3: aba\n4: baba\n\nSo the input strings include all these prefixes and suffixes. Now, the problem is to assign which are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nNow, the approach. How can we find the correct assignments?\n\nAn important observation is that the original string s must have a unique prefix of length n-1 and a unique suffix of length n-1. These two strings must be such that the suffix is the prefix of length n-1 shifted by one character. For example, in the first sample, the prefix of length 4 is abab, and the suffix of length 4 is baba. Let's see: the suffix is the original string s[1..4], which is 'baba' (since s is ababa). The prefix of length 4 is abab. So the suffix is the prefix shifted by one character. So the first character of the prefix is a, and the suffix starts with b. So the two strings of length n-1 must be such that one is the other shifted by one character. \n\nWait, but how? Let's think: suppose the original string is s. The prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So the suffix is s[1..n-1], which is the prefix of length n-1 (s[0..n-2]) with the first character removed and the last character added. Wait, no. The suffix is s[1..n-1], which is the original string minus the first character. So, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So, the suffix is equal to the prefix of length n-1 with the first character removed and then adding the last character of the original string. \n\nBut the original string's last character is the same as the last character of the suffix of length n-1. \n\nSo, given that, for the two strings of length n-1, one must be the prefix, and the other must be the suffix. Let's call them A and B. Then, if A is the prefix, then the original string is A + c, where c is the last character. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1] = A[1..n-2] + c. So B must be equal to A[1..n-2] + c. But since B is of length n-1, which is the same as A's length. So, B must be A[1:] + c. But since A is of length n-1, A[1:] is length n-2, and adding c makes it length n-1. \n\nBut how can we find c? Well, c is the last character of the original string. Also, B is the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1], which is the original string's suffix. So, B must be equal to A[1:] + c. Also, the original string is A + c. So, B must be (A[1:]) + c. \n\nBut since B is one of the two strings of length n-1, then for the two candidates (say, A and B), we can check if B is equal to A[1:] + (last character of B). Wait, no. Wait, because B is the suffix. Let me think again. If A is the prefix of length n-1, then the original string is A + c. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is (A + c)[1:] = A[1:] + c. Therefore, B must be equal to A[1:] + c. But since B is a string of length n-1, and A is of length n-1, A[1:] is length n-2. So the last character of B is c. Therefore, B's last character is c. Also, the first n-2 characters of B must be A[1:].\n\nSo, given that, if we take the two strings of length n-1, let's call them X and Y. Then, one of them is the prefix (say X) and the other is the suffix (Y). Then, Y must be X[1:] + last_char_of_Y. But since Y's last character is c, which is also the last character of the original string. Also, the original string is X + c. So, the original string's last character is c, which is the same as Y's last character. \n\nAlternatively, if Y is the prefix and X is the suffix, then X must be Y[1:] + last_char_of_X. \n\nSo, for the two strings of length n-1, we can check if either of them can be the prefix and the other the suffix. \n\nOnce we find which pair is correct, then we can determine the original string. Once we have the original string, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s. \n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them L1 and L2.\n\n2. Check whether L1 can be a prefix and L2 a suffix, or vice versa. \n\nFor example, check if L2 equals L1[1:] + last_char_of_L2. \n\nIf that's true, then the original string is L1 + last_char_of_L2. \n\nSimilarly, check if L1 equals L2[1:] + last_char_of_L1. \n\nIf either of these conditions is true, then we can find the original string. \n\nOnce the original string is determined, then for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix or suffix of s, and assign P or S accordingly. \n\nBut what if there are multiple possibilities? For example, in the third sample input, the input is:\n\n2\na\nc\n\nSo n=2, the original string can be \"ac\" or \"ca\". For each case, the prefixes and suffixes are:\n\nFor \"ac\": prefixes of length 1 is \"a\", suffix of length 1 is \"c\".\n\nFor \"ca\": prefixes of length 1 is \"c\", suffix of length 1 is \"a\".\n\nBut the input is two strings: \"a\" and \"c\". So in this case, the answer can be PS or SP. \n\nSo, how do we handle such cases? Well, the problem allows any valid assignment, as long as there exists at least one possible s. So, in such cases, we can choose either possibility. \n\nBut for the general case, the approach would be to find the original string s, then for each input string, check if it's a prefix or a suffix of s. \n\nBut how to find s? Well, once we find the correct pair of L1 and L2 (the two strings of length n-1), we can determine s. \n\nSo the first step is to find the two strings of length n-1. Then, check which of the two possibilities (L1 as prefix, L2 as suffix, or vice versa) gives a valid s. \n\nOnce we have s, we can proceed. \n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nFor the given input:\n\n- Collect all the input strings.\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n- For each possible pairing (candidate1 as prefix, candidate2 as suffix; and vice versa):\n\n   - Check if the suffix condition holds. For example, if candidate1 is the prefix, then the original string would be candidate1 + last_char_of_suffix_candidate. But the suffix candidate (candidate2) should be equal to candidate1[1:] + last_char_of_suffix_candidate. \n\n   - Wait, the suffix candidate is candidate2. So candidate2 must be equal to candidate1[1:] + (last character of s). But s is candidate1 + (last character of s). But the last character of s is the same as the last character of candidate2. Because candidate2 is the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1], so the last character of candidate2 is the same as the last character of s. \n\n   So, for candidate1 being prefix and candidate2 being suffix, then:\n\n   candidate2 must be equal to candidate1[1:] + (candidate2[-1])\n\n   Because candidate1 is of length n-1, candidate1[1:] is length n-2, and adding the last character of candidate2 (which is the last character of s) gives length n-1, which is the length of candidate2. \n\n   So, for this to be true, candidate2 must equal candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1]. \n\n   Let's see. For example, in the first sample:\n\n   candidate1 is abab (length 4, n=5, n-1=4). candidate2 is baba. \n\n   candidate1[1:] is bab. Adding the last character of candidate2 (a) gives 'baba', which is candidate2. So this condition holds. \n\n   So the original string would be candidate1 + last character of candidate2. Which is abab + a → ababa. Which is correct. \n\n   Similarly, if we check the other way around: candidate2 as prefix and candidate1 as suffix. Then candidate1 must be equal to candidate2[1:] + last character of candidate1. \n\n   candidate2 is baba. candidate2[1:] is aba. last character of candidate1 is 'b'. So aba + b = abab, which is candidate1. So that also holds. \n\n   Wait, but then both possibilities would be valid? But in the first sample, the original string is ababa. So if we take candidate2 as the prefix (baba) and candidate1 as the suffix (abab), then the original string would be baba + last character of candidate1 (which is 'b') → baba + b = babab. But then, the suffix of length 4 would be the original string's suffix of length 4, which is 'abab', which is candidate1. Let's check if that's correct. \n\n   Original string is babab (length 5). Its prefixes of length 4 is 'baba', which is candidate2. Its suffix of length 4 is 'abab', which is candidate1. So that would also be a valid scenario. But according to the note, the only possible string is ababa. So why is this not considered? \n\n   Oh, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e., that there exists at least one string s. However, in this case, there might be two possible s. But the problem says that Ivan will accept any answer that is consistent with at least one possible s. \n\n   So, in the first sample, there are two possible s: ababa and babab. However, according to the note, the only possible string is ababa. Why? \n\n   Wait, perhaps the input given in the first sample includes other prefixes and suffixes which may not be compatible with babab. Let me check. \n\n   The input strings for the first sample are:\n\n   ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba. \n\n   Let's see if babab would generate all these strings. \n\n   For babab (length 5):\n\n   Prefixes of lengths 1-4:\n\n   1: 'b'\n\n   2: 'ba'\n\n   3: 'bab'\n\n   4: 'baba'\n\n   Suffixes of lengths 1-4:\n\n   1: 'b'\n\n   2: 'ab'\n\n   3: 'bab'\n\n   4: 'abab'\n\n   Now, looking at the input strings. The input strings include 'ba' (length 2), 'a' (length 1), 'abab' (length 4), 'a' (length 1), 'aba' (length 3), 'baba' (length 4), 'ab' (length 2), 'aba' (length 3). \n\n   In this case, the input strings would need to contain all the prefixes and suffixes of babab. But the prefixes of length 1 for babab are 'b', but the input has two 'a's. So in this case, the input does not have 'b' as a prefix. Therefore, the original string cannot be babab. Hence, the only possible s is ababa. \n\n   Ah, so the initial approach of checking the two candidates of length n-1 is correct, but in addition, we need to make sure that the rest of the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of the generated s. \n\n   Therefore, the steps would be:\n\n   1. Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them L1 and L2.\n\n   2. For each possible way to assign them as prefix and suffix (two possibilities):\n\n      a. Generate the candidate s.\n\n      b. Check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s. \n\n      c. If yes, then proceed to assign P/S accordingly.\n\n   However, this approach may not be feasible for larger n because generating all possibilities could be time-consuming. But given that n is up to 100, and the number of possibilities is small (only two possibilities for the two candidates of length n-1), it's manageable. \n\n   So the plan is:\n\n   - For the given input, collect all the strings. \n\n   - Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them L1 and L2. \n\n   - For each of the two possibilities (L1 is prefix, L2 is suffix; or L2 is prefix, L1 is suffix):\n\n      - Check if the suffix condition holds. \n\n         For example, if L1 is prefix, then the suffix (L2) must be equal to L1[1:] + last_char_of_L2. \n\n         Because the original string s is L1 + last_char_of_L2. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:] = L1[1:] + last_char_of_L2. Which is L2. \n\n         So the condition is: L2 == L1[1:] + L2[-1]. \n\n         Similarly for the other case. \n\n      - If the condition holds, then generate s_candidate as L1 + L2[-1], or L2 + L1[-1], depending on which case. \n\n      - Then, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate. \n\n      - If this is true, then proceed to assign P/S for each input string. \n\n   Once we find such a candidate s_candidate, we can proceed. \n\n   However, there could be multiple candidates. For example, in the third sample, there are two possible s_candidates (ac and ca). But in that case, the input strings are \"a\" and \"c\". For ac, the prefixes are \"a\", and the suffixes are \"c\". For ca, the prefixes are \"c\" and the suffixes are \"a\". \n\n   So, how do we choose between them? Well, the problem allows any valid assignment, so we can choose any of the possibilities. \n\n   Now, the challenge is to implement this logic. \n\n   Let's outline the steps again:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and the list of input strings. \n\n   Step 2: Find the two strings of length n-1. \n\n   Step 3: For each possible pairing between these two strings as prefix and suffix, check if the condition holds (i.e., the suffix is formed by the prefix's substring plus the last character). \n\n   Step 4: For each valid candidate s_candidate, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate. \n\n   Step 5: Once a valid s_candidate is found, assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. \n\n   Now, how to implement this? \n\n   Let's think about code structure. \n\n   First, for the input strings, we need to process them. Let's read them into a list. \n\n   Then, find all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them. \n\n   Then, for each of the two possibilities (L1 as prefix, L2 as suffix and vice versa), check if the condition holds. \n\n   Let's code this. \n\n   For example, for the first possibility:\n\n   candidate_prefix = L1\n\n   candidate_suffix = L2\n\n   Check if L2 == L1[1:] + L2[-1]\n\n   If yes, then generate s_candidate = L1 + L2[-1]\n\n   Then, check if all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. \n\n   How to check that? For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with the string) or a suffix (ends with the string). \n\n   However, since there are exactly two strings of each length (from 1 to n-1), and for the correct s_candidate, each of these strings must be either a prefix or a suffix. \n\n   So for each input string, it must be a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. \n\n   Once that is confirmed, we can proceed to assign P/S. \n\n   Now, the problem is that there might be multiple s_candidate possibilities. For example, if both possibilities (L1 as prefix and L2 as suffix, and vice versa) generate valid s_candidate. How to choose between them? \n\n   Well, the problem allows any valid assignment. So, we can pick the first valid one we find. \n\n   Now, let's think about the code. \n\n   Let's code the following steps:\n\n   Read n.\n\n   Read 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called 'strings'.\n\n   Find the two strings of length n-1. \n\n   For example:\n\n   candidates_n_minus_1 = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\n   Now, these are two strings. Let's call them l1 and l2. \n\n   Then, for each possible pairing (l1 as prefix, l2 as suffix) and (l2 as prefix, l1 as suffix):\n\n      check if the condition holds. \n\n      For example, for the first case:\n\n      if l2 == l1[1:] + l2[-1]:\n\n          then s_candidate = l1 + l2[-1]\n\n          check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of s_candidate. \n\n          if yes, proceed. \n\n      else check the other case. \n\n   Once a valid s_candidate is found, proceed to assign P/S. \n\n   Now, how to check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate?\n\n   For each string in the input list, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (s_candidate starts with it) or a suffix (ends with it). \n\n   However, since there are exactly two strings of each length (from 1 to n-1), and for the correct s_candidate, each of these must be either a prefix or suffix. \n\n   So, for example, for the correct s_candidate, for each length l in 1..n-1, there are exactly two strings. One of them is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. \n\n   So, during the check, for each string in the input list, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. \n\n   Once that is confirmed, then the code can proceed to assign P/S. \n\n   Now, once we have s_candidate, how to assign P/S for each input string? \n\n   For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. \n\n   However, there's a problem here. Suppose a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if s_candidate is 'aaa', then the string 'a' is both a prefix and suffix. But in that case, the input has two strings of length 1, which are both 'a's. So, for each of those two strings, they can be assigned as P or S. \n\n   However, the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment. So, in such cases, we can assign P or S as needed, but we have to make sure that for each length l, exactly one is assigned as prefix and the other as suffix. \n\n   Wait, no. For each length l, there are two strings. Exactly one of them is a prefix (since the original string has exactly one prefix of length l), and exactly one is a suffix. So, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. \n\n   So, for example, for the input strings of length l, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. \n\n   Therefore, when checking for each input string, if it is a prefix or suffix, but there's ambiguity, we need to make sure that for each length l, exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S. \n\n   However, when we have s_candidate, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix. So, for example, for a given input string, it can be both, but in that case, it's allowed. But the problem requires that the total number of P and S is equal. \n\n   Wait, the problem says that the output must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's, since there are 2n-2 strings. \n\n   So, for the code, once we have s_candidate, we can process each input string and check whether it is a prefix or a suffix. However, in cases where a string is both, we can assign it as P or S. \n\n   However, the problem requires that the assignment is such that there exists at least one possible s. So, once we have s_candidate, the assignment is straightforward: for each input string, if it is a prefix of s_candidate, assign P, else assign S. \n\n   However, there's a problem here. For example, suppose a string is both a prefix and a suffix. Then, in the code, it would be marked as P (if we check first for prefix). But in reality, the actual assignment depends on which one is the prefix and which is the suffix. \n\n   However, since the code is based on the correct s_candidate, which has exactly one prefix and one suffix for each length, then for each input string of length l, exactly one of the two strings is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So, for example, for a given l, the two input strings are the prefix and the suffix. \n\n   Therefore, for each input string, when checking against s_candidate, exactly one of them will be a prefix and the other a suffix. \n\n   Therefore, when processing the input strings, for each string, if it is a prefix of s_candidate, then it must be assigned P, and if it is a suffix, then S. \n\n   However, there's a case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second sample input, the correct string is 'aaa'. For length 1, the two input strings are 'a' and 'a'. Both are prefixes and suffixes. So, for the output, each can be assigned as P or S. But the code needs to assign exactly one P and one S for each length. \n\n   So, how to handle that? \n\n   For example, in the second sample input:\n\n   Input is:\n\n   3\n\n   a\n\n   aa\n\n   aa\n\n   a\n\n   So the input strings are:\n\n   For n=3, the input has 4 strings. The two strings of length 1 are 'a' and 'a'; two of length 2 are 'aa' and 'aa'. \n\n   The correct s_candidate is 'aaa'. \n\n   The prefixes are:\n\n   length 1: 'a'\n\n   length 2: 'aa'\n\n   suffixes are:\n\n   length 1: 'a'\n\n   length 2: 'aa'\n\n   So, for the two 'a's of length 1, one is a prefix, the other is a suffix. Similarly for the two 'aa's of length 2. \n\n   So, when processing the input strings, the code needs to assign one of the 'a's as P and the other as S, and same for the 'aa's. \n\n   However, when checking for each input string, if it is a prefix of s_candidate (which it is for all of them), then the code would assign P to all of them, which is wrong. \n\n   Therefore, the approach of assigning P if it's a prefix and S otherwise is incorrect. \n\n   Oh no! This is a problem. So, how can we resolve this?\n\n   The problem is that the code needs to assign exactly one P and one S for each length. So, for each length l, among the two input strings of that length, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. \n\n   However, for a given s_candidate, each of the two input strings of length l may be a prefix or a suffix. \n\n   For example, for the 'a's in the second sample, both are prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, for each of the two strings, they can be assigned as either P or S, but we must assign exactly one P and one S. \n\n   Therefore, the code needs to assign for each length l, one of the two strings as P and the other as S. \n\n   But how to do that? \n\n   The approach of checking for each string whether it is a prefix or suffix is not sufficient, because for some strings, they are both. \n\n   Therefore, we need to find for each length l, which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. \n\n   How can we do that? \n\n   Well, for the correct s_candidate, the prefix of length l is s_candidate[:l], and the suffix is s_candidate[-l:]. \n\n   So, for each length l, there are exactly two input strings. One of them must be equal to the prefix of length l, and the other must be equal to the suffix of length l. \n\n   Therefore, for each length l, we can check which of the two input strings is the prefix, and which is the suffix. \n\n   Therefore, for the code, once we have s_candidate, we can:\n\n   For each length l in 1..n-1:\n\n      get the two input strings of length l. Let's call them str1 and str2. \n\n      check if str1 equals the prefix of length l of s_candidate. \n\n      if yes, then assign P to str1 and S to str2. \n\n      else, assign S to str1 and P to str2. \n\n   However, there's a problem here. What if both str1 and str2 are equal to the prefix of length l? That can't happen because the input is guaranteed to be valid. \n\n   Wait, the input is guaranteed to be prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So, for each length l, there are exactly two strings: one is the prefix and one is the suffix. Therefore, for the correct s_candidate, exactly one of the two strings of length l is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. \n\n   Therefore, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings of length l is equal to the prefix of length l of s_candidate, and the other is equal to the suffix. \n\n   Therefore, for each length l, we can find which of the two input strings is the prefix, and which is the suffix. \n\n   Therefore, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n   Once we have s_candidate, for each input string, we can group them by their length. \n\n   For each group (same length l), we have two strings. \n\n   For each group, check which of the two strings is the prefix of length l of s_candidate. Assign P to that string and S to the other. \n\n   This way, even if both strings are also suffixes, we can correctly assign them. \n\n   So, the code needs to:\n\n   For each input string, group them by their length. \n\n   For each group (l), the two strings are s1 and s2. \n\n   Check if s1 is equal to s_candidate[:l]. \n\n   If yes, then assign P to s1 and S to s2. \n\n   Else, assign S to s1 and P to s2. \n\n   This way, for each group, exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S. \n\n   However, how to group the input strings by their length? \n\n   So, for example, for the input list, we can create a dictionary where the key is the length, and the value is a list of the strings of that length. \n\n   Then, for each length l, we take the two strings, compare them to the prefix of s_candidate of length l, and assign accordingly. \n\n   However, the problem is that the order in which the two strings are processed may affect the assignment. For example, if both strings are the same as the prefix and suffix (like in the case of 'aaa'), then for the two strings of length l, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. But how to determine which is which? \n\n   Well, for example, in the case of 'aaa' and l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a'. The prefix is 'a', the suffix is 'a'. So, both are the same. Therefore, the code can assign one as P and the other as S. \n\n   But how to do that? \n\n   Well, in this case, for the group of length l, the two strings are the same. So, regardless of which is assigned as P or S, the output will be valid. \n\n   Therefore, the code can proceed as follows: for each group of length l, check which of the two strings is the prefix. If both are the same as the prefix (which is possible), then assign one as P and the other as S. \n\n   But how to check which of the two strings is the prefix? Well, since the group contains two strings, and the prefix is s_candidate[:l], then if both strings are equal to the prefix, then both are the prefix. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. Therefore, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is the prefix and the other is the suffix. \n\n   Wait, no. For example, in the case of 'aaa', the prefix of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So both strings of length 1 are the same. Therefore, for the group of length 1, the two strings are both the prefix and suffix. But according to the problem's input constraints, the input has exactly two strings of each length. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. Therefore, for the case of 'aaa', the two strings of length 1 are both 'a', which are the prefix and the suffix. \n\n   Therefore, in this case, when grouping the input strings, for the group of length l, the two strings are the same. \n\n   Therefore, the code can proceed to assign one as P and the other as S. \n\n   But how to determine which one? \n\n   Well, for the group, the code can take the first string and assign P, the second S, or vice versa. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, this is acceptable. \n\n   So, in the code, for each group of length l:\n\n   get the two strings (s1, s2). \n\n   check if s1 is equal to the prefix of s_candidate of length l.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`.
