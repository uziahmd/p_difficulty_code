He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string of P's and S's, each indicating the type for the corresponding input string.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the original string s could be. Because once I know s, I can check each input string to see if it's a prefix or suffix. But how do I find s?\n\nThe problem says that the input gives all improper prefixes and suffixes of s. So for example, if s is \"ababa\" (like in the first example), then all prefixes of lengths 1-4 and suffixes of lengths 1-4 are given. But the input doesn't tell which is which. My job is to assign each of the input strings as either P or S such that there exists at least one possible s that matches.\n\nBut how do I find s? Well, the key insight here is that the original string s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. Also, the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be present in the input. Wait, but since the input has exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1, the longest possible prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (same length) must be among the input. However, for the original string s, the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So these two are different unless the entire string is made of the same character.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is: find the correct s by considering that the longest possible prefix and suffix (of length n-1) must be in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that the original string s must be such that for each of the input strings, they are either a prefix or suffix of s. But how to find s?\n\nAnother idea: the original string s can be determined by looking for the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the original string s must be the concatenation of a prefix of length n-1 and a suffix of length n-1. Wait, no. For example, in the first example, the original string is ababa. The longest prefix is abab (length 4), the longest suffix is baba (length 4). But the original string is ababa. How do these relate? Well, the longest prefix is the first 4 letters, and the longest suffix is the last 4 letters. So, combining them, the original string must be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the original string s has length n. The longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix (length n-1) is s[1..n-1]. So, if we take the longest prefix and the longest suffix, then the original string s is the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix. But wait, that would be s = longest_prefix + (longest_suffix[-1])? Or maybe the longest prefix and longest suffix share some characters. For example, in the first example, the longest prefix is abab (length 4) and the longest suffix is baba (length 4). Then the original string is ababa. Which is the first 4 letters of the prefix (abab) plus the last letter of the suffix (a). So yes, combining the longest prefix and the last character of the longest suffix gives the original string. But how do I know which of the input strings are the longest prefix and the longest suffix?\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Among the input strings, find the two strings of length n-1. These must be the longest prefix and the longest suffix of the original string. But which is which?\n\n2. For each possible pair of these two strings, try to construct the original string. For example, if one is the longest prefix (call it p) and the other is the longest suffix (call it s), then the original string would be p + s[-1], since the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], so its last character is s[-1]. But wait, the longest suffix is of length n-1. So the original string s is of length n. So the first n-1 characters are the longest prefix, and the last n-1 characters are the longest suffix. Therefore, the first character of the longest suffix is s[1], and the last character of the longest prefix is s[n-2]. So the original string s is the longest prefix (p) plus the last character of the longest suffix (s_suf[-1]). However, the first character of the longest suffix is s[1], which is the second character of the original string. So the original string must be p concatenated with s_suf[-1], but also, the first character of the longest suffix (s_suf[0]) must be equal to the second character of the original string (which is p[1]).\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me denote the original string as s. The longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So the longest suffix starts at position 1 of s. So the first character of the longest suffix is s[1], and the last character of the longest suffix is s[n-1]. The longest prefix ends at s[n-2], and the longest suffix starts at s[1].\n\nTherefore, the original string s can be constructed by taking the longest prefix (p) and appending the last character of the longest suffix (s_suf). But the first character of the longest suffix (s_suf[0]) must be equal to p[1], because the longest suffix starts at position 1 of the original string, which is p[1].\n\nSo for example, if the longest prefix is p and the longest suffix is s_suf, then the original string s would be p + s_suf[-1], and we must check that p[1] == s_suf[0]. If that's true, then this is a valid candidate for the original string.\n\nSo here's the approach:\n\n- Find all strings of length n-1 in the input. There are exactly two of them.\n\n- For each possible pair (p, s_suf) where p is one of the two, and s_suf is the other, check if p[1] == s_suf[0]. If so, then the original string s is p + s_suf[-1].\n\nOnce we have a candidate s, we can check whether all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If so, then this is a valid candidate, and we can proceed to assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple possible candidates for s? For example, in the third sample input, the input is for n=2. The input strings are 'a' and 'c'. The possible original strings are 'ac' or 'ca'. So for each case, the longest prefix and suffix are of length 1. So the two strings are 'a' and 'c'. Trying the pair (a, c): the original string would be a + c[-1] = a + c = 'ac'. Check if p[1] equals s_suf[0]. Since p is of length 1 (n-1=1), p[1] is out of bounds. Oh wait, when n=2, the length of the longest prefix and suffix is n-1=1. So p is a string of length 1, and s_suf is also a string of length 1. Then the original string would be p + s_suf[-1] = p + s_suf. But since p is of length 1 and s_suf is of length 1, the original string would be length 2. However, the condition that p[1] == s_suf[0] is not applicable here because p is length 1. So for n=2, the check is not needed. So in that case, any combination of the two strings as the longest prefix and suffix would give a candidate s. For example, if the two strings are a and c, then the original string could be a + c (ac) or c + a (ca). Both are valid.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nFor the general case:\n\n1. Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\n2. For each permutation of these two (i.e., for each possible way to assign one as the longest prefix and the other as the longest suffix):\n\n   a. Check if the first string (longest prefix) and the second (longest suffix) can form a valid s.\n\n   How?\n\n   For n >= 3, the check is that the first character of the longest suffix (s_suf[0]) must be equal to the second character of the longest prefix (p[1]).\n\n   Because the original string s is p concatenated with the last character of the suffix (s_suf[-1]), which is the same as the last character of the original string. Also, the first character of the suffix is the second character of the original string (since the suffix starts at index 1).\n\n   So for example, if the original string is p + s_suf[-1], then the second character of the original string is p[1], and the first character of the suffix is s_suf[0]. These must be equal.\n\n   So for the case where n >= 3, the check is p[1] == s_suf[0].\n\n   For n=2, the check is not needed, because the original string is p + s_suf[-1], which is p + s_suf (since s_suf is length 1). So the original string is p + s_suf, which is of length 2. For example, p is 'a', s_suf is 'c', then s is 'ac'.\n\nOnce we have a candidate s, we need to check that all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nOnce we find such an s, we can proceed to assign P and S to the input strings.\n\nBut how to find which input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nOnce we have s, for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with that string) or a suffix (ends with that string). However, note that some input strings might be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second sample input, the string is 'aaa', and the input strings include 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'. For the string 'aa', it's both a prefix and a suffix. But according to the problem statement, the answer can be any assignment as long as there's at least one possible s that matches. So for such cases, we can choose either P or S for that string.\n\nBut the problem requires that the number of P's and S's is equal (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, total 2n-2). So for each input string, we need to assign it as either a prefix or a suffix, ensuring that the count is correct.\n\nBut how to do this? Once we have s, we can collect all the prefixes and suffixes of s, then match them with the input strings. However, since the input may contain duplicates, we need to make sure that for each occurrence in the input, we assign it correctly.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e., there exists at least one s. So once we find a valid s, we can proceed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nOnce we have s:\n\n- For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then it can be assigned as P. Similarly for suffix.\n\nBut how to assign them in such a way that all the required prefixes and suffixes are accounted for. For example, for each of the input strings, we need to assign it as either a prefix or a suffix. But since the input contains exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1, and for each length, one is a prefix and one is a suffix (except when the prefix and suffix are the same string, which can happen if the string is made of same characters).\n\nWait, no. For example, in the case where s is 'aaa' (n=3), then for length 1, the prefix is 'a' and the suffix is 'a'. So the input will have two 'a's. So for each length, there are exactly two strings. But for each length, one is a prefix and one is a suffix. However, if the prefix and suffix for that length are the same string, then both entries in the input are the same, and both must be assigned as P and S. But how to do that?\n\nBut for the problem, we need to assign each input string as either P or S, such that the set of all P's is exactly the set of all prefixes of s, and the set of all S's is exactly the set of all suffixes of s.\n\nBut the input may have duplicates. For example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nWhich corresponds to the string 'aaa'. The prefixes are:\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'aa'\n\nsuffixes are:\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'aa'\n\nSo the input has two 'a's and two 'aa's. So for each of the input strings, we need to assign one as P and one as S. For example, the first 'a' could be P, the second 'a' could be S. The first 'aa' could be P, the second 'aa' could be S. Or any other combination.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, once we have s, for each input string, determine if it is a prefix or suffix of s. But since there are exactly two strings for each length, and for each length, exactly one prefix and one suffix, the input strings must contain exactly one prefix and one suffix for each length. However, when the prefix and suffix for a certain length are the same string (e.g., 'a' in the example above), then the two entries in the input are the same, and each must be assigned as P and S.\n\nSo the approach is: for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign it as P. Else, assign it as S. However, there's a problem here. For example, a string may be both a prefix and a suffix. How do we decide which to assign?\n\nBut the problem allows any assignment as long as there exists at least one s that is consistent. So once we have s, the assignment can be done by checking for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix, and assign accordingly, but making sure that the counts are correct.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that all prefixes are assigned as P and all suffixes as S. For example, suppose a string is both a prefix and a suffix. Then it can be assigned as either. But in the input, there are two occurrences of that string. So for each occurrence, we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo the way to do this is to collect all the prefixes of s (for each length 1..n-1) and all suffixes of s (same lengths). Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefix set. If it is, assign P, else assign S. But since the input has exactly the same set of strings (with duplicates), this approach should work.\n\nBut how to collect the prefixes and suffixes of s?\n\nFor example, for s of length n:\n\nprefixes are s[0...k] for k from 1 to n-1.\n\nsuffixes are s[n-k ... n-1] for k from 1 to n-1.\n\nSo for each input string, we can check if it is in the set of prefixes. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut since the input is guaranteed to be valid, this should work.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe plan is:\n\n- Find the possible candidate s by checking the two strings of length n-1.\n\n- For each candidate s, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nOnce a valid s is found, proceed to assign P/S.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, read the input. Let's say the input is given as n followed by 2n-2 strings.\n\nThen, for the candidate s:\n\nWe need to generate all possible candidates based on the two strings of length n-1.\n\nSo first, collect all the input strings. Then, filter those with length n-1. There should be exactly two of them.\n\nThen, for each permutation (two possibilities) of these two strings (say, a and b):\n\n   if n >= 3:\n\n       check if a[1] == b[0]. If so, then candidate s is a + b[-1]\n\n   else:\n\n       candidate s is a + b[-1] (which is a + b since length is 1)\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, check if all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nIf yes, then proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce we have such s, then for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of 'aaa', the string 'a' is both a prefix and suffix. So for each occurrence in the input, we can assign as P or S as needed.\n\nBut since the input has exactly two strings for each length, and the set of prefixes and suffixes of s includes exactly one string per length (but possibly overlapping), the code can assign each input string as P if it is a prefix, else S. However, for a string that is both a prefix and a suffix, it can be assigned as P or S, but in the input, there are two copies of it. So for example, if the input has two 'a's, and 'a' is both a prefix and suffix, then one can be assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how does the code know which to assign? Well, the code can check for each input string whether it is a prefix. If it is, assign P, else assign S. However, in the case where the string is both, then it's possible that the code assigns P for one and S for another.\n\nBut how to ensure that the counts are correct?\n\nBecause the input has exactly two strings for each length, and for each length, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix. So for example, if a string is both a prefix and suffix for a certain length, then there are two copies in the input. So, for each of them, one must be assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut the code's approach of assigning P if it is a prefix (regardless of being a suffix) will assign both as P. Which would be incorrect. So that approach is wrong.\n\nAh, this is a problem. How to handle this?\n\nSo, the problem is that when a string is both a prefix and a suffix, the code needs to assign exactly one of the two input occurrences as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nAlternative approach: for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then it can be assigned as P. But since there are exactly n-1 prefixes, and the same for suffixes, we need to make sure that exactly n-1 of the input strings are assigned as P, and the same for S.\n\nSo perhaps the code can collect all the prefixes of s (each of length 1..n-1) and all the suffixes of s (same lengths). Then, for the input strings, we can check which ones are in the prefix set and which are in the suffix set. But since the input contains exactly the same strings as the union of prefixes and suffixes (with duplicates), the code can assign each input string as P if it is in the prefix set, and S otherwise. However, for strings that are both in the prefix and suffix sets, we need to ensure that exactly one occurrence is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think with an example. Take the second sample input:\n\nn=3, input strings are a, aa, aa, a. The correct s is aaa. The prefixes are a (len 1), aa (len 2). The suffixes are a (len 1), aa (len 2). So the input has two a's and two aa's. So for the two a's, one must be P and one S. Similarly for the two aa's.\n\nIn the code, when checking if a string is a prefix, the first a is a prefix, the second a is also a prefix. So the code would assign both as P, which is wrong. But the correct answer is that one is P and one is S.\n\nSo the approach of assigning P if the string is a prefix is not sufficient. Because for strings that are both a prefix and a suffix, the code may assign both as P, leading to an incorrect count.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix and not a suffix. If yes, assign P. If it is a suffix and not a prefix, assign S. If it is both, then assign P or S, but ensuring that the total number of P and S is correct.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then we need to count how many prefixes we have already assigned. But since the input has exactly two strings for each length, and for each length, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix, perhaps we can track for each length how many times we have assigned a P.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach: for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two input strings. One of them must be assigned as P (the prefix of length l), and the other as S (the suffix of length l). So for each length l, we can find the prefix of s of length l (call it pre_l) and the suffix of s of length l (call it suf_l). Then, for the two input strings of length l, one must be pre_l and the other must be suf_l. So for each length l, we can check which of the two input strings is pre_l and which is suf_l. Then assign P to pre_l and S to suf_l.\n\nThis approach would work, but how to implement it?\n\nSo, for each length l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   pre_l = s[0...l-1]\n\n   suf_l = s[n-l ... n-1]\n\n   Now, among the input strings of length l, there are two strings. One of them is pre_l, the other is suf_l. So for each input string of length l, if it equals pre_l, assign P, else assign S.\n\nThis would ensure that for each length l, exactly one P and one S are assigned.\n\nYes! Because for each length l, the two input strings are exactly pre_l and suf_l. So for each of the input strings of length l, if it's the prefix, assign P, else assign S.\n\nBut how to find for each input string of length l whether it is pre_l or suf_l?\n\nSo, the code can:\n\nFor each input string, check its length. Then for that length l, compute pre_l and suf_l. Then compare the input string with pre_l and suf_l.\n\nBut how to handle the case where pre_l equals suf_l (i.e., the prefix and suffix of length l are the same). In that case, the two input strings for that length are both equal to pre_l (and suf_l). So for each of the two input strings of length l, we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that? Because for both input strings, they are equal to pre_l and suf_l. So for example, if pre_l is 'a', and the input has two 'a's for length l=1. Then, one of them must be P and the other S.\n\nBut how to decide which?\n\nWell, in this case, the code can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S, or vice versa. But since the problem allows any valid assignment, the code can choose arbitrarily. For example, for each length l, for the two input strings of length l, the first one can be assigned P if it's equal to pre_l, else S. But if both are equal to pre_l, then assign the first as P and the second as S.\n\nSo the code can process all the input strings, group them by their length, and for each group of two strings, compare them to pre_l and suf_l. For example:\n\nFor each input string, group them by their length. For each length l, we have two strings. Then, for each of these two strings, check if it's equal to pre_l or suf_l.\n\nBut since the input is guaranteed to be valid, for each length l, the two strings are exactly pre_l and suf_l (possibly same).\n\nSo, for each group of two strings of length l:\n\n   if the two strings are same (pre_l == suf_l):\n\n       assign P to the first and S to the second (or vice versa, but arbitrary choice)\n\n   else:\n\n       one is pre_l, assign P; the other is suf_l, assign S.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce s is determined:\n\n   for each input string in order:\n\n       l = len(string)\n\n       pre_l = s[0:l]\n\n       suf_l = s[-l:]\n\n       if the current string is equal to pre_l:\n\n           assign 'P'\n\n       else:\n\n           assign 'S'\n\nBut wait, this would work only if for each input string of length l, it is either pre_l or suf_l. Which is guaranteed by the problem's input constraints.\n\nYes, because the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for each input string, it must be either a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the string is both pre_l and suf_l. For example, in the case where the two input strings for length l are both equal to pre_l (which is same as suf_l). Then, for both strings, when compared to pre_l, they are equal. So the code would assign 'P' to both, which is wrong.\n\nAh, that's a problem. Because for that length l, there are two input strings, but both are equal to pre_l (and also to suf_l). So the code would assign both as P, leading to two P's for that length, but we need exactly one P and one S.\n\nSo the code's approach of checking if the string equals pre_l and assigning P otherwise S is not sufficient. It would fail in such cases.\n\nSo what's the solution here?\n\nThe problem is that when the input has two identical strings for a certain length l, which are both pre_l and suf_l. How to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nThus, the code must, for each length l, process the two input strings and assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nAn alternative approach is to collect all the input strings grouped by their length. Then, for each length l:\n\n   pre_l = s[0:l]\n\n   suf_l = s[-l:]\n\n   the two input strings of length l are str1 and str2.\n\n   if str1 == pre_l:\n\n       assign P to str1, and S to str2.\n\n   elif str1 == suf_l:\n\n       assign S to str1, and P to str2.\n\n   else:\n\n       # impossible, since input is valid.\n\nBut this would work only if one of the two strings is pre_l and the other is suf_l. However, when pre_l == suf_l, then both strings are equal to pre_l and suf_l. So in that case, how to assign?\n\nIn that case, the code can assign P to one and S to the other. For example, for the first occurrence of the string in the input, assign P, and the second occurrence assign S.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nSo perhaps for each length l, we can check whether the two input strings are same. If they are same, then assign one P and one S. Otherwise, assign the one that is pre_l as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nLet me think about the steps again.\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, we can group them by their length. For example, create a dictionary where keys are the lengths, and values are lists of the input strings of that length. For each length l, the list has two elements.\n\nThen, for each length l in 1..n-1:\n\n   pre_l = s[0:l]\n\n   suf_l = s[-l:]\n\n   for the two input strings of length l:\n\n       if they are the same:\n\n           assign first as P, second as S (or vice versa)\n\n       else:\n\n           if first string is pre_l: assign P, else assign S\n\n           then, for the second string, if it is pre_l: assign P, else assign S\n\nBut how to handle this? Because for the two strings, one must be pre_l and the other suf_l.\n\nSo for example, if the two strings are str1 and str2, and pre_l != suf_l:\n\n   if str1 == pre_l, then assign P to str1 and S to str2.\n\n   else, assign S to str1 and P to str2.\n\nBut how to determine which is which?\n\nBut how to find which of the two strings is pre_l and which is suf_l?\n\nWell, for the two strings, one must be pre_l, the other must be suf_l.\n\nSo, for the two strings, check which one is equal to pre_l. That one is the prefix, and the other is the suffix.\n\nSo, for the two strings in the group:\n\n   if str1 == pre_l:\n\n       assign P to str1 and S to str2\n\n   elif str2 == pre_l:\n\n       assign P to str2 and S to str1\n\n   else:\n\n       # impossible, since input is valid.\n\nBut what if both are equal to pre_l (since pre_l == suf_l)?\n\nIn that case, the two strings are same. Then, assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each length l in 1 to n-1:\n\n   pre_l = s[0:l]\n\n   suf_l = s[-l:]\n\n   group = list of two input strings of length l\n\n   if group[0] == group[1]:\n\n       assign P to group[0], S to group[1]\n\n   else:\n\n       if group[0] == pre_l:\n\n           assign P to group[0], S to group[1]\n\n       elif group[1] == pre_l:\n\n           assign P to group[1], S to group[0]\n\n       else:\n\n           # this is impossible, since input is valid.\n\nBut how to handle the order in which the group is processed. For example, group[0] and group[1] are the two strings of length l in the input. However, the input may have these two strings in any order. So for example, if the first string is the suffix and the second is the prefix, then the code would assign P to the second and S to the first.\n\nBut the code needs to process all the input strings in the order they were given. So, the code cannot just group by length and process the group. Because the original input order is important for the output.\n\nSo, the code needs to process each input string in the original order, and for each, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix of s. However, for cases where the string is both a prefix and a suffix, and there are two copies in the input, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nAn alternative idea is to keep for each length l, the count of how many P's have been assigned. For example, for each length l, there must be exactly one P and one S. So, for each input string of length l, if it's the first occurrence of that length, assign it as P if it's a prefix, else S. Then, for the second occurrence, assign the opposite.\n\nBut how to know which is the first and second occurrence?\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, when processing, check if it is a prefix of s. But for the same length l, if it's the first time we've seen this length, assign it as P. If it's the second time, assign it as S. But this would work only if the first occurrence is the prefix and the second is the suffix. But this may not be the case.\n\nBut how to know which is the prefix and which is the suffix for a given length?\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, check if it's a prefix. If it is, then for that length l, we have not yet assigned a prefix. Assign it as P. Else, assign it as S. However, this would work only if for the first occurrence of the length l, it's the prefix, and the second occurrence is the suffix.\n\nBut how to track whether for a particular length l, we have already assigned a prefix.\n\nThis seems manageable. Here's an idea:\n\nCreate a dictionary called 'assigned_prefixes' that maps length l to a boolean indicating whether we have already assigned a prefix for that length.\n\nInitially, all are False.\n\nFor each input string in the original order:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   if the string is a prefix of s:\n\n       if assigned_prefixes[l] is False:\n\n           assign P, mark assigned_prefixes[l] as True\n\n       else:\n\n           assign S\n\n   else:\n\n       assign S\n\nBut this may not work for cases where the string is both a prefix and suffix. For example, for a length l where pre_l == suf_l. Suppose the first input string of length l is the prefix (and also suffix). We assign it as P. The second input string of length l is also the prefix (and suffix). Since assigned_prefixes[l] is True, we assign S. Which is correct.\n\nBut for the case where the first input string is the suffix, and the second is the prefix. For example, the first input string is the suffix, which is not a prefix. So assign S. Then the second input string is the prefix, which is a prefix, and assigned_prefixes[l] is False, so assign P. Which is correct.\n\nBut how to ensure that the first occurrence of the length l is the prefix or suffix?\n\nBut the code checks whether the string is a prefix. If it is, and hasn't been assigned yet, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut what if the first input string of length l is the suffix (so not a prefix), and the second input string is the prefix. Then, the first is assigned S, the second is assigned P. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the first input string of length l is the prefix, and the second is the suffix. Then, first is assigned P, second is assigned S. Correct.\n\nAnd if the two are the same (prefix and suffix), then first is assigned P, second S. Correct.\n\nThus, this approach would work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string in the original order:\n\n   l = len(str)\n\n   if str is a prefix of s:\n\n       if we haven't assigned a prefix for length l yet:\n\n           assign P, mark that we have assigned a prefix for l\n\n       else:\n\n           assign S\n\n   else:\n\n       assign S\n\nBut how to check if the string is a prefix of s?\n\nWell, for a string to be a prefix of s, it must be equal to s[0...l-1], where l is the length of the string.\n\nSimilarly, to check if it's a suffix, it must be equal to s[-l:].\n\nSo, for each input string, during processing, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then proceed as per the above logic.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think with code.\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string in the original order:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   pre = s[:l]\n\n   suf = s[-l:]\n\n   if string == pre:\n\n       if not assigned_prefixes.get(l, False):\n\n           result.append('P')\n\n           assigned_prefixes[l] = True\n\n       else:\n\n           result.append('S')\n\n   else:\n\n       result.append('S')\n\nBut wait, what if the string is a suffix but not a prefix? Then, it's assigned S. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, the string is pre and suf. Then, if it is checked as a prefix, and assigned P (if not already assigned), else S.\n\nBut this approach ensures that for each length l, exactly one P is assigned (the first occurrence of the prefix), and the second occurrence (whether it's prefix or suffix) is assigned S.\n\nBut what if the first occurrence is a suffix (not a prefix), and the second occurrence is a prefix. Then, the first is assigned S, and the second is assigned P. Which is correct.\n\nYes. This seems to handle all cases.\n\nLet's test this logic with the second sample input.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=3\n\ninput strings are:\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nThe correct s is 'aaa'.\n\nProcessing each input string:\n\nFirst string is 'a', length 1.\n\npre is s[:1] = 'a'. So string equals pre. assigned_prefixes for 1 is False. Assign P. Now assigned_prefixes[1] = True.\n\nSecond string is 'aa', length 2. pre is 'aa' (s[:2] = 'aa'). string equals pre. assigned_prefixes for 2 is False. Assign P. Now assigned_prefixes[2",
