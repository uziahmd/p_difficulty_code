Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\nFirst, check if all the elements on both diagonals are the same. Then, check that all the non-diagonal elements are the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). For each cell in these diagonals, we need to check if they are all the same.\n\nBut wait, for the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, their intersection is the center cell. So, for example, in a 5x5 grid, the center cell (2,2) is part of both diagonals. So when checking the diagonals, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are the same. So the first step is to collect all the characters in both diagonals and check that they are all the same.\n\nThen, for all other cells not on either diagonal, check that they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Collect all the characters on the two diagonals. Check that all of them are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n- Collect all the characters not on the diagonals. Check that all of them are the same and not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how do I collect the diagonals?\n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, check if it's on either of these two lines.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid:\n\nif (i == j) or (i + j == n-1): it's part of the diagonals.\n\nElse: part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect them into a set. If the size of the set is 1, then all are same. But also, the same for the non-diagonal characters.\n\nWait, but for the diagonals, the two diagonals must have the same character. So for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'y', then the set of diagonal characters would be {'x', 'y'}, which is size 2. So that's invalid.\n\nSo, the first step is to collect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check that they are all same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Check for all cells in diagonals:\n\n   a. Collect all characters from diagonals into a set. If the size is not 1, return NO.\n\n   b. Else, get the diagonal_char (the only element in the set).\n\n3. Check for all non-diagonal cells:\n\n   a. Collect all characters into another set. If size is not 1, return NO.\n\n   b. Else, check that this set's element is not equal to diagonal_char.\n\nIf all these steps pass, return YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\nCheck if it's on the diagonals.\n\nSo, for each cell, check if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nNow, collect all the diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut perhaps, for the diagonals, we can loop through each cell and check if it's on either diagonal. Then collect all those characters into a set. Similarly for the non-diagonal.\n\nBut for n up to 300, this is manageable.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) !=",
