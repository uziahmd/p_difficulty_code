Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. The problem says that the X is formed when both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. So, how do I check this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure. For a square of size n x n where n is odd, the main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left. All the cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check all the cells on both diagonals. They should all be the same character. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check all the other cells (not on either diagonal) and ensure they are all the same character, say 'o_char', and that 'o_char' is not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how do I check each cell?\n\nLet me think about the positions. For a cell (i,j) in 0-based or 1-based indices? Well, the input is given as n lines each with n characters. Let's assume 0-based for easier programming.\n\nIn a square matrix, the main diagonal is where i == j. The other diagonal is where i + j == n - 1. So for each cell (i,j), if either i == j or i + j == n-1, it's part of the diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo first, I need to collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the two diagonals have different characters. Like, maybe the main diagonal is 'x' and the other diagonal is 'y'. That would not satisfy the condition. So the first step is to check that all the diagonal cells (both diagonals) are the same.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect them into a set. If the size of the set is not 1, then it's invalid. Also, the same for the non-diagonal cells. But also, the non-diagonal set must have exactly one element, and that element must differ from the diagonal's element.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on either diagonal.\n- Collect the characters of the diagonals into a set (d_chars). If any of them is different, then it's invalid.\n- Collect the non-diagonal characters into another set (o_chars). If any of them is different, invalid.\n- Then check if d_chars has exactly one element, o_chars has exactly one element, and the two elements are different.\n\nWait, but how to collect these sets. Let me think.\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: add to d_chars.\n\nelse: add to o_chars.\n\nThen:\n\nif len(d_chars) != 1 or len(o_chars) != 1 or d_chars.pop() == o_chars.pop() → then output NO else YES.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For example, n=3. The diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So total diagonal cells are 2n - 1. For n=3, 5 cells. The total cells are 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, the o_chars will have 4 elements. So in that case, the code would work.\n\nBut what if the o_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no, for n ≥3, there are non-diagonal cells. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut how to collect the characters. Let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   for each j from 0 to n-1:\n\n      check if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1). If yes, add to d_chars. Else add to o_chars.\n\nOnce all cells are processed, check:\n\nif len(d_chars) == 1 and len(o_chars) == 1 and d_chars[0] != o_chars[0] → YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, how to collect the d_chars and o_chars. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all characters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Character Collection**: Separate characters into two sets:\n   - Characters on the diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals).\n   - Characters not on the diagonals.\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Check if all characters on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Check if all characters not on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Ensure the characters on the diagonals are different from those not on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_chars = set()\nother_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(other_chars) == 1:\n    d_char = diag_chars.pop()\n    o_char = other_chars.pop()\n    if d_char != o_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first input line is the size `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Character Separation**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal where row index equals column index or anti-diagonal where the sum of indices equals `n-1`), it is added to the `diag_chars` set. Otherwise, it is added to the `other_chars` set.\n3. **Validation Checks**: \n   - If both sets contain exactly one unique character each, we check if these characters are different. If they are, the grid forms an \"X\", otherwise it does not.\n   - If either set has more than one unique character, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring clarity and correctness in determining the result.",
