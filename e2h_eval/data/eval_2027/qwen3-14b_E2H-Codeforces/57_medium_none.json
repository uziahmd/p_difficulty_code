His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has the first and second tour points, but they are not paired. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the actual pairing between a and b isn't known. Wait, no—each participant has a first tour score and a second tour score. But the problem says that the input gives the first tour points and second tour points in arbitrary order. So the original data is that for each participant, there's a first tour score (a_i) and a second tour score (b_i). But the teacher has the lists of a's and b's, but not the pairing. So the actual pairing between a_i and b_j is unknown. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for example, the first list is the first tour points for all participants, but not necessarily in the same order as the second tour. So each participant's first and second tour scores are in the a and b arrays, but we don't know which a_i pairs with which b_j. However, the problem states that Vasya is present, meaning there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >= x. \n\nBut for the purposes of calculating the best and worst possible ranks, we need to consider all possible pairings of a and b. Because the actual pairing is unknown, but the teacher has to consider all possibilities. However, the problem is that when considering the possible pairings, we need to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have. \n\nWait, but how? Because Vasya's total is at least x. But the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. So for the purpose of calculating the best and worst possible positions, we need to assume that Vasya's total is exactly some value that's >=x, but the actual pairing of a and b for Vasya is such that his total is as high as possible (for best rank) or as low as possible (for worst rank), but with the constraint that it's at least x. \n\nWait, no. Because the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher wants to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have. So for the best possible position, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he is as high as possible), while for the worst possible position, we want to minimize his total (so that he is as low as possible), but ensuring that his total is at least x. \n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible rank, we want Vasya's total to be as high as possible. Because higher totals will give better ranks. So for best rank, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible, but also ensuring that this sum is >=x. Then, we need to find how many people can have a total higher than that. But since other participants' totals can be arranged in any way, but how?\n\nWait, no. Because for the best possible rank, we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are arranged in a way that as few as possible have higher totals than him. Similarly, for worst possible rank, arrange pairings so that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others are arranged to have as many as possible higher than him.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think again. For the best possible rank: we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he has the highest possible sum), then count how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than that. Then, the best possible rank is that count + 1. But how to find the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Well, the maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i + b_j where a_i and b_j are from the two arrays. But wait, but we have to choose one a and one b for Vasya. However, the problem says that the teacher has the two lists of a and b, but the pairing is unknown. So for the best case, we can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya (as long as it's >=x). But if the maximum possible sum is less than x, then it's impossible, but the problem says that it is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So for best case, we take the maximum possible sum (which is the maximum a_i + b_j). Then, we need to find how many participants can have a sum greater than that. Wait, but how? Because the other participants' pairings can be arranged in a way that minimizes the number of people with higher sums. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the jury can assign places to participants with same points. So for the best possible rank, we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged so that as few as possible have higher sums. So for example, if Vasya's sum is S, then the number of people who have a sum strictly greater than S is the minimal possible. So how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by choosing the maximum possible S (Vasya's sum) and then counting the number of participants who can have a sum >= S. But since the jury can assign the same ranks, maybe for best possible rank, we can arrange that Vasya is placed first even if others have same sum. So the best possible rank is 1 if there's a way to have Vasya's sum be the maximum possible. \n\nWait, but how to compute the best possible rank. Let's think:\n\nFor the best possible scenario, we can select a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Let's call this value S_max. Then, in the best case, we can arrange the other pairs such that no one else has a sum greater than S_max. Thus, Vasya's best possible rank is 1. But that's only possible if there's a way to pair the other a's and b's such that none of their sums exceed S_max. But how can we ensure that? Because, for example, if there are other pairs that can sum to S_max, but that's allowed. \n\nWait, but for the best possible rank, the teacher can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is maximum possible, and others are arranged to have as low as possible sums. But how? Because the other participants' pairings are arbitrary. So, for example, if Vasya's sum is S_max, then the other participants can be paired in such a way that their sum is <= S_max. But how to check whether that is possible?\n\nHmm, but perhaps the problem is not about the actual pairing of the other participants, but rather, what is the minimal possible number of people who have a sum higher than Vasya's sum. For example, if Vasya's sum is S, then the number of people who can have a sum higher than S is determined by the maximum possible number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that sum to more than S. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because when considering the best possible rank for Vasya, the teacher can arrange the pairings so that Vasya's sum is as high as possible and others are arranged so that as few as possible have higher sums. So for example, the best possible scenario is when Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and the number of participants with sum strictly greater than that is zero. Therefore, his best possible rank is 1. But how can we ensure that? Because for that, we need that there's a way to pair all other a's and b's such that none of their sums exceeds S_max. \n\nBut how can we know if that is possible? For example, if S_max is the maximum possible sum, then perhaps there's a way to pair the other a's and b's such that their sum is <= S_max. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best possible rank, regardless of the other pairings, the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible S that Vasya can have, and then the minimal number of people that can have a higher sum than S. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a possible pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. For example, if the maximum possible sum is S, and there's at least one way to pair the other participants such that none of their sums exceed S. But how can we check that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think of the sample input. In the first example, all a's are 1 and all b's are 1. So the maximum sum is 2. All other participants have sum 2. So in that case, Vasya can be placed first (if the jury gives him first place) or fifth (if they put him last). So for best rank, it's 1, and worst is 5. \n\nSo in this case, the best possible rank is 1 because even though others have the same sum, the jury can choose to rank him first. \n\nSo the key idea here is that for the best possible rank, we can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya, and then the number of people who have a sum strictly greater than that is zero. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1. But how to confirm that?\n\nWait, but suppose that there are other participants whose sum can be higher than Vasya's sum. For example, if Vasya's sum is S, but there's another participant that can have a sum higher than S. Then, in that case, even if we pair the other participants in a way that their sum is not higher than S, but that's impossible. Wait, no. Because if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to higher than S, then the teacher can't avoid that participant having that sum. Wait, but the pairing is arbitrary. So, for example, if there's a participant that can have a sum higher than S, then the teacher can pair that participant's a_i with a b_j that gives that sum, thus making their total higher than Vasya's. But that would be bad for Vasya's best rank. However, the teacher is trying to find the best possible rank for Vasya, so the teacher can arrange the pairings in a way that avoids that. Wait, but how?\n\nAh, here's the thing. The teacher has to find the best possible and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have. So for the best possible rank, the teacher can choose the pairings (for all participants, including Vasya) in a way that maximizes Vasya's rank. So, for the best possible rank, the teacher can choose the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and other participants' sums are as low as possible. \n\nBut how can we model that? For example, to maximize Vasya's rank (i.e., make it as good as possible), the teacher can choose for Vasya the maximum possible sum, and for the other participants, pair their a and b in a way that their sum is as low as possible. But how to compute how many of them can have a sum higher than that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as follows: For the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya has the maximum possible sum (S_max), and then count the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have a sum strictly greater than S_max. But since the pairings are arbitrary, how can we determine that? \n\nWait, no. Because if we are allowed to pair the other participants in any way, then to minimize the number of people with sum > S_max, we can pair them such that as few as possible have sum > S_max. \n\nBut how to compute that? For example, the maximum possible S_max is the maximum a_i + b_j. Then, for other participants, we can pair their a and b in a way that their sum is as small as possible. But how to find the minimal possible number of participants with sum > S_max?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible number of participants with sum > S_max is zero. Because if S_max is the maximum possible sum, then there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) that gives that sum. But for other participants, can we arrange their pairings such that their sum is not higher than S_max? Well, yes, because for any a_i and b_j, their sum can't be higher than S_max. Because S_max is the maximum possible sum. So if you pair the other participants in a way that their sum is <= S_max, then there's no one with sum higher than S_max. Therefore, the best possible rank for Vasya is 1. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because S_max is the maximum possible sum, and if Vasya has that sum, then no other participant can have a sum higher than that. Because the maximum possible is S_max. Therefore, in that case, the best possible rank is 1. \n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. Unless there are multiple participants with the same sum as Vasya. But even then, the jury can choose to put Vasya first. \n\nWait, but how can we know that there exists a way to pair all participants such that none of them have a sum higher than S_max? Because S_max is the maximum possible sum. So for any a_i and b_j, their sum can't be higher than S_max. So if you pair all participants in any way, their sum can't be higher than S_max. Therefore, if Vasya's sum is S_max, then there are no other participants with a higher sum. Thus, the best possible rank is 1. \n\nThat's a key insight. So the best possible rank is always 1. Wait, but in the first sample input, that's the case. The output is 1 for best. But why? Because in that case, the maximum sum is 2, and all other participants have sum 2. So the best possible rank is 1. \n\nSo that suggests that the best possible rank is always 1. But that can't be right. Wait, what if there are multiple people with the same maximum sum. But the problem says that the jury can assign the ranks in any way. So Vasya can be first. So the best possible rank is 1. \n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is always 1. But why is the second sample's output also 1 for best? Let's look at the second sample. \n\nSample input 2:\n\n6 7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nThe maximum possible sum is 6+8=14? Or wait, the a array is [4,3,5,6,4,4], and the b array is [8,6,0,4,3,4]. So the maximum sum would be 6 (from a) + 8 (from b) = 14. So if Vasya is assigned this pair, then his sum is 14. Then, the other participants can be paired in a way that their sum is not higher than 14. Which is possible. So the best possible rank is 1. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo yes, the best possible rank is always 1. But why? Because the teacher can arrange the pairings so that Vasya has the maximum possible sum, and others have sums not exceeding that. Thus, the best possible rank is 1. \n\nSo that part is straightforward. Now for the worst possible rank. \n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to choose a sum for Vasya that is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other participants' pairings such that as many as possible have a sum higher than Vasya's. \n\nSo the approach for the worst possible rank is:\n\nFind the minimal possible sum S_min that Vasya can have (i.e., the minimal S such that S >=x, and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = S). Then, count how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than S_min, and add 1 (since Vasya's sum is S_min, and those people have higher sums). But how to find that count?\n\nBut how to find S_min? Well, S_min is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. So the minimal possible sum for Vasya is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. \n\nWait, but how to find that? Because we need to find the minimal sum S such that S >=x and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum S. Then, for that S, we need to count how many pairs (a, b) can have a sum strictly greater than S. \n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher can arrange the pairings. For the worst case, the teacher will arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others are arranged to have as many as possible sums higher than that. \n\nSo the steps for worst rank:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible sum S that is >=x. Let's call this S_min.\n\n   How to find S_min? It's the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. \n\n   So, for example, if x is 2, and all a_i and b_j are 1, then S_min is 2. \n\n   So how to compute S_min? We can generate all possible a_i + b_j and find the minimum among those that are >=x. However, since n can be up to 1e5, generating all pairs would be O(n^2), which is impossible. So we need a more efficient way.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to find the minimal sum S such that S >=x and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum S. How can we find that efficiently?\n\nWell, for that, we can sort the a array and the b array. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, among all such pairs, find the minimal sum. \n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's sort the a array in ascending order, and the b array in ascending order. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Since the b array is sorted, for each a_i, we can perform a binary search to find the smallest b_j that satisfies this condition. Then, the minimal sum for that a_i is a_i + b_j. Then, among all these, find the minimal sum overall. \n\nYes. That would be O(n log n) time. \n\nOnce we have S_min, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than S_min. Because in the worst case, the teacher can arrange the pairings such that as many participants as possible have sum greater than S_min, which would make Vasya's rank as low as possible. \n\nSo how to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S_min. \n\nTo find this, we need to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed such that a_i + b_j > S_min, with each a and b used exactly once. \n\nBut how to compute that maximum number?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of maximum matching where we want to pair elements from a and b such that their sum is greater than S_min. \n\nThe standard approach for this is to sort both arrays. Let's sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order. Then, for each element in a, try to pair it with the largest possible element in b that hasn't been used yet. \n\nWait, here's an approach: \n\nSort a in ascending order, and sort b in descending order. Then, for each a_i in a, pair it with the first available b_j such that a_i + b_j > S_min. \n\nBut how to count the maximum number of such pairs?\n\nAlternatively, here's a standard approach for this kind of problem:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers approach. Let's have i starting from the end of a (largest elements), and j starting from the end of b (largest elements). For each a_i, if a_i + b_j > S_min, then we can pair them, and move both pointers. Else, we move the j pointer to the left. \n\nWait, no. Let me think. To maximize the number of pairs with a_i + b_j > S_min, we can proceed as follows:\n\nSort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order. \n\nInitialize i = n-1 (the largest element in a), j = n-1 (the largest element in b). \n\ncount = 0 \n\nwhile i >=0 and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] > S_min:\n\n       count +=1 \n\n       i -=1 \n\n       j -=1 \n\n   else:\n\n       j -=1 \n\nThis approach is similar to the two-pointer technique used in the \"maximize the number of pairs with sum greater than target\" problem. \n\nThis works because for the largest a_i, we want to pair it with the largest possible b_j that allows the sum to be greater than S_min. If it's possible, then we take that pair, and proceed to the next smaller a_i and next smaller b_j. Otherwise, we try a smaller b_j. \n\nThis method gives the maximum number of pairs possible with sum > S_min. \n\nOnce we have that count, then the worst possible rank for Vasya is count + 1. Because there are count participants with sum > S_min, and Vasya's sum is S_min. But if there are other participants with sum equal to S_min, they can be placed after Vasya, but since the jury can arrange the ranks, the worst possible rank would be count + 1. \n\nWait, but in the worst case, the teacher can arrange the pairings so that as many as possible participants have sum > S_min. So the number of participants with sum > S_min is the maximum possible. So the worst possible rank is that number plus 1. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor the worst possible rank:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible sum S_min that is >=x. \n\n   To find this, we can sort a and b, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, then take the minimal sum across all possible pairs. \n\n   But how to compute this efficiently?\n\n   Let me think again. To find the minimal sum S >=x, we can sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. \n\n   For example, for a sorted in ascending order, and b sorted in ascending order. For each a_i, the minimal b_j is the first element in b that is >= (x - a_i). \n\n   But since we need to find the minimal sum across all possible pairs, perhaps we can use a two-pointer approach. \n\n   Let me think: Sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order. \n\n   Initialize i = 0, j = 0. \n\n   For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. \n\n   But how? Let's think. For the first a_0, the minimal b_j is the first element in b that is >= (x - a_0). \n\n   Since b is sorted, we can do a binary search for (x - a_i) in b. \n\n   Then, for each a_i, if there exists such a b_j, then the sum is a_i + b_j. We can track the minimum of all such sums. \n\n   So, the minimal possible S_min is the minimal of a_i + b_j for all pairs where a_i + b_j >=x. \n\n   So, the code for finding S_min would be:\n\n   Sort a and sort b. \n\n   min_sum = infinity \n\n   for each a_i in a:\n\n       target = x - a_i \n\n       find the smallest index j in b where b_j >= target \n\n       if such j exists:\n\n           current_sum = a_i + b_j \n\n           if current_sum < min_sum:\n\n               min_sum = current_sum \n\n   So, after checking all a_i, the min_sum is S_min. \n\n   However, since the problem says that there is at least one such pair, min_sum will be found. \n\n   Once we have S_min, then we need to find the maximum number of pairs (a, b) that can be formed such that their sum is > S_min. \n\n   Because, in the worst case, the teacher can arrange the pairings such that as many as possible participants have sum > S_min. So that the number of people above Vasya is as large as possible. \n\n   Then, the worst possible rank is (number of people with sum > S_min) + 1. \n\n   So the steps are:\n\n   - Compute S_min. \n\n   - Compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min. Let's call this count. \n\n   - Worst rank is count + 1. \n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple pairs with sum equal to S_min? For example, suppose S_min is 5, and there are 3 participants with sum 5. Then, in the worst case, the teacher can arrange that all those 3 participants have sum higher than Vasya's sum? No, because Vasya's sum is S_min. So others can have sum equal to S_min, but since the jury can arrange the ranks, they can be placed after Vasya. So the worst possible rank is count + 1, where count is the number of participants with sum > S_min. \n\nThus, the worst rank calculation depends on the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S_min. \n\nSo, the problem now becomes how to compute S_min and the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min. \n\nNow, putting this into code. \n\nFirst, handling the best rank: it's always 1. \n\nBut wait, what if x is larger than the maximum possible sum? No, the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. \n\nSo the best rank is always 1. \n\nBut let me check the first sample input. Yes, the output is 1. \n\nNow, for the worst rank. Let's take the first sample input. \n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, x=2. \n\na is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted. \n\nb is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted. \n\nS_min is 2. \n\nThen, the maximum number of pairs with sum > 2 is zero. Because all pairs sum to 2. So the worst rank is 0 +1 =1? But the sample output says 5. \n\nWait, that's a contradiction. What's wrong here? \n\nWait, sample 1's output is 1 5. So the worst possible rank is 5. But according to the previous logic, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min is zero. Then the worst rank is 0 +1 =1. Which is conflicting. \n\nSo clearly, there's a mistake in my reasoning. \n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because S_min is the minimal sum that is >=x. But in this case, S_min is 2. However, when we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min (which is 2), that's zero. So according to the previous logic, the worst possible rank is 0 +1=1. But in reality, the worst possible rank is 5. \n\nSo what's wrong with my reasoning?\n\nAh! Because when S_min is 2, and all pairs have sum exactly 2, then the number of participants with sum > S_min is zero. But Vasya's sum is 2. So in this case, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >=2 (which is all 5) and the jury can arrange the ranks such that Vasya is last. So the worst possible rank is 5. \n\nBut according to the previous approach, the worst possible rank is count +1, where count is the number of participants with sum > S_min. Which is zero. So 0+1=1. Which is wrong. \n\nSo the problem is that when S_min is the minimal sum that is >=x, but there are other pairs that have sum equal to S_min. \n\nSo the worst possible rank is not just the count of participants with sum > S_min, but also the count of participants with sum equal to S_min, because the jury can arrange them to be placed after Vasya. \n\nBut how to account for that?\n\nIn this case, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > S_min plus the number of participants with sum equal to S_min (including Vasya?), but since the jury can arrange the order, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > S_min + 1 (since Vasya can be placed after all those with sum equal to S_min). \n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min. Because in that case, Vasya's sum is S_min, and the jury can arrange the participants with sum >= S_min in such a way that Vasya is placed last among them. \n\nSo the worst possible rank is equal to the number of participants with sum >= S_min. \n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min. \n\nWait, but the problem is that when we choose S_min as the minimal sum that is >=x, then there's a possibility that some other pairs have sum >= S_min. \n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min. \n\nBut how can we compute that? \n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min. Because in that case, Vasya is one of them. So the worst possible rank is that number. \n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min. \n\nThis seems tricky. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nWhen trying to find the worst possible rank for Vasya, we need to choose a sum S (>=x) for him, and then arrange the other participants in such a way that as many as possible have sum >= S. \n\nBut since S is chosen as the minimal possible (so that S is as small as possible), but we want to maximize the number of participants with sum >= S. \n\nWait, but S is fixed as the minimal sum that is >=x. \n\nBut for the worst possible rank, we need to choose S as the minimal possible sum (so that there are more participants with sum >= S). \n\nSo for example, in the first sample, S_min is 2. All participants can be paired to have sum 2. So the number of participants with sum >= S_min is 5, so the worst possible rank is 5. \n\nIn the second sample, let's see. \n\nSample 2:\n\nn=6, x=7. \n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4] → sorted a is [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4] → sorted b is [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nWe need to find S_min. \n\nFor each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7. \n\nFor example:\n\na_i =3: need b_j >=4. The minimal b_j is 4. sum is 3+4=7. \n\na_i=4: need b_j >=3. minimal is 3. sum 4+3=7. \n\na_i=4: same as above. \n\na_i=4: same. \n\na_i=5: need b_j >=2. minimal is 0. sum is 5+0=5 <7. So need to find the minimal b_j such that 5 + b_j >=7 → b_j >=2. The minimal is 3. sum is 5+3=8. \n\na_i=6: need b_j >=1. minimal is 0. sum 6+0=6 <7. So need b_j >=1. So minimal is 0? Wait, no. 6 +0=6 <7. So need to find the first b_j >= 7-6=1. The sorted b is [0,3,4,4,6,8]. So the first element >=1 is 3. So sum is 6+3=9. \n\nSo the minimal S_min is 7. \n\nNow, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=7. \n\nHow to compute that?\n\nTo compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=7. \n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= S_min. \n\nBut how to compute that maximum number. \n\nAgain, using two pointers approach. \n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. \n\nInitialize i =0 (start of a), j =n-1 (end of b). \n\ncount =0 \n\nfor each a_i in a:\n\n   while j >=0 and a_i + b[j] >= S_min:\n\n       count +=1 \n\n       j -=1 \n\n       break \n\n   else:\n\n       continue \n\nWait, no. Let me think of the standard approach for maximum number of pairs with sum >= target. \n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. \n\nInitialize i =0, j =n-1. \n\ncount =0 \n\nwhile i <n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >= target:\n\n       count +=1 \n\n       i +=1 \n\n       j -=1 \n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1 \n\nThis is the standard approach. \n\nLet me test this with the first sample:\n\na is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted. \n\nb is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted. \n\ntarget is 2. \n\ni starts at 0, j at 4. \n\na[0] + b[4] = 2 >=2 → count=1, i=1, j=3. \n\na[1] + b[3] = 2 → count=2, i=2, j=2. \n\na[2] + b[2] = 2 → count=3, i=3, j=1. \n\na[3] + b[1] = 2 → count=4, i=4, j=0. \n\na[4] + b[0] = 2 → count=5, i=5, loop ends. \n\nSo count is 5. \n\nWhich means that the maximum number of pairs with sum >=2 is 5. So the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo the correct approach for the worst rank is:\n\nOnce we have S_min, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min. Then, the worst possible rank is that count. \n\nWait, but why? Because if there are count participants with sum >= S_min, then Vasya is one of them, and the jury can arrange that he is placed last among them. So his rank is count. \n\nBut in the first sample, the count is 5, and the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches. \n\nIn the second sample, let's compute the count. \n\nSample 2: S_min is 7. \n\na sorted: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nb sorted: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\ntarget is 7. \n\nInitialize i=0, j=5. \n\nCheck a[0] (3) + b[5] (8) = 11 >=7 → count=1, i=1, j=4. \n\na[1]=4 + b[4]=6 → 10 >=7 → count=2, i=2, j=3. \n\na[2]=4 + b[3]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=3, i=3, j=2. \n\na[3]=4 + b[2]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=4, i=4, j=1. \n\na[4]=5 + b[1]=3 → 8 >=7 → count=5, i=5, j=0. \n\na[5]=6 + b[0]=0 → 6 <7 → so i increases to 6, loop ends. \n\nTotal count is 5. \n\nSo the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo the correct approach for the worst possible rank is:\n\nCompute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min. The worst possible rank is this count. \n\nBut why? Because the teacher can arrange the pairings so that as many participants as possible have sum >= S_min (which includes Vasya's sum). Then, the worst possible rank for Vasya is that count, since he can be placed last among them. \n\nThus, the correct approach for the worst rank is:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves efficiently calculating these ranks using sorting and two-pointer techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: This is always 1 because we can always pair Vasya's scores such that he has the highest possible total points, ensuring he is ranked first.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: This requires finding the minimum possible total score Vasya can have (which is at least `x`) and then determining how many participants can have a higher or equal score than this minimum. This is done using a two-pointer technique on sorted arrays to maximize the count of participants with scores greater than or equal to Vasya's minimum score.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n, x = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Best rank is always 1\n    best = 1\n    \n    # Compute worst rank\n    # Find S_min\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        # Find the first b >= target\n        j = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if j < len(b_sorted):\n            current_sum = ai + b_sorted[j]\n            if current_sum < min_sum:\n                min_sum = current_sum\n    \n    # Now compute max number of pairs with sum >= min_sum\n    # Using two pointers approach\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count = 0\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] >= min_sum:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    worst = count\n    \n    print(f\"{best} {worst}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the scores from the two tours.\n2. **Best Rank Calculation**: The best possible rank is always 1 because we can always pair Vasya's scores to achieve the highest possible total.\n3. **Worst Rank Calculation**:\n   - **Finding Minimum Valid Sum (S_min)**: We sort both score lists and use binary search to find the minimum valid sum that is at least `x`.\n   - **Two-Pointer Technique**: After determining `S_min`, we use a two-pointer approach on the sorted score lists to count the maximum number of participants who can have scores greater than or equal to `S_min`. This count gives the worst possible rank for Vasya as it represents the maximum number of participants that could be ranked above or equal to him, allowing the jury to place him last among them.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation with time complexity dominated by sorting and two-pointer traversal, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
