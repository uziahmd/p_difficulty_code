He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nSo, the process is: A starts with some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo, the final string must have:\n\n1. All 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. For example, if there's a 'c' before a 'b', that's not possible.\n\nSo first check: the string should consist of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So any deviation from this order (like a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b', etc.) would make it invalid.\n\nSo first step: check the order of characters. Let's think about how to do that. For example, the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So the string can be divided into three parts. So for example, the string 'aaabccc' is valid. But 'aabccba' is not.\n\nSo how to check that? Well, the string must not have any 'a's after the first occurrence of 'b' or 'c'. Similarly, once a 'b' is encountered, there should be no 'a's after that. And once a 'c' is encountered, there should be no 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo, perhaps we can check the order by iterating through the string and ensuring that the characters are non-decreasing in terms of their order (a < b < c). Wait, but the order must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the string must be in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be split into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's. So the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So any occurrence of a character that is not in this order is invalid.\n\nSo, for example, if the string is 'abba', then after the first 'b', there's another 'a' which is invalid. So that's a no.\n\nSo first, we need to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. How to check that?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and track the current allowed characters. Initially, allowed is 'a'. Once a 'b' is encountered, allowed becomes 'b' and 'c' (but wait, no. Because after the a's, the next is b's. Once a 'b' is found, then the allowed characters are 'b' and 'c'? No. Wait, after the a's, the b's are added. Then after that, the c's are added. So once the first 'b' is encountered, the rest of the string can't have any a's. Similarly, once the first 'c' is encountered, the rest can't have a's or b's.\n\nSo, perhaps we can track the current allowed characters. Let's think:\n\nInitially, the allowed characters are 'a's. Once a 'b' is found, allowed becomes 'b's and 'c's. Wait, no. Because the 'b's are added after the a's. Then the c's are added after the b's. So the order must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So once a 'b' is encountered, the rest of the string can only have 'b's and 'c's. But once a 'c' is encountered, the rest can only have 'c's.\n\nSo for example, the string can have a's followed by b's followed by c's. So during iteration, the characters must be in non-decreasing order of their type. So the first occurrence of a 'b' must be after all a's, and the first occurrence of a 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nSo, the way to check this is to make sure that the string is in the order a's, then b's, then c's. So, for example, the string can be split into three parts. So, the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So, the code can check that.\n\nSo, how to check that? Let's think of the string as being in three sections. For example, the first part",
