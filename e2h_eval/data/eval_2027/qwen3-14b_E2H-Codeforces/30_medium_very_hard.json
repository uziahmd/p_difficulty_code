Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge choosing turns to take digits from a number A such that each makes exactly n moves (so total 2n digits). The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum sum. And if there are multiple options, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. So the main challenge is figuring out the optimal way for Homer and Marge to pick digits. Since each choice affects the remaining digits and the future choices, it seems like a dynamic programming problem. But with n up to 18, the straightforward approach might not work because the state space could be too big.\n\nLet me think. Let's consider the state as the current position in the string (how many digits have been taken so far) and the number of moves each player has made. For example, after k moves, Homer has made h moves and Marge m moves, where h + m = k. Since each player must make exactly n moves, the state can be represented by (current position, h, m), but since h + m = current position, maybe we can just track h and m. Wait, but h + m = k, which is equal to the number of digits taken so far. Since the initial state is h=0, m=0, and after 2n steps, h=n, m=n.\n\nBut for the DP approach, the state would need to track how many digits have been taken, and how many Homer and Marge have taken. However, since the total digits taken is h + m, and each step increases it by one, maybe we can model it as the current index (i.e., how many digits have been taken) and how many Homer has taken so far. Because m = (current index) - h. So for a state (i, h), where i ranges from 0 to 2n, and h ranges from 0 to n. Then, for each state, we can decide whether the next move is H or M, provided that the number of H's doesn't exceed n and the same for M.\n\nBut the problem is that for n=18, the total number of states is (2*18 + 1) * (18 + 1) = 37 * 19 = 703. Wait, no. Wait, for each i (from 0 to 2n), and h (from 0 to n). But when i is the current number of digits taken, then h can be at most min(i, n), and m = i - h must be <=n. So for each i, h can be in the range max(0, i -n) to min(n, i). So for each state, the possible h is limited. But even so, for n=18, the total number of states is 36 * 19 = 684? Wait, 2n is 36. So i ranges from 0 to 36. For each i, the h can be up to min(i, n). So for each i, the number of h is up to n. So the total number of states is 37 * 19 = 703? Because n is 18, and for each i (0 to 36), h can be from 0 to 18, but only if i - h <= 18 (since m = i -h must be <=n). So for each i, the possible h is between max(0, i -n) and min(n, i). For example, when i is 36 (the maximum), h can be 18 (since m = 18). So for each i, the number of h values is up to 19 (for example, when i is 18, h can be from 0 to 18). So overall, the number of states is O( (2n) * n ), which for n=18 is 36 * 18 = 648. That's manageable.\n\nSo the DP approach would be to memoize the maximum total sum achievable from a given state (i, h), where i is the number of digits taken so far (so the next digit to take is at position i in the original string), and h is the number of times Homer has taken a digit so far. Then, for each state, we can decide whether the next move is H or M, provided that Homer hasn't taken n moves yet, or Marge hasn't taken n moves yet.\n\nBut wait, the next move can be H only if h < n, and M only if m = i - h < n. Because m is the number of moves Marge has made so far. Since i is the number of digits taken, m = i - h. So for the next move, if we choose H, then h increases by 1, and the new i is i+1. Similarly for M.\n\nThe key is that for each state (i, h), we can compute the maximum sum possible from that state onwards. Then, the DP transition would be:\n\ndp[i][h] = max( (take H now) value + dp[i+1][h+1], (take M now) value + dp[i+1][h] )\n\nBut how do we calculate the value added by taking H or M?\n\nWhen taking H, the current digit is A[i] (since i digits have been taken so far, the next digit is the i-th index in the original string). So, for example, if the original string is '1234', then when i=0, the first digit is 1. When we take H, the value added to the total is the digit (as part of S1). Similarly for M, the digit is added to S2. But since the total sum is S1 + S2, the value added is the digit multiplied by 1 (since each digit is part of either S1 or S2, and the sum is the sum of all digits, but each digit is added once. Wait, no! Wait, the sum S1 + S2 is the sum of all digits of A, because each digit is taken once. Because each digit is taken by either H or M. So regardless of the order, the total sum is fixed. Wait, that can't be right. Because the problem says that the total prize is S1 + S2. But S1 is the number formed by the digits taken by Homer, and S2 is the same for Marge. So the sum is not just the sum of digits, but the actual numeric value of S1 plus the numeric value of S2. Oh, that's a big difference.\n\nOh right! So for example, if Homer takes digits 1 and 2, his number is 12, and Marge takes 3 and 4, her number is 34. The total is 12 + 34 = 46. But if the order is different, say Homer takes 2 and 1, his number is 21, and Marge takes 3 and 4, sum is 21 +34 =55, which is higher. So the order in which digits are taken affects the sum.\n\nTherefore, the problem is not just about choosing which player takes which digits, but also the order in which they take them, because each digit's contribution to the sum depends on its position in the player's number. For example, a digit taken earlier contributes more (as higher place value) than a digit taken later.\n\nThis complicates things. Because the DP state needs to track not only the current sum, but also the current numbers of Homer and Marge. However, since n can be up to 18, and each number can be up to 1e18 digits long, storing the actual numbers is impossible for DP.\n\nWait, but the problem requires maximizing the total sum. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: For each state (i, h), we need to track the maximum possible total sum that can be achieved from that state onward, given that Homer has already taken h digits, and Marge has taken i - h digits. But how do we calculate the contribution of the current choice (H or M) to the total sum?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we are at state (i, h). The next digit to take is A[i]. If we choose H, then this digit will be added to Homer's number. But since Homer's number is built by taking digits in the order of the moves, this digit becomes the (h+1)th digit of Homer's number. Similarly for Marge. For example, if Homer has already taken h digits, then taking this digit will add it as the next digit (leftmost, because each move takes the leftmost digit of A). Wait, the problem says:\n\nOn each turn, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their number. Then this digit is erased from A. So the order of digits in the players' numbers is the order in which they took the digits. For example, if Homer takes the first digit (say 1), then the next digit (say 2) he takes, his number becomes 1 followed by 2, i.e., 12. But the way the digits are taken is that each time, the leftmost digit is taken. So the order of taking is fixed in terms of the original string. For example, the first move takes the first digit of A, the second move takes the next leftmost digit (which was originally the second digit of A, unless someone took it before).\n\nWait, the problem says that each time, the player takes the leftmost digit of A. So the order of digits in the players' numbers is determined by the order in which they take the digits from the original string. For example, if the original A is \"abcd\", and the sequence of moves is H, M, H, M, then Homer takes first digit a, then third digit c. His number is a followed by c, i.e., \"ac\" (but as a number, which is 10*c + a? No, wait: when you append the digit to your number. Wait, the problem says: \"takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number\". So appending to the end. So for example, if Homer takes a first, then his number is a. Then, if he takes c next, his number is a followed by c, which is ac (i.e., a*10 + c). So the value of the number depends on the order of digits taken. Each time a player takes a digit, it's added to the end of their number. Therefore, the first digit taken contributes to the highest place value (like 10^{n-1} if there are n digits), the next contributes to 10^{n-2}, etc.\n\nSo, for example, if a player takes digits in the order d1, d2, d3, then their number is d1*10^2 + d2*10^1 + d3*10^0.\n\nSo, when considering the contribution of a digit to the total sum, the position in which it is taken (i.e., when it is added to the player's number) determines the weight (power of 10) that it contributes to the total.\n\nBut how can we model this in the DP? Because for each state, we need to track not only how many digits each player has taken, but also the current value of their numbers. But for n=18, the numbers can be up to 1e18 digits long, which is impossible to store directly.\n\nThis seems like a problem. How can we model the DP state without tracking the exact numbers?\n\nAlternative idea: For each state (i, h), we can track the maximum total sum that can be achieved from that state, given that Homer has already taken h digits and Marge has taken (i - h) digits. But how do we compute the contribution of the current choice (taking H or M) to the total sum?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we are at state (i, h). The next digit is A[i]. If we choose H, then this digit is added to Homer's number. Since Homer has already taken h digits, this will be his (h+1)th digit. The position of this digit in his number is the (h+1)th digit, which contributes digit * 10^{n - (h+1)} to his number. Wait, because the total number of digits Homer will take is n. So the first digit he takes is the first digit of his number, contributing digit * 10^{n-1}, the second digit contributes digit * 10^{n-2}, and so on, until the nth digit contributes digit * 10^0.\n\nSimilarly for Marge. So for each digit that is taken by a player, its contribution to the total sum is digit * 10^{k}, where k is the number of digits remaining to be taken by that player after this move. For example, if Homer has already taken h digits, and takes another one (making h+1), then he will have (n - (h+1)) digits left to take. So this digit is the (h+1)th digit in his number, which is in the 10^{n - (h+1)} position.\n\nAh! So for the current choice, the contribution of the digit can be calculated based on how many digits the player has already taken. So, when choosing to take H now, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - (h + 1)}. Similarly, if taking M, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - (m + 1)}, where m is the number of digits Marge has taken so far. But m is equal to (i - h), since i is the number of digits taken so far (h + m = i). So when taking M, m_new = m + 1 = (i - h) + 1. So the contribution is digit * 10^{n - ((i - h) + 1)}.\n\nTherefore, during the DP transitions, for each state (i, h), we can calculate the contribution of taking H or M at this step, and then proceed recursively.\n\nThis seems promising. The DP state is (i, h), and the value stored is the maximum total sum achievable from that state onward. The recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i][h] = max( (digit * 10^{n - (h + 1)} ) + dp[i+1][h+1], (digit * 10^{n - ( (i - h) + 1 )} ) + dp[i+1][h] )\n\nBut for this to work, we need to precompute the powers of 10 up to n (since n can be up to 18, 10^18 is manageable as a Python integer).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute pow10 = [10^k for k in 0..n]\n\n- For each state (i, h), compute the maximum sum possible.\n\n- The base case is when i == 2n, which means all digits are taken. Then, the sum is 0.\n\nBut wait, when i reaches 2n, that's the end. So the base case is when i == 2n, return 0.\n\nFor other states:\n\nAt state (i, h), the next digit is A[i], which is the (i)th character (assuming zero-based index). Let me check the input: the input is a string of 2n digits. So for example, if the input is '1234', then for n=2, the digits are [1,2,3,4].\n\nSo when i is the number of digits taken so far, the next digit is the i-th index (since 0-based). So for i=0, the first digit is A[0], which is correct.\n\nNow, for the transitions:\n\nIf we choose H, then the contribution is digit * pow10[n - (h + 1)].\n\nBecause Homer has already taken h digits, and this is his (h+1)th digit. The number of digits he will take in total is n. So the position of this digit in his number is (h+1)th, which contributes digit * 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nSimilarly for M: she has taken (i - h) digits so far. Taking this digit is her (i - h + 1)th digit. So the contribution is digit * 10^{n - ( (i - h) + 1 )} = digit * 10^{n - (i - h + 1)}.\n\nSo, the DP transitions can be computed as follows.\n\nBut for n=18, the pow10 array would need to have up to 10^18, which is a very big number. But Python can handle big integers, so that's okay.\n\nNow, the problem is the size of the DP table. For n=18, i can be up to 36 (since 2n=36), and h can be up to 18. So the DP table is 37 x 19 entries. Each entry is a value (the maximum sum) and possibly the choice made (H or M) to get there, which is needed to reconstruct the path.\n\nBut how do we compute this DP? Since the transitions depend on the next state (i+1, ...), we can compute this using memoization (top-down) or iterative DP (bottom-up). Let's think about bottom-up.\n\nWe can compute the DP for i from 2n down to 0. For each i, we process all possible h values.\n\nLet's think about the steps.\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp[i][h], where i ranges from 0 to 2n, and h ranges from 0 to n.\n\nBut for i=2n, all digits are taken. So dp[2n][h] = 0 for any h (but in reality, h must be n, since i=2n implies h + m = 2n, and m = i - h = 2n - h. But since m must be n, then h must be n. So for i=2n, h must be n, and the dp is 0.\n\nSo for the bottom-up approach, we can start from i=2n-1 down to 0.\n\nFor each i, and for each possible h in the allowed range (such that h <=n, and i - h <=n), we compute the value of dp[i][h].\n\nSo for each state (i, h):\n\ndigit = A[i]\n\nif we take H:\n\nthen, the contribution is digit * pow10[n - (h + 1)]\n\nand we need to add dp[i+1][h+1]\n\nBut we can only take H if h < n.\n\nSimilarly, for taking M:\n\ncontribution is digit * pow10[n - ( (i - h) + 1 ) ]\n\nand add dp[i+1][h]\n\nBut we can take M only if (i - h) < n.\n\nSo for each state (i, h), we check both possibilities and take the maximum.\n\nOnce the DP table is filled, the answer is dp[0][0], which gives the maximum total sum. But we also need to reconstruct the path (the sequence of H and M) that leads to this maximum sum.\n\nTo reconstruct the path, during the DP computation, we can also keep track of the choice (H or M) made at each state. So for each state (i, h), we can store whether it was better to choose H or M.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute pow10.\n\npow10[k] = 10^k. For k from 0 to n.\n\nBut for the contribution of a digit when taken by H, it's 10^{n - (h + 1)} = 10^{(n - h - 1)}. Similarly for M.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nFor H, when he takes the (h+1)th digit, the number of digits he has left to take after this is (n - (h+1)) digits. So the current digit is the (h+1)th in his number, which is multiplied by 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, if n=2, and h=0 (Homer has taken 0 digits so far), taking this digit is his first digit, which is multiplied by 10^(2 - 1) = 10^1 = 10.\n\nSimilarly, if he takes his second digit (h=1), it's multiplied by 10^(2 - 2) = 1.\n\nSo the pow10 array needs to have exponents from 0 up to n-1. Because the maximum exponent is when h is 0, then n - (h+1) = n-1.\n\nSo pow10 should be precomputed up to n-1. Or perhaps up to n, depending on the calculation.\n\nWait, for n=18, the exponents can be up to 18-1=17, so pow10[0...17].\n\nSo pow10 can be precomputed as [10**k for k in 0..n].\n\nBut for the case when n - (h + 1) could be negative? No, because when h is up to n-1, since when taking H, h must be less than n. So h+1 can be up to n. Then n - (h+1) can be from n - (0+1) = n-1 down to n - (n) = 0. So exponents are from 0 to n-1. So pow10 needs to be precomputed up to n-1.\n\nSo pow10 can be a list where pow10[k] = 10^k for k in 0 to n.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can precompute it as follows:\n\npow10 = [1] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in 1 to n:\n\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nBut in Python, 10^18 is manageable.\n\nNow, for the DP table. Let's think about the implementation.\n\nWe can represent the dp as a 2D array. Since n can be up to 18, and 2n is 36, the maximum size is 37 rows (for i from 0 to 36) and 19 columns (h from 0 to 18). So it's manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, perhaps using lru_cache with memoization is easier. However, for n=18, the number of states is 37 * 19 = 703, which is very small. So even a recursive approach with memoization would work.\n\nBut for the path reconstruction, we need to know for each state (i, h) whether the optimal choice was H or M. So during the DP computation, we can store for each state the best choice (H or M), and then backtrack from (0, 0) to build the sequence.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a DP function with memoization that returns the maximum sum and the choice made (H or M) for each state.\n\nBut since in Python, memoization with mutable parameters (like lists) can be tricky, but for the parameters i and h (integers), we can use memoization via lru_cache.\n\nAlternatively, implement it with memoization via a memo table.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and A.\n\nThen, precompute pow10 as described.\n\nThen, implement a recursive DP function with memoization.\n\nBut for Python, recursion depth may not be an issue here, since the maximum depth is 2n, which is 36.\n\nBut for the DP function, perhaps memoization with lru_cache is manageable.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps using memoization with a dictionary or a 2D array.\n\nBut for code clarity, let's proceed with memoization.\n\nLet me outline the code steps:\n\nRead n and A as input.\n\nCompute the length of A as 2n.\n\nprecompute pow10 = [10^k for k in 0..n]\n\nThen, for each state (i, h), compute the maximum sum.\n\nBut in code, perhaps using memoization via a memo table.\n\nBut for Python, using memoization with functools.lru_cache.\n\nBut since the parameters are i and h, which are integers, it's manageable.\n\nBut for the code, the digits of A are accessed as A[i], which is a string. So we need to convert each character to an integer.\n\nNow, the DP function:\n\ndef dp(i, h):\n\n    if i == 2n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if memo[i][h] is not None:\n\n        return memo[i][h]\n\n    current_digit = int(A[i])\n\n    max_val = -infinity\n\n    choice = ''\n\n    # check if can take H\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        # contribution of taking H is current_digit * pow10[n - (h+1)]\n\n        # then proceed to i+1, h+1\n\n        val_h = current_digit * pow10[n - (h+1)] + dp(i+1, h+1)\n\n        if val_h > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val_h\n\n            choice = 'H'\n\n    # check if can take M\n\n    m = i - h\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        # contribution is current_digit * pow10[n - (m + 1)]\n\n        val_m = current_digit * pow10[n - (m + 1)] + dp(i+1, h)\n\n        if val_m > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val_m\n\n            choice = 'M'\n\n    memo[i][h] = max_val\n\n    return max_val\n\nBut wait, the pow10 array is for exponents. For example, when taking H, the exponent is n - (h + 1). So for n=2, h=0, exponent is 2-1=1, which is correct.\n\nBut what if n - (h+1) is negative? No, since h can be at most n-1 (because we can take H only when h <n). So h+1 ranges from 1 to n. Thus, n - (h+1) ranges from n-1 down to 0.\n\nSimilarly for M: m is the current number of M's moves, which is i - h. Since m <n, then m+1 can be up to n. So n - (m+1) ranges from n-1 down to 0.\n\nSo the pow10 array needs to have up to n-1. So the pow10 array can be precomputed as pow10 = [10**k for k in range(n)] ?\n\nWait, for exponents from 0 to n-1. Because when h+1 is 1, exponent is n-1. When h+1 is n, exponent is 0.\n\nSo for example, pow10[exponent] = 10^exponent.\n\nSo for exponents up to n-1, the pow10 array needs to be of size n.\n\nWait, let's compute the pow10 array as follows:\n\npow10 = [1] * (n)\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nBut no, for exponents 0 to n-1, the pow10 array can be generated as:\n\npow10 = [10**k for k in range(n)]\n\nBut for n up to 18, 10^18 is manageable as an integer.\n\nSo in code, pow10 can be generated as:\n\npow10 = [10**k for k in range(n)]\n\nWait, but for example, when n=2, the exponents for H are 1 and 0. So pow10[1] is 10^1=10, pow10[0] is 10^0=1. Which matches.\n\nBut in the code above, when taking H, the exponent is (n - (h+1)). For example, when n=2 and h=0, the exponent is 2 - (0+1) = 1, which is pow10[1], which is 10^1. So yes, the pow10 array must be of size n, with pow10[k] = 10^k.\n\nBut in the code, the pow10 array is of length n. So for exponents up to n-1.\n\nThus, the code for generating pow10 is:\n\npow10 = [1] * n\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nWait, no. Because for k=0, it's 10^0=1. For k=1, 10^1=10, etc. So the code should generate pow10 as:\n\npow10 = [10**k for k in range(n)]\n\nBut in Python, that's easy.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's better to precompute pow10 as follows:\n\npow10 = [1] * (n)\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nWait, but for n=0? Well, n starts from 1.\n\nBut for n=1, the pow10 array is [1], which is correct.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nNow, the problem is that when we compute the exponent, for example, when n=2, and h=0, the exponent is 2 - (0+1) = 1, which is within 0 to n-1 (since n=2, exponents up to 1). So yes.\n\nSo the code for pow10 is correct.\n\nNow, the DP function.\n\nBut for the code, we need to memoize the maximum sum for each (i, h) pair.\n\nBut for the code, in Python, using memoization with lru_cache is possible. However, since the input A is a string, and the function dp uses it, perhaps we need to pass it as a parameter, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, since the function is inside the code, and the A is a global variable, perhaps that's manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for functions decorated with lru_cache, the parameters must be hashable. So the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = ... \n\nA = ... \n\npow10 = ... \n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n\ndef dp(i, h):\n\n    if i == 2*n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    current_digit = int(A[i])\n\n    max_val = -1\n\n    choice = ''\n\n    # check H\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        exponent = n - (h + 1)\n\n        val_h = current_digit * pow10[exponent] + dp(i+1, h+1)\n\n        if val_h > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val_h\n\n            choice = 'H'\n\n    # check M\n\n    m = i - h\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        exponent = n - (m + 1)\n\n        val_m = current_digit * pow10[exponent] + dp(i+1, h)\n\n        if val_m > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val_m\n\n            choice = 'M'\n\n    return max_val\n\nWait, but in this code, the pow10 array is a global variable. Also, the function dp is called with parameters i and h. However, for the code to work, we need to compute the exponents correctly.\n\nBut for the exponents, when n is 2, and h is 0, exponent is 2 - (0+1) = 1, which is pow10[1], which is 10^1. But in the pow10 array, which is generated as [10^k for k in 0..n-1]. For n=2, the pow10 array has indexes 0 and 1. So yes, exponent is 1, which is within the array.\n\nBut wait, for the exponent, it's n - (h + 1). For example, when n=2, h+1 can be 1 or 2 (since h can be 0 or 1). So exponents are 2-1=1, and 2-2=0. Both are within the pow10 array of size 2 (indices 0 and 1). So yes.\n\nSo the code for pow10 is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the pow10 array is of length n. So for exponents from 0 to n-1. Which is exactly what is needed.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, the maximum sum is found. However, the problem requires not only the maximum sum but also the sequence of choices (H and M) that leads to it.\n\nSo we need to track the choices made. For that, we can have another memoization table, or during the DP computation, we can track the choice made for each (i, h) state.\n\nBut using a separate memoization for choices.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, we can track the choice, but for that, perhaps we need to modify the DP function to return both the maximum value and the choice made. However, that complicates the memoization.\n\nAnother approach is to run the DP once to compute all the maximum values, and then perform a second pass to reconstruct the path by checking for each state (i, h) which choice (H or M) was better.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nOnce the DP table is filled, for each (i, h), we can check which choice (H or M) gives the maximum value. So during the reconstruction phase, we can start from (0, 0), and for each step, check whether taking H or M would give the maximum value, and choose accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nIn code, after filling the DP table (using memoization or a 2D array), we can do:\n\nresult = []\n\ni = 0\n\nh = 0\n\nwhile i < 2*n:\n\n    current_digit = int(A[i])\n\n    # check if H is possible and better\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        m_current = i - h\n\n        exponent_h = n - (h + 1)\n\n        val_h = current_digit * pow10[exponent_h] + dp_table[i+1][h+1]\n\n    else:\n\n        val_h = -infinity\n\n    if (i - h) < n:\n\n        exponent_m = n - ( (i - h) + 1 )\n\n        val_m = current_digit * pow10[exponent_m] + dp_table[i+1][h]\n\n    else:\n\n        val_m = -infinity\n\n    if val_h > val_m:\n\n        result.append('H')\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        result.append('M')\n\n    i += 1\n\nBut this requires that the DP_table is stored as a 2D array. However, if we used memoization with lru_cache, we can't directly access the DP values for all (i, h) pairs. So perhaps it's better to compute the DP using a 2D array, and then reconstruct the path.\n\nSo, the code can be written with a bottom-up DP approach, storing the maximum values in a 2D array, and then reconstructing the path.\n\nLet's think about the bottom-up approach.\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp of size (2n + 1) x (n + 1). Because i can be up to 2n, and h can be up to n.\n\nBut for each i, h, the value is the maximum sum from that state.\n\nInitialize dp[i][h] for all i and h.\n\nBut for i from 2n down to 0:\n\nfor i in range(2n, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in possible range:\n\n        compute dp[i][h]\n\nBut how to loop through h for each i?\n\nFor each i, h can range from max(0, i - n) to min(n, i). Because m = i - h must be <=n. So i - h <=n => h >= i -n. Also, h can't be negative, so h >= max(0, i -n). And h can't be more than i (since h can't be more than the number of digits taken so far, which is i). Also, h can't be more than n.\n\nSo for each i, the h ranges from h_min = max(0, i -n) to h_max = min(n, i).\n\nSo for the bottom-up approach, for each i from 2n down to 0:\n\n    for h in h_min to h_max:\n\n        compute dp[i][h]\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of code steps.\n\nn = ... \n\nA = ... \n\npow10 = [10**k for k in range(n)]\n\nmax_len = 2 * n\n\ndp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(max_len + 1)]\n\nfor i in range(max_len, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in range(0, n+1):\n\n        # check if h is valid for this i\n\n        # m = i - h must be between 0 and n.\n\n        # So for h to be valid, i - h <=n --> h >= i -n\n\n        # and h <=i\n\n        # but for the loops, perhaps we can check if h is valid.\n\n        # But in code, for each i and h, we can check if it's valid.\n\n        # But for the code, perhaps better to loop h from max(0, i -n) to min(n, i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge to maximize their total prize when taking digits from a given number. Each player must take exactly `n` digits, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by the digits they take.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to compute the maximum possible total prize from each state. The state is defined by the number of digits taken so far (`i`) and the number of digits Homer has taken (`h`). The corresponding number of digits Marge has taken is derived as `i - h`.\n\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: Since the contribution of each digit to the total prize depends on its position in the number formed by the player, we precompute powers of 10 up to `n` to efficiently calculate the positional value of each digit.\n\n3. **State Transition**: For each state `(i, h)`, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and compute the resulting total prize. The choice that leads to the higher total prize is recorded.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the sequence of moves by checking which choice (Homer or Marge) leads to the maximum prize at each step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    \n    max_len = 2 * n\n    pow10 = [10**k for k in range(n)]\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(max_len + 1)]\n    \n    # Fill DP table from bottom up\n    for i in range(max_len, -1, -1):\n        for h in range(n+1):\n            # Check if current (i, h) is valid\n            m = i - h\n            if m < 0 or m > n:\n                continue\n            if i == max_len:\n                dp[i][h] = 0\n                continue\n            current_digit = int(A[i])\n            max_val = -1\n            # Try H\n            if h < n:\n                exponent_h = n - (h + 1)\n                val_h = current_digit * pow10[exponent_h] + dp[i+1][h+1]\n                if val_h > max_val:\n                    max_val = val_h\n            # Try M\n            if m < n:\n                exponent_m = n - (m + 1)\n                val_m = current_digit * pow10[exponent_m] + dp[i+1][h]\n                if val_m > max_val:\n                    max_val = val_m\n            dp[i][h] = max_val\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    h = 0\n    while i < max_len:\n        current_digit = int(A[i])\n        m = i - h\n        # Check possible choices\n        choice = ''\n        val_h = -1\n        val_m = -1\n        if h < n:\n            exponent_h = n - (h + 1)\n            val_h = current_digit * pow10[exponent_h] + dp[i+1][h+1]\n        if m < n:\n            exponent_m = n - (m + 1)\n            val_m = current_digit * pow10[exponent_m] + dp[i+1][h]\n        if val_h >= val_m:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n        i += 1\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming Table**: The `dp` table is filled from the end of the string back to the start. Each entry `dp[i][h]` holds the maximum total prize achievable starting from the `i`-th digit with Homer having taken `h` digits so far.\n- **Powers of 10**: Precomputed to quickly determine the positional value of each digit in the numbers formed by Homer and Marge.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we trace back from the start state `(0, 0)` to determine whether each move should be Homer's or Marge's based on which choice yields the higher total prize.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal sequence of moves using dynamic programming and reconstruct the path to achieve the maximum total prize.",
