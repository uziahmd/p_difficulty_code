The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because even chests can be paired with odd keys, and odd chests can be paired with even keys. So, the total is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests=2 (9,11). \n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1 (7), even_keys=3 (others). \n\nSo min(3,1) is 1 (even chests paired with odd keys) and min(2,3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3, which matches the sample output. \n\nSecond example input: \nChests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. So min(5,1) is 1, plus min(0,0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even), keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_chests=1, odd_keys=0. So min(1,0)=0. And odd_chests=0, even_keys=4. min(0,4)=0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach is correct. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, how to implement this in Python?\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of a's, then list of b's.\n\nFor the a's, count how many are even and odd. Similarly for the b's.\n\nThen compute the sum as described.\n\nLet me think about edge cases. For example, if there are zero even chests, or zero odd keys, etc. But the formula handles that.\n\nAnother example: if there are more even chests than odd keys. Then the min would be the number of odd keys, and the rest even chests can't be paired. Similarly for the other part.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\na_list = list of integers from input.\n\nb_list = list of integers from input.\n\ncount_even_chest = number of elements in a_list where x % 2 == 0.\n\ncount_odd_chest = n - count_even_chest.\n\ncount_even_key = number of elements in b_list where x % 2 == 0.\n\ncount_odd_key = m - count_even_key.\n\nresult = min(count_even_chest, count_odd_key) + min(count_odd_chest, count_even_key)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes, that's the plan. Now code that.\n\nNow, for the input, the code needs to read from stdin. Let's see.\n\nIn Python, the input is read via input() or sys.stdin. For large inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin, but for the problem constraints (n and m up to 1e5), using input().split() should be okay.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nRead first line as n, m.\n\nThen second line",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers. Similarly, count how many keys have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n2. **Pairing Strategy**: \n   - Even-numbered chests can be opened by odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests can be opened by even-numbered keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the number of even chests and odd keys plus the minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in b_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially with large input sizes.\n- **Parity Counting**: We iterate through the list of chest numbers and key numbers to count how many are even or odd.\n- **Result Calculation**: Using the counts of even and odd chests and keys, we compute the maximum number of pairs by taking the minimum values of compatible pairs (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal pairings using simple counting and arithmetic operations, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n + m), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
