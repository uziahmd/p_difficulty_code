There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure is different because of the rule. The problem wants us to maximize the number of games the winner plays, so we need to arrange the matches in a way that allows the winner to play as many times as possible while respecting the rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, they play against one player (say, player 2), then the winner plays against player 3. But why is that allowed? Because when the first game is played, both have 0 games before. Then after winning, the winner has 1 game, and the next opponent (player 3) has 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Wait, but in a normal knockout, it's two rounds. But why can't the winner play three games? Well, because there are four players. Let's think: if you have four players, the first round would be two matches. Suppose the winner plays in two matches. But maybe there's a way to have the winner play three? No, because for that, there would need to be three rounds. But with four players, the total number of games is three (since each game eliminates one player, and you need to eliminate three to get a winner). But the winner would have to play three games. However, according to the example, the answer is 2. So why is that?\n\nAh, because of the rule. Let's think. Let's say the winner plays three games. For that, each time he plays, his opponent must have a game count that differs by at most one. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the winner starts by playing against someone. That's game 1. Then, he needs to play again. His opponent could be someone who has played 0 or 1 games. Let's say the next opponent has played 0. Then, after that, the winner has 2 games. Now, the next opponent must have either 1 or 2 games. But how can there be such a player? Let's think about the structure.\n\nWait, with four players, the initial matches would be two matches. Suppose the winner plays in the first match (game 1), then in the second match (game 2). But then, the third game would require that the winner's opponent has played either 1 or 2 games. But the other players would have been eliminated. So perhaps the structure is that the winner can't play three games because there's no way to arrange the matches. For example, if the winner plays two matches, then the third match would require that the opponent has played 1 game. But how would that happen?\n\nIn the example given for n=4, the organizers arrange the matches as (1,2) and (3,4). Then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner (1) has played two games. So the maximum is 2. But why can't there be a scenario where the winner plays three games?\n\nAh, because for that, the winner would have to play three times. Let's imagine:\n\nFirst game: player 1 vs 2. Player 1 wins. Now, player 1 has 1 game.\n\nSecond game: player 1 vs 3. Player 1 wins. Now, player 1 has 2 games. But for this to be allowed, player 3 must have played 1 or 0 games. Since player 3 hasn't played before, that's okay. Then, the third game would be against player 4. But player 4 hasn't played any games. So the difference is 2 (player 1 has 2, player 4 has 0). Which is not allowed. So that's why the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play, given that each time they play, their opponent must have a game count differing by at most one.\n\nSo, how to model this? It seems like a problem that can be solved with some recursive approach or mathematical formula.\n\nLet me think about the maximum number of games possible. Let's denote f(n) as the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nFor n=2, f(2)=1. For n=3, f(3)=2. For n=4, f(4)=2. For n=5? Let's think. How can we arrange the matches?\n\nSuppose the winner plays 2 games. Let's see. Maybe the structure is similar to the n=3 case. For example, the winner beats two players, but then there's another player. Wait, but with five players, maybe the structure is that the winner plays against players in such a way that each time, the opponents have the required number of games.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. To maximize the number of games, the winner must play as many times as possible. Each time they play, the opponent must have a number of games that is either equal to the winner's current count or one less. \n\nLet me think of the problem as building a tree. The winner's path is a sequence of matches. Each time, the opponent must have a certain number of games. For example, the first match, the opponent has 0 games. The next match, the opponent could have 0 or 1 games. But if the winner wants to maximize the number of games, perhaps the best way is to have the opponent have as many games as possible. \n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for the winner to play k games, he must have defeated opponents who themselves had to play certain numbers of games. For example, to have a winner play k games, the number of players required is something like the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that for the winner to play m games, he must have played against m opponents. Each time, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let's think of the structure as follows: \n\nThe first game, the opponent has 0 games. Then, the second game, the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, the winner would have to have opponents that have as many games as possible. So, for the second game, the opponent must have 1 game. How can that happen? That opponent must have played once before. Which implies that that opponent was in a previous match. \n\nThis seems like a recursive problem. For the winner to play m games, the number of players required is the sum of the players needed for each of the opponents in each round. \n\nLet me think of it like this: \n\nTo have a player reach m games, he must have played m matches. Each time, the opponent must have played either m-1 or m-2 games. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nIn the first game, the winner has 0 games. He plays against someone else who has 0 games. After that, he has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. If we want to maximize the number of games, the opponent should have 1 game. How can that happen? That opponent must have played once before, which means that they had to have a previous match. \n\nSo, for the winner to play m games, the number of players required is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2). Because in order to get to the m-th game, the winner must have defeated an opponent who has played m-1 games (so that the difference is 1), and that opponent would have needed to come from a subtree that requires f(m-1) players. But also, the winner would have to have played against others in previous steps. \n\nWait, this seems familiar. Like the Fibonacci sequence. For example:\n\nLet’s think of the minimal number of players required to have a winner play m games. Let’s call this number g(m). Then, for m=1, g(1)=2 (two players). For m=2, the winner plays two games. The first game is against one player (so 2 players). The second game is against someone who has played 1 game. To get that someone, you need 2 players (as in m=1). So total players is 2 + 1 = 3? Or maybe 2 + 2? Wait, maybe the recurrence is g(m) = g(m-1) + g(m-2). Because for the winner to play m games, in the m-th game, he must face an opponent who has played m-1 games. To get that opponent, you need g(m-1) players. But the winner himself must have played m-1 games before, which requires g(m-1) players. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the winner's path requires that in each step, he has opponents that are from subtrees. For example, the first game is between two players (g(1) = 2). For the second game, the winner has to play against someone who has played 1 game. That someone comes from a subtree that requires g(1) players. But the winner himself has already played once. So the total players needed is g(1) + g(1) - 1? Or maybe the total players is g(m) = g(m-1) + g(m-2). Let's take examples.\n\nFor m=1: g(1) = 2.\n\nFor m=2: the winner plays two games. The first game is against someone (needs 2 players). Then, the second game is against someone who has played 1 game. That someone comes from a subtree where the winner played 1 game. So that requires 2 players. But since the winner is part of both subtrees, perhaps the total is 2 + 2 - 1 = 3? Which is the case for n=3. So for m=2, g(2) = 3.\n\nFor m=3, the winner has to play three games. The third game is against an opponent who has played 2 games. To get that opponent, you need g(2) players. And the winner's previous games require that he has played 2 games, which requires g(2) players. But how do these combine? So the total players would be g(2) + g(2) - 1? Or maybe g(3) = g(2) + g(1) ?\n\nLet me think: for m=3, the winner's third game requires that the opponent has 2 games. So that opponent's subtree requires g(2) players. The winner's path up to the second game requires that he has played 2 games, which requires g(2) players. But the winner and the opponent's subtree are separate, except for the final match. So the total number of players is g(2) + g(2) - 1? Or perhaps the total is g(2) + g(1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct recurrence is g(m) = g(m-1) + g(m-2). Because for the winner to reach m games, he must have played m-1 games before, and then in the m-th game, he faces someone who has played m-1 games. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, think of the structure as a Fibonacci tree. For the winner to have m games, the minimal number of players required is the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number. Let's see:\n\nIf we define Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4) = 3, Fib(5) = 5, etc.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nFor m=1, g(1)=2. Which is Fib(3) = 2.\n\nFor m=2, g(2)=3 = Fib(4).\n\nFor m=3, g(3)= Fib(5) = 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that g(m) = Fib(m+2).\n\nLet me check for m=3. If the minimal number of players is 5, then for n=5, the maximum number of games is 3. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nYes. For example:\n\nPlayer 1 beats player 2 (game 1). Then, player 1 needs to play against someone who has 1 game. Let's say player 3 beat player 4 (game 1). Then player 1 and 3 play (game 2). Now, player 1 has 2 games. Now, to play a third game, he needs to face someone with 2 games. How? Let's say there's player 5. But how does he get to 2 games? Well, maybe player 5 has to play against someone else. But with n=5, maybe the structure is:\n\nFirst, player 1 vs 2 → 1 wins (game 1).\n\nPlayer 3 vs 4 → 3 wins (game 1).\n\nPlayer 1 vs 3 → 1 wins (game 2).\n\nNow, player 1 has 2 games. Now, to play another game, he needs to face someone with 1 or 2 games. The remaining player is 5. But 5 hasn't played any games. So that's a difference of 2, which is not allowed. So how can we arrange it?\n\nAh, perhaps there's another way. Maybe the initial matches are arranged so that the opponent of the winner in the third game has played 2 games. For example:\n\nLet's have player 1 play against player 2 (game 1). Then, player 1 has 1 game. Now, player 1 needs to play against someone with 1 game. So, perhaps player 3 plays against player 4 (game 1). Then player 3 has 1 game. Player 1 and 3 play (game 2). Now, player 1 has 2 games. Then, player 3 has 1 game. Now, player 1 needs to play against someone with 1 or 2 games. But there's player 5. How can he get to 1 game? Well, player 5 could play against someone else. But there's no one else. So, perhaps in the third game, player 1 plays against player 5. But that's not allowed because player 5 has 0 games, and player 1 has 2. Difference of 2. Not allowed.\n\nSo how can the winner play 3 games? Maybe the structure is different. Maybe there are more players. For example, if n=5, perhaps the minimal required is 5 players, but the maximum games is 2. But according to the earlier assumption, g(3) is 5. Which suggests that for n=5, the answer is 3. But how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the structure is that the winner's path is such that each time he plays, the opponent has played one less game. So, for the third game, the opponent must have played 2 games. How can that happen?\n\nLet me think recursively. For the winner to play m games, the number of players required is the sum of the players needed for the two subtrees. For example, in the m-th game, the winner has to face an opponent who has played m-1 games. To get that opponent, you need g(m-1) players. Also, the winner must have played m-1 games before that. But how? Because the winner's path up to the m-th game requires that he has played m-1 games. Which would require that he has a subtree that requires g(m-1) players. However, the opponent's subtree is g(m-1) players. But the winner is part of that subtree. So the total players is g(m-1) + g(m-2)? Or perhaps g(m) = g(m-1) + g(m-2). Because to get the opponent for the m-th game, you need g(m-1) players. But the winner's path to get to the m-th game requires that he has played m-1 games, which would have required g(m-1) players. But this seems overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct recurrence is g(m) = g(m-1) + g(m-2). Because:\n\nFor the winner to play m games, he must have played m-1 games before. Then, in the m-th game, he plays against someone who has played m-1 games. But how did that someone get to m-1 games? That requires that the opponent's subtree has g(m-1) players. However, the winner's path up to m-1 games requires that he has a subtree of g(m-1) players. But since the two subtrees are separate, except for the final match, the total number of players is g(m-1) + g(m-2) ? Or perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the process as follows. To have a player reach m games, the last match is against an opponent who has played m-1 games. To get that opponent, you need g(m-1) players. But the winner himself must have played m-1 games, which requires that he has a path where he played m-1 games. However, the winner's path to reach that point would have required that he has played m-1 games, which requires g(m-1) players. But that's not possible because the opponent's subtree is separate. So, perhaps the total players is g(m-1) + g(m-2). Because the winner's previous matches would have required that he has played m-1 games, which requires g(m-1) players. But how does that fit with the opponent's subtree?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recurrence is g(m) = g(m-1) + g(m-2). Let's test for the known values.\n\ng(1) = 2 (for m=1, two players).\n\ng(2) = g(1) + g(0). Wait, what is g(0)? Maybe g(0) is 1? Because if the player has played zero games, then there's just one player. But that seems arbitrary. Let's think again.\n\nIf m=0, then the player hasn't played any games. So the minimal number of players is 1. So g(0) = 1.\n\nThen, for m=1, g(1) = g(0) + g(-1)? No, that doesn't make sense. Perhaps the recurrence is different. Let's re-examine.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the maximum number of games the winner can play is m, and the minimal number of players required for that is g(m). Then, the recurrence is:\n\ng(m) = g(m-1) + g(m-2).\n\nBecause to reach the m-th game, the winner must have played m-1 games and faced an opponent who has played m-1 games. But how does that work? Well, the winner's path to get to the m-th game requires that he has played m-1 games, which would have required g(m-1) players. But the opponent's path to get to m-1 games requires g(m-1) players. However, since they are two separate branches, the total players would be g(m-1) + g(m-2)? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is g(m) = g(m-1) + g(m-2) - 1. Because the winner is counted in both subtrees. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's try to find the values for g(m):\n\nFor m=1: 2 players.\n\nFor m=2: 3 players. Because the winner plays two games. The first game requires 2 players. The second game requires the winner to face someone who has played 1 game. That someone requires 2 players. But the winner is already in that group. So total players is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nFor m=3: The winner needs to play a third game. The opponent must have played 2 games. Which requires 3 players (from m=2). The winner's path to get to that third game requires that he has played 2 games, which requires 3 players. But the opponent's 3 players and the winner's 3 players? But that would be 3 + 3 - 1 (since the winner is in both groups?) So 5 players. Which is 3 + 2 = 5. Wait, 3 is g(2), and 2 is g(1). So the recurrence would be g(3) = g(2) + g(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. Which fits. Similarly, for m=2, g(2) = g(1) + g(0). Assuming g(0) = 1, then 2 + 1 = 3. Which fits. So yes! The recurrence is g(m) = g(m-1) + g(m-2), with base cases g(0) = 1, g(1) = 2.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\ng(0) = 1\n\ng(1) = 2\n\ng(2) = 3\n\ng(3) = 5\n\ng(4) = 8\n\ng(5) = 13, etc.\n\nWhich is the Fibonacci sequence shifted by some indices. For example, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, etc. So g(m) = Fib(m+2), since for m=0, Fib(2) = 1. For m=1, Fib(3)=2, m=2 Fib(4)=3, etc.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given n, find the maximum m such that g(m) ≤ n. Because if the minimal number of players required to have a winner play m games is g(m), then if n is at least g(m), it's possible to arrange the tournament so that the winner plays m games. So for a given n, the answer is the largest m where g(m) ≤n.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFind the maximum m such that Fib(m+2) ≤n. \n\nBut wait, let's check the examples:\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. What is the maximum m where Fib(m+2) ≤4?\n\nLet's compute Fib numbers:\n\nFib(2) = 1\n\nFib(3)=2\n\nFib(4)=3\n\nFib(5)=5\n\nSo for n=4, the largest m where Fib(m+2) ≤4 is m=2 (since Fib(4)=3 ≤4, Fib(5)=5>4). So the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=3. Fib(4)=3, so m=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample n=10: Let's compute Fib(m+2) until it exceeds 10.\n\nFib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13. So for m=4, Fib(6)=8 <=10. m=4. Then Fib(7)=13>10. So the answer is 4. Which matches the sample input where n=10 outputs 4.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum m where Fib(m+2) ≤n. \n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers until they exceed 1e18 (since n can be up to 1e18).\n\n2. For a given n, find the maximum m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nWe can generate the Fibonacci sequence until the value exceeds 1e18, then for each n, perform a binary search on the list of Fib numbers to find the maximum m.\n\nLet's generate the Fib sequence:\n\nLet me compute the Fib numbers:\n\nLet's start with Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, Fib(8)=21, Fib(9)=34, Fib(10)=55, Fib(11)=89, Fib(12)=144, Fib(13)=233, Fib(14)=377, Fib(15)=610, Fib(16)=987, Fib(17)=1597, Fib(18)=2584, Fib(19)=4181, Fib(20)=6765, Fib(21)=10946, Fib(22)=17711, Fib(23)=28657, Fib(24)=46368, Fib(25)=75025, Fib(26)=121393, Fib(27)=196418, Fib(28)=317811, Fib(29)=514229, Fib(30)=832040, Fib(31)=1,346,269, Fib(32)=2,178,309, Fib(33)=3,524,578, Fib(34)=5,702,887, Fib(35)=9,227,465, Fib(36)=14,930,352, Fib(37)=24,157,817, Fib(38)=39,088,169, Fib(39)=63,245,986, Fib(40)=102,334,155, Fib(41)=165,580,141, Fib(42)=267,914,296, Fib(43)=433,494,437, Fib(44)=701,408,733, Fib(45)=1,134,903,170, Fib(46)=1,836,311,903, Fib(47)=2,971,215,073, Fib(48)=4,807,526,976, Fib(49)=7,778,742,049, Fib(50)=12,586,269,025, Fib(51)=20,365,011,074, Fib(52)=32,951,280,099, Fib(53)=53,316,291,173, Fib(54)=86,267,571,272, Fib(55)=139,583,862,445, Fib(56)=225,851,433,717, Fib(57)=365,435,296,162, Fib(58)=591,286,729,879, Fib(59)=956,722,026,041, Fib(60)=1,548,008,755,920, Fib(61)=2,504,730,781,961, Fib(62)=4,052,739,537,881, Fib(63)=6,557,470,319,842, Fib(64)=10,610,209,857,723, Fib(65)=17,167,680,177,565, Fib(66)=27,777,890,035,288, Fib(67)=44,945,570,212,853, Fib(68)=72,723,460,248,141, Fib(69)=117,669,030,460,994, Fib(70)=190,392,490,709,135, Fib(71)=308,061,521,170,129, Fib(72)=498,454,011,879,264, Fib(73)=806,515,533,049,393, Fib(74)=1,304,969,544,928,657, Fib(75)=2,111,485,077,978,050, Fib(76)=3,416,454,622,906,707, Fib(77)=5,527,939,700,884,757, Fib(78)=8,944,394,323,791,464, Fib(79)=14,472,334,024,676,221, Fib(80)=23,416,728,348,467,685, Fib(81)=37,889,062,373,143,906, Fib(82)=61,305,790,721,611,591, Fib(83)=99,194,853,094,755,497, Fib(84)=160,500,643,816,367,088, Fib(85)=259,695,496,911,122,585, Fib(86)=420,196,140,727,489,673, Fib(87)=679,891,637,638,612,258, Fib(88)=1,100,087,778,366,101,931, Fib(89)=1,779,979,416,004,714,189, Fib(90)=2,880,067,194,370,816,120, Fib(91)=4,660,046,610,375,530,309, Fib(92)=7,540,113,804,746,346,429, Fib(93)=12,200,160,415,121,876,738, Fib(94)=19,740,274,219,868,223,167, Fib(95)=31,940,434,634,990,100, 905, which is over 1e18. \n\nSo the maximum Fib number needed is around Fib(90) which is 2.88e18. So for n up to 1e18, the Fib numbers up to Fib(90) will suffice.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute all the Fib numbers up to the first one that exceeds 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the maximum m such that Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nBut how to compute m?\n\nLet me think: the Fib numbers are stored in a list. For example, the list starts with Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4) = 3, Fib(5) = 5, etc. So for each Fib index i (starting from 2), the value is Fib(i).\n\nSo for each n, we need to find the largest i such that Fib(i) ≤n, and then m = i-2.\n\nBecause m+2 = i => m = i-2.\n\nFor example, for n=3, Fib(4)=3. So i=4, m=4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=10. The Fib numbers up to 13 are 1,2,3,5,8,13. The largest Fib number ≤10 is 8, which is Fib(6). So i=6, m=6-2=4. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the list of Fib numbers starting from Fib(2) =1, Fib(3)=2, etc., until the value exceeds 1e18.\n\nThen, for a given n, find the maximum i where Fib(i) ≤n. Then the answer is i-2.\n\nBut how to find this i efficiently?\n\nWe can precompute the list of Fib numbers, then perform a binary search on the list for the maximum value ≤n.\n\nSo in code:\n\nGenerate a list fibs where fibs[0] = 1 (Fib(2)), fibs[1] = 2 (Fib(3)), fibs[2] = 3 (Fib(4)), etc. Then for each n, find the largest index k where fibs[k] <=n. Then the answer is (k+2) - 2 = k? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the index in the list is k, which corresponds to Fib(2 + k) ?\n\nNo. Let me think:\n\nIf the list is generated as:\n\nfibs = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...]\n\nEach element in the list is Fib(2 + index). For example, index 0 is Fib(2) =1, index 1 is Fib(3)=2, index 2 is Fib(4)=3, etc.\n\nSo, for a given Fib(i) = fibs[i-2].\n\nSo, if during the binary search, we find that the maximum Fib(i) ≤n is Fib(i), then the answer is m = i-2.\n\nBut how to find i?\n\nAlternatively, during the list generation, we can store the Fib numbers in a list, and for each n, perform a binary search to find the largest Fib number <=n. Once found, the index in the list is k, and the corresponding i is (k+2). Then m = i-2 = k.\n\nWait, for example, Fib(4) is 3, which is in the list at index 2 (assuming the list starts with Fib(2) as index 0). So for Fib(4) =3, the index is 2. Then m= i-2 = 4-2=2. Which is equal to the index (2). So yes, the answer is the index of the Fib number in the list.\n\nThus, the answer is the index of the largest Fib number <=n in the list.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nGenerate the list of Fib numbers starting from Fib(2) =1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, etc., until the Fib number exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for input n, find the largest element in the list that is <=n, and return its index (which is m).\n\nBut how to handle cases where n is not exactly a Fib number?\n\nFor example, n=4. The list contains 1,2,3,5,... So the largest element <=4 is 3 (index 2). So the answer is 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, which is Fib(5) =5. The index is 3, so answer is 3. Which would mean m=3. For n=5, the maximum games is 3. Which would be correct.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, generate the list of Fib numbers.\n\nInitialize a list, say fibs = [1, 2]. Then, next term is 3 (1+2), then 5 (2+3), etc. Until the next term exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, perform a binary search on the list to find the largest value <=n. The index of that value is the answer.\n\nBut how to handle the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves leveraging properties of the Fibonacci sequence to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key constraint is that two players can only compete if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one. This constraint leads us to consider the structure of the tournament as a Fibonacci-like sequence, where each subsequent game requires an increasing number of players.\n\n2. **Fibonacci Insight**: The minimum number of players required for a winner to play `m` games follows a Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the number of players needed for `m` games is given by the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number. This insight allows us to precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a value that exceeds the maximum possible input size (10^18).\n\n3. **Binary Search**: For a given number of players `n`, we use binary search on the precomputed Fibonacci sequence to find the largest value that does not exceed `n`. The index of this value gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers starting from Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, etc.\n    fibs = [1, 2]  # corresponds to Fib(2) and Fib(3)\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_fib > 10**18:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_fib)\n    \n    # Now find the largest element in fibs <= n\n    left = 0\n    right = len(fibs) - 1\n    answer = 0\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if fibs[mid] <= n:\n            answer = mid\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    \n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers starting from Fib(2) = 1 and Fib(3) = 2. This sequence continues until the values exceed 10^18, ensuring coverage for all possible inputs.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: For a given input `n`, we perform a binary search on the precomputed Fibonacci list to find the largest value that is less than or equal to `n`. The index of this value directly corresponds to the maximum number of games the winner can play, leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence as derived from the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency even for very large values of `n`, up to 10^18, by leveraging precomputation and binary search, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n) for each query after the initial precomputation.",
