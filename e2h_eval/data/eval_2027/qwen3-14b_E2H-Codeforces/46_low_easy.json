The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest subsegment in a sequence where changing at most one element makes it strictly increasing. Hmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that for problems involving strictly increasing sequences, dynamic programming might be useful. But since we can change one element, maybe we need to track some state about the current subsegment.\n\nLet me think. For each position, maybe I can track two things: the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending here with no changes, and with one change. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as looking for the longest window where there's at most one place where a[i] >= a[i+1]. Because if there's more than one such place, even changing one element won't fix it. Wait, but maybe there's a way to adjust by changing one element. For example, if there's a dip in the sequence, changing one element could bridge it.\n\nBut checking all possible subsegments is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 1e5. So I need an O(n) or O(n log n) approach.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the standard approach for finding the longest strictly increasing subarray. For that, we can track the current length of increasing sequence. But here, we can allow one \"error\" (a place where the next element is not larger than current).\n\nSo perhaps, for each position, we can track two variables:\n\n- The length of the longest subsegment ending at this position with 0 errors (i.e., strictly increasing so far)\n- The length of the longest subsegment ending at this position with 1 error (either the previous part had an error, or this is the first error)\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet's define two arrays:\n\ndp0[i] = length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at i with no changes (so a[i] > a[i-1], and so on)\ndp1[i] = length of the longest subsegment ending at i with exactly one change allowed.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nIf a[i] > a[i-1], then dp0[i] = dp0[i-1] + 1. Otherwise, dp0[i] = 1 (since the current element is not larger than previous, so the subsegment can't be strictly increasing unless we change something, but for dp0, no changes are allowed. So if a[i] is not larger than previous, then the current subsegment would be broken, so dp0[i] is 1? Or maybe 0? Wait, no. The dp0[i] represents the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at i with no changes. So if a[i] is not larger than a[i-1], then the subsegment can't be strictly increasing. So dp0[i] would be 1, because the subsegment consisting of just a[i] is strictly increasing (length 1). But wait, the previous elements might have a longer sequence, but since a[i] breaks the strictly increasing, the current dp0[i] is 1.\n\nWait, for example, if the previous sequence was strictly increasing up to i-1, but a[i] is less than a[i-1], then the current subsegment can't be strictly increasing. So the maximum subsegment ending at i with no changes is 1 (only a[i]).\n\nNow for dp1[i]. How to compute this?\n\nIf the current a[i] > a[i-1], then the previous subsegment with one error can be extended. So dp1[i] = dp1[i-1] + 1. Also, if there was no error before, then we can take dp0[i-1] + 1 (because we can now make a change here, but since a[i] is already larger than previous, maybe that's not necessary. Wait, no. The dp1[i] represents the maximum length of a subsegment ending at i with at most one change. So if the current a[i] is larger than a[i-1], then the existing subsegment ending at i-1 with 0 errors can be extended, and since there's no error, the current subsegment can be extended without using the change. Therefore, the dp1[i] could be dp0[i-1] + 1 (but that's part of the 0 error case). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the definitions.\n\nAlternatively, for dp1[i], it's the maximum length of a subsegment ending at i with at most one change. So how can this be achieved?\n\nCase 1: There was already a change in the previous subsegment. Then, the current element must be larger than the previous. So dp1[i] = dp1[i-1] + 1.\n\nCase 2: There was no change before, but we can make a change here. For example, if a[i",
