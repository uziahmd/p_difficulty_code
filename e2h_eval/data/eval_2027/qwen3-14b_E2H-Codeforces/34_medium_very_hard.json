And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I need to compute the average sleep time. Then, I have to output the average of all those averages. Oh right, but the way the problem is structured, maybe there's a smarter way than calculating each week's sum individually, especially since n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So brute force would be O(n*k), which would be 2e5 * 2e5 = 4e10 operations. That's way too slow. So I need an efficient approach.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the sliding window technique. Because each consecutive week overlaps with the previous one by k-1 days. So if I can compute the sum of the first week, then for the next week, subtract the first day's value and add the next day's value. That way, each step takes O(1) time, leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nYes. So the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the first k elements. This is the sum for the first week.\n2. Then, for each subsequent week, subtract the element that's leaving the window (the leftmost element of the previous window) and add the new element (the next element in the array). So each new sum is previous_sum - a[i] + a[i + k], where i starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time.\n3. Once I have all the sums for each week, I need to compute the average of each week (sum / k) and then take the average of all those averages.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the answer is the average of all the weekly averages. But since each weekly average is (sum of k elements)/k, the overall average would be (sum of all weekly sums) / (number of weeks * k). Wait, because each weekly average is sum_week / k. So the average of all those averages is (sum_week_1/k + sum_week_2/k + ... + sum_week_m/k)/m, where m is the number of weeks. Which is equal to (sum of all sum_weeks) / (m * k). But m is (n - k + 1). \n\nSo instead of calculating each average and then averaging them, I can just calculate the total sum of all the weekly sums and divide by (number of weeks * k). Which is the same as the average of the averages.\n\nBut how do I compute the total sum of all the weekly sums?\n\nWell, the first sum is sum of a[0..k-1], then next is sum of a[1..k], etc. So the total sum of all the weekly sums is the sum of all these individual sums. Let's think about how to compute that efficiently.\n\nThe sliding window approach allows me to compute each weekly sum in O(1) time. So for each of the m weeks, I can compute their sum and add them all together. Then divide by (m * k) to get the final average.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute initial sum for the first window.\n- Add it to total_sum.\n- Then for each next window, subtract the outgoing element and add the incoming element, then add to total_sum.\n- Once all are processed, divide total_sum by (m * k) to get the average.\n\nYes. So this approach would be O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read the array of a's.\n\nThen, compute the initial sum. For example, if n=3, k=2, the first sum is 3+4=7, then next sum is 4+7=11. The total sum is 7 + 11 = 18. Then m is 2. The average is 18/(2*2) = 4.5. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the output is 9.000... Wait wait, no, wait the example input was:\n\nIn the first example input, the input is 3 2 and [3,4,7]. The output is 9.000... Wait, but according to the note, the result is ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 ?\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the output is the average of all the weeks. For the first example, there are two weeks. The first week is days 1 and 2 (sum 7, average 3.5), second week is days 2 and 3 (sum 11, average 5.5). The average of those two averages is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But according to the sample output, the output is 9.000... Wait, that's conflicting. Wait wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the sample input given is:\n\nIn the first example input, the input is '3 2\\n3 4 7', and the output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nWait that's impossible. Wait what's the correct answer here? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nAh! Oh wait, the problem says that the answer is the average of all weeks. But perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait the first example's note says that the result is (sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks). Wait no, the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Wait the note says that the third example's answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Wait, but the problem says that the average of all weeks is the sum of the averages of each week divided by the number of weeks. But the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement. The problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the example is not given, but the note says that the first example's output is 9.000... Let me think again. Wait the first example input is 3 2 and [3,4,7]. How many weeks are there? n - k + 1 = 3-2+1=2 weeks. The first week is days 1 and 2 (sum 3+4=7), average is 3.5. Second week is days 2 and 3 (sum 4+7=11), average is 5.5. The average of these two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output says 9.0000000000. So this suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait this indicates that there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nPolycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n -k +1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is ... (the example is not given, but the sample input shows that for this case the output is 9.000000...).\n\nWait perhaps the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the sum of all the averages divided by the number of weeks? No, that would be the same as the average of the averages. But in the first sample input, the output is 9.000... So how can that be?\n\nWait maybe the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the sum of all the weeks' total hours divided by the number of weeks. But that would be the average of the weekly totals. For example, in the first sample, the sum of the two weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 weeks gives 9. Which matches the sample output. Oh! Oh right! So the problem says that Polycarp is going to calculate the average sleep time over all weeks. But what's the average? For each week, the average is sum of the week divided by k. Then, the average of all those averages is the total of all the weekly averages divided by the number of weeks. However, the sample shows that the answer is 9.0, which is the average of the weekly sums divided by k. So perhaps the problem is actually to compute the average of the weekly sums divided by k. Which is the same as the average of the weekly averages. But why in the first example, the average of the weekly averages is 9?\n\nWait in the first example, the two weekly averages are 3.5 and 5.5. Their average is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"You should write a program which will calculate average sleeping time of Polycarp over all weeks.\"\n\nSo what is the average? For example, the first example says the output is 9.0. Let me think: the first example has two weeks. The first week's average is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second week's average is (4+7)/2 = 5.5. The average of these two averages is (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. So that can't be. Therefore, there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the sample input and output:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nInput: 3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput: 9.0000000000\n\nBut according to the note, the output is the sum of all weeks divided by 7 (in the third example). Wait no, the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So perhaps the problem is not to take the average of the averages, but to take the sum of the weekly sums divided by the number of weeks multiplied by k? Or maybe the problem is to compute the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages.\n\nWait let's think. Let's suppose that the problem requires to compute the average of the weekly sums. For example, the first example's two weeks have sums 7 and 11. The average is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which matches the sample output. Oh! That's the key. So the problem is not to take the average of the averages, but the average of the weekly sums. But why does the problem say \"average sleep time per week\"?\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the problem says that the result is the average sleep time over all weeks. But the example's output is 9.0. Which would be the average of the weekly sums. But that would be the average of the total hours per week, not the average per week. But that seems contradictory.\n\nWait let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\nThe doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). So Polycarp is considering each week (k consecutive days) and calculating the average per week. Then, he wants to find the average of those averages. But according to the sample input, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the average of the total hours per week, not the average per week. For example, if the sample input has two weeks, each of which has a total of 7 and 11 hours, then the average is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which is the sample output. But that would be the average of the total hours per week. But the problem says \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\".\n\nSo this is a contradiction. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's note:\n\n\"In the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nWait the third example's input is 8 2, and the array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. The output is 28964.2857142857. Let's compute that.\n\nNumber of weeks is 8-2+1 =7. The sum of all weeks is:\n\nEach week is two days. The weeks are:\n\n[1,2] sum 3\n\n[2,4] sum 6\n\n[4,100000] sum 100004\n\n[100000, 123] sum 100123\n\n[123,456] sum 579\n\n[456, 789] sum 1245\n\n[789, 1] sum 790\n\nTotal sum is 3 +6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = let's compute that.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n+100004 = 100013\n\n+100123 = 200136\n\n+579 = 200715\n\n+1245 = 201960\n\n+790 = 202750.\n\nThen the average is 202750 / 7 = let's compute that. 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... which matches the sample output. So the sample output is the sum of the weekly sums divided by the number of weeks. Which suggests that the problem is to compute the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the weekly averages. But why does the problem say \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\"?\n\nThis is confusing. But according to the sample, the answer is the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages. So the problem's wording may be misleading. Let's re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nBut the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which implies that the answer is the average of the weekly sums. So the problem is to compute the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the weekly averages. So why does the problem say \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\"?\n\nThat's unclear. But according to the sample, the answer is the average of the weekly sums. So the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which would be the same as the average of the weekly averages multiplied by k. Because the average of the weekly averages is (sum of weekly sums / k) / m, where m is the number of weeks. So the average of the weekly sums is (sum of weekly sums) / m. So the sample output is (sum of weekly sums) / m.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to compute the average of the weekly sums. Which is the same as the average of the weekly averages multiplied by k. But the problem says \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\", which would be the average of the weekly averages. However, the sample contradicts that. Hence, the problem must be to compute the average of the weekly sums.\n\nBut that's very confusing. Let me look back at the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample input, the output is 9.000000... which is the average of the weekly sums. The sum of the two weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 weeks, gives 9. Which matches the sample. So that's correct.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the weekly averages. So the problem statement's wording is misleading. But according to the samples, that's the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute the sum of all weekly sums, then divide by the number of weeks (m = n -k +1). So that's the answer.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCalculate the sum of all the weekly sums, then divide by m (the number of weeks). Which is the same as the average of the weekly sums.\n\nSo the code needs to calculate the total sum of all the weekly sums, then divide by (n -k +1).\n\nSo the initial approach of using sliding window to calculate the sum of each week's sum, and adding them all up, then dividing by m is correct.\n\nSo for the first example, that's 18 / 2 =9. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the third example, the sum is 202750 divided by 7, which gives the sample output.\n\nSo that's the correct approach.\n\nSo now, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and k, then the array a.\n\nCompute the initial window sum (sum of first k elements).\n\nThen, for each next window, subtract a[i] and add a[i +k], then accumulate the sum.\n\nOnce all the sums are added, divide by the number of weeks (m = n -k +1).\n\nNow, the code can be implemented efficiently.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nIn Python, for large n (up to 2e5), we need to read the input efficiently.\n\nBut for the sum, we can use a sliding window approach.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\ntotal_weekly_sum = initial_sum\n\nThen, for i in range(1, m):\n\n   current_sum = previous_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\n   add current_sum to total_weekly_sum.\n\nBut wait, the number of weeks is m = n -k +1. So the first window is from index 0 to k-1. The next is 1 to k, etc. So for each of the m weeks, we need to compute the sum.\n\nBut the initial sum is the first week's sum. Then, for each of the next (m-1) weeks, we can compute the sum by subtracting the outgoing element and adding the incoming element.\n\nSo the loop runs from 1 to (m-1) times. So the code would be:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\nThen, the average is total / m.\n\nBut for m = n -k +1.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is O(n) time.\n\nNow, in Python, the initial sum can be computed with sum(a[0:k]).\n\nBut for large k, this could take O(k) time, but since the total time is O(n), it's acceptable.\n\nBut for n=2e5, and k=2e5, then sum(a[0:k]) is O(n), and the rest of the loop is O(n -k) steps, which is O(n) total. So overall O(n) time.\n\nSo that's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, reading the input as a list of integers is manageable.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nNow, the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\ninitial sum is 3+4=7.\n\nm = 3-2+1 = 2.\n\nloop runs once (i=1 to 1):\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[1+2-1] = a[2] (7). So 7-3+7= 11. total becomes 7 +11 =18. average is 18 /2 =9. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 1 1, [10]. m = 1. sum is 10. average 10/1=10. Correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\narray is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nm = 8-2+1=7.\n\ninitial sum is 1+2=3. Then for each of the next 6 steps:\n\ni=1: subtract a[0] (1) and add a[1+2-1] = a[2] (4). sum is 3-1+4=6. total is 3+6=9.\n\ni=2: subtract a[1] (2) and add a[3] (100000). sum is 6-2+100000=100004. total is 9+100004 = 100013.\n\ni=3: subtract a[2] (4) and add a[4] (123). sum is 100004-4+123 = 100123. total becomes 100013 + 100123 = 200136.\n\ni=4: subtract a[3] (100000) and add a[5] (456). sum is 100123 - 100000 +456 = 579. total is 200136 +579 = 200715.\n\ni=5: subtract a[4] (123) and add a[6] (789). sum is 579-123+789 = 1245. total is 200715 + 1245 = 201960.\n\ni=6: subtract a[5] (456) and add a[7] (1). sum is 1245 -456 +1 = 790. total is 201960 +790 = 202750.\n\nThen average is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for handling large numbers, but in Python it's okay.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead the input. However, the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich seems to be three test cases. But the original problem says that the input is read from stdin. So the code must read multiple test cases? Or is that part of the example?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user provided some sample inputs and outputs, but the actual problem says that the input is read from stdin. So the code must process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But that's probably a mistake in the way the user presented the sample input. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nSo the code should read one test case per run. However, the sample input provided by the user seems to have multiple test cases. But perhaps the user is showing multiple examples. However, the code should read from stdin, which for programming competition problems usually has one test case per run. So the code should read n and k from the first line, then the array from the second line.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first sample input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nand output is 9.0000000000.\n\nThe second sample input is 1 1 followed by 10, output is 10.0...\n\nThird sample input is 8 2 followed by the array, output as given.\n\nSo the code must process a single test case. However, in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases. But that's probably for illustrating different cases. So the code must process one test case.\n\nThus, the code will read two lines from stdin: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nBut in some cases, perhaps the input may have multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the code should process one test case. So the code should read the first line as n and k, then the second line as the array.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, the user shows three test cases, but that's perhaps a formatting error. For example, the sample input may have been presented as three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one.\n\nSo assuming that the code should process one test case, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the first line as n and k.\n\nRead the second line as list of integers.\n\nCompute the sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen, for the sliding window.\n\nBut in Python, when reading from stdin, the code can read via input().split().\n\nBut for large inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for code submission, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen compute the initial sum.\n\nBut for cases where the input may have multiple lines, but the code reads two lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nOnce the initial sum is computed, then:\n\nm = n -k +1\n\nif m ==0: but since k <=n, m is >=1.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / m\n\nThen, print the average with sufficient decimal digits.\n\nBut how to format the output? The problem says that the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error is <= 1e-6. So outputting with at least 6 decimal digits.\n\nIn Python, printing with 10 decimal digits, as in the sample outputs.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the code can format the output as a float with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to avoid floating point inaccuracies?\n\nBut since the sum is integer, and m is integer, the average can be a float. However, division in Python is done with /, which returns a float.\n\nSo code:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut for example, in the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857. Let's compute 202750 /7 = ?\n\nLet me compute 202750 divided by 7:\n\n7 * 28964 = 202748. 202750 - 202748 = 2. So 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nSo the code would output that with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to ensure that Python prints the required decimal digits, even if trailing zeros?\n\nUsing the format string as above.\n\nBut in Python, when you use the format string with .10f, it will show 10 decimal digits, padding with zeros if needed.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut for the case when k = n. Then m = 1. The code will compute sum(a) and divide by 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, k=1. The sum is a[0], divided by 1. Correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the initial sum, when k is large, say 2e5, then a[:k] is a slice of 2e5 elements. sum of that is O(k) time. But for the code, that's acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for large lists, slicing is O(k) time, but that's unavoidable.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    m = n - k + 1\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total = current_sum\n    for i in range(1, m):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n        total += current_sum\n    average = total / m\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the loop, the i ranges from 1 to m-1, because range(1, m) is from 1 to m-1 inclusive. Because for m weeks, the first week is handled, and then m-1 more weeks. So yes, the loop runs m-1 times.\n\nTesting this code on the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7]\n\nm = 3-2+1 = 2.\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4 =7.\n\ntotal is 7.\n\nloop runs for i in 1 to 1 (since m is 2, range(1,2) is [1]).\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[1+2-1] = a[2] (7) → 7-3+7=11.\n\ntotal becomes 7+11=18.\n\naverage is 18/2=9.0 → printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSample 2: 1 1, a = [10]. m=1. loop runs 0 times. total is 10. average is 10.0 → printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nAs discussed earlier, code produces correct result.\n\nBut in Python, the code may have issues with very large numbers, but since Python handles big integers, it's okay.\n\nBut for the case where the sum is very large, but division is handled as floating point.\n\nBut for the problem constraints, the sum can be up to (2e5) * (1e5) = 2e10 per week. Multiply by m (up to 2e5) gives 4e15, which is within the range of Python's floats (which are double-precision, 64-bit). However, when dividing by m, the average can be up to 2e10, which is within the precision of double-precision floats. However, when the average is something like 28964.2857142857, the code needs to print enough decimal digits. Using the format string with 10 decimals ensures that.\n\nBut why in the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 decimal digits. Let's check:\n\nThe exact value is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857142857..., so when printed with 10 decimals, it's 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut in Python, when you format with .10f, it rounds the number to 10 decimal places. Let's check:\n\nLet me compute 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857142857...\n\nSo the exact value is 28964.285714285714..., so the first 10 decimals are 2857142857. So the formatted string would be 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut in Python, when you do print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(202750/7)), what is the output?\n\nLet me compute 202750 /7 in Python.\n\nWell, 202750 divided by 7 is 28964.285714285714...\n\nSo when printed with 10 decimals, it would be 28964.2857142857. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. So for example, in the first sample input, the code would read the first line as '3 2', then the second line as '3 4 7'.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code is written. Now, considering possible edge cases:\n\nCase when k=1. Then each week is one day, and the average is the average of all the days. Because the sum of all weeks is sum of all a[i], and m =n -1 +1 =n. So average is (sum(a))/n. Which is the same as the average of the array. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=2. m=1. The average is sum(a)/1 = sum(a).\n\nAnother case: n=4, k=2. a = [1,2,3,4]. m=3. The weeks are [1,2] sum 3, [2,3] sum 5, [3,4] sum 7. total is 3+5+7=15. average is 15/3=5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as k consecutive days from a given list of sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of each week's sleep time using a sliding window technique to ensure optimal performance.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This technique allows us to compute the sum of each consecutive week in constant time after the initial computation of the first week's sum. By sliding the window one day at a time, we adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the first week's sleep times. For subsequent weeks, adjust the sum using the sliding window technique.\n3. **Average Calculation**: Sum all the weekly sums and divide by the number of weeks to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    m = n - k + 1\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total = current_sum\n    for i in range(1, m):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n        total += current_sum\n    average = total / m\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (number of days in a week). The second line contains the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first `k` days to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: For each subsequent week, adjust the sum by subtracting the day that is no longer in the window and adding the new day that enters the window. This adjustment ensures each sum calculation is done in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum and Average Calculation**: Accumulate the sum of all weekly sums and then compute the average by dividing this total by the number of weeks. The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution runs efficiently in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 days.",
