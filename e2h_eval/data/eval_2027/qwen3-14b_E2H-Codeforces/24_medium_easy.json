She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. Let's think about how she can do this optimally.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: there are n tabs, and the mouse is at position pos. The goal is to have only tabs from l to r open. So any tabs outside that range need to be closed. But how?\n\nEach second, she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. Closing tabs to the left or right requires being at a certain position. For example, if she wants to close all tabs to the left, she must be at the first tab (or maybe not? Wait, no. Wait, the description says that when she closes tabs to the left, it's all tabs from a to i-1, where a is the current minimum index of unclosed tabs. So when she closes tabs to the left, she can do that from any position, but that action would close all tabs to the left of her current position. But after closing, the a and b values change. However, since we need to close all tabs outside [l, r], perhaps the optimal way is to close the left and right parts in one or two steps.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. Let's consider the required segment [l, r]. The tabs that need to be closed are those less than l and those greater than r. So, the problem reduces to closing the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r).\n\nBut how to do that efficiently. Let's think about the steps:\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, maybe she can close the left and right parts. But how?\n\nWait, for example, if she needs to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. Suppose she is at position pos which is inside [l, r]. Then, she can first close all tabs to the left (but only those that are not in [l, r]). Wait, no. Because when she closes tabs to the left of her current position, that would close all tabs from a (current min) up to i-1. But if the current a is 1, and she's at position l, then closing left would close tabs from 1 to l-1, which is exactly what we want. Similarly, if she is at position r, closing right would close all tabs from r+1 to current b (which is n). So, perhaps the optimal way is to first close the left part (if needed) and then the right part, or vice versa.\n\nBut how to get to the correct positions to perform these operations.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFirst, determine whether the left part (tabs < l) needs to be closed. That's if l > 1. Similarly for the right part (tabs > r), if r < n.\n\nSo, for example, if l=2 and r=4, and n=6, then the left part is tabs 1, and the right part is 5,6.\n\nNow, to close the left part, she needs to be at position l (so that closing left would close all tabs from a (which is 1) to l-1 (which is 1)). Similarly, to close the right part, she needs to be at position r, so that closing right closes all from r+1 to b (which is n).\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close the left part by moving to some position and then closing, but perhaps the optimal way is to move to l, then close left. Or maybe she can close left from a position to the right of l, but that would require moving to the left first.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose the current position is pos. Let's say she wants to close the left part (tabs < l). How can she do that?\n\nShe needs to be at position l, and then close all tabs to the left. Because if she's at position l, then closing left would close [a, i-1] = [1, l-1], which is exactly what we need. Alternatively, if she's at position l-1, then closing left would close [a, l-2], which isn't enough. So to close the entire left part, she must be at l, and then close left.\n\nSimilarly, to close the right part, she must be at position r, then close right.\n\nSo the steps for closing left and right are:\n\nIf left part exists (l>1):\n\n- Move to l (from current pos, which may be inside or outside [l, r]?)\n\nWait, the initial position is pos. But after closing some tabs, the a and b change. But during the process, we need to find the minimal steps.\n\nBut maybe the problem can be considered as follows: the minimal steps required to reach the positions to perform the necessary closing operations, plus the time for the closing operations.\n\nBut since each closing operation takes 1 second, and moving takes 1 per step.\n\nSo for example, if she needs to close left and right:\n\nTime = (time to move to l) + 1 (close left) + (time to move to r) + 1 (close right). But perhaps there's a better way. Also, maybe she can close left and right in a different order, but perhaps the movement steps are same.\n\nWait, but if she is already in the [l, r] range, then moving to l and then to r would take (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r). But if she can move directly to r first, then to l, maybe that's better. But perhaps the minimal steps would be to move to the leftmost point (l) and then to the rightmost (r) or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close left and right in one step if she is in the right position. But that depends on the initial position.\n\nBut let's think of all possibilities.\n\nFirst, check whether the current position is already in the [l, r] range. If not, then she needs to move into it. For example, if pos is less than l, then she needs to move to l. Or if pos is greater than r, then move to r. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut let's think of the four possible cases:\n\nCase 1: The current pos is inside [l, r]. Then, she can perform the closing steps.\n\nCase 2: pos is to the left of l. So she needs to move to l (but maybe she can close the left part first, but since the left part is already closed? No, because the left part is tabs < l, which are not in the desired range. So if pos is to the left of l, then she needs to move to l, then close left (which would close all tabs to the left of l, which includes the current position. Wait, but when she closes left, that would close all tabs from a (current a) to i-1, where i is her current position. So if she is at l, then closing left would close from a to l-1. But if she is at l, then the a is 1, so that's correct.\n\nBut if she is at pos which is left of l, then to close the left part, she can move to l, then close left. But in that case, the movement steps would be (l - pos) steps to move to l, then 1 second to close left. But also, if she's in the left of l, perhaps she can close all tabs to the right? No, because that would close tabs from i+1 to b. But if she is at pos, which is left of l, then closing right would close all tabs from pos+1 to b. Which would include l and r, which are needed. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo she can't close right from pos if pos is left of l. So the only way is to move to l and close left, then move to r and close right.\n\nSo, for the case where pos is left of l:\n\nTime steps would be:\n\nMove from pos to l: (l - pos) steps.\n\nThen close left: 1 sec.\n\nThen move from l to r: (r - l) steps.\n\nThen close right: 1 sec.\n\nTotal: (l - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (r - pos + 2) ?\n\nWait, (l - pos) + (r - l) = r - pos. Then +2 gives r - pos + 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, maybe after closing left, the a and b changes. But once she closes left, the a becomes l, and the b remains n. So when moving from l to r, the movement is possible.\n\nBut perhaps there's another approach. For example, if she can close the left and right in a different order. But I think the steps are same.\n\nAlternatively, suppose she moves to l, closes left (takes 1 sec), then moves to r (steps r - l), then closes right (another 1 sec). Total steps: (l - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (r - pos) + 2.\n\nBut maybe she can close right first? Well, if she's at pos (left of l), she can't close right (since that would close tabs from pos+1 to b, which includes l, which is needed. So that's not allowed. Therefore, she must first close the left part, then the right part.\n\nSo for pos < l, the steps are (l - pos) steps to move to l, then 1 to close left, then (r - l) steps to move to r, then 1 to close right. Total of (l - pos) + (r - l) + 2 = (r - pos) + 2.\n\nBut wait, let's check with the first example in the input.\n\nFirst input example: 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So the initial position is already in [l, r]. So what's the steps?\n\nIn the example, the answer is 5. Let's see:\n\nThe steps given are: move to 2 (from 3: 1 step), close left (1 sec). Then move to 3 (1 step?), then to 4 (another step?), then close right (1 sec). So total steps: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move from 2 to 4) + 1 (close right) = 5 steps. Which matches the example.\n\nBut according to the formula I thought earlier, when the pos is inside [l, r], then what?\n\nLet me think. When pos is inside [l, r], then the steps needed to close left and right would be:\n\nIf the left part needs to be closed (l > 1), then she needs to move to l, close left. Then move to r, close right.\n\nBut how long does that take?\n\nSuppose pos is in [l, r]. Then:\n\nTo close the left part, she needs to move to l. The distance is |pos - l| steps. Then 1 sec to close left. Then move to r (distance |r - l| steps). Then 1 sec to close right. Total: |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut if she can do it in a better way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close the left part by moving to l, then close left. Then, from l, move to r (r - l steps). Then close right. So total steps is (pos to l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\nBut in the example, pos is 3, l is 2, r is 4. So pos to l is 1 step. Then 1, then (4-2)=2 steps, then 1. Total 1+1+2+1=5 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother scenario: if pos is already at l. Then moving to l is zero steps. Then close left (1 sec). Then move to r (r - l steps) and close right (1 sec). Total is 0 + 1 + (r-l) + 1 = r - l + 2.\n\nSimilarly, if pos is already at r, then to close the left part, she has to move to l (distance r - l steps), then 1 sec, then move to r (0 steps?), then close right. So total (r - l) + 1 + 0 + 1 = r - l + 2.\n\nBut what if she can close both left and right in one step? Like, if she is at l, then close left (closing all tabs to the left of l), and then close right (all tabs to the right of r). But how can she close right? She has to be at r. So she can't close right from l. So she has to move to r.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nBut what about if she can close left and right in a different order? For example, if she can first close right, then close left. But that would require moving to r first, then closing right, then moving to l, then closing left. But in that case, the steps would be |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1. Which could be better or worse depending on pos.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal steps is the minimum between the two options: closing left first then right, or right first then left.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, if pos is inside [l, r], then:\n\nOption 1: move to l, close left, move to r, close right.\n\nTime: (pos to l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (pos - l) steps (if pos >= l) or (l - pos) steps if pos < l. But since pos is inside [l, r], pos is between l and r. So the movement to l is (pos - l) steps if pos is to the right of l, or (l - pos) steps if pos is to the left of l.\n\nWait, but in the case where pos is inside [l, r], then the movement to l is |pos - l| steps, then movement to r is |r - l| steps (since from l to r is r - l steps). So the total steps for option 1 is |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - l| + r - l + 2.\n\nOption 2: move to r, close right, then move to l, close left. Time is |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - r| + r - l + 2.\n\nWhich option is better depends on the value of |pos - l| vs |pos - r|. For example, if pos is closer to l, then option 1 is better. If closer to r, then option 2 is better.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if she can close both left and right in a single movement. But I don't think that's possible unless she's at l and r at the same time, which is only possible if l=r.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for the case when pos is inside [l, r] is min( |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2, |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 ). But since (r - l) is fixed, the difference is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|.\n\nBut the minimal of the two is (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r| )) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut wait, what if l = r? Then, r - l is 0. And we need to close nothing. So in that case, the answer is 0 steps.\n\nSo, let's think of all possible cases.\n\nFirst, check if the current [l, r] is already the entire range. Like, if l=1 and r=n. Then no steps needed. So output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, check if l > 1 or r < n. So, need to close left and/or right.\n\nBut let's think of all possibilities:\n\nCase A: l == 1 and r == n. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase B: l == 1, r < n. Need to close right part.\n\nCase C: l > 1, r == n. Need to close left part.\n\nCase D: l > 1 and r < n. Need to close left and right parts.\n\nSo, for each of these cases, compute the steps.\n\nLet me think about how to compute for each case.\n\nLet me think of the general steps:\n\nIf the current pos is in [l, r], then:\n\nIf we need to close left and right parts (case D), then the steps are as discussed.\n\nIf only need to close left (case C), then steps are movement to l (from pos) + 1 second to close left.\n\nIf only need to close right (case B), steps are movement to r (from pos) + 1 second to close right.\n\nBut what if pos is not in [l, r]?\n\nFor example, pos is to the left of l (case where l > 1). Then, she needs to move to l, close left, then move to r, close right. But if she's already to the left of l, then moving to l is (l - pos) steps. Then close left (1 sec). Then, from l, move to r (r - l steps), then close right (1 sec). Total steps: (l - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (r - pos) + 2.\n\nSimilarly, if pos is to the right of r (r < n). Then, she needs to move to r (steps pos - r), close right (1 sec), then move to l (steps r - l), close left (1 sec). Total steps: (pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (pos - l) + 2.\n\nBut what if she can close left and right in a different order?\n\nFor example, if she is to the right of r, then she can move to r, close right (1 sec), then move to l, close left (1 sec). Or, move to l first, then close left, then move to r and close right. But moving to l from pos (which is to the right of r) would take (pos - l) steps. Then close left (1 sec). Then move to r (r - l steps) and close right (1 sec). Total steps: (pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = pos - l + r - l + 2 = (pos - l) + (r - l) + 2. Which is more than the previous option (pos - r + r - l + 2 = pos - l + 2). So the first option (moving to r first) is better.\n\nThus, in this case, the steps are (pos - r) + (r - l) + 2 = pos - l + 2.\n\nWait, no. The steps are (pos - r) steps to move to r, then 1 sec to close right, then (r - l) steps to move to l, then 1 sec to close left. So total steps: (pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (pos - r + r - l) + 2 = pos - l + 2.\n\nWhich is better than moving to l first.\n\nSo, for pos outside [l, r], the steps depend on which side.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the steps can be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, check if the current [l, r] is already the entire range. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check whether l is 1 and r is n. Well, that's covered by the first case.\n\nNow, let's determine whether left part (tabs < l) needs to be closed. That is, if l > 1. Similarly, whether right part (tabs > r) needs to be closed, if r < n.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\nneed_left = (l > 1)\nneed_right = (r < n)\n\nIf need_left and need_right:\n\nThen, the steps depend on where pos is.\n\nIf pos is in [l, r]:\n\nsteps = min( (distance to l) + (r - l) + 2, (distance to r) + (r - l) + 2 )\n\nBut since (r - l) is fixed, this is equivalent to min( distance to l, distance to r ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut since distance to l is |pos - l|, and distance to r is |pos - r|.\n\nAlternatively, since in this case, the steps are (steps to reach l, then steps to reach r from l) + 2 (for the two close operations). So steps_to_l = |pos - l|, steps_from_l_to_r = r - l. So total steps for this path is steps_to_l + steps_from_l_to_r + 2.\n\nSame for steps_to_r + steps_from_r_to_l + 2, where steps_from_r_to_l is r - l (since from r to l is r - l steps? No, from r to l is (r - l) steps if moving left. Wait, if you are at r, and you need to move to l, then the steps are r - l steps (since each step moves left by 1). So steps_from_r_to_l is r - l.\n\nSo steps for the alternative path is steps_to_r + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo the minimal between the two.\n\nBut since steps_to_l is |pos - l| and steps_to_r is |pos - r|, then the minimal is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if pos is already at l, then steps_to_l is 0. Then steps_to_r is r - l steps. So total steps is 0 + (r - l) + 2 = (r - l + 2). Which is the same as (r - l) + 2.\n\nIf pos is already at r, then steps_to_r is 0. steps_to_l is r - l steps. So again same total.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nIf pos is outside [l, r], then:\n\nIf pos < l:\n\nThen steps = (l - pos) + 1 (close left) + (r - l) + 1 (close right) = (l - pos) + (r - l) + 2 = r - pos + 2.\n\nIf pos > r:\n\nsteps = (pos - r) + 1 (close right) + (r - l) + 1 (close left) = (pos - r) + (r - l) + 2 = pos - l + 2.\n\nBut what if pos is in [l, r], but need to close only left or only right?\n\nLike, if need_left is true but need_right is false (i.e., r = n). Then, the steps would be steps to move to l, close left. But since need_right is false, no need to close right. So steps are steps_to_l + 1.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nSo, in general, the code can be structured as:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    need_left = l > 1\n    need_right = r < n\n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n        if pos is in [l, r]:\n            steps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n        elif pos < l:\n            steps = (l - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (r - pos + 2)\n        elif pos > r:\n            steps = (pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (pos - l + 2)\n    elif need_left and not need_right:\n        # need to close left only. So need to move to l, close left.\n        # but if pos is already in [l, r], then steps to move to l is |pos - l|\n        # then 1 sec to close left.\n        # but if pos is already to the left of l, then steps to move to l is (l - pos), then close left.\n        # but if pos is already in [l, r], then steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n        # if pos is to the right of r (but need_right is false, so r = n. So pos is to the right of r, but r is n, which is impossible. So pos is in [l, r] or pos < l.\n        # So, need to handle pos < l and pos in [l, r].\n        if pos < l:\n            steps = (l - pos) + 1\n        else:\n            steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif not need_left and need_right:\n        # need to close right only. So move to r, close right.\n        if pos > r:\n            steps = (pos - r) + 1\n        else:\n            steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        # neither need left nor right. But this case is handled by the first condition (l == 1 and r ==n)\n        pass\n\nBut how to handle the case where need_left and need_right is false? That's only when l=1 and r=n. Which is handled first.\n\nBut let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → Output: 5.\n\nIn this case, l=2, r=4. So need_left (2>1) and need_right (4<6). So need both.\n\npos is 3, which is in [2,4].\n\nsteps = min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 ) + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 6 3 1 3 → Output: 1.\n\nHere, l=1, r=3. So need_left is false (l=1), need_right is true (r=3 <6). So need to close right.\n\npos is 3, which is in [1,3]. So steps is |pos - r| (3-3=0) + 1 → 0 +1=1. Which is correct.\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput: 5 2 1 5 → Output 0. Because l=1 and r=5. So handled by first condition.\n\nAnother test case: when pos is outside [l, r]. For example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So need_left (2>1) and need_right (3 <5). So steps:\n\npos < l. So steps is r - pos + 2 = 3 - 1 +2 =4? Let's see.\n\nSteps: move to l (2-1=1 step). Close left (1 sec). Then move to r (3-2=1 step). Close right (1 sec). Total 1+1+1+1=4 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: pos=6, l=2, r=4, n=6. So need_left and need_right. pos is > r. So steps is pos - l + 2 → 6-2 +2=6 steps. Let's see:\n\nMove to r (4) from 6: 6-4=2 steps. Close right (1). Then move to l (2) from 4: 2 steps. Close left (1). Total 2+1+2+1=6 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother example: when need to close only left. For example, n=5, l=2, r=5. So need_left (2>1), need_right (r=5 is n, so no). So steps: if pos is 3 (in [2,5]), steps is |3-2| +1 = 1+1=2 steps. So move to l (2) and close left.\n\nAnother example: pos is 1 (outside [2,5]). Steps: (2-1) +1 = 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code logic seems to hold.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe need to read n, pos, l, r.\n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute need_left = (l > 1), need_right = (r < n).\n\nThen, based on need_left and need_right:\n\nCase 1: both need_left and need_right.\n\nCheck if pos is in [l, r].\n\nIf yes:\n\nsteps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nElse if pos < l:\n\nsteps = (r - pos) + 2.\n\nElse (pos > r):\n\nsteps = (pos - l) + 2.\n\nCase 2: only need_left.\n\nsteps is:\n\nif pos is in [l, r] (since need_right is false, so r = n):\n\nthen steps is abs(pos - l) + 1.\n\nelse (pos < l):\n\nsteps is (l - pos) + 1.\n\nCase 3: only need_right.\n\nsteps is:\n\nif pos is in [l, r] (since need_left is false, l=1):\n\nsteps is abs(pos - r) + 1.\n\nelse (pos > r):\n\nsteps is (pos - r) + 1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    need_left = l > 1\n\n    need_right = r < n\n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n\n        if l <= pos <= r:\n\n            # inside\n\n            min_dist = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))\n\n            steps = min_dist + (r - l) + 2\n\n        elif pos < l:\n\n            steps = (r - pos) + 2\n\n        else: # pos > r\n\n            steps = (pos - l) + 2\n\n    elif need_left:\n\n        # need to close left only\n\n        if pos >= l and pos <= r:\n\n            steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # pos < l\n\n            steps = (l - pos) + 1\n\n    else: # need_right\n\n        if pos >= l and pos <= r:\n\n            steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # pos > r\n\n            steps = (pos - r) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what about when need_left is true and need_right is false, but pos is not in [l, r]?\n\nLike, if l=2, r=5 (n=5), and pos is 6. But since r=5 is n, pos can't be 6. Because n is 5. So the input constraints are 1 ≤ pos ≤ n. So in the code, pos is always between 1 and n.\n\nSo for the case where need_right is false (r = n), pos can't be > r. So in that case, when need_left is true and need_right is false, the pos is either in [l, r] (which is [l, n]) or pos < l.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSimilarly for the other cases.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. l !=1 and r !=6. So need_left and need_right. pos is in [2,4]. min_dist is min(1, 1) → 1. steps = 1 + (4-2) + 2 = 1+2+2=5 → correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So l=1, r=3. Since r < 6, need_right is true. need_left is false. So code goes into 'need_right' case. Check if pos is in [l, r]. Yes. steps is abs(3-3) + 1 → 0 +1=1 → correct.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5. So l=1, r=5. So first condition is true. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input is 5 2 1 5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input is 5 5 1 5 → output 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So need_left and need_right. pos < l. steps = r - pos +2 = 4 -1 +2 =5. Let's see:\n\nmove to l (2) → 1 step. close left (1 sec). move to r (4) → 2 steps. close right (1 sec). total 1+1+2+1=5 → correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. need_left and need_right. pos is > r. steps is (5 - 2) + 2 → 3+2=5. Let's see:\n\nmove to r (3) → 5-3=2 steps. close right (1 sec). then move to l (2) → 3-2=1 step. close left (1 sec). total 2+1+1+1=5 → correct.\n\nAnother case: when need_left and need_right, pos is inside [l, r], but closer to r. For example, l=2, r=4, pos=4. min_dist is min(4-2=2, 0) → 0. steps = 0 + (4-2) + 2 → 0 + 2 +2=4. Let's see:\n\nmove to r (already there) → 0 steps. close right (1 sec). then move to l (2) → 4-2=2 steps. close left (1 sec). total 0+1+2+1=4 → correct.\n\nAnother case: need_left only. For example, l=2, r=5 (n=5). need_left is true. pos is 3 (inside [2,5]). steps is |3-2| +1 =1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: need_left only, pos is 1 (outside [2,5]). steps is (2-1)+1 =2 steps.\n\nAnother case: need_right only. For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. pos is 2 (inside). steps is |2-3| +1 =1+1=2. Which is moving to r (3) and closing right. Correct.\n\nAnother case: need_right only, pos is 4 (outside [1,3]). steps is (4-3)+1=2 steps. Correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead the input. But the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line of input containing four integers. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nWait, but in the example, the input is given as:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe original problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. But the problem says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers\".\n\nWait, the user provided the sample input as a list of strings, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is one line with four integers.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is a single line with four integers. But in the sample input, there are three examples. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code is supposed to read one line per test case. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nWait, the user's sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But the original problem says that the input is a single line.\n\nWait, no. The original problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, but the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while efficiently moving the mouse cursor and closing tabs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l = 1 and r = n), no action is needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Determine Needs**: Check if tabs to the left of l (need_left) or right of r (need_right) need to be closed.\n3. **Position Analysis**:\n   - **Inside Segment**: If the current position is within [l, r], calculate the minimum steps required to move to either end of the segment and close the respective tabs.\n   - **Outside Segment**: If the current position is outside [l, r], calculate the steps required to move into the segment and then close the necessary tabs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    need_left = l > 1\n    need_right = r < n\n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n        if l <= pos <= r:\n            min_dist = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))\n            steps = min_dist + (r - l) + 2\n        elif pos < l:\n            steps = (r - pos) + 2\n        else:  # pos > r\n            steps = (pos - l) + 2\n    elif need_left:\n        if l <= pos <= r:\n            steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        else:\n            steps = (l - pos) + 1\n    else:  # need_right\n        if l <= pos <= r:\n            steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        else:\n            steps = (pos - r) + 1\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: Directly check if the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs.\n- **Need Left/Right Check**: Determine if tabs outside the segment on either side need closing.\n- **Position Handling**: Depending on whether the current position is inside or outside the segment, compute the minimal steps required to move to the appropriate positions and perform the closing operations efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize the movement and closing operations by leveraging the closest positions to the segment boundaries, thus optimizing the total time required.",
