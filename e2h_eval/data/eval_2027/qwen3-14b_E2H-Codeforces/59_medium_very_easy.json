    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to count the number of arrays of N sets that satisfy certain conditions related to being children of each other after rearrangement. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's understand the definition of a child set. A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1,2}, then B must have 2 and 3. Wait, no: for each x in A, B must have x+1. So for x=1, B needs 2; for x=2, B needs 3. So B must contain 2 and 3. But B can have other elements as well.\n\nNow, the problem says that we need to find arrays of N sets such that there exists some permutation of the array where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. So, the order of the array can be rearranged into a sequence where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nThe challenge is to count all possible such arrays. Let's think about what constraints this imposes on the sets.\n\nLet me think about the structure required for such a permutation to exist. For example, if we have N sets, they must form a chain where each set in the chain is a child of the next. But since the permutation can be any rearrangement, perhaps the sets can be ordered in a way that forms such a chain.\n\nBut how do the sets relate to each other? Let's think of the sets in terms of their elements. For a set to be a child of another, it must not contain any elements that are higher than the maximum element in the parent set. Wait, not exactly. Let me think again. Suppose set B has elements up to some value m. Then, a set A that is a child of B can have elements up to m-1. Because for each x in A, x+1 is in B. So, the maximum element in A can be at most m-1. So, the maximum element of A is less than or equal to the maximum element of B minus 1. Therefore, if we arrange the sets in a chain S1 → S2 → ... → SN, then each set's maximum element is strictly less than the previous one's. Wait, no. Because S1 is a child of S2, so S1's max is ≤ (S2's max) - 1. Similarly, S2's max is ≤ (S3's max) -1, etc. So, the maximum elements of the sets in the chain must be strictly decreasing. Therefore, the maximum elements of all sets in the array must be distinct and form a strictly decreasing sequence. Wait, but since the array can be permuted, the sets can be ordered in such a way that their maxima form a strictly decreasing sequence. Therefore, the sets in the array must have maxima that are all distinct? No, wait. Suppose two sets have the same maximum. Then, in any permutation, if you have two sets with the same maximum, you can't arrange them in a chain where each is a child of the next. Because suppose set A and B have the same maximum m. Then, if you have A followed by B, then A must be a child of B. But since A's max is m, then B must have m+1. But B's max is m, so that's impossible. Similarly, B followed by A would require B to be a child of A, which also requires B's max to be m, and A's max to be m, but for each element in B, x+1 must be in A. Since B's max is m, then A must have m+1, but A's max is m. Contradiction. Therefore, all sets in the array must have distinct maxima. Otherwise, you can't arrange them in a chain.\n\nWait, but maybe the sets have different maxima. For example, if you have two sets with maxima m and m-1. Then, the one with m-1 can be a child of the one with m. So, in this case, the maxima are distinct. Therefore, the conclusion is that all sets in the array must have distinct maxima. Because otherwise, if two sets have the same maximum, they can't be arranged in a chain where each is a child of the next.\n\nSo, the first observation is that each set in the array must have a unique maximum. Because otherwise, there's no way to arrange them into a chain where each is a child of the next. Because if two sets have the same maximum, say m, then neither can be a child of the other. Because for the first set to be a child of the second, the second must have m+1, which it doesn't. Similarly for the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all arrays of N sets where each set has a unique maximum, and the sets can be ordered in a way that their maxima are strictly decreasing. But since the array can be permuted, the actual order of the array doesn't matter as long as the sets have distinct maxima. Wait, no. Because once the sets have distinct maxima, you can arrange them in the order of decreasing maxima, and then each set will be a child of the next one. Because for each set S_i in the chain, its maximum is m_i, and the next set has maximum m_{i+1} < m_i. So for S_i to be a child of S_{i+1}, each element x in S_i must have x+1 in S_{i+1}. But since the maximum of S_i is m_i, and the maximum of S_{i+1} is m_{i+1} < m_i. Wait, but how does that ensure that all elements of S_i have their x+1 in S_{i+1}? That's not necessarily true. Oh, right! So my previous conclusion was wrong. Just having distinct maxima isn't sufficient. Because even if the maxima are distinct, the sets could have elements that don't satisfy the child condition.\n\nSo I need to think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose K=2, N=2. Let's consider two sets S1 and S2. Suppose S1 is {1}, and S2 is {2}. Then, S1 is a child of S2 because 1+1=2 is in S2. So in this case, the array [S1, S2] can be arranged as [S1, S2], and S1 is a child of S2. Alternatively, if the array is [S2, S1], then we need S2 to be a child of S1. But S2 has element 2. For that to be a child of S1, which has {1}, there must be 2+1=3 in S1. Which it doesn't. So the array [S2, S1] can't be arranged in a valid way. However, the original array [S1, S2] can be arranged in order. So the key is that when we arrange the sets in order of decreasing maxima, each set's elements are all less than the maxima of the next set. Wait, but how do we ensure that for each x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}? Because S_{i+1} has maximum m_{i+1} which is less than m_i. Wait, no. If the sets are ordered in decreasing maxima, then S_1 has max m_1, S_2 has max m_2 < m_1, etc. Then, for S_1 to be a child of S_2, all elements in S_1 must have x+1 in S_2. But S_2's maximum is m_2, which is less than m_1. So for example, if S_1 has an element m_1, then x+1 = m_1 +1 must be present in S_2. But S_2's maximum is m_2 < m_1, so m_1 +1 is larger than m_2. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, my earlier conclusion was wrong. So arranging the sets in order of decreasing maxima is not sufficient. So there's a mistake in my reasoning here.\n\nHmm. So what's the correct approach?\n\nLet me think again. What's the necessary and sufficient condition for the array of sets to be rearranged into a chain where each is a child of the next?\n\nLet me think about the chain. Suppose the chain is S_1, S_2, ..., S_N. Then:\n\nFor each i from 1 to N-1, S_i is a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nWhich implies that for every element x in S_i, x+1 is present in S_{i+1}.\n\nThis suggests that the elements in S_i must be at most (max of S_{i+1} - 1). Because if x is in S_i, then x+1 is in S_{i+1}, so x+1 <= max(S_{i+1}) => x <= max(S_{i+1}) -1. So the maximum of S_i is <= max(S_{i+1}) - 1. So the maximum of S_i is strictly less than the maximum of S_{i+1}.\n\nThus, the maxima of the sets in the chain must form a strictly increasing sequence. Wait, no. Because the maximum of S_i is less than the maximum of S_{i+1}. So the maxima of the chain S_1, S_2, ..., S_N must be strictly increasing. But since the array can be permuted, we can arrange the sets in any order. So the necessary condition is that the maxima of all the sets in the array are distinct and can be ordered in a strictly increasing sequence. But that's always possible if all the maxima are distinct. Because if all maxima are distinct, then they can be ordered in a strictly increasing sequence. However, even with that, the chain condition may not hold. Because for example, suppose S_1 has max 2, and S_2 has max 3. Then S_1 can be a child of S_2 only if all elements in S_1 are such that x+1 is in S_2. For example, if S_1 is {2}, then x+1 is 3, which is in S_2. So that's okay. But if S_1 is {1}, then x+1 is 2. So S_2 must contain 2. But S_2's max is 3, so it can contain 2. So that's okay. But if S_2 is {3}, then it doesn't contain 2, so S_1 can't be a child of S_2. Thus, even though the maxima are distinct and can be ordered in increasing order, the sets may not satisfy the child condition.\n\nSo what's the correct condition? It seems that for the chain to be possible, the sets must form a hierarchy where for any two sets, if their maxima are m and m', and m < m', then the set with max m can be a child of the set with max m'. But how can we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire array of sets must be such that for each set, all elements in it are less than the maximum of the set. Which is trivial. But that's already given. Wait, no. Each set can have elements from 1 to K, but the maximum element in the set is the largest element in it. So, for example, if a set has elements {1,3}, then its maximum is 3. But for it to be a child of another set with maximum m', then m' must be at least 4 (so that 3+1=4 is present). But if m' is 4, then the set with max 3 can be a child of that set, provided that for all elements x in the set, x+1 is in the parent set.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be transformed into considering the maximum elements of the sets. Let's think of each set as having a maximum value. Let's denote that for each set, its maximum is m. Then, for the set to be a child of another set with maximum m', we need m' ≥ m + 1. Moreover, the set with maximum m must not contain any elements greater than m. But since the maximum is m, that's already ensured.\n\nBut even if m' ≥ m + 1, the set with maximum m could still have elements that require x+1 to be present in the parent set. For example, if the set has elements {1, 3}, and the parent set has maximum 4. Then, for x=1, 2 must be in the parent set. For x=3, 4 must be in the parent set. So the parent set must contain both 2 and 4. But the parent set's maximum is 4, but it could have elements like {2,4}. So the parent set can be anything as long as it contains all required x+1 elements.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to model the sets in terms of their maximum elements and their allowed elements. Let's think recursively. Suppose that we have a set with maximum m. Then, the elements in the set can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m}, but with the condition that for each element x in the set, x+1 is present in the parent set. But since the parent set's maximum is higher than m, perhaps the set can be any subset of {1, ..., m} as long as it's compatible with the parent. However, since the parent set is arbitrary (as long as it has maximum ≥ m + 1), perhaps the only constraint is that the set can be any subset of {1, ..., m} where m is the maximum element. Wait, but how does that affect the possibility of being a child of another set?\n\nWait, the problem allows us to arrange the sets in any order. So, for example, if we have two sets S and T, where S has maximum m and T has maximum m', and m' > m + 1. Then, S can be a child of T. But for that to happen, all elements x in S must have x+1 in T. However, T's maximum is m', which is larger than m+1. So, for example, if S has elements {m}, then x+1 is m+1, which must be in T. But T's maximum is m', which is larger than m+1, so T can contain m+1. But T could choose not to contain m+1. So in that case, S cannot be a child of T. Therefore, the problem is that even if the maxima are ordered correctly, the actual elements in the sets must be compatible with the parent set.\n\nThis seems very complex. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: think of the entire array of sets. Since we can arrange them in any order, the key is that there exists a permutation of the array such that each set is a child of the next. Let's imagine that the permutation is ordered such that the sets are arranged in order of increasing maxima. Wait, earlier analysis suggested that if the maxima are in increasing order, then each set's maximum is m_i and the next is m_{i+1} > m_i. For S_i to be a child of S_{i+1}, all elements x in S_i must have x+1 in S_{i+1}. But since m_i is the maximum of S_i, then for x = m_i, x+1 = m_i + 1 must be in S_{i+1}. But S_{i+1}'s maximum is m_{i+1} ≥ m_i + 1. So m_i +1 is ≤ m_{i+1} (if m_{i+1} is exactly m_i + 1) or larger. But S_{i+1} can have elements up to m_{i+1}, but it's not required to have m_i +1. Unless S_{i} has m_i as an element.\n\nAh! So if the set S_i has maximum m_i, then it must contain m_i. Therefore, for S_i to be a child of S_{i+1}, S_{i+1} must contain m_i + 1. Therefore, the set S_{i+1} must contain m_i +1. \n\nBut S_{i+1}'s maximum is m_{i+1} ≥ m_i +1. So, if m_{i+1} is exactly m_i +1, then S_{i+1} must contain m_i +1 (since it's its maximum). So that's okay. But if m_{i+1} is larger than m_i +1, then S_{i+1} may or may not contain m_i +1. But in order for S_i to be a child of S_{i+1}, it must contain m_i +1. Therefore, if the sets are ordered in increasing maxima, then for each consecutive pair, the next set's maximum must be exactly one more than the previous. Otherwise, if the next set's maximum is more than one higher, then S_{i} has m_i, and S_{i+1} must contain m_i +1. But since the next set's maximum is m_{i+1} ≥ m_i + 2, it's possible that it doesn't contain m_i +1. Therefore, this would violate the condition.\n\nSo this suggests that the maxima of the sets in the chain must form a sequence where each is exactly one more than the previous. Because otherwise, there's a gap that could prevent the child condition from being satisfied. \n\nWait, but if the maxima are in a sequence where each is exactly one more than the previous, then for each consecutive pair, the next set has maximum m_i + 1, which means it contains m_i +1. Therefore, the previous set's maximum is m_i, which is present in the previous set. Hence, the previous set's elements include m_i, which requires that the next set contains m_i +1. Which it does. Also, for any other elements x in the previous set, x ≤ m_i. So x+1 ≤ m_i +1. Since the next set's maximum is m_i +1, x+1 can be present in the next set. However, the next set may not have x+1. So this seems like a problem. \n\nFor example, suppose the previous set is {1, 3}, with maximum 3. The next set has maximum 4. So it must contain 4. But the previous set has 1, so the next set must contain 2. But the next set's maximum is 4, but it may not contain 2. So the previous set can't be a child of the next set. Therefore, even if the maxima are consecutive, the sets may not satisfy the child condition unless the next set contains all x+1 for elements x in the previous set.\n\nThis seems very complex. How can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the only way for the entire array to be arranged into a chain is that the sets are such that their maxima form a sequence m_1, m_2, ..., m_N where each m_i = m_{i-1} + 1. Then, the sets can be ordered in increasing order of maxima, and for each consecutive pair, the next set has maximum m_i = m_{i-1} +1. Then, for the previous set to be a child of the next, all elements x in the previous set must have x+1 in the next set. Since the next set's maximum is m_i = m_{i-1} +1, which is the previous maximum plus 1. So, the next set must contain m_i = m_{i-1} +1. But what about other elements?\n\nSuppose the previous set has elements {x_1, x_2, ..., x_k} where the maximum is m_{i-1}. Then, each x_j must have x_j +1 in the next set. The next set's maximum is m_i = m_{i-1} +1. So, for each x_j, x_j +1 can be between 1 +1 = 2 (if x_j is 1) up to m_{i-1} +1. So the next set must contain all x_j +1. However, the next set can be any subset of {1, ..., m_i} that includes m_i (since it's the maximum) and all required x_j +1. \n\nBut how can we ensure that this is possible? Well, if the previous set's elements are such that their x_j +1 are all included in the next set. But since the next set can be chosen freely (as long as it has maximum m_i and contains the required elements), perhaps the only requirement is that the previous set's elements are all ≤ m_i -1, which they are because the previous set's maximum is m_{i-1} = m_i -1. Therefore, the x_j +1 is ≤ m_i. So the next set can contain those elements. But since the next set is allowed to be any subset of {1, ..., m_i} that includes m_i, the problem becomes how to count the number of possible sets for each step.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Perhaps there's a way to model this as a graph or using dynamic programming. Let's think about the problem again.\n\nThe key insight might be that the entire array of sets must form a chain where each set's maximum is exactly one more than the previous. Because otherwise, there's no way to ensure that the child condition holds. Let me think: if the maxima are not consecutive, then there's a gap. For example, if we have a set with maximum m, then a set with maximum m + 2. Then, the first set's maximum is m, so it contains m. For it to be a child of the second set, the second set must contain m+1. However, the second set's maximum is m+2, so it can contain m+1. But it's not required. So if the second set doesn't contain m+1, then the child condition fails. However, since we are allowed to choose the sets, perhaps we can choose the second set to include m+1. Therefore, the problem reduces to ensuring that for any two consecutive sets in the chain, the next set has maximum m_i and contains all required x+1 elements from the previous set. But how can we ensure that this is possible?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way for the entire array to be arranged into such a chain is that the sets can be ordered in a way where their maxima form a strictly increasing sequence, and for each consecutive pair, the next set's maximum is at least the previous set's maximum + 1. But even that may not be sufficient. However, if the sets are allowed to be chosen in a way that satisfies the child condition, then perhaps the only thing that matters is that the maxima are distinct and can be ordered in a strictly increasing sequence. Because for any such ordering, we can construct the sets in a way that they satisfy the child condition. But how?\n\nFor example, let's say we have two sets with maxima m and m', where m < m'. We can arrange them in order of m then m'. To make the first set a child of the second, we need that for all x in the first set, x+1 is in the second. Since the first set's maximum is m, it contains m. So the second set must contain m+1. But the second set's maximum is m', which is ≥ m+1. So we can choose the second set to contain m+1. And for other elements x in the first set, x+1 can be any value up to m+1. So the second set can contain all those values. Thus, the number of ways to choose the first and second sets is:\n\nnumber of subsets for the first set with maximum m multiplied by the number of subsets for the second set with maximum m' that include m+1 and have maximum m'.\n\nWait, but the second set can be any subset that includes m' and includes m+1. But m' can be any value ≥ m+1. So for example, if the second set's maximum is m', then it must contain m', and can contain any subset of {1, ..., m'} that includes m' and includes m+1. \n\nSo, for a given sequence of maxima m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, the total number of arrays is the product over each set's possibilities, where each set's elements are a subset of {1, ..., m_i} that contains m_i (so that it's the maximum), and for each consecutive pair (m_i, m_{i+1}), the set with m_{i+1} must contain m_i +1.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think of the entire array of sets. Suppose that the maxima are m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N. Then, for the chain to be possible, the following must hold:\n\nFor each i from 1 to N-1, m_{i+1} ≥ m_i + 1. Because the set with maximum m_i has m_i as an element, which requires that the next set's maximum is at least m_i + 1. Otherwise, if m_{i+1} = m_i, it's impossible. If m_{i+1} = m_i + 0, then the next set's maximum is m_i, but the previous set has m_i as element, which requires that the next set has m_i +1, which it doesn't. Hence, m_{i+1} must be ≥ m_i + 1. Therefore, the sequence of maxima must be such that each is at least one more than the previous. \n\nBut if the sequence is m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, and each m_{i+1} ≥ m_i +1, then we can arrange the sets in order of increasing maxima. Now, for each consecutive pair, the next set's maximum is at least m_i + 1. So, the next set must contain m_i +1. But how can we ensure that?\n\nBecause the next set's maximum is m_{i+1} ≥ m_i +1. So, for example, if m_{i+1} is m_i + 1, then the next set must contain m_i +1 (since it's its maximum). If m_{i+1} is larger than m_i +1, then the next set can have any elements as long as it contains m_i +1 and has maximum m_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for the chain to be valid, the sets must be chosen such that:\n\n- For each set i, its maximum is m_i, and it contains m_i.\n- For each consecutive pair (i, i+1), the set i+1 contains m_i +1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a sequence of maxima m_1, m_2, ..., m_N such that m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, and for each i from 1 to N-1, m_{i+1} ≥ m_i + 1. Then, for each such sequence, compute the number of ways to choose the sets.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to count the number of sequences of maxima. Let me denote that the maxima sequence is m_1, m_2, ..., m_N, where each m_{i} ≥ m_{i-1} +1, and m_1 ≥ 1, m_N ≤ K.\n\nBut since the maxima are strictly increasing and each consecutive pair is at least 1 apart, the minimal possible maximum for m_N is m_1 + (N-1)*1. So for example, if N=2, the minimal m_2 is m_1 +1.\n\nBut how many such sequences are there? This seems like a stars and bars problem. For example, if we have to select N distinct integers m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, such that m_{i+1} ≥ m_i +1. This is equivalent to choosing N distinct integers with m_1 ≥ 1, m_2 ≥ m_1 +1 ≥ 2, m_3 ≥ m_2 +1 ≥ 3, etc. So the minimal possible sequence is 1, 2, 3, ..., N. The maximal possible is K - (N-1), K - (N-2), ..., K. Wait, no. For example, if K is large enough, the maxima can be any sequence of N numbers where each is at least one more than the previous. This is equivalent to choosing N numbers in {1, 2, ..., K} with m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N and m_{i+1} ≥ m_i +1. Which is equivalent to choosing N numbers with m_1 ≥ 1, m_2 ≥ m_1 + 1 ≥ 2, m_3 ≥ m_2 + 1 ≥ 3, etc. This is equivalent to choosing N numbers such that m_i ≥ i. So, if we define variables y_i = m_i - (i-1), then the constraints become y_1 ≥ 1, y_2 ≥ y_1 + 1 - (i-1)? Wait, perhaps a better substitution is to consider that for the sequence m_1, m_2, ..., m_N, the differences between consecutive terms are at least 1. This is equivalent to selecting N elements in the range [1, K] such that they are strictly increasing and each is at least 1 more than the previous. Which is the same as selecting N elements where m_1 ≥ 1, m_2 ≥ m_1 +1 ≥ 2, m_3 ≥ m_2 +1 ≥ 3, ..., m_N ≥ N. So the minimal value of m_N is N. Hence, the number of such sequences is C(K - N + 1, N). Wait, no. Let me think of it as a stars and bars problem. \n\nIf we have to choose N distinct numbers m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N with m_{i+1} ≥ m_i + 1. Let's perform a substitution: let m'_i = m_i - (i - 1). Then, since m_1 ≥ 1, m'_1 = m_1 ≥ 1. m_2 ≥ m_1 + 1 → m'_2 = m_2 -1 ≥ m_1 +1 -1 = m_1 = m'_1 + (i-1) ? Wait, let me recompute.\n\nOriginal constraints: m_1 < m_2 - 1 < m_3 - 2 < ... < m_N - (N-1). Wait, no. Let me think of the substitution. Let's define m'_i = m_i - (i - 1). Then, since m_1 ≥ 1, m'_1 ≥ 1 - 0 = 1. m_2 ≥ m_1 + 1 → m_2 -1 ≥ m_1 → m'_2 ≥ m'_1. Similarly, m_3 ≥ m_2 +1 → m_3 - 2 ≥ m_2 -1 → m'_3 ≥ m'_2. And so on. Therefore, the sequence m'_1 ≤ m'_2 ≤ ... ≤ m'_N. Also, since m_i ≤ K, m'_i = m_i - (i-1) ≤ K - (i-1). \n\nBut since the m_i are strictly increasing, m'_i = m_i - (i-1) is non-decreasing. Wait, because m_2 ≥ m_1 +1 → m_2 -1 ≥ m_1 → m'_2 ≥ m'_1. Similarly for others. So the transformed variables m'_i are non-decreasing. Also, since m_1 ≥ 1, m'_1 ≥ 1. And since m_N ≤ K → m'_N = m_N - (N-1) ≤ K - (N-1). \n\nBut since the m'_i are non-decreasing, they can be considered as any sequence of numbers where 1 ≤ m'_1 ≤ m'_2 ≤ ... ≤ m'_N ≤ K - (N-1). However, since the m'_i are non-decreasing, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of multisets of size N from the range [1, K - N + 1]. Wait, no. Because the maximum value for m'_N is K - (N-1). So the number of non-decreasing sequences of length N with elements between 1 and L, where L = K - (N-1), is C(L + N - 1, N). Wait, no. The number of non-decreasing sequences of length N with elements between 1 and L is equal to the number of combinations with repetition, which is C(L + N - 1, N). \n\nBut wait, the transformed variables m'_i can be any non-decreasing sequence of N elements from 1 to L, where L = K - (N-1). Because m'_N = m_N - (N-1) ≤ K - (N-1). So the number of sequences is C(L + N - 1, N) = C( (K - N + 1) + N - 1, N ) = C(K, N). Wait, that can't be right. Let me see:\n\nL = K - (N-1). Then, the number of non-decreasing sequences of length N with elements between 1 and L is equal to the number of combinations with repetition, which is C(L + N - 1, N). Substituting L = K - N +1:\n\nC( (K - N +1) + N -1, N ) = C(K, N). So the number of sequences of m_i is C(K, N). \n\nWait, that's interesting. So the number of possible sequences of maxima m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N with m_{i+1} ≥ m_i +1 is equal to C(K, N). Because each such sequence corresponds to a combination of N distinct elements from 1 to K, and the transformation shows that the number of such sequences is C(K, N). \n\nBut how? For example, if K=2 and N=2, then C(2,2)=1. Which matches the first example's note where the answer is 11. Wait, no. In the first example input is N=2, K=2. According to this logic, the number of sequences of maxima is C(2,2)=1. But in the first example, there are multiple arrays of sets. So this suggests that the number of sequences of maxima is C(K, N), but for each such sequence, we have to multiply by the number of ways to choose the sets. \n\nBut this seems promising. So the total number of valid arrays is equal to the sum over all possible sequences of maxima (each being a combination of N distinct elements from 1 to K) multiplied by the number of ways to choose the sets for each sequence.\n\nSo the problem now reduces to:\n\nTotal = C(K, N) × (product for each set in the sequence of the number of ways to choose that set given its maximum and the constraints from the previous set).\n\nBut what is the number of ways for each set in the sequence?\n\nLet's think about the sequence of maxima m_1, m_2, ..., m_N. For each set i, the maximum is m_i. The set must contain m_i. Additionally, for the set i+1, it must contain m_i +1. But for the set i itself, there are no constraints except that it contains m_i and any subset of the elements below m_i. However, for the set i+1, it must contain m_i +1. \n\nBut how do these constraints affect the choices for each set?\n\nLet's consider the first set. Its maximum is m_1. It can be any subset of {1, ..., m_1} that contains m_1. The number of such subsets is 2^{m_1 -1}. Because for each element from 1 to m_1 -1, it can be present or not, but m_1 must be present. \n\nSimilarly, the second set has maximum m_2. It must contain m_2. But also, since the first set is a child of the second set, the second set must contain m_1 + 1. So the second set's elements are any subset of {1, ..., m_2} that contains m_2 and m_1 +1. The number of such subsets is 2^{m_2 - 2}, since elements from 1 to m_2, excluding m_2 and m_1+1, can be chosen freely. But wait: the subset must contain both m_2 and m_1+1. So the number of subsets is 2^{m_2 - 2} (since there are m_2 elements, and two of them are fixed to be present, the rest are optional).\n\nSimilarly, the third set has maximum m_3. It must contain m_3 and also m_2 +1. So the number of subsets for the third set is 2^{m_3 - 2} ?\n\nWait, no. Because for the third set, it must contain m_3 (its maximum) and also m_2 +1 (because the second set is a child of the third set). But what if m_2 +1 is greater than m_3? That can't happen because the sequence of maxima is m_1 < m_2 < m_3 and m_3 ≥ m_2 +1. So m_2 +1 ≤ m_3. Hence, m_2 +1 is within the range of the third set's elements. So the third set must",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each set is a child of the next. The key insight is that each set in the array must have a unique maximum value, and these maxima must form a strictly increasing sequence where each subsequent maximum is at least one greater than the previous.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Combinatorial Selection**: The number of ways to choose N distinct maxima from the range [1, K] is given by the binomial coefficient C(K, N). This is because each valid sequence of maxima corresponds to a combination of N distinct elements from 1 to K.\n2. **Subset Counting**: For each chosen maximum value `m_i`, the number of valid subsets that can be formed with `m_i` as the maximum is `2^(m_i - 1)`. This is because each element less than `m_i` can either be included or excluded from the subset, while `m_i` itself must always be included.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we use modular arithmetic with a modulus of 998244353 to ensure we handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    if N > K:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo MOD\n    max_n = K\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n-1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    def comb(n, k):\n        if k < 0 or k > n:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD\n    \n    # Compute the number of sequences of maxima: C(K, N)\n    c = comb(K, N)\n    \n    # Now compute the product of 2^{m_i - 1} for each m_i in the sequence\n    # But since the sequence is any combination of N distinct elements from 1..K,\n    # the sum over all sequences of the product of 2^{m_i -1} is equal to C(K, N) multiplied by something?\n    # Wait no.
