He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the factorial is divisible by 10, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization. But since there are usually more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the main idea is to find all n's where the count of 5s in their factorial equals m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors of 5? Wait no. Wait, 5! has one zero. 6! is 720, which also has one zero. Similarly for 7!, 8!, 9! — they all have one zero until 10! which adds another 5 (from 10=2*5). So for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So that's five numbers.\n\nBut how do I find for a given m, what are the possible n's?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are other numbers that also give the same count.\n\nWait, but how do we find that?\n\nAlternatively, the number of trailing zeros function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a larger n can't decrease the count of 5s. So for example, when n increases, the count of trailing zeros either stays the same or increases.\n\nSo for a given m, there could be a range of n's that give exactly m zeros. But how many?\n\nFor example, if m is 5, then let's see. Let's compute for n=25: the count is 25//5 + 25//25 = 5+1=6. So maybe the numbers that give exactly 5 zeros would be between some numbers. Like, perhaps 24, 25? Wait, 24//5 is 4, 24//25 is 0. So total 4. So that's not. Wait, maybe I need to find for m=5, what n's give exactly 5 zeros.\n\nWait, let's think. Let me find for n=20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0. Total 4. For n=21, same. For n=24, same. For n=25, it's 5+1=6. So how do we get 5?\n\nAh, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Because when you reach 25, the count jumps from 4 (for 24) to 6 (for 25). So m=5 would have zero solutions. That's why the sample input for m=5 outputs 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists n's that have exactly m zeros. And if so, how many and what are they.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that the count of zeros is >= m. Then check if the count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the range of n's where the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but how to find the possible n's?\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, for a given m, we need to find all n where f(n) = m, where f(n) is the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nSince f(n) is non-decreasing, the values of n that satisfy f(n) = m must form a contiguous range. So if there exists such n, then there's a range of numbers from a to b where all have f(n)=m. So the count would be b - a + 1.\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find these bounds?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the first sample, m=1. The minimal n where f(n) = 1 is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values for `n` that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times `n!` can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the count of 5s in the prime factorization of `n!`. This count can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zero count function, we can use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of `n` such that the count of trailing zeroes equals `m`.\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: Once we find the smallest `n` where the trailing zero count is `m`, we check if the next few values also have the same count. If not, there are no valid `n` values for the given `m`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if m == 0:\n        print(\"1\\n0\")\n        return\n    \n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Now find the max_n where count is m\n    max_n = min_n\n    while count_trailing_zeros(max_n) == m:\n        max_n += 1\n    max_n -= 1\n    \n    result = list(range(min_n, max_n + 1))\n    print(len(result))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by powers of 5 and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_min_n**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest `n` such that the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is at least `m`. If the count at this `n` is exactly `m`, it is a valid starting point.\n\n3. **Main Function**: After determining the minimum `n` with the required trailing zeroes, we incrementally check subsequent values to find the maximum `n` that still has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The valid range of `n` values is then printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the valid range of `n` values using binary search and linear checks, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
