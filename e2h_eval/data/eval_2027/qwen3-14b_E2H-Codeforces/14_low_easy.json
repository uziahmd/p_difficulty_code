He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's think about how the count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then adding 1 to n would add one more 5. But if it's a multiple of higher powers like 25, then it adds more. So the count can jump by more than 1. For example, 24! has 4 trailing zeros (24/5=4.8 → 4, 24/25=0.96 → 0). Then 25! adds 25/5=5 (but 25/25=1, so total is 5+1=6. So from 24! to 25! the count increases by 2. So between some numbers, the count jumps by more than 1. Which implies that for certain m values, there may be no n's that have exactly that count. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there's a range of numbers where the count jumps from 5 to 6, so there are no numbers with exactly 5? Or wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, for example, let's take m=5. Let's see:\n\nLooking for n such that trailing_zeros(n!) = 5.\n\nLet's compute trailing zeros for numbers around 25.\n\nFor 24: 24//5=4, 24//25=0 → total 4. So 24! has 4 zeros.\n\n25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1 → total 6. So 25! has 6 zeros. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. Therefore, for m=5, the answer would be zero. But wait, what about numbers between 25 and ...?\n\nWait, perhaps there are numbers where the count is 5. Let me check for n=25, 26, etc. Wait, 25! has 6 zeros. So 25, 26, 27, 28, 29: their factorials will have 6 zeros. Then 30! would be 30/5=6, 30/25=1, 30/125=0 → total 7. So between 25 and 30, the count is 6. So for m=5, there are no n's. Hence, the output would be zero.\n\nBut in the sample input given, when m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check that. For 5! it's 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! is 5040 (1), 8! 40320 (1), 9! 362880 (1). Then 10! is 3628800 (two zeros). So the count for 5-9 is 1. So the answer for m=1 is 5 numbers. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Now, how to find those n's?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\n1. Find the minimum n where the trailing zeros count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find all n's that have exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for a",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the valid values of `n`.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n- The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, and higher powers of 5 (like 25, 125, etc.) contribute more.\n  \n- The formula for counting trailing zeroes in `n!` is:\n  $$\n  \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n  $$\n\n- For a given `m`, there may be zero or more values of `n` such that `count_trailing_zeros(n) == m`. However, due to the way trailing zeroes increase, some values of `m` may not be achievable.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Binary Search for Range Boundaries**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest `n_low` such that `count_trailing_zeros(n_low) == m`.\n   - Find the largest `n_high` such that `count_trailing_zeros(n_high) == m`.\n   - If no such `n` exists, return `0`.\n\n2. **Generate Valid `n` Values**:\n   - Once we have the range `[n_low, n_high]`, all integers in this interval will have exactly `m` trailing zeroes in their factorial.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Details**\n\n- We define a helper function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` to compute the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.\n- We use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of `n` where the count of trailing zeros equals `m`.\n- If the count at the lower bound is not equal to `m`, it means there are no such `n`, and we return an empty list.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Binary search to find the lowest n with >= m trailing zeros\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Now find the upper bound\n    high = low\n    while count_trailing_zeros(high) == m:\n        high += 1\n    return list(range(low, high))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    if not input:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    m = int(input)\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if result:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Example Execution**\n\nFor input `1`, the output will be:\n\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nFor input `5`, the output will be:\n\n```\n0\n```\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles edge cases such as when no valid `n` exists for the given `m`. It uses binary search to minimize the number of operations required to find the valid range of `n`.",
