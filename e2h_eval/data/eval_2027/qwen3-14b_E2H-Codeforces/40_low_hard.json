The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to compute this modulo a given mod. The constraints are n up to 500, which is pretty big, so we need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, let's think about what the problem requires. We need to count all pairs (p, q) where p < q lexicographically and inv(p) > inv(q). Since permutations can be numerous, brute-forcing all possible pairs is impossible for n=500. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties here. Let's denote the total number of permutations as n! So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q is (n!)^2 - n! (since each permutation can pair with n!-1 others). But we need to consider only those pairs where p is lex smaller than q, and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm. Let's consider that for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly half of them will have p < q lex, assuming no ties. Because for any two distinct permutations, one is lex smaller than the other. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But that's not directly helpful yet.\n\nBut our problem requires considering for each such pair (p, q) where p < q, whether inv(p) > inv(q). So the answer is the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. For all pairs (p, q) where p < q, we can split them into three categories: inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) = inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q). Our goal is to find the count of the first category.\n\nNow, if we can compute the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), then that's our answer.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider that for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) if there's symmetry. However, since the lex order and inversion count are independent properties, perhaps not. Wait, but when you swap p and q, the inversion counts would be compared inversely. So for all pairs where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) equals the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) if there are no pairs with inv(p) = inv(q). But if there are some pairs with equal inversions, then the total would be:\n\ntotal_pairs = (number of pairs with p != q) = T = (n!)*(n! - 1)\n\nThen, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (T - same_count)/2, where same_count is the number of pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). Because for each pair (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. So the total number of such pairs is (T - same_count) / 2. Then, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is (T - same_count) / 2.\n\nBut our problem is only considering the pairs where p < q lex. So the total number of such pairs is S = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Now, if we can compute the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q), then the answer would be (S - same_lex_count) / 2, where same_lex_count is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nWait, but how? Let me think again. For all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is (T - same_total)/2, where same_total is the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = inv(q) and p != q. But this includes both cases where p < q and p > q. So the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is (total_pairs - same_total)/2.\n\nBut our problem wants the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's denote this as X. Similarly, the number",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we use combinatorial insights and dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Inversions**: The number of inversions in a permutation is a measure of how \"out of order\" the permutation is. For two permutations p and q, we need to compare their inversion counts.\n2. **Lexicographical Order**: For any two distinct permutations, one is always lexicographically smaller than the other. This allows us to split the total number of permutation pairs into those where p < q and vice versa.\n3. **Symmetry Insight**: For all pairs (p, q) where p â‰  q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). This symmetry helps reduce the problem to counting pairs with equal inversion counts.\n4. **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to precompute the number of permutations of each possible length with a given number of inversions. This helps in efficiently calculating the required counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    mod = int(input[1])\n\n    # Precompute inversion counts for permutations of size up to n\n    # dp[i][j] = number of permutations of i elements with j inversions\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    dp = [[0] * (max_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[1][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(max_inv + 1):\n            for k in range(j + 1):\n                if dp[i - 1][k]:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][k]\n                    if j - k >= i - 1:\n                        dp[i][j] -= dp[i - 1][j - k - (i - 1)]\n                    dp[i][j] %= mod  # To prevent overflow, but since we are using Python, maybe not needed here\n        # Actually, the correct recurrence is:\n        # dp[i][j] = sum_{k=0}^{j} dp[i-1][k] * (number of ways to insert i-th element)\n        # which is more complex.
