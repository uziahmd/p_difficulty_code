Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the requirements. So, each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base, and vice versa. And the key constraint is that any two line segments (from a spaceship to its assigned base) must not cross each other. \n\nHmm. How do I check for that? Well, for a given assignment (a perfect matching), I need to check all pairs of line segments to ensure none of them intersect. But since R and B are small (up to 10), maybe trying all possible perfect matchings and checking each for intersections is feasible.\n\nWait, but what's the number of possible perfect matchings? For R = B = n, the number is n! which for n=10 is 3.6 million. But 10! is 3,628,800. For each of these, checking all pairs of line segments for intersections. Let's think: for each matching, there are n line segments. The number of pairs is n*(n-1)/2. For n=10, that's 45 pairs per matching. For each pair, we need to check if their line segments intersect. \n\nSo total operations would be around 3.6 million * 45 = 163 million operations. That might be acceptable for Python, considering that each check is simple. But perhaps there's a smarter way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges represent non-crossing possibilities, and then check if there's a perfect matching. However, the problem is that the edges are not independent. For example, choosing one edge might affect the possibility of others. Because even if two edges don't cross, when combined with others, they might create crossings. \n\nSo the approach of checking all possible perfect matchings and seeing if any of them has no crossing lines seems feasible given the small constraints. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases. Since R and B are equal (since the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, so R must equal B. Wait, the input has R and B. Wait the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, which requires that R equals B. Wait, the first line says R and B. So the problem says that the input will have R and B, but for there to be a perfect matching, R must equal B. So in the code, perhaps first check if R != B, then output 'No' immediately. Because if R != B, there's no perfect matching. \n\nBut according to the input constraints, the problem says that the input is given with R and B. So the first thing in the code is to check if R != B. If they are not equal, output 'No'. Otherwise, proceed. \n\nSo step 1: Check if R != B. If yes, output No.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to generate all possible permutations of assignments. For example, if there are R spaceships and B=R bases, then each permutation represents a possible assignment (each spaceship is assigned to a unique base). For each permutation, check if all the line segments between the spaceships and their assigned bases do not cross each other. \n\nIf any permutation passes the check, output 'Yes'; else, 'No'.\n\nNow, the next part is generating all permutations. For example, for R=3, the permutations of the bases (assuming the bases are ordered in some way) would be all possible orderings. But how are the spaceships and bases represented?\n\nLet me think. Let's say the spaceships are stored in a list called rebels, and the bases in a list called bases. Then, for each permutation of the bases (or of the indices of the bases?), we can assign each rebel to a base in that order. \n\nFor example, for a permutation p (which is a list of indices of bases), the i-th rebel is assigned to the p[i]-th base. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the bases are given in a list. So for each possible permutation of the bases, we can generate all possible assignments. But since the bases are distinct, each permutation represents a unique assignment. \n\nBut the number of permutations is R! (since for R rebels and R bases, each permutation is a possible assignment). \n\nSo for each permutation, we need to check whether all the line segments between the rebels and their assigned bases are non-intersecting. \n\nNow, the key part is checking if two line segments intersect. How to do that?\n\nI need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise. \n\nBut note that the problem says that no three points are colinear.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting line segments intersect. Given the constraints that the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B) are each at most 10, we can use a brute-force approach to check all possible permutations of assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, ensure that the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If not, output \"No\" immediately as a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of the bases, generate a possible assignment of spaceships to bases.\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check if any pair of line segments (connecting a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. If no intersections are found for any permutation, output \"Yes\"; otherwise, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef read_input():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in data if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    return R, B, rebels, bases\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if segment AB intersects with segment CD\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    # Check if any point is on the other segment\n    if ccw1 == 0 and (min(A[0], B[0]) <= C[0] <= max(A[0], B[0]) and min(A[1], B[1]) <= C[1] <= max(A[1], B[1])):\n        return True\n    if ccw2 == 0 and (min(A[0], B[0]) <= D[0] <= max(A[0], B[0]) and min(A[1], B[1]) <= D[1] <= max(A[1], B[1])):\n        return True\n    if ccw3 == 0 and (min(C[0], D[0]) <= A[0] <= max(C[0], D[0]) and min(C[1], D[1]) <= A[1] <= max(C[1], D[1])):\n        return True\n    if ccw4 == 0 and (min(C[0], D[0]) <= B[0] <= max(C[0], D[0]) and min(C[1], D[1]) <= B[1] <= max(C[1], D[1])):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    R, B, rebels, bases = read_input()\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    # Generate all permutations of bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(range(B)):\n        # Check all pairs of segments in this permutation\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Get the two segments: rebels[i] -> bases[perm[i]] and rebels[j] -> bases[perm[j]]\n                A = rebels[i]\n                B = bases[perm[i]]\n                C = rebels[j]\n                D = bases[perm[j]]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into lists of coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Using permutations, all possible assignments of spaceships to bases are generated.\n3. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, we check if any pair of line segments intersect using the cross product method to determine if segments intersect.\n4. **Output Result**: If any valid permutation is found where no segments intersect, \"Yes\" is printed.
