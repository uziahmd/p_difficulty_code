The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Nikephoros and Polycarpus play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. The sequences can be up to 1000 characters each. But n can be as big as 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the problem is to compute for each round i (from 0 to n-1?), what move each player makes, then determine who wins. But since n is up to 2e9, we can't iterate through all rounds. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, and calculate the number of wins in each cycle, then multiply by the number of cycles and add the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think about the sequences. For each round, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo the key is to find for each possible pair of (a, b) in A and B, how many times they occur in the rounds, and then calculate how many times each player loses in those scenarios.\n\nBut since the sequences are cyclic, the combined pattern of A and B will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because the LCM of m and k is the least common multiple of their lengths. Let me think: after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the same pair of moves will repeat again. So the pattern of moves between the two players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period. For each round in 0..period-1, we can compute the moves of both players, and count how many times each player loses in this period. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period. The remaining rounds are remainder = n % period.\n\n2. Multiply the counts per period by total_periods, and then add the counts from the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut how do I compute the counts per period?\n\nFirst, for each round in the period, I can calculate the moves of A and B. Then for each such pair, determine who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut since the period can be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000 (since 1000 and 1000 have LCM 1000). Wait, no. Wait, LCM(m, k) for m and k up to 1000 would be up to 1000*1000 = 1,000,000. Because if m and k are coprime, then LCM is m*k. So for m=1000 and k=1000, LCM is 1000. So the maximum period is 1,000,000. Which is manageable, because even 1e6 iterations are acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Calculate m = len(A), k = len(B). Compute period = LCM(m, k).\n\n- For each i in 0 to period-1:\n\n   - a_move = A[i % m]\n\n   - b_move = B[i % k]\n\n   - determine who wins between a_move and b_move.\n\n   - increment counters for Nikephoros_loss and Polycarpus_loss accordingly.\n\nThen, total_periods = n // period\n\nremainder = n % period\n\nSo total_nik_losses = total_periods * nik_in_period + nik_in_remainder\n\nSame for polycarpus.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need to compute GCD of m and k.\n\nSo first, write a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here.\n\nSo, for m and k, compute their GCD, then LCM is m*k // gcd.\n\nOnce I have the period, then for the full periods, multiply by the counts in one period. Then for the remainder, process the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the counts in the first 'remainder' rounds? For that, I can precompute for each round in 0 to period-1, the outcome, and then for the remainder, just take the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut how to precompute that?\n\nSo, let's create two arrays: for each round in 0 to period-1, we can compute the outcome (who loses, if any). Then, for the full periods, multiply the total counts by total_periods, and for the remainder, add the counts from the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute the period.\n\nCompute for each of the period rounds, the outcome (nik_loss, pol_loss) for each round.\n\nThen, sum over all period rounds to get per_period_nik and per_period_pol.\n\nThen total_nik = per_period_nik * total_periods + sum of the first 'remainder' rounds' nik losses.\n\nSame for pol.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B)\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute per_period_nik and per_period_pol.\n\nThen compute total_periods = n // period\n\nremainder = n % period\n\nThen, compute the counts for the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut how to compute per_period_nik and per_period_pol?\n\nWe can loop through each i in 0 to period-1, compute the moves, determine the outcome, and accumulate the counts.\n\nNow, the question is how to determine who wins between a and b.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nIf same, draw.\n\nSo, for a_move and b_move:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\n   if (a, b) is (R, S) or (S, P) or (P, R): then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a pinch (so Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1).\n\n   else: Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nWait, because if a is R and b is S, Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus loses. So Nikephoros's loss count is 0, and Polycarpus's is +1.\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if Nikephoros loses, he gets a red spot (so his count increases by 1). If Polycarpus loses, his count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each round, determine if Nikephoros loses, and if so, add 1 to his total. Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo, for a_move and b_move:\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\n   if a beats b: Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus loses. So Polycarpus's count +=1.\n\n   else: Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros's count +=1.\n\nSo, how to check if a beats b?\n\nWe can have a helper function, or a lookup table.\n\nFor example, a dictionary where for each move, we know what it beats.\n\nLike:\n\nbeats = {\n\n    'R': 'S',\n\n    'S': 'P',\n\n    'P': 'R'\n\n}\n\nSo if a_move is 'R', and b_move is 'S', then a beats b. So Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif a == b:\n\n    continue\n\nelif beats[a] == b:\n\n    # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss.\n\n    pol_loss +=1\n\nelse:\n\n    # Nikephoros loses, so his loss count increases.\n\n    nik_loss +=1\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's how we can compute per round.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each of the period rounds, and then for the remainder rounds.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 2e9, but the period is up to 1e6, this approach is feasible.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12. So period is 12.\n\nThen, for each of the 12 rounds, compute the moves and the outcomes.\n\nLet me compute them:\n\nRound 0:\n\nA[0%3] = R\n\nB[0%4] = R → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 1:\n\nA[1%3] = P\n\nB[1%4] = S → P vs S. Beats? S beats P? Wait, beats['S'] is P. So if a is P and b is S, then beats[a] is 'R'? Wait no. Wait, the beats dict is:\n\nbeats['R'] is 'S' → R beats S.\n\nbeats['S'] is 'P' → S beats P.\n\nbeats['P'] is 'R' → P beats R.\n\nSo, for a_move = P, b_move = S. So, does a beat b? Check if beats[a] == b. beats['P'] is R. So no. So b_move is S, which beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So his count increases by 1.\n\nIn this case, the round is P vs S. So S beats P. So Nikephoros (a) loses. So nik_loss +=1.\n\nSo in round 1, nik gets 1.\n\nRound 2:\n\nA[2%3] = S\n\nB[2%4] = P → S vs P. Beats? S beats P. So a (S) beats b (P). So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a loss. So pol_loss +=1.\n\nRound 3:\n\nA[3%3=0] → R\n\nB[3%4=3 → P. R vs P. P beats R. So a (R) loses. So nik_loss +=1.\n\nRound 4: A[4%3=1 → P. B[4%4=0 → R. P vs R. P beats R. So Nikephoros wins. Polycarpus loses. So pol +=1.\n\nRound 5: A[5%3=2 → S. B[5%4=1 → S. S vs S. Draw.\n\nRound 6: A[6%3=0 → R. B[6%4=2 → P. R vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. nik +=1.\n\nRound 7: A[7%3=1 → P. B[7%4=3 → P. P vs P. Draw.\n\nRound 8: A[8%3=2 → S. B[8%4=0 → R. S vs R. R beats S. Nikephoros loses. So nik +=1.\n\nRound 9: A[9%3=0 → R. B[9%4=1 → S. R vs S. R beats S. Nikephoros wins. Polycarpus loses. pol +=1.\n\nRound 10: A[10%3=1 → P. B[10%4=2 → P. P vs P. Draw.\n\nRound 11: A[11%3=2 → S. B[11%4=3 → P. S vs P. S beats P. Nikephoros wins. Polycarpus loses. pol +=1.\n\nSo for the 12 rounds, the nik losses are:\n\nLooking at each round:\n\nRound 0: 0\n\nRound 1: 1\n\nRound 2: 0\n\nRound 3: 1\n\nRound 4: 0\n\nRound 5: 0\n\nRound 6: 1\n\nRound 7: 0\n\nRound 8: 1\n\nRound 9: 0\n\nRound 10: 0\n\nRound 11: 0\n\nTotal nik losses in period: 1+1+1+1 = 4?\n\nWait:\n\nLet me recount:\n\nRound 1: +1 (nik)\n\nRound 3: +1 (nik)\n\nRound 6: +1 (nik)\n\nRound 8: +1 (nik). That's 4 times.\n\nPolycarpus's losses are:\n\nRound 2: +1\n\nRound 4: +1\n\nRound 9: +1\n\nRound 11: +1 → total 4.\n\nSo per_period_nik is 4, per_period_pol is 4.\n\nNow, for the sample input, n is 7. So period is 12. total_periods = 7//12 = 0. remainder is 7.\n\nSo the total is 0 * (4,4) plus the first 7 rounds.\n\nLooking at the first 7 rounds:\n\nRound 0: 0\n\nRound 1: +1 nik\n\nRound 2: +1 pol\n\nRound 3: +1 nik\n\nRound 4: +1 pol\n\nRound 5: 0\n\nRound 6: +1 nik\n\nSo total nik in 7 rounds is 1+1+1 = 3. Pol is 1+1 = 2. Which matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8, 1) is 8.\n\nIn each round, A's move is R, B's move is R. All draws. So per_period_nik and pol are 0. So for n=5, the total is 0 and 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nFirst, read n, A, B.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the sample input given in the problem is:\n\nInput:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is read as:\n\nThe first line is n, then the second line is A, third line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '7', then 'RPS', then 'RSPP'.\n\nSo in code, the input is read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, perhaps the input is given as three lines. So the code should read three lines: first line is n, second line is A, third line is B.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute GCD(m, k). Then LCM(m, k) = m * k // GCD.\n\nBut need to handle GCD. Python's math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. However, note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nThen, period = lcm(m, k).\n\nOnce we have period, we can compute for each of the period rounds, the nik and pol losses.\n\nBut for that, we can loop from 0 to period-1, for each i:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen check who wins.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to period-1:\n\nWe can compute the outcome.\n\nNow, for the entire period, we can compute the total nik and pol losses.\n\nThen, the total_periods = n // period.\n\nremainder = n % period.\n\nThen, the total for the full periods is total_periods * (per_period_nik, per_period_pol).\n\nThen, for the remainder, we need to compute the first 'remainder' rounds, and sum their nik and pol losses.\n\nSo, how to compute that?\n\nWe can precompute for each i in 0 to period-1, the nik_loss and pol_loss for that round. Then, for the remainder, we can take the first 'remainder' entries and sum them.\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can create two lists, for each round in 0..period-1, the nik_loss (0 or 1) and pol_loss (0 or 1). Then, for the full periods, multiply by total_periods, and for the remainder, sum the first 'remainder' entries.\n\nBut for large period (up to 1e6), storing these lists is acceptable.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nCompute per_period_nik and per_period_pol.\n\nThen, for the remainder, compute the sum for the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWe can create two arrays, nik_per_round and pol_per_round, of length period.\n\nThen, for the remainder, sum the first 'remainder' elements of each array.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute for each i in 0 to period-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nthen determine if a and b are same.\n\nif same: add 0 to both.\n\nelse:\n\n   if beats[a] == b: then pol_loss +=1 (so pol_per_round[i] = 1, nik_per_round[i] = 0)\n\n   else: nik_per_round[i] = 1, pol_per_round[i] = 0.\n\nSo, for each i, we can compute these values.\n\nOnce that's done, the total for the full periods is:\n\ntotal_nik = total_periods * sum(nik_per_round)\n\ntotal_pol = total_periods * sum(pol_per_round)\n\nThen, for the remainder:\n\nsum_nik_remainder = sum(nik_per_round[:remainder])\n\nsum_pol_remainder = sum(pol_per_round[:remainder])\n\ntotal_nik += sum_nik_remainder\n\ntotal_pol += sum_pol_remainder\n\nThus, the final answer is total_nik and total_pol.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for very large period (like 1e6), creating these arrays may take some time, but for Python, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the beats dictionary.\n\nBut perhaps using a helper function to check who wins.\n\nAlternatively, for each a and b, check the conditions.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So (0, 1)\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Nikephoros loses. (1, 0)\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nSo for each a and b, returns (nik_loss, pol_loss).\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to period-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nnik, pol = get_outcome(a, b)\n\nadd to nik_per_round and pol_per_round.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for Python, with m and k up to 1000, and period up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    period = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Now compute for each round in 0..period-1, the outcome\n\n    nik_per_round = [0] * period\n\n    pol_per_round = [0] * period\n\n    for i in range(period):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            nik_per_round[i] = 0\n\n            pol_per_round[i] = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n                # Nikephoros wins. Polycarpus loses.\n\n                nik_per_round[i] = 0\n\n                pol_per_round[i] = 1\n\n            else:\n\n                # Nikephoros loses.\n\n                nik_per_round[i] = 1\n\n                pol_per_round[i] = 0\n\n    # Now compute total_periods and remainder\n\n    total_periods = n // period\n\n    remainder = n % period\n\n    # Sum for full periods\n\n    total_nik = total_periods * sum(nik_per_round)\n\n    total_pol = total_periods * sum(pol_per_round)\n\n    # Add remainder part\n\n    total_nik += sum(nik_per_round[:remainder])\n\n    total_pol += sum(pol_per_round[:remainder])\n\n    print(total_nik, total_pol)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 1, the period is 12. For n=7, the remainder is 7. So sum(nik_per_round[:7]) is the sum of the first 7 elements. Which in our example was 3, and sum(pol_per_round[:7]) is 2. Which gives the correct output.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the period is larger than n? Like, for example, when n is smaller than the period. Then, total_periods is 0, and remainder is n. So the code handles that.\n\nTesting the second sample input:\n\nn=5, A is RRRRRRRR (length 8), B is R (length 1). So period is LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nFor each i from 0 to 7:\n\nA[i%8] is R, B[i%1] is R. So all are draws. So nik_per_round and pol_per_round are all zero. So sum(nik_per_round) is 0, sum(pol_per_round) is 0. total_periods is 5//8=0. remainder is 5. sum(nik_per_round[:5]) is 0. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly equal to period. Then remainder is 0, so sum the full periods once.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about the data types. For n up to 2e9, and period up to 1e6, sum(nik_per_round) can be up to 1e6. Multiply by total_periods (up to 2e9 / 1 → 2e9). So total_nik could be up to 2e9 * 1e6 = 2e15, which fits into Python's integers.\n\nSo no issues with integer overflow.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut what about the time complexity?\n\nThe period can be up to 1e6. For each of the 1e6 steps, the code runs O(1) operations. Then, for the sum of the arrays, which is O(period). Then, for the remainder, sum of first remainder elements, which is O(remainder). So overall, O(period) steps. Which for 1e6 is acceptable.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's code it.\n\nBut in Python, for reading input, sometimes there are issues with leading/trailing spaces. But the problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. So the code reads the second and third lines as the sequences.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses sys.stdin.readline() for the first line. But when reading the second and third lines, perhaps there's a possibility that the input is read with trailing newlines. But the strip() removes leading and trailing whitespace, so it's safe.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nLet me check the first sample:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen, m=3, k=4. period=12.\n\nAs discussed, the code computes the nik_per_round and pol_per_round for each of 12 rounds.\n\nsum(nik_per_round) is 4, sum(pol_per_round) is 4.\n\ntotal_periods = 7//12=0. remainder=7.\n\nsum(nik_per_round[:7]) is 3, sum(pol_per_round[:7]) is 2. So output is 3 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=12. Then total_periods=1, remainder=0. So total_nik is 4, total_pol is 4. So output 4 4.\n\nAnother example: n=12*2 + 3. Then total_periods=2, remainder=3. So total_nik is 2*4 + sum of first 3 rounds. Which for first 3 rounds, the nik_per_round is 1 (round 1), 0 (round 2), 1 (round 3). So sum is 1+0+1=2. So total_nik is 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nSo code should handle that.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results given the potentially very large number of rounds.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds. The combined sequence of moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds, where LCM is the least common multiple of `m` and `k`.\n\n2. **Period Calculation**: Calculate the period as the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This period determines after how many rounds the sequence of moves repeats.\n\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors. Track the number of losses for each player during this period.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Losses**: Using the number of full periods within the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds, compute the total number of losses for each player by leveraging the precomputed results from one period.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    nik_per_round = [0] * period\n    pol_per_round = [0] * period\n    \n    for i in range(period):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            nik_per_round[i] = 0\n            pol_per_round[i] = 0\n        else:\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n                # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n                nik_per_round[i] = 0\n                pol_per_round[i] = 1\n            else:\n                # Nikephoros loses\n                nik_per_round[i] = 1\n                pol_per_round[i] = 0\n    \n    total_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    total_nik = total_periods * sum(nik_per_round)\n    total_pol = total_periods * sum(pol_per_round)\n    \n    total_nik += sum(nik_per_round[:remainder])\n    total_pol += sum(pol_per_round[:remainder])\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_pol)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using standard input functions. The first line gives the number of rounds `n`, followed by the move sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the period after which the move sequences repeat.\n\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within the period, the moves of both players are determined. The outcome of each round is evaluated to count losses for each player.\n\n4. **Total Losses Calculation**: The total number of full periods within `n` rounds is calculated. The losses from these full periods are multiplied by the number of periods. The remaining rounds are processed separately to accumulate any additional losses.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the potentially very large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating pattern of moves, thus avoiding the need to simulate each round individually.",
