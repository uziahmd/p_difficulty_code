The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly isn't feasible. So we need an efficient way to compute the results without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The key here is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can calculate the number of losses in each full cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the moves are generated. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], and Polycarpus uses B[i % k]. So for each round, the move depends on the current index modulo the length of their respective sequences.\n\nBut since n can be very large, we can't simulate each round. So we need to find the number of times each player loses over all rounds.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the number of losses for each player. Let's denote:\n\n- For each possible pair (a, b) where a is from A and b is from B, determine who wins. Then, count how many times each such pair occurs in the entire sequence of n rounds. Multiply by the number of times that pair occurs, and sum up the losses accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute the number of times each (a, b) pair occurs?\n\nThe total number of rounds is n. Each round corresponds to a certain (i mod m, i mod k) pair. So for each possible (x, y) where x is in 0..m-1 and y is in 0..k-1, we need to find how many times (x, y) occurs in the first n rounds. Then, for each such occurrence, we check what the outcome is between A[x] and B[y], and accumulate the losses.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (x, y) where x is from A's sequence, y from B's sequence.\n2. For each such pair, find how many times they occur in the n rounds.\n3. For each occurrence, determine if Nikephoros loses, Polycarpus loses, or it's a draw.\n\nBut how to compute the count for each (x, y) pair?\n\nThe total number of times a particular (x, y) occurs is equal to the number of integers i in [0, n-1] such that i mod m = x and i mod k = y.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the number of solutions to the congruence equations i ≡ x mod m and i ≡ y mod k. For each i in 0..n-1.\n\nBut solving this for each (x, y) pair might be computationally intensive if done naively. However, since m and k are up to 1000, the total number of (x, y) pairs is up to 1e6, which is manageable if we can compute the count efficiently for each pair.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\nFor each (x, y) in 0..m-1 and 0..k-1:\n\n- Determine if there exists i such that i ≡ x mod m and i ≡ y mod k. If such i exists, then the number of times this pair occurs is equal to the number of solutions i in [0, n-1].\n\nBut how do I compute this?\n\nThis is a classic problem of solving for i in the system of congruences. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) comes into play here. However, since m and k may not be coprime, the solution exists only if x ≡ y mod gcd(m, k). Wait, no. The system of congruences i ≡ x mod m and i ≡ y mod k has solutions if and only if x ≡ y mod d, where d is gcd(m, k).\n\nSo for each (x, y), first check if x ≡ y mod d, where d = gcd(m, k). If not, then there are zero occurrences. Otherwise, the solutions are periodic with period LCM(m, k). Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the solution for the system i ≡ x mod m and i ≡ y mod k. Let's call the minimal solution t. Then all solutions are of the form t + k * LCM(m, k) / m * ... Wait, perhaps the period is LCM(m, k). Because once you find the first solution, the next solutions are spaced by LCM(m, k). So the solutions are in the form t + L * LCM(m, k) for integer L.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions in [0, n-1] can be calculated as follows:\n\nIf there is no solution, then count is 0.\n\nElse, the first occurrence is t, and then every LCM(m, k) steps. So the total number of occurrences is floor( (n - t - 1) / LCM ) + 1, if t < n.\n\nWait, but how to find t?\n\nAlternatively, for each pair (x, y), we can find the minimal i >=0 that satisfies the congruences, and then compute how many times this i occurs within the range [0, n-1].\n\nBut solving for each (x, y) pair might be computationally expensive. However, given that m and k are up to 1000, and for each pair (x, y) we can compute this, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since m and k are small, we can precompute for all possible (x, y) pairs the number of times they appear in the first n rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the count for each (x, y) pair?\n\nAnother approach: For each i in 0..n-1, the move of Nikephoros is A[i mod m], and Polycarpus is B[i mod k]. So for each (x, y), the number of times that (x, y) occurs is equal to the number of integers i in [0, n-1] where i mod m = x and i mod k = y.\n\nBut for each (x, y), the number of i's that satisfy both congruences is equal to the number of integers i in [0, n-1] that are congruent to x mod m and y mod k.\n\nLet me think of this as the intersection of two arithmetic progressions. The problem is to find the size of the intersection of these two sets within the range [0, n-1].\n\nTo find the count for (x, y), we can find the minimal i that satisfies the congruences, then compute how many terms are in the arithmetic sequence starting at that i with step LCM(m, k) up to n-1.\n\nBut how to find that minimal i?\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as solving for i in the equations:\n\ni = x + a*m\n\ni = y + b*k\n\nfor integers a, b >=0.\n\nSo x + a*m = y + b*k → a*m - b*k = y -x.\n\nThis is a linear Diophantine equation. The solutions exist only if gcd(m, k) divides (y - x). Let's denote d = gcd(m, k). So if (y -x) is not divisible by d, there are no solutions. Otherwise, there are solutions.\n\nOnce we know that there are solutions, we can find the minimal i that satisfies the congruence and is >=0.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Since m and k are up to 1000, perhaps for each (x, y) pair, we can compute the number of times they appear by checking for all possible i in the range [0, LCM(m, k)-1], and then see how many times that pattern repeats.\n\nWait, the LCM(m, k) is the period after which the combination of (i mod m, i mod k) repeats. So for each possible i in 0..LCM-1, the pair (i mod m, i mod k) is unique? No, but the sequence of pairs will repeat every LCM(m, k) steps.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence of (x, y) pairs for the first LCM(m, k) rounds is a cycle. So for any n, we can compute how many full cycles there are, and then the remainder.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\nCompute the total number of full cycles, say q = n // LCM, and the remainder r = n % LCM.\n\nFor each (x, y) pair in the first LCM rounds, count how many times they appear in the full cycles and in the remainder.\n\nBut how to compute for each (x, y) pair how many times they appear in the LCM-length cycle?\n\nWell, for each i in 0..LCM-1, we can compute (i mod m, i mod k) and count how many times each (x, y) pair occurs in this cycle. Then, for each (x, y), the number of times it appears in the full cycles is q * count_in_cycle, and then add the count in the first r rounds of the next cycle.\n\nBut this approach would require for each (x, y) pair, to find how many times they appear in the LCM-length cycle. However, since LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1e3, their LCM can be up to 1e6), and for each of the 1e6 possible i's, we can compute their (x, y) pair, and then for each (x, y) pair, we can count how many times it occurs in the LCM-length cycle.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1e3, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6. So for each (x, y) pair, we can precompute how many times they appear in the LCM cycle. Then, for the total n rounds, the number of times (x, y) occurs is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // LCM\n\nremainder = n % LCM\n\ncount_in_cycle = precomputed_count[x][y]\n\ntotal = full_cycles * count_in_cycle + count_in_remainder_part\n\nBut how to compute count_in_remainder_part?\n\nWell, the remainder is r = n % LCM. So for the first r rounds (i=0 to r-1), we can check how many times (x, y) appears in those rounds. But again, for each (x, y), we can precompute for all possible positions in the LCM cycle, and then for the remainder, just check how many times (x, y) appears in the first r rounds.\n\nBut this seems computationally feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute LCM of m and k. Let's call it L.\n\n2. Precompute for each i in 0..L-1, the (x, y) pair where x = i mod m, y = i mod k.\n\n3. For each (x, y) pair, count how many times they appear in the L-length cycle. Let's call this cnt[x][y].\n\n4. Then, the total number of times (x, y) occurs in n rounds is:\n\n   total = full_cycles * cnt[x][y] + cnt_remainder[x][y]\n\n   where full_cycles = n // L, and cnt_remainder is the number of times (x, y) appears in the first r rounds (r = n % L) of the cycle.\n\nBut how to compute cnt_remainder[x][y]?\n\nWe can precompute for each position in the L-length cycle, and for each (x, y) pair, store all the indices where they occur. Then, for a given r, we can count how many of those indices are less than r.\n\nBut storing for each (x, y) a list of positions in the cycle may take O(L) space. However, with L up to 1e6, and (x, y) pairs up to 1e6, this would be O(1e6) storage, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial precomputation, for each (x, y) pair, we can store a list of positions in the cycle where it occurs. Then, for a given r, the count_remainder is the number of elements in that list that are less than r.\n\nBut for each (x, y), the list can be sorted, and we can perform a binary search to find how many elements are less than r.\n\nBut this approach would require O(L) time and space for the precomputing.\n\nBut given that m and k are up to 1e3, L is up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k)\n\nprecompute for each i in 0..L-1:\n\n   x = i % m\n\n   y = i % k\n\n   store in a list for (x, y) the positions i.\n\nThen, for each (x, y), the list of positions is stored. Then, for a given r, the number of times (x, y) appears in the first r rounds is the number of positions in the list that are < r.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nWell, for each (x, y), during pre-processing, we can collect all the positions in the cycle where (x, y) occurs, and sort them. Then, for a given r, we can use binary search to find how many positions are less than r.\n\nBut for each (x, y), the positions are in the order of 0, ..., L-1. So for example, if (x, y) occurs at positions 0, 5, 10, etc., then the list is sorted. So during pre-processing, for each (x, y), we can collect all positions i where (x, y) occurs, and sort them. Then, for any r, the count is the number of elements in the list that are less than r.\n\nBut for each (x, y), the list can be empty (if there are no i's in the L-length cycle that satisfy the (x, y) pair). But in that case, the count is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the initial pass, for each i in 0..L-1, we can increment a counter for (x, y) pair. Then, for each (x, y), cnt[x][y] is the number of times it occurs in the L-length cycle. And for the remainder part, we can create a prefix array for each (x, y) that tells how many times it has occurred up to each position in the cycle. But that may be more complex.\n\nBut perhaps for the remainder, the easiest way is to precompute for each (x, y) the list of positions in the cycle, and for a given r, perform a binary search on the list to find how many are less than r.\n\nBut for each (x, y), the list can be generated once.\n\nBut let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can first compute m and k, then compute LCM(m, k). How to compute LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b // GCD(a, b). So we need to compute GCD. Python's math module has gcd, but for Python versions before 3.5, perhaps we need to implement it. However, assuming that the code will run in a recent environment, we can use math.gcd. Also, note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nOnce L is computed, for each i in 0 to L-1:\n\n   x = i % m\n\n   y = i % k\n\n   append i to a dictionary entry for (x, y).\n\nOnce that is done, for each (x, y) pair, we can have a sorted list of positions in the cycle where this pair occurs.\n\nNow, for each (x, y) pair, the count_in_cycle is len(list_of_positions).\n\nThen, for the total n rounds, the number of times this pair occurs is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // L\n\nremainder = n % L\n\ncount = full_cycles * len(list_of_positions) + number of positions in list_of_positions that are < remainder.\n\nBut how to compute the number of positions in list_of_positions that are < remainder?\n\nSince the list_of_positions is sorted (as we process i from 0 to L-1 in order), we can perform a binary search to find the first element >= remainder, and then the index is the count.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can help here. For example, using bisect_left to find the insertion point of remainder in the list, which gives the number of elements less than remainder.\n\nSo for each (x, y) pair, we can precompute the list and then during the calculation for n rounds, for each (x, y), compute how many times it occurs.\n\nOnce we have the count for each (x, y) pair, we can then compute for each pair, whether Nikephoros loses, Polycarpus loses, or it's a draw. Then multiply by the count and accumulate the totals.\n\nSo the overall steps:\n\n1. Read input: n, A, B.\n\n2. Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n3. Compute L = LCM(m, k).\n\n4. Preprocess for each (x, y) pair, the list of positions in the cycle.\n\n   For example, create a dictionary, say positions_dict, where the keys are tuples (x, y), and the values are lists of integers (the positions in the cycle).\n\n5. For each (x, y) in positions_dict:\n\n   For each occurrence in the cycle, we can check what the outcome is between A[x] and B[y].\n\n   So, for each (x, y), we can precompute the outcome (which player loses, if any).\n\n   For example, for each (x, y), determine if A[x] beats B[y], B[y] beats A[x], or it's a draw.\n\n   Then, for each occurrence of this (x, y) pair in the n rounds, we can add to the respective counts.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nOnce we have the count of occurrences for each (x, y) pair, we can loop through all possible (x, y) pairs, compute the outcome once, and multiply by the count.\n\nSo, for each (x, y) pair:\n\n   a = A[x]\n\n   b = B[y]\n\n   determine the outcome:\n\n   if a == b: no loss.\n\n   else:\n\n      if (a beats b):\n\n          Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a red spot (so Nikephoros's loss count increases by 0, Polycarpus's by 1?)\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the loser gets pinched. So in each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser and gets a spot. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros is the loser and gets a spot. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo for each (a, b) pair:\n\n   if a beats b: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarpus's is +1).\n\n   if b beats a: Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros gets a spot (Nikephoros's count +1, Polycarpus's 0).\n\n   else: no change.\n\nSo for each (x, y) pair, we can compute the outcome once, and then multiply by the number of times this pair occurs.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nInitialize total_nik = 0, total_poly = 0.\n\nFor each (x, y) in positions_dict:\n\n   count = number of times this pair occurs in n rounds (as computed earlier).\n\n   a = A[x], b = B[y]\n\n   determine outcome:\n\n   if a == b: continue.\n\n   elif (a beats b):\n\n       total_poly += count\n\n   else:\n\n       total_nik += count\n\nThus, the problem is solved.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently in Python, considering the constraints.\n\nBut how to handle the (x, y) pairs? For example, some (x, y) pairs may not appear in the positions_dict. But since we generate all possible i in 0..L-1, and for each i, we generate (x, y) pairs, the positions_dict will contain all possible (x, y) pairs that can occur. However, some (x, y) pairs may not be present in the positions_dict if they don't occur in the cycle. Wait, no. Because for each i, the (x, y) is added to the positions_dict. So for any (x, y) that can be generated by i mod m and i mod k, they will be present. However, some (x, y) pairs may not be present in the positions_dict if there is no i in 0..L-1 that satisfies i mod m = x and i mod k = y. But that's possible only if the congruence system has no solution. However, since L is the LCM of m and k, the system of congruences i ≡ x mod m and i ≡ y mod k has solutions if and only if x ≡ y mod d, where d = gcd(m, k). But since L is the LCM, which is m*k/d, and since the cycle is L, then for each i in 0..L-1, the (x, y) pairs are generated, and for those (x, y) that are compatible, they will be present in the positions_dict. For incompatible (x, y) pairs, they will not be present in the positions_dict. However, when we iterate through all possible (x, y) pairs, we need to check if they are present in the positions_dict. But perhaps it's easier to generate all (x, y) pairs that are present in the positions_dict, and for each of those, process them.\n\nBut how to generate all possible (x, y) pairs that are present in the positions_dict?\n\nWell, the positions_dict will have entries for all (x, y) pairs that are present in the cycle. So during the processing, we can loop through all the keys in the positions_dict.\n\nBut perhaps in Python, the positions_dict can be a defaultdict(list), and for each i in 0..L-1, we append to the (x, y) key. Then, after that, for each key in positions_dict, we can process it.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\npositions_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(L):\n\n    x = i % m\n\n    y = i % k\n\n    positions_dict[(x, y)].append(i)\n\nThen, for each (x, y) in positions_dict, we can process.\n\nBut then, for all (x, y) pairs that are not in positions_dict, they have zero occurrences. So we can ignore them.\n\nSo the code can proceed as:\n\nOnce the positions_dict is built, for each (x, y) in positions_dict:\n\n   compute the count of occurrences in n rounds.\n\n   compute the outcome.\n\n   add to the totals accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each (x, y) in positions_dict, how many times it occurs in n rounds.\n\nWhich requires for each (x, y) pair:\n\n   list_of_positions = positions_dict[(x, y)]\n\n   len_list = len(list_of_positions)\n\n   full_cycles = n // L\n\n   remainder = n % L\n\n   count = full_cycles * len_list\n\n   # Now, for the remainder part, count how many elements in list_of_positions are < remainder.\n\n   # Since list_of_positions is sorted (because we added i in order from 0 to L-1), we can use bisect.\n\n   import bisect\n\n   cnt_remainder = bisect.bisect_left(list_of_positions, remainder)\n\n   count += cnt_remainder\n\n   then, process count.\n\nBut for each (x, y) pair, the list_of_positions is sorted, because we added i in increasing order. So yes.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Precompute the positions_dict.\n\n- For each (x, y) in positions_dict:\n\n   process as above.\n\nBut for large L (up to 1e6), and for each (x, y) pair, the list_of_positions could be of varying lengths. However, the total number of (x, y) pairs is O(L), which is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo m = 3, k =4. LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nFor each i from 0 to 11:\n\ni | i%3 | i%4 | (x,y)\n\n0: 0,0 → (0,0)\n\n1: 1,1 → (1,1)\n\n2: 2,2 → (2,2)\n\n3: 0,3 → (0,3)\n\n4: 1,0 → (1,0)\n\n5: 2,1 → (2,1)\n\n6: 0, 2 → (0,2)\n\n7: 1, 3 → (1,3)\n\n8: 2, 0 → (2,0)\n\n9: 0, 1 → (0,1)\n\n10: 1, 2 → (1,2)\n\n11: 2, 3 → (2,3)\n\nSo for each (x,y) pair in positions_dict, the list_of_positions is the list of i's where they occur.\n\nThen, for n=7, L=12, full_cycles = 0, remainder=7.\n\nFor each (x,y) in positions_dict, we check how many of their positions are <7.\n\nFor example, the (0,0) occurs at i=0 → 0<7 → count_remainder=1.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) occurs at i=1 → count_remainder=1.\n\nBut let's look at the sample explanation. The first sample's rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (since P is paper, S is scissors. Scissors beats paper. So Nikephoros's move is P, which loses to S. So Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nWait, the first sample input is:\n\nn=7, A is \"RPS\" (so m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4).\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 0 (assuming 0-based index):\n\ni=0: A[0] = R, B[0] = R → draw.\n\ni=1: A[1] = P, B[1] = S → P vs S. S beats P. So Nikephoros (P) loses → his count increases by 1.\n\ni=2: A[2] = S, B[2] = P → S beats P. So Polycarpus loses → his count increases by 1.\n\ni=3: A[0] = R (i=3 mod 3 is 0), B[3 mod 4=3 → B[3] is P. R vs P → P beats R. Nikephoros loses → count increases by 1.\n\ni=4: A[1] = P, B[0] = R → P beats R. Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets a spot. So Nikephoros's count is 0, Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\ni=5: A[2] = S, B[1] = S → draw.\n\ni=6: A[0] = R, B[2] = P → R vs P → P beats R. Nikephoros loses → count increases by 1.\n\nWait, but according to the sample explanation, the output is 3 and 2.\n\nSo in the sample explanation, Nikephoros has 3 losses (so total_nik =3), and Polycarpus has 2 (total_poly=2). Let's see:\n\nLooking at each round:\n\nRound 0: draw → no one.\n\nRound 1: Nikephoros loses → total_nik +=1.\n\nRound 2: Polycarpus loses → total_poly +=1.\n\nRound 3: Nikephoros loses → total_nik +=1.\n\nRound 4: Polycarpus loses → total_poly +=1.\n\nRound 5: draw.\n\nRound 6: Nikephoros loses → total_nik +=1.\n\nTotal: 3 and 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo in this case, for the 7 rounds, the code should process each (x,y) pair.\n\nBut according to our approach, for each (x,y) pair, we compute how many times they occur in the 7 rounds.\n\nFor example, the (x,y) pair (1,1) occurs once (i=1). Which is in the first 7 rounds. So it contributes once. The outcome is P vs S → S beats P → Nikephoros loses → total_nik +=1.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) occurs once (i=2): S vs P → S beats P → Polycarpus loses → total_poly +=1.\n\nBut how does the code compute this?\n\nIn the code, for each (x,y) pair, we compute the count, then check the outcome.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the computational complexity.\n\nThe LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6. For each of the 1e6 iterations, we process the (x,y) pairs. Then, for each (x,y) pair in the positions_dict, which can be up to 1e6 entries, we perform a bisect operation. The bisect is O(log s), where s is the number of elements in the list for that (x,y) pair. Since for each i, exactly one (x,y) pair is added, the total number of elements across all lists is L (1e6). So the total time for all bisect operations is O(1e6 log s), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work for the given constraints.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, need to compute LCM and GCD.\n\nImplementing GCD:\n\nPython's math.gcd(a, b) returns the GCD of a and b. However, note that in Python 3.5+, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nSo LCM(m, k) = m * k // gcd(m, k).\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nThen, build the positions_dict as a defaultdict(list), and for each i in 0 to L-1, append i to the (x, y) entry.\n\nOnce that is done, for each (x, y) in positions_dict:\n\n   list_of_positions = positions_dict[(x, y)]\n\n   len_list = len(list_of_positions)\n\n   full_cycles = n // L\n\n   remainder = n % L\n\n   count = full_cycles * len_list\n\n   # compute cnt_remainder:\n\n   cnt_remainder = bisect.bisect_left(list_of_positions, remainder)\n\n   count += cnt_remainder\n\n   then, check the outcome between A[x] and B[y].\n\n   if a == b: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      if a beats b:\n\n          total_poly += count\n\n      else:\n\n          total_nik += count\n\nBut how to check if a beats b?\n\nWe can write a helper function:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # a wins, so b loses (so Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot)\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # b wins, Nikephoros loses\n\nSo, for example, if a is 'R' and b is 'S', a wins → Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus's count increases by count.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor (x, y) in positions_dict:\n\n    list_of_positions = positions_dict[(x, y)]\n\n    ... compute count ...\n\n    a = A[x]\n\n    b = B[y]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    res = get_result(a, b)\n\n    if res == 1:\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot → total_poly += count\n\n        total_poly += count\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot → total_nik += count\n\n        total_nik += count\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase when n is 0? But according to input constraints, n ≥ 1.\n\nAnother case: when m or k is 1. For example, if m=1, then the sequence for Nikephoros is always A[0].\n\nAnother case: when L is larger than n. For example, n=5 and L=10. Then full_cycles is 0, remainder is 5. So we check how many positions are less than 5.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the LCM correctly.\n\n- The positions_dict may have (x, y) pairs that are not possible (but no, since for each i, we generate (x, y) pairs, which are possible).\n\nAnother thing: the code must read the input correctly. For example, the first input line is n. Then the second line is A, third line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, the input format is:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A.\n\nThe third line contains sequence B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of two elements? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. The actual input would be:\n\nThe first line is 7.\n\nSecond line is RPS.\n\nThird line is RSPP.\n\nBut in the sample input, perhaps the user intended to show that the first input is 7, then the second line is RPS, third is RSPP. Then another example with input 5, etc. But the way the sample input is written is confusing. However, the code should read the input correctly. So the code should read n from stdin, then read A, then read B.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys, math, bisect\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        while b:\n\n            a, b = b, a % b\n\n        return a\n\n    d = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    L = m * k // d\n\n    positions_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(L):\n\n        x = i % m\n\n        y = i % k\n\n        positions_dict[(x, y)].append(i)\n\n    total_nik = 0\n\n    total_poly = 0\n\n    for (x, y) in positions_dict:\n\n        list_pos = positions_dict[(x, y)]\n\n        len_list = len(list_pos)\n\n        full_cycles = n // L\n\n        remainder = n % L\n\n        count = full_cycles * len_list\n\n        # compute how many in list_pos are < remainder\n\n        cnt_remainder = bisect.bisect_left(list_pos, remainder)\n\n        count += cnt_remainder\n\n        a = A[x]\n\n        b = B[y]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        # determine who wins\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # a wins, so Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n            total_poly += count\n\n        else:\n\n            # b wins, Nikephoros loses\n\n            total_nik += count\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input:\n\nFor the first example, n=7.\n\nThe code computes L=3*4 / gcd(3,4)= 12/1=12.\n\nThen, for each (x, y) in positions_dict, process.\n\nFor example, (x=1, y=1) is in the positions_dict, with list_pos = [1]. For remainder=7, bisect_left([1], 7) returns 1. So count is 0 * 1 + 1 = 1. Then, a is A[1] = 'P', B[1] = 'S'. So a is P, b is S. Check if a beats b: S beats P? Wait, the condition is:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') → a wins.\n\nor (a == 'S' and b == 'P') → a wins.\n\nor (a == 'P' and b == 'R') → a wins.\n\nIn this case, a is P, b is S. So none of the above. So the else clause is triggered. Which means that b wins. But what's the outcome between P and S?\n\nRock-Paper-Scissors rules: S (scissors) beats P (paper). So in this case, b (S",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after they play rock-paper-scissors for `n` rounds using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results given the potentially very large value of `n` (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of their chosen moves. Nikephoros uses sequence A and Polycarpus uses sequence B. The moves repeat cyclically.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The key insight is that the combination of moves from both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute results for one full cycle and then extrapolate for the entire number of rounds.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By leveraging the LCM, we can precompute all possible move pairs within one cycle and use this information to determine the number of times each pair occurs in `n` rounds. This avoids simulating each round individually.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute GCD and LCM\n    d = math.gcd(m, k)\n    L = m * k // d\n    \n    positions_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(L):\n        x = i % m\n        y = i % k\n        positions_dict[(x, y)].append(i)\n    \n    total_nik = 0\n    total_poly = 0\n    \n    for (x, y) in positions_dict:\n        list_pos = positions_dict[(x, y)]\n        len_list = len(list_pos)\n        full_cycles = n // L\n        remainder = n % L\n        \n        count = full_cycles * len_list\n        cnt_remainder = bisect.bisect_left(list_pos, remainder)\n        count += cnt_remainder\n        \n        a = A[x]\n        b = B[y]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        \n        # Determine the winner\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            total_poly += count\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            total_nik += count\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values for the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences A and B are read.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of sequences A and B is calculated to determine the cycle length.\n3. **Preprocessing Move Pairs**: For each index in the LCM cycle, the corresponding moves from A and B are recorded. This helps in determining how often each move pair occurs within a cycle.\n4. **Counting Occurrences**: For each move pair, the number of occurrences in `n` rounds is computed by considering full cycles and the remaining rounds after the last full cycle.\n5. **Determining Winners**: For each move pair, the winner is determined based on rock-paper-scissors rules, and the respective counts of red spots are updated accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large value of `n` by leveraging cycle detection and precomputation, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
