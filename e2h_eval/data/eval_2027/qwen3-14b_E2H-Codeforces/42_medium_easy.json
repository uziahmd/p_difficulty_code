    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo the problem is about copying files and tracking two progress bars. The first shows the percentage of the current file copied, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are floored to integers. After each byte copied, these percentages are updated. We need to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown on both progress bars at the same time.\n\nThe input gives n files with their sizes. The output is all such numbers in order.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, think about all possible moments when the progress bars are updated. Each byte copied is a moment. But since the files can be up to 1000 bytes, and there are up to 100 files, the total number of bytes is up to 100 * 1000 = 100,000. So for each byte copied, we can compute the two percentages and check if they are equal. Then collect all such values.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the values are updated after each byte. So for each byte x in file i, after copying that byte, the progress bars are updated. So the total number of steps is sum(a_i) steps. For each step, compute both percentages and check if they are equal.\n\nBut for each step, how do I compute the two percentages?\n\nLet me formalize:\n\nFor each byte copied, which is part of some file i. Let's say that up to this point, the total bytes copied is total = sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j + x, where x ranges from 1 to a_i (since each byte is copied one by one).\n\nWait, but the initial state is before any bytes are copied. Both bars show 0. So that's also a moment. But according to the problem statement, the initial state is considered as 0% for both. So we need to include that.\n\nBut how? Let me think: when the first byte is copied, the first bar is floor(100 * 1 / a_1), and the second is floor(100 * (sum of all bytes up to that point) / total_sum). But the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0 for both. So that's a valid moment.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Compute the total_sum = sum(a_1 ... a_n).\n\n- For each possible moment (including the initial state?), check the two percentages.\n\nBut how to model all the moments?\n\nThe initial state is before any bytes are copied. So that's a moment where both are 0. Then, after each byte is copied, there's another moment. So the total number of moments is sum(a_i) + 1? Because the initial state is 0, then after each byte, there's a new state. Wait, no. Because after the first byte is copied, it's the first moment. The initial state is before any bytes. So for example, if there's one file of size 1, then there are two moments: initial (0%) and after copying the byte (100%).\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the initial state is considered. So for each byte copied, we have to check after that byte. Also, the initial state (0%) is a moment when both are 0. So that's included.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize a set to collect all the valid percentages.\n\nAdd 0 to the set if it's present (since initial state is 0% for both).\n\nThen, for each byte copied (each step), compute the current percentage for the current file and the overall percentage. If they are equal, add that value to the set.\n\nBut how to iterate through all the bytes?\n\nLet me think about the process:\n\nFor each file i from 1 to n:\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current byte is x in file i.\n\n       current_file_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j + x\n\n       overall_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum)\n\n       if current_file_percent == overall_percent, add to the set.\n\nBut also, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0 for both. So we need to check that. So 0 is added to the set.\n\nWait, but when all bytes are copied, the total is total_sum. So the last step is after the last byte. At that moment, the overall percent is 100. And the current file percent is floor(100 * a_i / a_i) = 100. So that's included.\n\nBut what about the case when the total_sum is zero? Well, the input constraints say that a_i >= 1, so total_sum is at least 1. So division by zero is not possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0 to the set (the initial state).\n\nThen for each file i, and for each x in 1 to a_i:\n\n   compute current_file_percent = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n   compute total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is sum of a_1 to a_{i-1}\n\n   compute overall_percent = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\n   if current_file_percent == overall_percent, add to the set.\n\nOnce all steps are processed, collect all elements in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So in that case, the total_bytes_so_far is 0. So the overall_percent is 0. The current_file_percent is 0 (since no bytes are copied yet). So that's why 0 is added. However, in the code above, the initial 0 is added, but during the processing of the first byte, the code checks for x=1, etc. So maybe the initial 0 is already covered by the first step?\n\nWait, no. Because the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So when the first byte is copied, the code checks for x=1. But the initial state is a separate moment. So for example, in the first test case where there is one file of size 6, the initial state is 0% for both. Then after each byte, the current and overall percent are same. So the 0 is added once, and then other values are added.\n\nBut according to the first sample input:\n\nInput is 1 and 6. Output includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWait, the first sample's output is 0, 16, etc. So the initial 0 is included. So in the code, the initial 0 is added to the set. Then, during processing of each byte, the code checks if the current percentages are same. So for example, when x=1, the current_file_percent is (1*100)/6 = 16.666..., which is floored to 16. The total bytes so far is 1, total_sum is 6. So overall percent is (1 * 100)/6 = 16.666... floored to 16. So 16 is added. So the initial 0 is included, and then 16, etc.\n\nSo the code needs to include the initial 0. But wait, when the code is processing the first byte, the current_file_percent is 16, and the overall is 16. So that's added. But the initial 0 is added as a separate case. However, in the first sample, the output includes 0, which comes from the initial state. But during processing, when x=0? No, because x starts from 1. So the initial state is not captured in the processing of the bytes. Hence, the code must add 0 to the set first.\n\nBut how to make sure that 0 is included? Because in the initial state, both progress bars are 0. So even if during processing of the bytes, there's no moment where both are 0 (except the initial state), then 0 should be added.\n\nBut in the first sample, after the first byte, the current_file_percent is 16, which is not 0. So the initial 0 is a separate case.\n\nTherefore, the code must start by adding 0 to the set, and then process all the bytes, checking for equality between the two percentages.\n\nBut wait, what about when the total bytes is 0? Well, that's only possible when there are zero files, but the input constraints say n >= 1. So no problem.\n\nSo the steps for code:\n\nRead n, then the list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set called result.\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen, for each file i (from 0 to n-1 in 0-based index?), compute the sum_prev as the sum of previous files. For example, for the first file, sum_prev is 0. For the second file, sum_prev is a[0], etc.\n\nThen for each x in 1 to a[i], compute:\n\ncurrent_file_percent = (x * 100) // a[i]\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\noverall_percent = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\nif current_file_percent == overall_percent, add to the set.\n\nOnce all are processed, collect the elements in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what about the final state when all bytes are copied? For example, when all bytes are copied, the total_bytes_so_far is total_sum, which gives overall_percent = 100. The current_file_percent for the last byte is (a_i * 100) // a_i = 100. So that's added. So the 100 is in the set.\n\nBut in the code, when x is a[i], then the current_file_percent is 100. So yes, that's added.\n\nBut in the initial code, the 0 is added. But what about when the overall_percent is 100? It's handled in the loop.\n\nNow, considering the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nTotal sum is 6.\n\nInitial 0 is added.\n\nThen for x from 1 to 6:\n\nfor x=1, current_file_percent = 100 * 1 /6 = 16.666... floored to 16. total_bytes_so_far is 1. overall_percent is 100 *1/6 = 16.666... floored to 16. So 16 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x=2, 2*100/6=33.333... floored to 33. total is 2, 2*100/6=33.333... so 33. So added.\n\nx=3: 3*100/6=50. total is 3, 3*100/6=50. So 50 added.\n\nx=4: 4*100/6=66.666... floored to 66. total is 4, 4*100/6=66.666... floored to 66. So added.\n\nx=5: 5*100/6=83.333... floored to 83. total is 5, 5*100/6=83.333... same. So added.\n\nx=6: 6*100/6=100. total is 6, 6*100/6=100. So added.\n\nThus the set has 0,16,33,50,66,83,100. Which matches the first sample's output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is 2 files, 100 and 500. Total sum is 600.\n\nThe output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nLet me think. For example, when the first file is being copied, the overall progress is (x)/600 *100. For example, when x is 100, the first file is done. The overall is 100/600 *100 = 16.666... floored to 16. But the current file percent is 100. So they are not equal. But during the copying of the first file, the overall progress is low, while the current file percent is higher. So perhaps during the first file, the only time when both are same is when x is 0 (initial state) and maybe other times?\n\nBut according to the sample output, the numbers include 0,95,...,100. So perhaps during the second file, when the overall progress is approaching 100%, and the current file percent is also approaching 100%.\n\nBut let's see. Let's take the case when the second file is being copied. The sum_prev is 100. So for x bytes copied in the second file (size 500), total_bytes_so_far is 100 + x.\n\nThe overall percent is floor( (100 + x) * 100 / 600 )\n\nThe current file percent is floor( x * 100 / 500 )\n\nWe need to find x where these are equal.\n\nFor example, when x is 500, the total is 600. overall is 100, current is 100. So added.\n\nBut for x= 499:\n\ncurrent_file_percent is (499 * 100)/500 = 99.8 → 99.\n\noverall is (100 + 499) * 100 /600 = 599 * 100 /600 = 99.833... → 99. So same. So 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly, x=498:\n\ncurrent is 498 * 100 /500 = 99.6 → 99.\n\noverall is (100 + 498) * 100 /600 = 598 * 100 /600 = 99.666... → 99. So same. So 99 is added again. But since it's a set, it's stored once.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 495:\n\ncurrent is (495 * 100)/500 = 99. So 99.\n\noverall is (100+495) * 100 /600 = 595 * 100 /600 = 99.166... → 99. So same.\n\nSo for many x in the second file, the percentages are same. But how do they get 95, 96, etc.?\n\nLet me think of when the overall percent is 95. Let's compute for overall percent 95.\n\noverall_percent = floor( (100 + x)*100 /600 ) = 95.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n95 ≤ (100 + x) * 100 /600 < 96.\n\nMultiply all by 600:\n\n95 *6 = 570 ≤ (100 + x)*100 < 96 *6 = 576.\n\nDivide by 100:\n\n5.7 ≤ 100 + x < 5.76 → wait no, wait:\n\nWait, original equation:\n\n(100 + x) * 100 / 600 = (100 +x)/6.\n\nSo 95 ≤ (100 +x)/6 < 96 → multiply by 6:\n\n570 ≤ 100 +x < 576 → subtract 100:\n\n470 ≤ x < 476.\n\nSince x is between 1 and 500.\n\nSo x can be 470, 471, ..., 475.\n\nNow, for each of these x, the current_file_percent is floor( x * 100 / 500 ) = floor( (x * 2)/10 ) ?\n\nWait, 100/500 is 0.2. So x * 0.2.\n\nSo for x=470: 470 * 0.2 = 94. So floor is 94. But the overall is 95. So not equal. So why does the sample output have 95?\n\nAh, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, the overall percent is 95. So during the second file, when x is such that the overall is 95. But the current file percent is floor( x * 100 / 500 ). So for x in 470 to 475, the current percent is:\n\nx=470: 470 * 100 /500 = 94 → floor 94.\n\nx=475: 475 * 100 /500 = 95 → floor 95.\n\nSo for x=475, the current percent is 95. And the overall is 95. So that's a match.\n\nSo when x=475, the overall is (100+475) = 575. 575 * 100 / 600 = 95.833... → floor 95. So yes, 95 equals 95. So that's a match.\n\nSo x=475 is a case where both are 95. So 95 is added to the set.\n\nSimilarly, for x=476, the overall is (100 +476)= 576 → 576 * 100 /600 = 96. So overall is 96. The current percent is 476 * 100 /500 = 95.2 → 95. So not equal.\n\nSo the 95 is added when x=475.\n\nSo the code would capture that.\n\nSo the code approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, no. The user input is given as per the problem statement. For example, the first line is n, then the next line has n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. But in the actual code, the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given in the standard way. So for example, the first line is n, then the second line has the a_i.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read the next line, split into list of integers.\n\nThen compute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set called result = set()\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen for each file in a:\n\n   sum_prev is the sum of previous files. So we need to track the cumulative sum.\n\n   For example, for the first file, sum_prev is 0. For the second file, sum_prev is a[0], etc.\n\nSo we can compute a prefix sum array. Or, we can keep track of the sum_prev as we iterate through the files.\n\nLike:\n\ncurrent_sum_prev = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n        current_file_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = current_sum_prev + x\n\n        overall_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_file_percent == overall_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_file_percent)\n\n    current_sum_prev += current_file_size\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\ncurrent_sum_prev = 0\n\nfor each file in a:\n\n    file_size = current file's size\n\n    for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n        current_file_percent = (x * 100) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = current_sum_prev + x\n\n        overall_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_file_percent == overall_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_file_percent)\n\n    current_sum_prev += file_size\n\nOnce all done, collect the sorted list of elements in result.\n\nThen print them each on separate lines, joined by newlines.\n\nWait, but the sample outputs have for the first input:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is the sorted list of the set.\n\nSo after collecting the set, we need to sort it, then print each element in order.\n\nBut what about the case where the same value is added multiple times? Since it's a set, duplicates are handled.\n\nNow, what about the initial 0?\n\nIn the first sample, the initial 0 is added. Then, during processing, the code adds 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. So the set contains 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 2 files of 100 and 500. The output includes 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nSo during the processing of the first file (size 100), the code checks for x from 1 to 100.\n\nFor each x, current_file_percent is (x * 100) // 100 = x. The total_bytes is 0 + x = x. The overall_percent is (x * 100) // 600. So for x=0, it's 0, but that's already added. For x=1, current is 1, overall is 0. So not equal. For x=6, current is 6, overall is (6*100)/600 = 1. Not equal. So during the first file, no matches except maybe for x=0 (but that's already added). So during the first file, no additions except the initial 0.\n\nThen during the second file, the code processes x from 1 to 500. For example, when x=475, as discussed earlier, the current_file_percent is 475 * 100 / 500 = 95. The total_bytes is 100 + 475 = 575. 575 * 100 / 600 = 95.833... → 95. So added.\n\nSimilarly, when x= 480, current is (480 * 100)/500 = 96. The total_bytes is 100+480 = 580. 580 * 100 /600 = 96.666... → 96. So 96 is added.\n\nSo the code would collect 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 (and others?), but according to the sample output, those numbers are present.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if all files are size 1?\n\nFor example, n=2, a = [1, 1]. total_sum = 2.\n\nInitial 0 is added.\n\nProcessing first file (size 1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_file_percent is (1 * 100) //1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes is 0 + 1 = 1. overall_percent is (1 * 100) // 2 = 50. Not equal. So not added.\n\nProcessing second file (size 1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_file_percent is 100.\n\ntotal_bytes is 1 + 1 = 2. overall_percent is (2 * 100) // 2 = 100. So added. So the set has 0, 100.\n\nAnother case: n=1, a = [1]. Then, initial 0 is added. Then x=1: current is 100, overall is 100. So set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother edge case: when the total_sum is 1. For example, n=1, a = [1]. Then, the initial 0, and after x=1, both are 100. So output is 0, 100.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a = [1, 1]. So the initial 0 is added. Then during processing first file, x=1: current is 100, overall is 50. Not same. Then during second file, x=1: current is 100, overall is 100. So set is {0, 100}.\n\nNow, code.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize result = set().\n\nAdd 0 to result.\n\ncurrent_sum_prev = 0\n\nfor each file in a:\n\n    file_size = current file's size.\n\n    for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n        current_file_percent = (x * 100) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = current_sum_prev + x\n\n        overall_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_file_percent == overall_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_file_percent)\n\n    current_sum_prev += file_size\n\nOnce done, sort the result, and print each in order.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, what about when the total_sum is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, a_i >= 1. So sum is at least 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\ncurrent_sum_prev = 0\n\nfor file_size in a:\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = current_sum_prev + x\n\n        overall_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == overall_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\n    current_sum_prev += file_size\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first sample's output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich matches the code's output.\n\nBut in the first sample, when x=6, the code adds 100. So the set has 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nWhich would generate the output 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nBut according to the code, during the processing of the second file, there are multiple x that would generate the same percentages.\n\nBut the code adds all of them, but since it's a set, duplicates are removed.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the second sample.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=2, a = [100, 500]\n\ntotal_sum = 600.\n\ncurrent_sum_prev starts at 0.\n\nProcessing first file (100):\n\nfor x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent = (x * 100) // 100 = x.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0 +x =x.\n\noverall_percent = (x * 100) // 600.\n\nWe need to check if x == (x * 100) // 600.\n\nFor example, x=0 is not considered here. For x=0, it's initial state.\n\nBut for x= 0, it's not part of the loop.\n\nSo for x= 6, x is 6. overall is 6 * 100 / 600 = 1. So 6 != 1. So no.\n\nOnly when x=0 (initial) and when x= 600 (but that's not in this loop). So during first file, no additions.\n\nThen, current_sum_prev becomes 100.\n\nNow, processing second file (500):\n\nfor x in 1..500.\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100) // 500.\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 + x.\n\noverall_percent = (100 +x) * 100 // 600.\n\nWe need to check if these are equal.\n\nSo for x= 475, current_percent is 475 * 100 // 500 = 95. overall_percent is (575 * 100) // 600 = 57500 // 600 = 95.833... → 95. So added.\n\nSimilarly, x= 476: current is 476 * 100 /500 = 95.2 → 95. overall is (100 + 476) * 100 /600 = 576 * 100 /600 = 96. So 95 vs 96, not equal.\n\nx= 480: current is (480 * 100)/500 = 96. overall is (580 * 100)/600 = 58000 / 600 = 96.666... → 96. So 96 equals 96. So added.\n\nSimilarly, x= 499:\n\ncurrent is (499 * 100)/500 = 99.8 → 99.\n\noverall is (100 + 499) * 100 /600 = 599 * 100 / 600 = 99.833... → 99. So added.\n\nx= 500: current is 100, overall is (600 * 100)/600 = 100 → added.\n\nSo during this loop, the set will have 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, and others?\n\nWait, let's check for x= 595:\n\nWait, no. For x in 1..500.\n\nLet me think of when the overall is 99.\n\noverall_percent = 99.\n\nWhich means:\n\n99 <= (100 +x)*100 / 600 < 100 → multiply by 600:\n\n99 * 6 = 594 ≤ (100 +x)*100 < 600 * 100 → wait no:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n(100 +x) * 100 / 600 = (100 +x) / 6.\n\nSo 99 ≤ (100 +x)/6 < 100 → multiply by 6:\n\n594 ≤ 100 +x < 600 → subtract 100:\n\n494 ≤ x < 500.\n\nSo x can be 494, 495, ..., 499.\n\nFor these x values, the overall is 99.\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100) // 500.\n\nFor x=494: 494 * 100 /500 = 98.8 → 98. So not equal to 99.\n\nFor x=495: 495 * 100 /500 = 99 → 99. So yes. So added.\n\nx=495: current is 99, overall is 99. So added.\n\nSimilarly x=496: 496 * 100 /500 = 99.2 → 99. So current is 99. overall is 99. So added.\n\nSame for x=497, 498, 499. All these x will have current_percent 99, and overall_percent 99.\n\nSo the code adds 99.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 490:\n\noverall is (100 + 490) = 590 → 590/6 = 98.333... → 98.\n\ncurrent_percent is 490 * 100 / 500 = 98 → 98. So equal. So added.\n\nSo 98 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x= 485:\n\noverall is (585)/6 = 97.5 → 97. current is 485 * 100 /500 = 97 → 97. So added.\n\nSo for x in 485, 486, ..., 489:\n\noverall is 97.5 → 97, and current is 97.\n\nSo 97 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 470:\n\noverall is (100 +470) = 570 → 570 /6 = 95. So overall is 95. current is 470 * 100 /500 = 94 → no. But when x=475, current is 95, and overall is 95.\n\nSo the code captures 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nBut what about 95?\n\nYes, as discussed earlier.\n\nSo the set would contain 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother sample input is '4\\n1000 2 2 998' which outputs '0\\n50\\n99\\n100'.\n\nLet me think about that. The total_sum is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nBut the code would process each byte. For example, during the first file (1000 bytes), the overall percent is (x)/2002 * 100. The current percent is x/1000 * 100. So for x= 1000, the current is 100, and overall is (1000 * 100) / 2002 = 49.95... → 49. So not same. But during the first file, perhaps there are some points where the two percentages are same.\n\nBut according to the sample output, 0, 50, 99, 100 are present.\n\nSo during the first file, when x is 1000, the current is 100, but the overall is 49.95 → 49. Not same. So perhaps during the fourth file?\n\nBut let's think about when the overall is 50. For that, (total_bytes * 100) // 2002 = 50. So total_bytes * 100 >= 50 * 2002 → total_bytes >= (50 * 2002)/100 → 50 * 20.02 = 1001. So total_bytes >= 1001 and < 1002 (since 50 * 2002 = 100100, and 100 * total_bytes >= 100100 → total_bytes >= 1001. So total_bytes is 1001. So when total_bytes is 1001, the overall is 50.\n\nWhen is total_bytes 1001?\n\nThat's when the sum_prev + x = 1001.\n\nsum_prev depends on which file we are in.\n\nLet me think:\n\nThe first file is 1000 bytes.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer percentages between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that both progress bars show simultaneously during the file copying process. The first progress bar indicates the percentage of the current file copied, while the second indicates the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Total Size Calculation**: Compute the total size of all files combined to determine the overall progress.\n3. **Progress Tracking**: For each byte copied in each file, compute the current file's progress and the overall progress. Check if these two values are equal and record them.\n4. **Edge Case Handling**: Ensure the initial state (0%) is included as both progress bars start at 0%.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\ncurrent_sum_prev = 0\n\nfor file_size in a:\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // file_size\n        total_bytes = current_sum_prev + x\n        overall_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n        if current_percent == overall_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\n    current_sum_prev += file_size\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files followed by their sizes.\n2. **Total Size Calculation**: The total size of all files is calculated once to determine the overall progress.\n3. **Tracking Progress**: For each byte copied in each file, we compute the current progress of the file being copied and the overall progress across all files. These values are compared, and if they match, the value is added to a set to avoid duplicates.\n4. **Initial State Handling**: The initial state where both progress bars are at 0% is explicitly added to the result set.\n5. **Output**: The results are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible moments when both progress bars show the same percentage are captured efficiently, considering the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
