For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement again. For each binary string s (of any length up to n), we choose a c_s between 0 and k. Then, a beautiful multiset is one where for every s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. The maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. We need to count the number of valid choices of c_s's that make this true.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find all possible assignments of c_s's such that when you choose them, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's first think about what determines the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. For a given set of c_s's, what is the maximum number of strings that can be in a beautiful multiset?\n\nThis seems similar to some kind of constraint problem. Each string in the multiset contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, if a string of length n is \"010\", then it contributes to the counts of \"0\", \"01\", \"010\".\n\nSo, the problem of finding the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is equivalent to choosing as many strings as possible such that for every prefix s of every string in the multiset, the number of times s appears as a prefix (i.e., the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix) is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with constraints on the prefixes. How can we model the maximum possible size?\n\nI recall that in such prefix-based problems, there's a way to model it using a trie structure. But maybe there's a more straightforward approach here.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node (binary string) in the trie, the number of strings that pass through it (i.e., have it as a prefix) is constrained by c_s. However, the maximum total number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimal constraints along the paths.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of nodes in a trie where each node has a capacity, and each string added consumes one unit from all its prefixes. So the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all possible capacities, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a flow problem. But that might not be helpful here.\n\nAnother approach: The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the minimal value among all c_s multiplied by some factors? No, that's probably not directly applicable.\n\nWait, let's consider that each string in the multiset contributes +1 to all of its prefixes. So, for the multiset, the count for each prefix s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. The constraints are that for each s, this count must be ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, to maximize the size of the multiset, we need to select as many strings as possible such that all these constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how can we model this maximum?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements in a collection such that for each node in the trie, the number of elements passing through that node is ≤ c_s. This is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements in the multiset, given that for each node s, the number of elements that have s as a prefix is at most c_s.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum?\n\nAh! This is similar to the problem of scheduling with constraints. Let me think of the constraints in terms of the trie hierarchy. Each node's capacity limits the number of strings that can pass through it. However, since a longer string's prefixes are all shorter strings, there's a hierarchical dependency here.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a string of length 3. Its prefixes are of lengths 1, 2, 3. The capacity for the length-3 string is c_{s}, and for the prefixes of length 1 and 2, their capacities must be ≥ the number of strings that have them as a prefix.\n\nTo maximize the number of strings in the multiset, we need to ensure that for each node, the number of strings passing through it does not exceed its capacity. However, the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimal capacities along certain paths.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each node (binary string) s, the maximum number of strings that can pass through s is c_s. However, since each string that passes through s must also pass through all of its prefixes",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values $ c_s $ for all binary strings $ s $ of lengths from 1 to $ n $ such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $. The solution involves understanding the constraints imposed by these $ c_s $ values and efficiently computing the valid configurations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string $ s $ of length up to $ n $ has a constraint $ c_s $ which limits how many strings in the multiset can have $ s $ as a prefix.\n2. **Prefix Hierarchy**: For any given string, its prefixes are shorter strings. Thus, the constraints on longer strings are influenced by their shorter prefixes.\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations. The key insight is to consider the constraints in a hierarchical manner, starting from the shortest strings and moving up to the longest.\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo $ 998244353 $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        k = int(data[i+1])\n        f = int(data[i+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo MOD\n        max_len = n\n        # dp[len][x] = number of ways to assign c_s for strings of length up to len, with x being the minimal constraint\n        # However, we need to model the constraints in a way that the maximum possible multiset size is exactly f\n        \n        # The key observation: For the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f,\n        # we need that the minimal value of (c_s) * 2^{n - len(s)} for all s is exactly f.\n        # Wait, no, perhaps the correct approach is to model the constraints in a trie-like structure.\n        \n        # Another approach: For each node (binary string s), the maximum number of strings in the multiset that can have s as a prefix is c_s.

So, for each s, the maximum number of full strings that can be added without violating c_s is c_s * 2^{n-l}.\n        # Therefore, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the minimum over all s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # But this is not correct.

For each string s of length l (from 1 to n), compute 2^{n - l} as a weight.\n        # 2. For the assignment of c_s, compute m_s = c_s * weight_s.\n        # 3.
