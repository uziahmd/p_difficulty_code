For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what's going on here. First, the beautiful multiset condition. For each binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f. Our goal is to count the number of valid c_s assignments that make this maximum exactly f.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? The key seems to be figuring out, for a given set of c_s values, what is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. Then we need to count all assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute that maximum? Let me think. The maximum size of the beautiful multiset would be determined by some constraints based on the c_s values. It's similar to a tree structure where each node (binary string) has constraints on how many times it can be a prefix. \n\nLet me think recursively. For example, for a string of length n, each such string contributes 1 to the count of its prefixes. But when building the multiset, we need to ensure that for all prefixes of each string in the multiset, their counts are not exceeded.\n\nWait, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is equivalent to the minimal sum over certain constraints. Maybe it's similar to a problem where you have to select a number of elements such that for each node in a trie, the count doesn't exceed c_s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a trie where each node represents a binary string. Each node has two children (0 and 1). The root is the empty string, but since our problem starts with strings of length 1, maybe the root isn't considered here. Wait, the problem says that the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. Each such string has prefixes of all lengths from 1 to n. For example, the string \"01\" (length 2) has prefixes \"0\" (length 1) and \"01\" (length 2).\n\nSo the constraints are that for every s (prefix of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. Now, the maximum possible size of such a multiset is the maximum number of strings we can have in the multiset without violating any of these constraints. We need this maximum to be exactly f.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the number of assignments of c_s values (each between 0 and k) such that the maximum number of strings in a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum for a given assignment of c_s?\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming on the trie structure. For each node (binary string), the maximum number of strings that can pass through it is constrained by c_s. However, since each string contributes to all its prefixes, there's a dependency between the nodes. For instance, the count for a parent node must be at least the sum of the counts of its children. Or wait, perhaps the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimum of the c_s values along the paths. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider that each string in the multiset is a path from the root (empty string) to a leaf (string of length n). But since the problem considers all strings of length up to n, but the multiset is only of length n. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n. Each such string s has prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., n. For each of those prefixes, the count of how many strings in the multiset have that prefix as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, for example, if I have a string of length n, then for each prefix of length m (from 1 to n), the count of how many times that prefix occurs as a prefix in the multiset must be ≤ c_{prefix}.\n\nNow, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the maximum number of strings we can include in the multiset without violating any of the constraints. How do we compute this maximum?\n\nThis feels like a problem where for each node (prefix), the number of strings that can be allowed under it is limited by c_s. But since each string contributes to all its prefixes, the constraints are hierarchical.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is that the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all nodes of the sum of the capacities along the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for $ c_s $ (for all binary strings $ s $ of length from 1 to $ n $) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $. The solution involves dynamic programming and combinatorial counting under constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string $ s $ of length from 1 to $ n $ has a constraint $ c_s $ which limits how many strings in the multiset can have $ s $ as a prefix.\n2. **Dynamic Programming on Trie Structure**: We model the problem using a trie where each node represents a binary string. For each node, the number of valid strings that can pass through it is constrained by $ c_s $.\n3. **Counting Valid Configurations**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations of $ c_s $ values such that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo MOD\n        max_fact = 2 * 10**5 + 10\n        fact = [1] * (max_fact)\n        for i in range(1, max_fact):\n            fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n        \n        inv_fact = [1] * (max_fact)\n        inv_fact[max_fact - 1] = pow(fact[max_fact - 1], MOD-2, MOD)\n        for i in range(max_fact - 2, -1, -1):\n            inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n        \n        def comb(a, b):\n            if a < 0 or b < 0 or a < b:\n                return 0\n            return fact[a] * inv_fact[b] % MOD * inv_fact[a - b] % MOD\n        \n        # We need to compute the number of ways to assign c_s such that the maximum is exactly f\n        # First, compute the number of ways where the maximum is <= f, then subtract those where it's <= f-1\n        # But how to compute that?\n        \n        # Let's think about the problem in terms of the minimal constraints. For the maximum size to be exactly f,\n        # the constraints must allow at least f strings, but not more than f.\n        # However, the way to model this is tricky. Instead, we can model the problem as follows:\n        \n        # For each node (binary string), the capacity c_s must be >= the number of times it is used as a prefix.\n        # The maximum number of strings is determined by the minimum of the sum of capacities along paths.\n        # Wait, but this seems complex. Another approach: the maximum number of strings is equal to the minimal value of the sum over all nodes of their capacities, considering their hierarchy.\n        \n        # However, after some research and thinking, the correct approach is to realize that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves, considering that each leaf contributes 1 to all its prefixes.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum possible size is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}). Because for each node s of length l, the number of strings passing through it is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Since each such string is a binary string of length n, the number of strings that can have s as a prefix is up to c_s, and the number of such strings is c_s multiplied by the number of possible extensions (2^{n-l}).\n        \n        # So the maximum size is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) for all s. Thus, the maximum size is the minimum of these values across all s.\n        \n        # Therefore, to have the maximum size exactly f, we need that the minimum over all (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) is exactly f.\n        \n        # So the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the minimum over all (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) is exactly f.\n        \n        # Now, let's consider that for each binary string s of length l, we have a variable m_s = c_s * 2^{n - l}.\n        # The minimum of all m_s must be exactly f.\n        \n        # So, for each s, m_s >= f, and there is at least one s where m_s = f.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem becomes: count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that:\n        # For all s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f\n        # And there exists at least one s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f\n        \n        # Let's compute the total number of assignments where all m_s >= f, and subtract those where all m_s >= f+1. Then, we need to ensure that the result is the number of assignments where min m_s is exactly f.\n        \n        # But first, we need to check if f is even possible. For example, if f > k * 2^{n - 1}, then it's impossible. Because for the root (length 1?), no, wait, the minimum m_s is for the string of length n. For example, for a string s of length n, m_s = c_s * 2^0 = c_s. So the minimal m_s could be as low as 0. But for the maximum size to be f, there must be some s where m_s = f.\n        \n        # Let's proceed with the following steps:\n        \n        # 1. Compute the number of valid assignments where all m_s >= f. Let's call this A.\n        # 2. Compute the number of valid assignments where all m_s >= f+1. Call this B.\n        # 3. The answer is (A - B) mod MOD.\n        \n        # However, we also need to ensure that for each s, c_s is between 0 and k. So for each s, c_s must be >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)})) ), but since m_s = c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, then c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) ? Or c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) ? No, because m_s = c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f => c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) ?\n        # For example, suppose 2^{n - len(s)} is d. Then c_s * d >= f => c_s >= ceil(f / d). However, since c_s is an integer between 0 and k, inclusive.\n        \n        # So for each s of length l, the minimal allowed c_s is max(ceil(f / (2^{n - l})), 0). But since 2^{n - l} can be large, for some s, this may be 0. For example, if f is 0, but that's a special case.\n        \n        # However, note that for the minimum m_s to be exactly f, we need that for all s, m_s >= f and at least one s has m_s = f. Thus, the answer is the number of assignments where all m_s >= f, minus the number of assignments where all m_s >= f+1.\n        \n        # So the problem reduces to computing A and B as above.\n        \n        # Now, let's compute A. For each s, c_s must be >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) and <=k. However, since m_s = c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >=f, then c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) ? Let me check.\n        \n        # Let d = 2^{n - len(s)}. Then, c_s * d >=f => c_s >= ceil(f / d) if f is not divisible by d. Otherwise, c_s >= f/d. So yes, c_s >= ceil(f / d). But since c_s is an integer, we can write it as c_s >= ceil(f / d).\n        \n        # However, if d is zero? No, n - len(s) is >=0. For len(s) up to n. So d is 2^{n - l} where l ranges from 1 to n. So for l = n, d is 1. For l=1, d is 2^{n-1}.\n        \n        # So for each s of length l, we compute d = 2^{n - l}. Then the minimal c_s for that s is max(ceil(f / d), 0). But since d can be very large, for some s, f/d can be zero. For example, if f is 2, and d is 8, then ceil(2/8) is 1? No, 2/8 is 0.25, ceil is 1. So c_s must be >= 1. But then m_s = c_s * d >= 1 * 8 = 8 >= f=2. Which is true. But if c_s is 0, then m_s is 0 < f=2. So indeed, the minimal c_s is ceil(f / d).\n        \n        # However, if f is zero, then the minimal c_s is 0. But in that case, the problem requires that the maximum size is exactly zero, which would mean that all c_s are zero. But the code needs to handle this.\n        \n        # So, the first step is to compute for all binary strings s of lengths 1..n, the minimal required c_s for A and B.\n        \n        # Let's compute for all possible l (lengths from 1 to n), the number of binary strings of length l. For each l, there are 2^{l} such strings.\n        \n        # For each l, we compute d = 2^{n - l}, and the minimal c_s for that l is m = ceil(f / d). But since c_s can be up to k, if m > k, then there are no valid assignments. So, for each l, we need to check if m <=k. If for any l, the minimal required c_s is larger than k, then A is zero.\n        \n        # So, for each l from 1 to n:\n        # d = 2^{n - l}\n        # m = ceil(f / d)\n        # if m >k, then A is zero.\n        # else, for each binary string of length l, the number of choices for c_s is (k - m + 1)\n        \n        # So the total number of assignments for A is product over all l ( (number of strings of length l) ) * (k - m_l + 1)^{number of strings of length l} }, where m_l is the minimal required c_s for that l.\n        \n        # Similarly for B, but with f replaced by f+1.\n        \n        # However, there's a problem here. For example, when f is zero, but the problem requires that the maximum is exactly zero. Which implies that all c_s must be zero. Because if any c_s is non-zero, then the maximum size could be positive. But this is handled by the formula.\n        \n        # So, the plan is:\n        # - For the given f, compute A and B as described.\n        # - The answer is (A - B) mod MOD.\n        # - However, if f is zero, then B would be the count for f+1=1. But if f is zero, then the answer is the number of assignments where all m_s >=0 (which is always true, since c_s is >=0) and at least one m_s is zero. But according to our previous approach, it would be A (all m_s >=0) minus B (all m_s >=1). However, since m_s = c_s * d, and d is 2^{n-l} which is >=1, m_s >=0 is always true. So A would be the total number of possible assignments (each c_s can be 0..k), and B would be the number of assignments where all m_s >=1. So the answer would be total_assignments - B.\n        \n        # But how do we compute A and B?\n\n        # Let's implement this approach.\n\n        # First, compute for a given target (like f or f+1), whether it's possible to have all m_s >= target. If not, then the count is zero.\n\n        # For each target (say, T), we compute the product over all l (from 1 to n) of (number of strings of length l) raised to the power of (number of choices for c_s for that l).\n\n        # For each l, d = 2^{n - l}\n        # For each string of length l, the minimal c_s is ceil(T / d). Let's compute that.\n\n        # But how to compute ceil(T / d)? Well, ceil(a / b) = (a + b - 1) // b.\n\n        # However, if T is zero, then ceil(0 / d) is zero. So for T=0, the minimal c_s is zero.\n\n        # Now, for each l, compute d = 2^{n - l}\n\n        # Let's precompute all d for l from 1 to n.\n\n        # Also, note that for l from 1 to n, n - l ranges from n-1 down to 0. So d = 2^{n - l} can be precomputed.\n\n        # Now, for the given target T (either f or f+1), we need to compute for each l:\n\n        # For each l, compute d = 2^{n - l}\n\n        # m_l = ceil(T / d)\n\n        # if m_l > k, then the count is zero.\n\n        # else, the number of choices per string of length l is (k - m_l + 1)\n\n        # The total number of ways for this target is product for each l of ( (number of strings of length l) ) * ( (k - m_l + 1) ^ (number of strings of length l) ) ?\n\n        # Wait, no. For each l, there are 2^l strings of length l. For each of them, the number of choices for c_s is (k - m_l + 1), assuming that m_l <=k. So the contribution for this l is (k - m_l + 1) ^ (2^l).\n\n        # So the total for a target T is product over l=1..n of [ (k - m_l + 1) ^ (2^l) ] if all m_l <=k, else 0.\n\n        # So, the function to compute the number of assignments for a given T is as follows:\n\n        def compute(T):\n            res = 1\n            for l in range(1, n+1):\n                d = 1 << (n - l)  # 2^(n - l)\n                if d == 0:\n                    # Not possible, since n - l >=0\n                    pass\n                m = (T + d - 1) // d  # ceil(T / d)\n                if m > k:\n                    return 0\n                cnt = (k - m + 1)\n                num_strings = 1 << l  # 2^l\n                # compute cnt^num_strings mod MOD\n                # but since num_strings can be up to 2^15 = 32768, and T can be up to 2e5, but we can compute pow(cnt, num_strings, MOD)\n                res = res * pow(cnt, num_strings, MOD) % MOD\n            return res\n\n        # Now, compute A = compute(f), B = compute(f+1)\n        # answer is (A - B) mod MOD\n\n        # However, there is a corner case when f is zero. For example, if T=0, then m_l = ceil(0 / d) = 0. So for each l, m_l is zero. So the number of assignments is (k - 0 + 1) ^ (sum 2^l) ?\n\n        # But in that case, the compute(0) function will return the product of (k+1)^{sum 2^l} ?\n\n        # However, the problem requires that the maximum size is exactly f. So when f=0, the maximum size must be zero. Which implies that for all strings s, the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is zero. Which can only happen if all c_s are zero. Because if any c_s is positive, then you can have at least one string in the multiset with s as a prefix. But for the maximum size to be zero, the multiset must be empty. So the only valid assignment is when all c_s are zero. Hence, the number of valid assignments is 1 if k >=0 (which it is), but according to our compute function, compute(0) would be (k+1)^{total number of strings} ?\n\n        # This suggests a problem with our approach. Because the compute(T) function counts all assignments where all m_s >= T, but when T=0, m_s >=0 is always true (since c_s >=0). So compute(0) would be (k+1)^{total}, which is incorrect. But the actual valid assignments for the maximum size being exactly 0 is only 1 (all c_s are zero).\n\n        # So our previous approach is wrong. What's wrong here?\n\n        # The mistake lies in the interpretation of the problem. The earlier reasoning was incorrect. The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is not the minimum of m_s (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}), but rather the minimum of the c_s values along the paths. This is a critical error.\n\n        # Let's re-analyze the problem. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the constraints. For each node (string s), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is limited by c_s. To maximize the multiset, we can imagine that for each node, we can take up to c_s strings that pass through it. However, since each string passes through all its prefixes, the constraints form a hierarchical structure. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum value of c_s multiplied by the number of strings that can be extended from s. This seems to be a problem similar to a tree where each node can have a certain capacity, and the total number of leaves is limited by the minimum capacity along the path.\n\n        # This is analogous to the problem where each node in a trie has a capacity, and the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) is determined by the minimum capacity along the path from the root to the leaf. In this case, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of c_s multiplied by the number of leaves that can be generated from that node.\n\n        # For a node s of length l, the number of leaves that can be generated from it is 2^{n - l}. Thus, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s * 2^{n - l}).\n\n        # Therefore, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - l} for all nodes s of length l. Hence, the previous approach is correct.\n\n        # However, the problem arises when f=0. Let's take an example. For n=1, k=0, f=0. Then the only c_s is c_0 and c_1. The maximum size is the minimum of c_0 * 2^{1-1} = c_0, and c_1 * 2^{1-1} = c_1. To have this minimum be 0, at least one of c_0 or c_1 must be 0. But according to the compute function, compute(T=0) would be (k - m_l +1)^{...} where m_l is ceil(0 / d). For l=1, d=2^{1-1}=1. m_l = ceil(0/1) = 0. So for each string of length 1, c_s can be between 0 and k (which is 0). So each c_s must be 0. Hence, the number of ways is 1, which matches the expected result. But if k=1, then compute(T=0) would be (1 - 0 + 1)^{2} = 2^2=4, which is incorrect. Because in this case, the minimum of c_0 and c_1 must be >=0, which is always true, but the maximum size is the minimum of c_0 and c_1. To have it exactly 0, at least one of c_0 or c_1 must be 0. So the number of valid assignments is (number of assignments where at least one of c_0 or c_1 is 0). This is (total assignments) - (assignments where both c_0 and c_1 are >=1). Total assignments is (k+1)^2 = 2^2=4. Assignments where both >=1 is 1*1=1 (since k=1). So answer is 4-1=3. But according to our previous approach, compute(0) would be (k+1)^{2} = 4, compute(1) would be (k - m_l +1)^... where m_l is ceil(1/1)=1. So for each string of length 1, c_s must be >=1. Since k=1, it's possible. So compute(1) would be 1^2=1. Hence, answer would be 4-1=3, which is correct.\n\n        # So the previous approach is correct. The confusion earlier was due to a misunderstanding of what compute(T) represents. The compute(T) function returns the number of assignments where all m_s >= T. So for the maximum size to be exactly f, we need to compute compute(f) - compute(f+1).\n\n        # Thus, the code should proceed with the following steps:\n        # 1. Compute A = compute(f)\n        # 2. Compute B = compute(f+1)\n        # 3. Answer is (A - B) mod MOD\n\n        # Now, let's implement the compute function as described.\n\n        # But first, we need to handle the case where T is zero, and other cases. Also, we need to compute 2^{n - l} for l from 1 to n.\n\n        # Now, for the given n, let's precompute all the 2^{n-l} values for l=1..n.\n\n        # However, for n up to 15, 2^{n-l} can be up to 2^{14} = 16384, which is manageable.\n\n        # Now, implement the compute function.\n\n        # Also, note that for T=0, if k >=0, then compute(T) is the product for each l of (k - m_l + 1)^{2^l}, where m_l = ceil(0 / d) = 0. Hence, (k - 0 + 1) = k+1. So for each l, it's (k+1)^{2^l}.\n\n        # But the total number of binary strings of lengths 1..n is sum_{l=1}^n 2^l = 2^{n+1} - 2. So the total number of assignments is (k+1)^{2^{n+1} - 2} if T=0 and all m_l are 0.\n\n        # However, this is handled correctly by the compute function.\n\n        # Now, implement the code.\n\n        # Handle the case where f is larger than what is possible.\n\n        # Let's proceed with the code.\n\n        def compute(T):\n            res = 1\n            for l in range(1, n+1):\n                d = 1 << (n - l)\n                m = (T + d - 1) // d\n                if m > k:\n                    return 0\n                cnt = (k - m + 1)\n                num_strings = 1 << l\n                res = res * pow(cnt, num_strings, MOD) % MOD\n            return res\n\n        A = compute(f)\n        B = compute(f + 1)\n        ans = (A - B) % MOD\n        print(ans)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Factorials and Inverses**: These are used for combinatorial calculations, although they are not directly used in the final solution due to the problem's constraints.\n2. **Compute Function**: This function calculates the number of valid configurations where all $ c_s $ values satisfy the condition that $ c_s \\times 2^{n - \\text{len}(s)} \\geq T $ for a given $ T $.\n3. **Main Logic**: The main function computes the number of valid configurations for $ f $ and $ f+1 $, then subtracts the latter from the former to get the exact count of configurations where the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the solution is computed modulo $ 998244353 $.",

Another approach: the maximum number of strings is equal to the minimal value of the sum over all nodes of their capacities, considering their hierarchy.\n        \n        # However, after some research and thinking, the correct approach is to realize that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves, considering that each leaf contributes 1 to all its prefixes.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum possible size is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}). Because for each node s of length l, the number of strings passing through it is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Since each such string is a binary string of length n, the number of strings that can have s as a prefix is up to c_s, and the number of such strings is c_s multiplied by the number of possible extensions (2^{n-l}).\n        \n        # So the maximum size is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) for all s. Thus, the maximum size is the minimum of these values across all s.\n        \n        # Therefore, to have the maximum size exactly f, we need that the minimum over all (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) is exactly f.\n        \n        # So the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the minimum over all (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) is exactly f.\n        \n        # Now, let's consider that for each binary string s of length l, we have a variable m_s = c_s * 2^{n - l}.\n        # The minimum of all m_s must be exactly f.\n        \n        # So, for each s, m_s >= f, and there is at least one s where m_s = f.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem becomes: count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that:\n        # For all s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f\n        # And there exists at least one s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f\n        \n        # Let's compute the total number of assignments where all m_s >= f, and subtract those where all m_s >= f+1. Then, we need to ensure that the result is the number of assignments where min m_s is exactly f.\n        \n        # But first, we need to check if f is even possible. For example, if f > k * 2^{n - 1}, then it's impossible. Because for the root (length 1?), no, wait, the minimum m_s is for the string of length n. For example, for a string s of length n, m_s = c_s * 2^0 = c_s. So the minimal m_s could be as low as 0. But for the maximum size to be f, there must be some s where m_s = f.\n        \n        # Let's proceed with the following steps:\n        \n        # 1. Compute the number of valid assignments where all m_s >= f. Let's call this A.\n        # 2. Compute the number of valid assignments where all m_s >= f+1. Call this B.\n        # 3. The answer is (A - B) mod MOD.\n        \n        # However, we also need to ensure that for each s, c_s is between 0 and k. So for each s, c_s must be >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)})) ), but since m_s = c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, then c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) ? Or c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) ? No, because m_s = c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f => c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) ?\n        # For example, suppose 2^{n - len(s)} is d. Then c_s * d >= f => c_s >= ceil(f / d). However, since c_s is an integer between 0 and k, inclusive.\n        \n        # So for each s of length l, the minimal allowed c_s is max(ceil(f / (2^{n - l})), 0). But since 2^{n - l} can be large, for some s, this may be 0. For example, if f is 0, but that's a special case.\n        \n        # However, note that for the minimum m_s to be exactly f, we need that for all s, m_s >= f and at least one s has m_s = f. Thus, the answer is the number of assignments where all m_s >= f, minus the number of assignments where all m_s >= f+1.\n        \n        # So the problem reduces to computing A and B as above.\n        \n        # Now, let's compute A. For each s, c_s must be >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) and <=k. However, since m_s = c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >=f, then c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)} )) ? Let me check.\n        \n        # Let d = 2^{n - len(s)}. Then, c_s * d >=f => c_s >= ceil(f / d) if f is not divisible by d. Otherwise, c_s >= f/d. So yes, c_s >= ceil(f / d). But since c_s is an integer, we can write it as c_s >= ceil(f / d).\n        \n        # However, if d is zero? No, n - len(s) is >=0. For len(s) up to n. So d is 2^{n - l} where l ranges from 1 to n. So for l = n, d is 1. For l=1, d is 2^{n-1}.\n        \n        # So for each s of length l, we compute d = 2^{n - l}. Then the minimal c_s for that s is max(ceil(f / d), 0). But since d can be very large, for some s, f/d can be zero. For example, if f is 2, and d is 8, then ceil(2/8) is 1? No, 2/8 is 0.25, ceil is 1. So c_s must be >= 1. But then m_s = c_s * d >= 1 * 8 = 8 >= f=2. Which is true. But if c_s is 0, then m_s is 0 < f=2. So indeed, the minimal c_s is ceil(f / d).\n        \n        # However, if f is zero, then the minimal c_s is 0. But in that case, the problem requires that the maximum size is exactly zero, which would mean that all c_s are zero. But the code needs to handle this.\n        \n        # So, the first step is to compute for all binary strings s of lengths 1..n, the minimal required c_s for A and B.\n        \n        # Let's compute for all possible l (lengths from 1 to n), the number of binary strings of length l. For each l, there are 2^{l} such strings.\n        \n        # For each l, we compute d = 2^{n - l}, and the minimal c_s for that l is m = ceil(f / d). But since c_s can be up to k, if m > k, then there are no valid assignments. So, for each l, we need to check if m <=k. If for any l, the minimal required c_s is larger than k, then A is zero.\n        \n        # So, for each l from 1 to n:\n        # d = 2^{n - l}\n        # m = ceil(f / d)\n        # if m >k, then A is zero.\n        # else, for each binary string of length l, the number of choices for c_s is (k - m + 1)\n        \n        # So the total number of assignments for A is product over all l ( (number of strings of length l) ) * (k - m_l + 1)^{number of strings of length l} }, where m_l is the minimal required c_s for that l.\n        \n        # Similarly for B, but with f replaced by f+1.\n        \n        # However, there's a problem here. For example, when f is zero, but the problem requires that the maximum is exactly zero. Which implies that all c_s must be zero. Because if any c_s is non-zero, then the maximum size could be positive. But this is handled by the formula.\n        \n        # So, the plan is:\n        # - For the given f, compute A and B as described.\n        # - The answer is (A - B) mod MOD.\n        # - However, if f is zero, then B would be the count for f+1=1. But if f is zero, then the answer is the number of assignments where all m_s >=0 (which is always true, since c_s is >=0) and at least one m_s is zero. But according to our previous approach, it would be A (all m_s >=0) minus B (all m_s >=1). However, since m_s = c_s * d, and d is 2^{n-l} which is >=1, m_s >=0 is always true. So A would be the total number of possible assignments (each c_s can be 0..k), and B would be the number of assignments where all m_s >=1. So the answer would be total_assignments - B.\n        \n        # But how do we compute A and B?\n\n        # Let's implement this approach.\n\n        # First, compute for a given target (like f or f+1), whether it's possible to have all m_s >= target. If not, then the count is zero.\n\n        # For each target (say, T), we compute the product over all l (from 1 to n) of (number of strings of length l) raised to the power of (number of choices for c_s for that l).\n\n        # For each l, d = 2^{n - l}\n        # For each string of length l, the minimal c_s is ceil(T / d). Let's compute that.\n\n        # But how to compute ceil(T / d)? Well, ceil(a / b) = (a + b - 1) // b.\n\n        # However, if T is zero, then ceil(0 / d) is zero. So for T=0, the minimal c_s is zero.\n\n        # Now, for each l, compute d = 2^{n - l}\n\n        # Let's precompute all d for l from 1 to n.\n\n        # Also, note that for l from 1 to n, n - l ranges from n-1 down to 0. So d = 2^{n - l} can be precomputed.\n\n        # Now, for the given target T (either f or f+1), we need to compute for each l:\n\n        # For each l, compute d = 2^{n - l}\n\n        # m_l = ceil(T / d)\n\n        # if m_l > k, then the count is zero.\n\n        # else, the number of choices per string of length l is (k - m_l + 1)\n\n        # The total number of ways for this target is product for each l of ( (number of strings of length l) ) * ( (k - m_l + 1) ^ (number of strings of length l) ) ?\n\n        # Wait, no. For each l, there are 2^l strings of length l. For each of them, the number of choices for c_s is (k - m_l + 1), assuming that m_l <=k. So the contribution for this l is (k - m_l + 1) ^ (2^l).\n\n        # So the total for a target T is product over l=1..n of [ (k - m_l + 1) ^ (2^l) ] if all m_l <=k, else 0.\n\n        # So, the function to compute the number of assignments for a given T is as follows:\n\n        def compute(T):\n            res = 1\n            for l in range(1, n+1):\n                d = 1 << (n - l)  # 2^(n - l)\n                if d == 0:\n                    # Not possible, since n - l >=0\n                    pass\n                m = (T + d - 1) // d  # ceil(T / d)\n                if m > k:\n                    return 0\n                cnt = (k - m + 1)\n                num_strings = 1 << l  # 2^l\n                # compute cnt^num_strings mod MOD\n                # but since num_strings can be up to 2^15 = 32768, and T can be up to 2e5, but we can compute pow(cnt, num_strings, MOD)\n                res = res * pow(cnt, num_strings, MOD) % MOD\n            return res\n\n        # Now, compute A = compute(f), B = compute(f+1)\n        # answer is (A - B) mod MOD\n\n        # However, there is a corner case when f is zero. For example, if T=0, then m_l = ceil(0 / d) = 0. So for each l, m_l is zero. So the number of assignments is (k - 0 + 1) ^ (sum 2^l) ?\n\n        # But in that case, the compute(0) function will return the product of (k+1)^{sum 2^l} ?\n\n        # However, the problem requires that the maximum size is exactly f. So when f=0, the maximum size must be zero. Which implies that for all strings s, the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is zero. Which can only happen if all c_s are zero. Because if any c_s is positive, then you can have at least one string in the multiset with s as a prefix. But for the maximum size to be zero, the multiset must be empty. So the only valid assignment is when all c_s are zero. Hence, the number of valid assignments is 1 if k >=0 (which it is), but according to our compute function, compute(0) would be (k+1)^{total number of strings} ?\n\n        # This suggests a problem with our approach. Because the compute(T) function counts all assignments where all m_s >= T, but when T=0, m_s >=0 is always true (since c_s >=0). So compute(0) would be (k+1)^{total}, which is incorrect. But the actual valid assignments for the maximum size being exactly 0 is only 1 (all c_s are zero).\n\n        # So our previous approach is wrong. What's wrong here?\n\n        # The mistake lies in the interpretation of the problem. The earlier reasoning was incorrect. The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is not the minimum of m_s (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}), but rather the minimum of the c_s values along the paths. This is a critical error.\n\n        # Let's re-analyze the problem. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the constraints. For each node (string s), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is limited by c_s. To maximize the multiset, we can imagine that for each node, we can take up to c_s strings that pass through it. However, since each string passes through all its prefixes, the constraints form a hierarchical structure. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum value of c_s multiplied by the number of strings that can be extended from s. This seems to be a problem similar to a tree where each node can have a certain capacity, and the total number of leaves is limited by the minimum capacity along the path.\n\n        # This is analogous to the problem where each node in a trie has a capacity, and the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) is determined by the minimum capacity along the path from the root to the leaf. In this case, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of c_s multiplied by the number of leaves that can be generated from that node.\n\n        # For a node s of length l, the number of leaves that can be generated from it is 2^{n - l}. Thus, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s * 2^{n - l}).\n\n        # Therefore, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - l} for all nodes s of length l. Hence, the previous approach is correct.\n\n        # However, the problem arises when f=0. Let's take an example. For n=1, k=0, f=0. Then the only c_s is c_0 and c_1. The maximum size is the minimum of c_0 * 2^{1-1} = c_0, and c_1 * 2^{1-1} = c_1. To have this minimum be 0, at least one of c_0 or c_1 must be 0. But according to the compute function, compute(T=0) would be (k - m_l +1)^{...} where m_l is ceil(0 / d). For l=1, d=2^{1-1}=1. m_l = ceil(0/1) = 0. So for each string of length 1, c_s can be between 0 and k (which is 0). So each c_s must be 0. Hence, the number of ways is 1, which matches the expected result. But if k=1, then compute(T=0) would be (1 - 0 + 1)^{2} = 2^2=4, which is incorrect. Because in this case, the minimum of c_0 and c_1 must be >=0, which is always true, but the maximum size is the minimum of c_0 and c_1. To have it exactly 0, at least one of c_0 or c_1 must be 0. So the number of valid assignments is (number of assignments where at least one of c_0 or c_1 is 0). This is (total assignments) - (assignments where both c_0 and c_1 are >=1). Total assignments is (k+1)^2 = 2^2=4. Assignments where both >=1 is 1*1=1 (since k=1). So answer is 4-1=3. But according to our previous approach, compute(0) would be (k+1)^{2} = 4, compute(1) would be (k - m_l +1)^... where m_l is ceil(1/1)=1. So for each string of length 1, c_s must be >=1. Since k=1, it's possible. So compute(1) would be 1^2=1. Hence, answer would be 4-1=3, which is correct.\n\n        # So the previous approach is correct. The confusion earlier was due to a misunderstanding of what compute(T) represents. The compute(T) function returns the number of assignments where all m_s >= T. So for the maximum size to be exactly f, we need to compute compute(f) - compute(f+1).\n\n        # Thus, the code should proceed with the following steps:\n        # 1. Compute A = compute(f)\n        # 2. Compute B = compute(f+1)\n        # 3. Answer is (A - B) mod MOD\n\n        # Now, let's implement the compute function as described.\n\n        # But first, we need to handle the case where T is zero, and other cases. Also, we need to compute 2^{n - l} for l from 1 to n.\n\n        # Now, for the given n, let's precompute all the 2^{n-l} values for l=1..n.\n\n        # However, for n up to 15, 2^{n-l} can be up to 2^{14} = 16384, which is manageable.\n\n        # Now, implement the compute function.\n\n        # Also, note that for T=0, if k >=0, then compute(T) is the product for each l of (k - m_l + 1)^{2^l}, where m_l = ceil(0 / d) = 0. Hence, (k - 0 + 1) = k+1. So for each l, it's (k+1)^{2^l}.\n\n        # But the total number of binary strings of lengths 1..n is sum_{l=1}^n 2^l = 2^{n+1} - 2. So the total number of assignments is (k+1)^{2^{n+1} - 2} if T=0 and all m_l are 0.\n\n        # However, this is handled correctly by the compute function.\n\n        # Now, implement the code.\n\n        # Handle the case where f is larger than what is possible.\n\n        # Let's proceed with the code.\n\n        def compute(T):\n            res = 1\n            for l in range(1, n+1):\n                d = 1 << (n - l)\n                m = (T + d - 1) // d\n                if m > k:\n                    return 0\n                cnt = (k - m + 1)\n                num_strings = 1 << l\n                res = res * pow(cnt, num_strings, MOD) % MOD\n            return res\n\n        A = compute(f)\n        B = compute(f + 1)\n        ans = (A - B) % MOD\n        print(ans)\n\nmain()",
