    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we need to compute this modulo mod. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is required here. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. p and q are permutations of 1..n.\n2. p is lex smaller than q. So, for all permutations, when considering all possible ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex order, we need to count those pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut since there are n! permutations, the total number of possible pairs (p, q) with p < q is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But we need to find how many of those satisfy inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nWait, but how can we compute this efficiently? For n up to 500, brute force is impossible. So we need a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. For each permutation, we can compute its inversion count. Then, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, we check if inv_p > inv_q.\n\nBut even for n=500, the number of permutations is way too big. So we need to find some way to compute this without enumerating all permutations.\n\nLet me think about the properties. Let's denote for all permutations, their inversion counts. Let's say we have a list of all permutations sorted lex, and for each permutation, we have its inversion count. Then, for each pair (p, q) where p comes before q lex, we check if inv_p > inv_q.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, think about all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of the following holds: p < q lex or q < p lex. So, for each pair (p, q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is considered in the count. Now, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is (total_permutations choose 2). \n\nNow, for each such pair, either inv_p > inv_q, inv_p < inv_q, or inv_p = inv_q. So, the answer is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv_p > inv_q. \n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q lex. Let's call this T. Then, for each such pair, exactly one of inv_p > inv_q or inv_p < inv_q holds (assuming inv_p != inv_q). If inv_p == inv_q, then neither contributes. So, the total number of pairs where inv_p > inv_q is equal to (T - S)/2, where S is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q lex and inv_p = inv_q. Because for each pair where inv_p != inv_q, exactly half of them would have inv_p > inv_q and the other half inv_p < inv_q. Wait, but this is only true if the relation between inv_p and inv_q is symmetric in some way. \n\nWait, suppose we consider all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of the following is true: inv_p > inv_q, inv_p < inv_q, or inv_p = inv_q. Letâ€™s denote A as the number of pairs where inv_p > inv_q, B as the number where inv_p < inv_q, and C as the number where inv_p = inv_q. Then, A + B + C = total_pairs. Also, since for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is counted in the T (the total number of ordered pairs with p < q lex). So, for the unordered pairs, each pair is counted once in T. \n\nBut in terms of A and B, since for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv_p > inv_q, then in the ordered pairs, (p, q) is counted in T if p < q lex. Similarly, (q, p) is counted in T if q < p lex. So, for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q or q < p) is true. Therefore, for the entire set of unordered pairs {p, q}, the number of pairs where inv_p > inv_q and p < q lex is equal to the number of pairs where inv_q < inv_p and q < p lex. So, the total A (as defined earlier) would be equal to B. Therefore, the total number of pairs where inv_p > inv_q and p < q lex is equal to (total_pairs - C) / 2. Because A = B, and A + B = total_pairs - C. So A = (total_pairs - C)/2.\n\nSo, the answer is (total_pairs - C) / 2, where total_pairs is the number of unordered pairs of distinct permutations, which is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. And C is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q and inv_p = inv_q. \n\nWait, but wait. Because the answer is the number of (p, q) pairs where p < q lex and inv_p > inv_q. Which is exactly A as defined above. And according to the reasoning, A = (total_pairs - C)/2. \n\nSo, if we can compute the total number of unordered pairs (total_pairs) and the number of unordered pairs with equal inversion counts (C), then the answer is (total_pairs - C)/2.\n\nBut how do we compute C?\n\nC is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with p != q and inv_p = inv_q. So, for each possible inversion count k, if there are m_k permutations with inversion count k, then the number of pairs for that k is (m_k choose 2). Summing over all k gives us C.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute for each inversion count k, the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions. Let's denote this as inv_count[k]. Then, C is sum( inv_count[k] * (inv_count[k] - 1) ) / 2 for all k.\n\nOnce we have that, the answer is (total_pairs - C) // 2, where total_pairs is (total_perms * (total_perms - 1)) // 2, and total_perms is n!.\n\nBut wait, the answer is (total_pairs - C) / 2, but since total_pairs is (total_perms choose 2), and C is the number of pairs with same inversion counts. So yes.\n\nBut then, the problem becomes how to compute inv_count[k], the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions.\n\nAh, right! The inversion count for permutations is a well-known problem. The number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions is given by the Mahonian numbers. \n\nThe Mahonian numbers can be computed using dynamic programming. The recurrence is:\n\ndp[n][k] = dp[n-1][k] + dp[n-1][k - (n-1)] + ... \n\nBut more formally, the number of permutations of n elements with k inversions is equal to the sum of dp[n-1][k - i] for i from 0 to min(n-1, k). \n\nAlternatively, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[n][k] = dp[n-1][k] + dp[n-1][k - 1] + ... + dp[n-1][k - (n-1)], where the terms are taken as zero if k - i is negative.\n\nBut for n up to 500, and k up to maximum possible inversions (which for n elements is n*(n-1)/2). For n=500, the maximum k is 500*499/2 = 124750. So the DP table would be size 500 x 124750. That's manageable?\n\nYes, because 500 * 125,000 is around 62 million entries. But with Python, even that might be tight for memory. However, since we can compute it iteratively and for each n, only keep track of the current row and the previous row, maybe we can optimize space.\n\nBut let's think about the DP approach. Let's define dp[i][j] as the number of permutations of i elements with j inversions. Then:\n\nFor i=1, dp[1][0] = 1, and all others are 0.\n\nFor i>1, when adding the ith element, inserting it into a permutation of i-1 elements. Inserting the new element (which is the largest element, since permutations are of numbers 1..i) into position m (where m ranges from 0 to i-1). Inserting it at position m adds m inversions. So for each permutation of i-1 elements with k inversions, inserting the new element in position m will create a permutation of i elements with k + m inversions. \n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][k] = sum_{m=0}^{i-1} dp[i-1][k - m], where for each term, if k -m <0, it's 0.\n\nBut this can be optimized with prefix sums. Because for each i, dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k] + dp[i-1][k-1] + ... + dp[i-1][k - (i-1)].\n\nBut for each i, the maximum possible k is i*(i-1)/2. So for each i, the maximum k increases by i-1.\n\nSo for our problem, we can precompute dp[i][k] for all i from 1 to n, and k up to max_k = n*(n-1)/2.\n\nOnce we have dp[n][k], which is the number of permutations of n elements with k inversions, then for each k, we can compute the count of permutations with that inversion count. Then, compute C as sum over all k (count[k] * (count[k] - 1) ) // 2.\n\nOnce we have that, then compute total_pairs = (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) // 2, where total_perms is n!.\n\nThen the answer is (total_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod.\n\nWait, but why? Because the answer is the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv_p > inv_q. Which, according to our earlier reasoning, equals (total_pairs - C) // 2. \n\nYes. Because for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, exactly half of them (excluding those with same inversion counts) will have inv_p > inv_q. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the Mahonian numbers dp[n][k], which is the number of permutations of n elements with k inversions.\n\n2. Compute the total number of permutations: total_perms = factorial(n).\n\n3. Compute total_pairs = (total_perms * (total_perms - 1)) // 2.\n\n4. Compute C, the number of unordered pairs with same inversion counts. For that, for each k, take count = dp[n][k], add count * (count - 1) // 2 to C.\n\n5. The answer is (total_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod.\n\nBut wait, what if (total_pairs - C) is odd? Because then dividing by 2 would not give an integer. But according to the logic, since for each pair with different inversion counts, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is counted in the answer. So the total_pairs - C must be even. Because total_pairs is (total_perms choose 2), which is (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) / 2. And C is the number of pairs with same inversion counts. So total_pairs - C is the number of pairs with different inversion counts. Each such pair contributes exactly once to either the answer or to the opposite case. Hence, the total_pairs - C must be even, so division by 2 is valid.\n\nSo, this approach should work.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute the Mahonian numbers for n up to 500, which requires handling up to 500 * 499 / 2 = 124750 inversions.\n\nLet's think about how to compute this DP. Let's use a 2D array. However, for n=500, and k up to 124750, the size would be 500 * 124750. Let's calculate the memory needed. Each entry is an integer. Assuming 4 bytes per integer, but in Python, integers can be large. But for n=500, the maximum value for dp[n][k] is (n!) which is huge, but since we need to compute it modulo something? No, wait. Wait, no. Because the problem requires us to compute C, which is the sum over k of (count[k] choose 2). However, the mod is applied to the final answer. But during the computation of count[k], we can't take mod because when we compute count[k] * (count[k]-1) / 2, we need the exact value. However, for n=500, the count[k] could be very large, but since mod is up to 1e9, and the maximum possible count[k] is n! (for k=0, which is 1, but for other k's it's less). For n=500, n! is way larger than 1e18, so storing these numbers as integers in Python is possible, but may take time and memory. However, for n=500, the maximum possible k is 124750, and for each step, the DP can be computed with big integers.\n\nBut in Python, this is feasible? Let's see. For example, for each n, we can compute the DP table for that n. For each i from 1 to n, and for each possible k up to the maximum for i.\n\nBut how to compute the DP. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nInitialize a 2D array, say dp, where dp[i][k] represents the number of permutations of i elements with k inversions.\n\nBut for space optimization, since each i-th row depends only on the (i-1)-th row, we can use two 1D arrays: previous and current.\n\nFor example, for i=1, previous is [1] (for k=0).\n\nFor i=2, current[k] = sum_{m=0}^1 previous[k - m], but only for k >= m.\n\nBut for each i, the maximum k is i*(i-1)/2. So for i steps, we can build up the dp.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize a list of previous, which starts as [1] (for i=1, k=0).\n\nFor each i from 2 to n:\n\n   current is initialized as a list of zeros with length up to max_k_i = i*(i-1)/2.\n\n   for each possible k in 0 to max_k_i:\n\n       current[k] = sum of previous[k - m] for m from 0 to i-1, where k - m >= 0.\n\nBut calculating this sum directly for each k would be O(i) per k, leading to O(n^3) time. For n=500, that's 500^3 = 125 million operations. Which may be acceptable in Python, but perhaps we can optimize it using prefix sums.\n\nYes, because for each i, the current[k] is the sum of previous[k - m] for m from 0 to i-1. Which is equivalent to sum_{j = k - (i-1)}^k previous[j], but only if j >=0. Wait, let's think:\n\nFor m in 0 to i-1, k - m = j. So j ranges from k - (i-1) to k. So the sum is sum_{j = max(0, k - i + 1)}^k previous[j].\n\nBut since for each i, the previous array is for i-1 elements, and the maximum k for previous is (i-1)(i-2)/2. So for each i, when building current, the current[k] can be computed as the sum of previous[k - m], where m ranges from 0 to i-1, but k - m can't be negative. So for each k, the sum is over the range of previous[j], where j = k - m, m ranges from 0 to i-1. Which is j ranges from k - (i-1) to k, but only if j is >=0. So the sum is sum_{j = max(0, k - (i-1))}^k previous[j], provided that j <= max_prev_k, which is (i-1)(i-2)/2.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently? Using prefix sums. For each i, we can precompute the prefix sums of previous, and then for each k, the sum is prefix_sum[min(k, max_prev_k)] - prefix_sum[max(0, k - i) - 1], or something like that.\n\nLet me think again. The previous array is for i-1 elements. Let's denote the previous array as prev, and the maximum possible k for prev is (i-1)(i-2)/2.\n\nFor current i, for each k, current[k] = sum_{m=0}^{i-1} prev[k - m], where k - m >= 0. Which is equivalent to sum_{j = k - (i-1)}^k prev[j], but j can't be less than 0. So the lower bound is max(0, k - (i-1)).\n\nBut since for each k, the sum is over a range of length i (if k is large enough). So if we have a prefix sum array for the previous array, then for each k, the sum can be calculated as the sum from l to r, where l = max(0, k - (i-1)), and r = k. However, if r exceeds the length of the previous array, then we take up to the end.\n\nSo, for each i, we can compute the prefix sums of the previous array. Then, for each k, compute l = max(0, k - (i-1)), r = k. The sum is prefix[r] - prefix[l-1], but with care for l=0.\n\nThis approach would reduce the per-k calculation from O(i) to O(1), leading to O(n^2) time.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nInitialize prev as [1] (for i=1, k=0).\n\nFor i from 2 to n:\n\n   max_prev_k = (i-1)*(i-2)//2\n\n   max_current_k = i*(i-1)//2\n\n   current is initialized as a list of zeros with length max_current_k + 1.\n\n   compute prefix_prev array, where prefix_prev[j] = sum_{x=0}^j prev[x]\n\n   for each k in 0 to max_current_k:\n\n       l = max(0, k - (i-1))\n\n       r = k\n\n       if r > max_prev_k:\n\n           r = max_prev_k\n\n       if l > r:\n\n           sum_val = 0\n\n       else:\n\n           sum_val = prefix_prev[r] - (prefix_prev[l-1] if l > 0 else 0)\n\n       current[k] = sum_val\n\n   prev = current.copy()\n\nOnce we have prev after processing i=n, that's the array of Mahonian numbers for n elements. So, for each k, the number of permutations is prev[k].\n\nBut wait, the initial prev for i=1 is [1], which is for k=0. For i=2, max_prev_k is 1*(0)/2 = 0. So for i=2, the max_prev_k is 0. So for each k in 0 to 1 (max_current_k = 1):\n\nFor k=0:\n\nl = max(0, 0 - 1) = 0. r = 0. Since r is <= max_prev_k (0), sum is prefix_prev[0] - 0 = 1. So current[0] = 1.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nl = max(0, 1-1) = 0. r = 1. But max_prev_k is 0. So r is 0. sum is prefix_prev[0] - 0 = 1. So current[1] = 1. Which is correct, since for i=2, there are 1 permutation with 0 inversions (1,2) and 1 permutation with 1 inversion (2,1).\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo, the code needs to implement this DP approach with prefix sums.\n\nOnce we have the Mahonian numbers for n, we can compute the count for each k, then compute C as the sum over all k of (count[k] * (count[k] - 1)) // 2.\n\nThen, compute total_perms = factorial(n), total_pairs = total_perms * (total_perms - 1) // 2.\n\nThen, answer = (total_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod.\n\nNow, the next steps are:\n\nImplementing this DP in Python.\n\nBut for n=500, the maximum k is 500*499/2 = 124750. So the DP array for i=500 will have 124750+1 elements. For each i, the previous array grows as i increases.\n\nBut in Python, creating a list for each i and updating it is feasible.\n\nBut for the prefix sums, we need to compute them for each i step.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, compute the Mahonian numbers for n.\n\nWe can represent the previous array as a list. For each step, we compute the current array based on the previous array and prefix sums.\n\nLet me outline the code steps:\n\nRead n and mod.\n\nCompute the Mahonian numbers for n.\n\nCompute the count array for n, which is the prev array after processing i = n.\n\nThen compute C as sum( (count[k] * (count[k] - 1)) // 2 for all k )\n\nCompute total_perms = factorial(n)\n\ntotal_pairs = (total_perms * (total_perms - 1)) // 2\n\nanswer = (total_pairs - C) // 2\n\nThen, output answer mod mod.\n\nBut for n=1, the total_perms is 1. So total_pairs is 0. So answer is 0.\n\nBut for n=1, there are no pairs (p, q) with p < q, so the answer is 0.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing the DP.\n\nBut first, for the factorial part. For n up to 500, the factorial can be computed as a Python integer, but for n=500, it's a very big number. However, since we need to compute total_perms, which is n! and then total_pairs = (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) // 2. For n=500, this is a huge number, but Python can handle big integers.\n\nBut for n=500, the Mahonian numbers for k up to 124750 may be very big, but since we need to compute count[k] * (count[k] - 1) // 2, and then sum them all, which is C, which is again a very big number. However, since the final answer is (total_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod, we need to compute this value modulo mod. However, the problem is that for very large numbers, even if we compute them as Python integers, they can take a lot of memory and time.\n\nWait, but for n=500, the maximum value of count[k] is n! (but for k=0, which is 1). For example, for n=500, the count[k] for k= (500*499)/2 is 1 (the permutation in reverse order). But for other k's, the numbers are huge. However, when computing C, which is sum( count[k] * (count[k] - 1) // 2 ), we need to compute this sum. But since mod is applied to the final answer, perhaps we can compute everything modulo mod?\n\nWait, but no. Because (total_pairs - C) can be negative, and we need to compute it modulo mod. However, the problem is that C can be very large. For example, for n=500, even if mod is 1e9, but C can be up to ( (n! )^2 ) / 2. Which is way beyond the capacity of standard data types. However, Python can handle big integers, but for n=500, this could take a lot of time and memory.\n\nBut perhaps the problem allows this. Let's think. For n=500, the maximum possible value of count[k] is n! (but for k=0, it's 1). For example, for k=0, count[k] is 1. For k=1, it's 1 (for n=2). For larger n, count[k] can be up to n! / something. However, even for n=500, the count[k] can be as big as 500! which is way too big to store as a Python integer. However, since the problem requires the answer mod mod, perhaps we can compute C mod (mod * something) ?\n\nWait, but no. Because (total_pairs - C) can be very large, but we need to compute (total_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod. However, since (total_pairs - C) is even, but how to compute this modulo mod?\n\nBut the problem is that (total_pairs - C) can be a very big number, but mod is up to 1e9. How can we compute (total_pairs - C) mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nBecause when you divide by 2, you need to know the value mod 2*mod to get the correct result mod mod. Because:\n\nLet me think. Suppose x is even, and x = 2y. Then x mod (2*mod) can be written as 2y mod 2*mod. Then y mod mod = (x mod 2*mod) // 2 mod mod.\n\nSo, perhaps we can compute (total_pairs - C) mod (2 * mod), then divide by 2, then take mod mod again. But how?\n\nBut how to compute C mod (2 * mod)?\n\nBecause total_pairs is (n! * (n! -1 )) // 2. Let's compute total_pairs mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nBut how to compute total_pairs and C mod (2*mod) ?\n\nBut for that, we need to compute total_pairs and C mod (2*mod). However, for n=500, n! can be very big, but mod is up to 1e9. So for example, for mod=1e9, 2*mod is 2e9. But n! for n=500 is way larger than that. However, when we compute n! mod (something), but for the total_pairs, which is (n! * (n! -1 )) // 2, how to compute this modulo 2*mod?\n\nBut perhaps there's another way. Let me think again. The answer is ((total_pairs - C) // 2) mod mod. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLetâ€™s compute A = total_pairs - C. Then answer is A//2 mod mod.\n\nBut since A is even, A//2 is an integer. \n\nBut how to compute A mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nBecause if we can compute A mod (2 * mod), then we can divide by 2 to get (A//2) mod mod. \n\nSo, let's compute:\n\nA = total_pairs - C.\n\nWe need to compute A mod (2 * mod). Once we have that, then (A mod (2 * mod)) is equal to 2k or 2k + 1. But since A is even, it must be 2k. Then (A//2) mod mod is k mod mod.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCompute total_pairs mod (2 * mod) â†’ T.\n\nCompute C mod (2 * mod) â†’ C_mod.\n\nThen, A_mod = (T - C_mod) mod (2 * mod).\n\nThen, answer = (A_mod // 2) mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute T and C_mod?\n\nBut for T = total_pairs = (n! * (n! - 1 )) // 2.\n\nBut how to compute this modulo 2*mod?\n\nWell, let's compute n! mod (2 * mod * 2), because when we compute (n! * (n! -1 )) // 2, perhaps we need to compute it modulo 2*mod. However, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, since for the answer, we need to compute (total_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod, which is equivalent to ( (total_pairs - C) mod (2 * mod) ) // 2 mod mod. \n\nBut how to compute total_pairs and C mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nLet me think about how to compute total_pairs mod (2 * mod):\n\ntotal_pairs = (n! * (n! - 1 )) // 2.\n\nBut for this, we need to compute n! modulo (2 * mod * 2), because when you divide by 2, you need to know whether the numerator is even. But perhaps for the purpose of mod 2*mod, we can compute:\n\nLetâ€™s compute n! mod (2 * mod * 2) ?\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, since total_pairs is an integer, and we can compute it as (n! * (n! -1 )) // 2. But for very large n, even n! can't be stored as an integer. However, for n up to 500, Python can handle big integers. But for n=500, n! is a number with about 1000 digits, which is manageable in Python, but may take time and memory. However, given that the constraints are up to n=500, perhaps it's feasible.\n\nBut for n=500, the value of n! is 500! which is a very big number. However, for the purposes of computing total_pairs and C, which are both huge numbers, but when we compute (total_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod, perhaps we can compute total_pairs and C modulo 2 * mod, then proceed.\n\nBut how to compute total_pairs mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nWell, let's compute n! mod (2 * mod * something). But perhaps we can compute n! mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nBut for that, we can compute factorial(n) mod (2 * mod) as follows:\n\nfact = 1\n\nfor i in 1 to n:\n\n    fact = (fact * i) % (2 * mod)\n\nBut if mod is 1e9, then 2 * mod is 2e9. For n up to 500, this is feasible. \n\nOnce we have fact_n = n! mod (2 * mod), then:\n\ntotal_pairs = (fact_n * (fact_n - 1 )) // 2 mod (2 * mod).\n\nWait, but this is not correct. Because (n! * (n! -1 )) // 2 may not be congruent to (fact_n * (fact_n - 1 )) // 2 mod (2 * mod). Because fact_n is congruent to n! mod (2 * mod), but when you multiply by (fact_n - 1), you are not sure about the actual value of n! * (n! - 1) mod (2 * mod * 2), etc. \n\nThis seems tricky. However, since n! can be very large, but for the purposes of computing total_pairs mod (2 * mod), perhaps we can compute it as follows:\n\nLetâ€™s compute n! mod (2 * mod). Letâ€™s call this F.\n\nThen, total_pairs = (F * (F - 1 )) // 2 mod (2 * mod).\n\nBut this is only correct if n! is congruent to F mod (2 * mod), and (n! -1) is congruent to (F - 1) mod (2 * mod). However, when you multiply F * (F - 1), you get (n! * (n! - 1 )) mod (2 * mod * something). But the division by 2 may not be straightforward. However, since n! is divisible by 2 for n â‰¥ 2, and (n! -1) is odd. So the product n! * (n! -1) is even, so (n! * (n! -1 )) // 2 is an integer. But when we compute F * (F - 1), since F â‰¡ n! mod (2 * mod), then F * (F - 1) â‰¡ n! * (n! - 1) mod (2 * mod). So (F * (F -1 )) // 2 mod (2 * mod) would be congruent to (n! * (n! - 1 )) // 2 mod (2 * mod). \n\nBut wait, because F * (F -1) = n! * (n! -1) + k * (2 * mod) for some integer k. Then, F * (F -1) is congruent to n! * (n! -1) mod (2 * mod). So when you divide by 2, you get (F * (F -1 )) // 2 â‰¡ (n! * (n! -1 )) // 2 mod mod, but not necessarily mod 2 * mod. \n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's think again. Since we need to compute (total_pairs - C) mod (2 * mod), and then divide by 2. \n\nBut if we can compute total_pairs mod (2 * mod) and C mod (2 * mod), then their difference mod (2 * mod) is A_mod. Then, since A is even, A_mod must be even. Then, A_mod // 2 is an integer, and (A_mod // 2) mod mod is the answer.\n\nSo, the problem is to compute total_pairs mod (2 * mod) and C mod (2 * mod).\n\nBut how?\n\nFor total_pairs:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we can compute F = n! mod (2 * mod). Then, total_pairs is (F * (F -1 )) // 2 mod (2 * mod). However, this is only correct if F * (F -1) is congruent to n! * (n! -1) mod (2 * mod). Which it is. Then, since (F * (F -1 )) is even, dividing by 2 gives an integer. But how to compute this division correctly modulo 2 * mod?\n\nFor example, suppose that F * (F -1) = 2 * K. Then, K mod (2 * mod) is what we want. But since F * (F -1) is congruent to n! * (n! -1) mod (2 * mod), then 2*K is congruent to that mod 2 * mod. Hence, K is congruent to (n! * (n! -1 )) // 2 mod mod. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since F is n! mod (2 * mod), then F * (F -1) = n! * (n! -1) + m * (2 * mod) for some integer m. Hence, F * (F -1) = 2 * total_pairs + m * (2 * mod). Therefore, when you divide by 2, you get total_pairs + m * mod. Hence, total_pairs mod (2 * mod) is equal to (F * (F -1 )) // 2 mod (2 * mod). \n\nBut how to compute (F * (F -1 )) // 2 ?\n\nWell, since F * (F -1) is even, (F * (F -1 )) // 2 is an integer. So in Python, this can be computed as (F * (F -1 )) // 2.\n\nBut then, this value may be larger than 2 * mod. However, when we take this value mod (2 * mod), we get the correct value of total_pairs mod (2 * mod).\n\nSo, the steps for computing T_mod = total_pairs mod (2 * mod) are:\n\nCompute F = factorial(n) mod (2 * mod).\n\nThen T_mod = (F * (F - 1) // 2) % (2 * mod).\n\nSimilarly for C_mod. But how to compute C mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nC is sum( (count[k] * (count[k] - 1 )) // 2 for all k )\n\nBut count[k] is the number of permutations with inversion count k. For n up to 500, count[k] can be very large. But we need to compute each term (count[k] * (count[k] - 1 )) // 2 mod (2 * mod), and sum them all mod (2 * mod).\n\nBut how to compute count[k] mod (something) ?\n\nBecause count[k] is the Mahonian number for n and k. But for n=500 and k up to 12475",
