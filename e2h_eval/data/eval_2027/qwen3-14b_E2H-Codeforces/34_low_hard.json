And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. Each week is k consecutive days, and I have to compute the average of all those weeks' total sleep times. Then output that average with enough decimal precision.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For example, if n=3 and k=2, there are 3-2+1 = 2 weeks. The first week is days 1 and 2, sum 3+4=7. The second week is days 2 and 3, sum 4+7=11. The average is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the main task is to compute the sum of all possible consecutive k-day periods, then divide by the number of such periods (which is n - k + 1).\n\nBut how do I compute the sum efficiently? Because n can be up to 2e5, so a naive approach of checking each window and adding up each time would be O(n*k), which would be 4e10 operations in worst case. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Oh right, sliding window technique. Let's think about that.\n\nThe idea is to compute the sum for the first window (first k elements), then for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element that's entering. This way, each step is O(1), leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nYes. So steps:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this sum to a total sum variable.\n3. Then, for each next window (from position 1 to n -k), subtract the element that's no longer in the window (a[i-1]) and add the new element (a[i + k -1]). Then add this to the total sum.\n4. Finally, divide the total sum by the number of windows (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the initial sum? Let's think with an example.\n\nTake the first sample input: 3 2, array [3,4,7]. The initial sum is 3+4=7. Then next window is 4+7=11. Total sum is 7+11=18. Divided by 2 (number of windows) gives 9. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, let's handle the input. The input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Wait, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, the input is given as:\n\nIn the example, the input is:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, maybe the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases in the sample input. But according to the original problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem's input description says that the first line contains two integers n and k. Then the second line has n integers. So each test case is two lines. However, in the sample input, there are three test cases given. So perhaps the actual problem expects that the code can process multiple test cases. Wait, but looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe user provided the sample input as a list of strings, but perhaps that's just for illustration. Wait, the original problem's input is probably for a single test case. However, in the sample input given here, there are three test cases. But perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases as part of the input. Wait, maybe the original problem is expecting to read multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ... \n\nSo perhaps the actual problem is for a single test case. However, in the sample input given here, the user shows three test cases. But perhaps that's part of the example, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first line is ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'] — but perhaps that's not the actual input format. Wait, perhaps the user is showing",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days from a list of `n` days. The solution must efficiently compute the sum of sleep times for each possible week and then determine the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This technique allows us to efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive subarray of length `k` in linear time. Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: We start by computing the sum of the first `k` elements. For each subsequent window, we update the sum using the sliding window technique.\n3. **Average Calculation**: After computing the total sum of all valid windows, we divide this sum by the number of valid windows, which is `n - k + 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        total_sum = 0\n        # Calculate the sum of the first window\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum += current_sum\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        \n        # Slide the window\n        for i in range(1, num_weeks):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        \n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first `k` elements is computed to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the element that exits the window (the leftmost element of the previous window) and adding the new element that enters the window (the rightmost element of the current window).\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of valid windows to get the average, which is then printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution runs efficiently in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
