The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to do this modulo some mod value. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently. Since n can be up to 500, brute-forcing all possible pairs of permutations is impossible. The total number of permutations is n! and for each pair, checking conditions would be O(n^2), which is way too slow for n=500.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let's break down the problem into parts.\n\nThe main idea here is to find for each possible inversion count, the number of permutations with that count, and then compute the pairs where p has more inversions than q, and p is lex smaller than q.\n\nBut how to compute the number of permutations with a certain number of inversions?\n\nI remember that there's a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of permutations of size k with exactly m inversions. Let me recall that. The DP state could be dp[k][m], representing the number of permutations of length k with m inversions.\n\nThe recurrence relation for this is: dp[k][m] = sum_{i=0}^{min(k-1, m)} dp[k-1][m - i]. Because inserting the k-th element into a permutation of size k-1 can add between 0 and k-1 inversions, depending on where it's inserted.\n\nYes. So for example, inserting the new element at position j (0-based) in a permutation of length k-1 would add j inversions. So for each k, we can build up the dp table.\n\nOnce we have this dp table, we can precompute for all possible k (up to n) and m (up to max_inversions for that k). The maximum number of inversions for a permutation of size k is k*(k-1)/2.\n\nNow, the next part is to compute the number of pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet me think about the total number of unordered pairs (p, q) where p != q. But since we need p to be lex smaller than q, that's exactly half of the total when considering all ordered pairs (since for any two distinct permutations, one is lex smaller than the other). However, the condition here also requires that inv(p) > inv(q). So maybe we can compute the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), and then subtract those pairs where p is lex larger than q. Or perhaps find a way to compute the required count directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So if we can compute the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q, that's what we need.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. Let's first compute for all possible inversion counts i and j. Let's say that for inversion counts i and j, the number of permutations with i inversions is A[i], and with j inversions is A[j]. Then, for each pair (i, j) where i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is A[i] * A[j]. However, among these pairs, exactly half of them will have p < q and the other half will have p > q, assuming that for any two distinct permutations, one is lex smaller than the other. But wait, that's only true if all permutations are considered. However, if two permutations have the same inversion count, but different lex orderings, then they contribute to different pairs.\n\nWait, but when considering all possible (p, q) pairs with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, where i > j, then for each such pair (p, q), if p != q, then either p < q or q < p. However, the total number of such pairs is A[i] * A[j], but since for each pair (p, q) where p and q are different, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. But in our case, when i > j, the pair (p, q) contributes to our answer only if p < q. So how can we compute the number of such pairs?\n\nBut here's a problem: when i > j, for all permutations p with i inversions and q with j inversions, the number of pairs where p < q is equal to (total number of pairs (p, q) where p != q) / 2, plus the number of cases where p = q (but since p and q are different permutations, that's zero). Wait, no. For two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of pairs (p, q) with p != q is equal to the number of pairs where p < q plus the number where p > q. So for each i and j, if i > j, then the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j is A[i] * A[j], and among these, exactly (A[i] * A[j] - same_count) / 2 pairs have p < q, and same for p > q, where same_count is the number of pairs where p = q (which is zero, since p and q are different permutations). Wait, but p and q are different permutations, because they are from different inversion counts? No, not necessarily. Wait, if i > j, then inv(p) is i and inv(q) is j. So if i != j, then p and q can't be the same permutation. Because a permutation's inversion count is fixed. So in this case, for each pair (p, q) where p and q are different, and inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and i > j, then exactly half of them will have p < q and half will have p > q. Because for any pair (p, q) where p and q are different, exactly one of the two possibilities holds. Therefore, the total number of (p, q) pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to (sum over i > j of A[i] * A[j]) / 2. But wait, no. Because sum over i > j of A[i] * A[j] gives the total number of (p, q) pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), regardless of their lex order. Then, since for each such pair, exactly half of them have p < q and the other half have p > q. So the answer would be (total_pairs_with_inv_p_greater_than_inv_q) / 2. But wait, why?\n\nBecause for each pair (p, q) where p and q are distinct permutations and inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of p < q or q < p is true. Therefore, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is exactly equal to the total number of such pairs divided by 2. Because for each such pair (p, q), either (p, q) is counted here or (q, p) is counted in the other case (where inv(q) < inv(p)).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose we have a pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q). Then, since p and q are different permutations, either p < q or q < p. So for each such pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding pair (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p). But in our case, we are only counting the pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. So the total number of such pairs is exactly the same as the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how to compute that?\n\nBut the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), and for each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of such pairs is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q plus the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p > q. However, the latter is the same as the number of pairs (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p) and q < p. Which would be the same as the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. So I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of the following is true:\n\n- p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)\n- p < q and inv(p) < inv(q)\n- p > q and inv(p) > inv(q)\n- p > q and inv(p) < inv(q)\n\nBut since for each pair (p, q), exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, and for each pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds (if they are equal, then it's not counted in either case). So the total number of pairs (p, q) where p != q is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number where inv(p) < inv(q). \n\nBut since the problem requires us to find the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), which is exactly the same as the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. How can we compute this?\n\nLet me think of the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q. That is equal to (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) / 2. Because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q is T = (total_permutations choose 2). \n\nNow, among these T pairs, how many have inv(p) > inv(q)? Let's denote this as X. Similarly, how many have inv(p) < inv(q)? Let's denote this as Y. And how many have inv(p) = inv(q)? Let's denote this as Z. Then, X + Y + Z = T. But since inv(p) can't be equal to inv(q) for a pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q), but that's allowed. However, the problem's condition requires inv(p) > inv(q). So our answer is X.\n\nBut how to compute X?\n\nBut note that for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q). So the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) < inv(q), because for each pair (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), the pair (q, p) has inv(p) < inv(q). However, since in the total count of all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number with inv(p) < inv(q). So that total is (total_pairs - same_count) / 2, where same_count is the number of pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nBut then, how does this relate to X and Y?\n\nBecause X is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), and Y is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). Then, since for every pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), there is a corresponding pair (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). So the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X + (number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)), which is Y. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X (the pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) plus the number of pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me call that W. Similarly, the total number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) is Y (pairs where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q)) plus the number of pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) < inv(q), which is equal to the number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), which is Y. So the total number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is X + W, and the total number with inv(p) < inv(q) is Y + ... which equals Y + ... ?\n\nAlternatively, since for any pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. So the total number of such pairs is equal to total_pairs = (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)). And since the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) equals the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q), then each is equal to (total_pairs - same_count) / 2, where same_count is the number of pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nBut how to get X, which is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nWell, note that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q) (X) or inv(p) < inv(q) (Y) or inv(p) = inv(q) (Z). And X + Y + Z = T, where T is the total number of pairs (p < q) which is (total_permutations choose 2).\n\nBut how to find X?\n\nLet me think of the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_count) / 2. But this includes all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q. So this is equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q). Now, this can be split into two parts: those where p < q and those where p > q. \n\nBut for each pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding pair (q, p) where p > q and inv(q) < inv(p). Therefore, the number of such pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X + (number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)) which is Y. Wait, no. Because for the ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), it includes both (p, q) where p < q and (p, q) where p > q. But the total number of such pairs is (total_pairs - same_count)/2. \n\nBut how to find X?\n\nWe can think that for the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), which is S = (total_pairs - same_count)/2, this S is equal to X + W, where W is the number of pairs (p, q) with p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). But since for every pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), the pair (q, p) has p > q and inv(q) < inv(p), which is part of the pairs (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p). Therefore, the number of pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), which is Y. Therefore, S = X + Y. But since X + Y + Z = T (the number of pairs where p < q), and S = X + Y, then S = T - Z. \n\nWait, because T = X + Y + Z. So S = X + Y = T - Z. Therefore, X = (T - Z) - Y. But I don't know Y. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find X as follows. Let me think that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is X. Similarly, the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. And the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) is Z. Then, X + Y + Z = T.\n\nAlso, the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is X + (number of pairs (p, q) with p > q and inv(p) > inv(q)) = X + Y', where Y' is the number of such pairs. But earlier reasoning says that Y' is equal to Y. Because for each pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), there is a pair (q, p) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). So Y' = Y. Therefore, the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is X + Y. And this equals S = (total_pairs - same_count)/2. Also, since X + Y + Z = T, then X + Y = T - Z. Therefore, S = T - Z. But S is (total_pairs - same_count)/2. \n\nBut what is total_pairs? total_pairs is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q. Which is total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1). And same_count is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). So same_count = sum_{k} (A[k] * (A[k] - 1)), where A[k] is the number of permutations with k inversions. \n\nTherefore, S = [total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1) - same_count ] / 2. \n\nBut also, S = T - Z. Where T is (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) / 2, since that's the number of unordered pairs (p, q) with p < q. And Z is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nSo substituting:\n\nS = [total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1) - same_count ] / 2 = T - Z. \n\nWhich implies that T - Z = [total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1) - same_count ] / 2. \n\nBut T is (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1 )) / 2. So substituting:\n\n(total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1 )) / 2 - Z = [ total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1 ) - same_count ] / 2 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\ntotal_permutations * (total_permutations - 1 ) - 2Z = total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1 ) - same_count \n\nRearranged:\n\n-2Z = - same_count → same_count = 2Z. \n\nBut same_count is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). Which is sum_{k} A[k] * (A[k] - 1). And Z is the number of unordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). Which is sum_{k} C(A[k], 2). Which is sum_{k} A[k] * (A[k] - 1) / 2. So same_count is 2Z. Which matches. So yes, the equations are consistent.\n\nBut how does this help me find X?\n\nWell, we need to find X, which is the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). \n\nFrom earlier, S = X + Y = T - Z. And since X + Y + Z = T, then substituting:\n\nT - Z = X + Y → T - Z = (T - Z) → which is always true. Not helpful.\n\nBut perhaps another approach. Let me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is X, and the same for inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. Then X + Y + Z = T. Also, since for all unordered pairs (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. So the total number of such unordered pairs is (total_permutations choose 2) - Z. And since X + Y = (total_permutations choose 2) - Z. \n\nBut how to find X?\n\nIf I can find the total number of unordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), which is X, then that's our answer. How?\n\nLet me think of the following. For all pairs (p, q) with p < q, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is X. And the number of such pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. So X + Y = T - Z, where T is (total_permutations choose 2), and Z is the number of pairs with inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nBut how to find X? Well, perhaps we can find the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) as follows:\n\nX = (sum_{i > j} (A[i] * A[j] - same_count_ij) ) / 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Because for each i and j where i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j is A[i] * A[j]. Among these, the number of pairs where p < q is (A[i] * A[j] - same_count_ij) / 2, where same_count_ij is the number of pairs where p = q. But since p and q are different permutations (because i != j), same_count_ij is zero. So for each i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q is (A[i] * A[j]) / 2. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for each pair of permutations (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and i != j, then exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Therefore, for each i and j with i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j and p < q is exactly (A[i] * A[j]) / 2. Because for each such pair (p, q) where p and q are different permutations, exactly one of the two possibilities holds. \n\nBut this is only true if for all permutations p and q with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, i != j, the number of pairs where p < q is exactly (A[i] * A[j])/2. \n\nBut that's not necessarily the case. Because the lex order of permutations depends on their actual elements, not just their inversion counts. So for example, two permutations with different inversion counts may have varying numbers of pairs where p < q. \n\nWait, but for all pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and i != j, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is exactly equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where q < p. Because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of the two holds. So the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j is A[i] * A[j], and since each pair (p, q) is unique and p != q (because i != j), then exactly half of them have p < q and the other half have q < p. \n\nYes! Because for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Therefore, for each i and j where i != j, the number of (p, q) pairs with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q is equal to (A[i] * A[j]) / 2. \n\nBut wait, this would only be true if for all pairs of permutations (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and i != j, the number of such pairs is even. Which is not necessarily the case. For example, if A[i] * A[j] is odd, then dividing by 2 would give a fraction. But this is impossible because the number of pairs must be integer. \n\nAh, but for i != j, the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j is A[i] * A[j]. And for each such pair (p, q) where p != q, which they are since i != j, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Therefore, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q is exactly (A[i] * A[j] - same_count) / 2, where same_count is the number of pairs where p = q. But since i != j, same_count is zero. Therefore, the number of such pairs is (A[i] * A[j]) / 2. \n\nBut this is only possible if A[i] * A[j] is even. Which may not be the case. However, the sum over all i and j where i != j of A[i] * A[j] is even. Because the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q is even. \n\nBut this suggests that for each i and j, the product A[i] * A[j] must be even if i != j. But that's not necessarily true. For example, if A[i] = 1 and A[j] = 1, then the product is 1, which is odd. But then, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is 1, and since p and q are distinct, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the count for p < q is 1/2, which is impossible. \n\nWait, this indicates that my previous reasoning is wrong. Where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! Oh right, because when i and j are different, but for the same pair (p, q), inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j. However, if i and j are different, then p and q are distinct permutations. So the total number of such pairs is A[i] * A[j]. For each such pair (p, q), exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is exactly equal to the number of pairs (q, p) where q < p. Therefore, the total number of such pairs is (A[i] * A[j]) / 2. But this requires that A[i] * A[j] is even. Otherwise, this would not be possible. \n\nBut this is only possible if the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j is even. Which is not necessarily the case. So where is the error?\n\nWait, for example, suppose i = 0 and j = 1. Let's say A[i] = 1 (only the identity permutation has 0 inversions), and A[j] = 1 (some permutation with 1 inversion). Then, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p)=0 and inv(q)=1 is 1*1=1. But for this pair, either p < q or q < p. Which one is it? Well, the identity permutation is [1, 2], and a permutation with one inversion is [2, 1]. The lex order between [1,2] and [2,1] is [1,2] < [2,1], so the count for p < q is 1. But according to the formula (A[i] * A[j])/2, it would be 1/2, which is impossible. \n\nThis shows that the previous assumption is wrong. Therefore, my reasoning was incorrect. \n\nSo what's the correct way to compute X?\n\nAlternative approach: For all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the sum over all i > j of the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q. \n\nBut how to compute that sum?\n\nThe problem is that for a given i and j, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q is not simply A[i] * A[j] / 2. Because the lex order of p and q depends on their actual structure, not just their inversion counts.\n\nSo this seems like a dead end. How else can I approach this?\n\nPerhaps, I need to find for each permutation p, the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have fewer inversions than p. Then, summing over all p and q gives the answer.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the sum for all p of (number of q > p with inv(q) < inv(p)).\n\nSo if I can compute for each permutation p, the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have fewer inversions than p, then summing all these numbers would give the answer.\n\nBut with n up to 500, this seems computationally impossible. There are n! permutations, which is way too big for n=500.\n\nThus, I need another approach. Let's think again.\n\nLet me consider that the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is equal to total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1) / 2. Let me denote this as T.\n\nLet me also consider that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of such pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is X, and the number with inv(p) < inv(q) is Y. We have X + Y + Z = T, where Z is the number of pairs with inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nNow, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is X, which is our desired answer.\n\nBut how to find X?\n\nLet me think about the following: the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is S = (total_pairs - same_count) / 2, where same_count is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nBut this S includes all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q). This includes both (p, q) where p < q and (p, q) where p > q. \n\nBut for each pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), there exists a pair (q, p) where p > q and inv(q) < inv(p). Thus, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(q) < inv(p) and p > q. \n\nBut the total number of such pairs is S = X + (number of pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q)) = X + W. But since W is the number of pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q), which is equal to the number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), which is Y. \n\nThus, S = X + Y. \n\nBut from earlier, X + Y = T - Z. \n\nSo S = T - Z. \n\nBut S is also equal to (total_pairs - same_count) / 2. \n\nSo, solving for X:\n\nWe have S = T - Z. \n\nBut how to find X?\n\nAnother observation: the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(q) < inv(p). Which is X. \n\nBut how to find X?\n\nLet me think of the following: for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of such pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), which is X. \n\nBut how to compute this using the inversion counts?\n\nMaybe I can compute the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q as follows:\n\nFor all pairs (p, q) with p < q, the sum over all pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the sum for all i, j where i > j of (number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, p < q).\n\nBut how to compute this number for each i and j?\n\nThis brings us back to the original problem of finding, for each pair (i, j), the number of (p, q) pairs with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following: for a given i and j, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where p has i inversions, q has j inversions, and p is lex smaller than q. \n\nBut how to compute this? It seems like it's impossible to compute this for large n without knowing something about the relationship between the inversion counts and lex order.\n\nBut perhaps there's a symmetry here. For example, for all pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and i != j, the number of pairs where p < q is equal to the number of pairs where q < p multiplied by some factor. But I don't see a direct way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and p < q, is equal to (A[i] * A[j] + D[i][j]) / 2, where D[i][j] is some difference based on the relationship between i and j. But I don't know what D[i][j] is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is equal to (C[i][j] + D[i][j]) / 2, where C[i][j] is the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and D[i][j] is the number of pairs where p < q minus the number where q < p. But this doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me think of the example given in the problem statement. For n=4, the answer is 17. Let me see what the values would be.\n\nFor n=4, the number of permutations is 24. The total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is 24*23/2 = 276. \n\nNow, let's assume that the answer is 17. So X = 17. \n\nBut how to compute this using the inversion counts.\n\nLet me think of the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q). Let me compute that. \n\nFor n=4, the inversion counts can range from 0 to 6. Let me compute the number of permutations for each inversion count. For example, the number of permutations with 0 inversions is 1, with 1 inversion is 1 (no, wait for n=4, the inversion counts are more varied). Let me look up the inversion count distribution for n=4.\n\nActually, for n=4, the number of permutations with k inversions is known. For example, for k=0: 1 (identity), k=1: 1 ([2,1,3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$ and the number of inversions in $p$ is greater than the number of inversions in $q$.
