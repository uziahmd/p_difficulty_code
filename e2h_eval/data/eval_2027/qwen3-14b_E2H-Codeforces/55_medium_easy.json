    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But you can't swap 0 and 2 directly. So, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (if adjacent) and between 1 and 2 (if adjacent). \n\nHmm. So, what does that mean for the order of characters? Well, since we can swap 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s, but not 0s and 2s. So, maybe the 0s can move past 1s, and 2s can move past 1s, but 0s and 2s can't pass each other. Wait, no. Because if you can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, then perhaps 0s can move past 1s and 2s? Wait no, because if there's a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. But if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, then maybe you can move the 0 past the 1 and then the 1 past the 2. But that would allow the 0 to end up before the 2. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, suppose the string is \"0 2\". Can't swap. But if it's \"0 1 2\", then you can swap the 0 and 1 to get \"1 0 2\", then swap the 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. Wait, but the 0 and 2 are not adjacent. So, in that case, the 0 can't move past the 2. So, the 0 can only move through 1s, and the 2 can only move through 1s. So, the relative order between 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. But if there's a 0 followed by some 1s and then a 2, then perhaps you can move the 0 to the left of the 1s and the 2 to the right of the 1s. But the 0 and 2 would still be in their original order. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 before a 2, then in the final string, all 0s must come before the 2s. Wait, no. Because if there's a 0 and a 2, but they are separated by 1s, then maybe you can arrange the 0s and 2s in any order as long as their relative positions are maintained? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose the original string is \"0 1 2\". Then, can we swap the 0 and 1 to get \"1 0 2\", then swap the 1 and 2 to get \"1 2 0\"? But that's not possible. Because the 0 and 2 are not adjacent. So, the 0 can't move past the 2. So, in this case, the 0 can't be moved to the end. So, the relative order of 0 and 2 is fixed. Because in the original string, the 0 is before the 2. So in the final string, all 0s must come before 2s. Because you can't swap them. So, the 0s and 2s can't pass each other. Therefore, the relative positions of 0s and 2s in the original string are fixed. Only the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but if you have a 0 and a 2 with 1s in between. For example, \"0 1 1 2\". Then, can we move the 0s and 2s past each other? Well, no. Because the 0 can be moved left or right through the 1s. Similarly, the 2 can be moved left or right through the 1s. But if the 0 is to the left of the 2, then the 0 can't move to the right of the 2. Because the 0 can't swap with the 2. So, the 0 can be moved as far left as possible through the 1s, and the 2 can be moved as far right as possible through the 1s. But the 0 and 2 can't cross each other. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is preserved. So, for example, if in the original string, a 0 comes before a 2, then in the final string, all 0s must come before 2s. So the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, and arrange the 1s in between them. But how?\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved around. For example, any 1 can be moved to the left of 0s (if they are adjacent to 0s) and to the right of 2s (if adjacent to 2s). But how?\n\nSo, here's the idea: the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. However, the 1s can be moved freely between 0s and 2s. So, for example, any 1s can be placed between 0s and 2s. But how to arrange them optimally.\n\nSo the minimal lex string would be achieved by grouping all 0s first, then 1s, then 2s. But that's not possible if the original order of 0s and 2s is different. For example, if the original string is '20', then we can't swap them. So the output is '20'.\n\nBut if the original string is '210', then the 2 can't move past the 0. So the 2 is before the 0, so in the final string, the 2 must be before the 0. But the 1 can be moved. So the original string is '2 1 0'. We can swap 1 and 0 (since they are adjacent) to get '2 0 1'. But then the 2 is before the 0. So the final string is '201'. But that's the minimal possible. However, if the original string was '201', then we can't swap the 2 and 0. But the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So '201' can become '210', but that's worse. So the minimal is '201'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let's think again. The allowed swaps are:\n\n- Swap adjacent 0 and 1 (so they can be moved past each other)\n- Swap adjacent 1 and 2 (so they can be moved past each other)\n\nSo, the 0s and 1s can be rearranged among themselves, but only as long as they are moving through 1s. Wait, no. The 0s can be swapped with 1s, which allows them to move past each other. Similarly, the 2s can be swapped with 1s, allowing them to move past each other. But 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So, the 0s can be moved past 1s, and the 2s can be moved past 1s. But 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is fixed. So, for example, if there is a 0 before a 2 in the original string, then in the final string, all 0s must be before all 2s. But the 1s can be arranged anywhere else. \n\nSo the strategy is to:\n\n1. Keep the relative order of 0s and 2s as in the original string. \n2. For the 1s, arrange them in between the 0s and 2s, but also possibly grouped together.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s optimally. Since 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s, but not between 0s and 2s. Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose there is a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2. Then, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0 (if possible) or to the right of the 2 (if possible). But the 0 and 2 can't cross. So, the 1 can be placed anywhere between the 0 and 2. But how?\n\nLet me think of the entire process. The 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. Wait, no. Because the 1 can be swapped with 0s (so 1 can move left or right through 0s) and with 2s (so 1 can move left or right through 2s). So, the 1s can be moved anywhere. But the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. So, the 1s can be arranged in any order, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. So, the minimal string would be formed by:\n\n- All 0s in their original order, but arranged as early as possible (but can't cross 2s)\n- All 2s in their original order, arranged as late as possible (but can't cross 0s)\n- All 1s can be placed in between, and also possibly grouped with 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, but arrange the 1s between them. For example, if the original string has a 0, then some 1s, then a 2, then the 1s can be moved to be between the 0 and 2. But how to arrange them. Since the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s. So, in the minimal lex string, the 1s should be placed as early as possible, but perhaps grouped with the 0s and 2s. Wait, but the 1s can be arranged in any order. Wait, but since the 1s can be moved past each other. For example, if there are multiple 1s, their order can be changed. But since we want the lex smallest string, we can arrange the 1s in any order, but since all 1s are same, their order doesn't matter. So, the 1s can be grouped together, and placed between the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So, the minimal lex string would be formed by:\n\nGrouping all 0s, then all 1s, then all 2s. But only if the original string's 0s and 2s are in such a way that they can be arranged like that. But if the original string has a 2 before a 0, then that's not allowed. So, for example, if the original string is '20', then the answer is '20'. If the original string is '201', then the 2 is before the 0. So, the 0 can't move past the 2. So the 0 is after the 2. So the minimal string would be '012'? No, because the 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So in the original string '201', the 0 is after the 2. So, in the final string, the 2 must be before the 0. So the minimal possible is '012'? No, that would require the 2 to be after the 0. Which isn't allowed. So the original string is '201'. How can we arrange it? Let's see:\n\nOriginal is '2', '0', '1'. The 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So the 2 must be before the 0. The 0 can be swapped with the 1. So, we can swap the 0 and 1 to get '210'. But that's better than '201'? Let's compare. '201' vs '210'. The first character is 2. Second character is 0 vs 1. So '201' is lex smaller. So the minimal is '201'? Wait, but can we do anything else? Well, the 2 and 0 can't be swapped. The 1 can be moved. So, in the original string, the 1 is after the 0. So, the 0 can be swapped with the 1, which gives '210'. But that's worse. So the minimal is '201'.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So, the 0s and 2s must appear in the same order as in the original string. However, the 1s can be moved around. So, the idea is to arrange the 1s as early as possible, but considering the order of 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps, the approach is to split the original string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s, but maintaining the order of 0s and 2s. But that's not exactly correct. For example, the original string may have 0s and 2s interleaved with 1s. But the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So, for example, if the original string is '0 2 1 0 2', then the 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 2, 0, 2. So, in the final string, the order of these 0s and 2s must be preserved, but the 1s can be moved around.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, but without the 1s. Let's call this the \"fixed\" part.\n\n2. Then, collect all the 1s, and insert them into the fixed part in positions where they can be placed to make the string lex smallest.\n\nBut how to insert the 1s optimally. Since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. For example, between two 0s, between a 0 and a 2, between a 2 and a 0 (but that's not allowed, since the 0s and 2s can't cross), etc.\n\nWait, no. The fixed part is the sequence of 0s and 2s in their original order. So, the 1s can be inserted in between any of these elements. For example, between two 0s, between a 0 and a 2, between a 2 and a 0 (but wait, that's not possible because the original order of 0s and 2s must be preserved. So, if the fixed part is [0, 2], then the 1s can be inserted before the 0, between the 0 and 2, or after the 2. But not between 2 and 0 if the original order is 0 then 2. \n\nSo the idea is: the fixed part is a list of characters that are either 0 or 2, in the same order as in the original string. Then, the 1s can be placed in any positions in the fixed part, but inserting them in the optimal way.\n\nBut how to insert them optimally. Since the 1s are all the same, and the lex smallest string is achieved when the 1s are as far to the left as possible. But that depends on the surrounding characters.\n\nFor example, inserting a 1 between a 0 and a 2 would be better than inserting it after the 2. Because 0 < 1 < 2. So inserting the 1 between the 0 and 2 would make the string lex smaller.\n\nBut if inserting the 1 between a 0 and a 2, then the 1 is in between. So the 1 is placed as early as possible. So, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s in the fixed part where they can be placed to make the lex smallest.\n\nBut how to model this. For example, the fixed part is a list of 0s and 2s. Let's say the fixed part is [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], where each a_i is 0 or 2. Then, the 1s can be inserted between any of these elements, or at the beginning, or at the end. \n\nThe goal is to insert all the 1s into the fixed part, in positions that minimize the lex order. Since 1 is larger than 0 but smaller than 2, inserting 1s between 0s and 2s would be better than inserting them after 2s.\n\nFor example, if the fixed part is [0, 2], inserting the 1s between the 0 and 2 would give [0, 1, 1, 2], which is better than inserting them after the 2, which would be [0, 2, 1, 1]. Also, inserting them before the 0 is better than inserting them between 0 and 2? No, because inserting before the 0 would be [1, 0, 2, ...], but that's better than [0, 1, ...], since 1 is larger than 0. Wait, no. The lex order is determined by the first differing character. So, if the fixed part is [0, 2], and we have 1s to insert, then inserting them before the 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So, the best place to insert the 1s is between the 0 and 2, or after the 0 and before the 2. But inserting them between the 0 and 2 gives a better lex order than inserting them after the 2. \n\nBut inserting them between the 0 and 2 would be better than inserting them after the 0. Because inserting them after the 0 would be [0, 1, 1, 2], which is better than [0, 2, 1, 1]. \n\nWait, but inserting the 1s between the 0 and 2 would make the string 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than having the 2 followed by 1s. So, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s. \n\nBut how to determine where to insert the 1s. For example, if the fixed part is [0, 0, 2, 2], then inserting all 1s between the 0s and 2s. So, the resulting string is 00 followed by all 1s followed by 22. Which is the lex smallest possible.\n\nBut if the fixed part is [2, 0], then the 2 is before the 0. So the 1s can be inserted before the 2, between 2 and 0, or after the 0. Inserting between 2 and 0 would give 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. But since 1 is less than 0? No, 1 is less than 0? No, 0 is less than 1. So inserting the 1s between 2 and 0 would result in 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. But that's worse than inserting the 1s after the 0. Because the first position is 2, and inserting after the 0 would be 2, 0, 1s. Which is worse than inserting the 1s between 2 and 0? Let's compare:\n\nCase 1: [2, 1s, 0] â†’ '21...0'\n\nCase 2: [2, 0, 1s] â†’ '20...1'\n\nWhich is lex smaller? Let's take the first differing position. In both cases, first character is 2. Second character is 0 (case 2) vs 1 (case 1). Since 0 < 1, case 2 is better. So inserting the 1s after the 0 is better than inserting between 2 and 0. So, in this case, inserting the 1s after the 0 is better. But how to decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nSo, the problem is that the 1s can be inserted into any of the possible gaps between the fixed elements. The gaps are:\n\n- Before the first element of the fixed part.\n\n- Between each pair of consecutive elements.\n\n- After the last element of the fixed part.\n\nThe goal is to insert all the 1s into these gaps in such a way that the overall string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to choose which gaps to insert the 1s into.\n\nSince inserting the 1s into a gap between a previous element and next element will affect the lex order. For example, inserting between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting after the 2, because 0 < 1 < 2. So inserting the 1s between 0 and 2 makes the string lex smaller. But inserting between a 2 and a 0 (if that's allowed) would be worse than inserting after the 0. But in that case, the 2 is before the 0, so inserting between them would create a 2 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than inserting the 1s after the 0.\n\nSo, the key is to find for each gap between the fixed elements, whether inserting the 1s there would be better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nBut how to model this. Since the 1s can be inserted into any of the gaps, and the optimal choice is to insert them into the earliest possible gap that allows the lex smallest string.\n\nWait, but since all the 1s are the same, inserting them all into the earliest possible gap that gives the best result.\n\nLet me think. For each gap between the fixed elements, we can decide whether inserting the 1s there would be better than inserting them elsewhere. For example, inserting into a gap between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting into a gap after the 2, because inserting into the first gap would place the 1s earlier in the string, which is better.\n\nBut when comparing two gaps, which one is better to insert the 1s. For example, inserting the 1s into a gap between a 0 and 2 is better than inserting them into a gap between a 0 and 0. Because inserting into the first gap would allow the 1s to be placed between 0 and 2, which is better than placing them between two 0s. Because 0 is smaller than 1, but inserting between two 0s would give 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is better than inserting them after the 0 (which would be 0 followed by 0, then 1s). But that depends on the positions.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gap where inserting them would be beneficial. But how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that inserting the 1s into a gap between a and b (where a is the previous element in the fixed part, and b is the next element in the fixed part) is better if inserting them there would make the string lex smaller. For example, if a is 0 and b is 2, inserting the 1s between them is better than inserting them after the 2. If a is 2 and b is 0, inserting the 1s between them would be worse than inserting them after the 0.\n\nBut how to find the best gap to insert all the 1s. Since inserting all the 1s into the same gap is optimal.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the earliest possible gap where inserting the 1s would not make the string worse. But how?\n\nAnother approach is to consider that inserting the 1s into the gaps between the fixed elements in a way that for each gap, the insertion of the 1s would be as early as possible, but considering the surrounding elements.\n\nFor example, the best place to insert the 1s is in the earliest gap where the previous element is as small as possible and the next element is as large as possible. Because inserting the 1s between a 0 and a 2 gives the best possible scenario.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n- Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this list 'fixed'.\n\n- Collect all the 1s in a list 'ones'.\n\n- Now, we need to insert all the 'ones' into the 'fixed' list in the optimal positions.\n\n- To find where to insert the 1s, iterate through the possible gaps (before the first element, between elements, after last element) and choose the gap where inserting the 1s would give the lex smallest result.\n\nBut how to choose which gap. For example, for each possible gap, inserting the 1s there would create a new string. We need to find the gap that gives the lex smallest string when inserting all the 1s there.\n\nBut with a large input size, we can't check all possibilities for each gap. However, given that the 1s are all the same, perhaps we can find the optimal gap quickly.\n\nLet me think about the possible gaps. For each gap between a and b (where a is the previous element, and b is the next element), inserting the 1s there would create a segment of 1s between a and b. The question is, which of these gaps is the best to insert the 1s.\n\nThe best gap is the earliest one where the previous element is as small as possible and the next element is as large as possible. Because inserting the 1s there would allow the 1s to be placed between a lower and higher value, which would be better for lex order.\n\nFor example, inserting between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting between two 0s or two 2s. Because inserting between 0 and 2 allows the 1s to be placed where they are between a 0 and a 2. \n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gap where the previous element is 0 and the next element is 2. If there are multiple such gaps, inserting into the earliest one. If there are no such gaps, then insert the 1s into the earliest possible gap where inserting them would not make the string worse.\n\nAlternatively, for each gap, the decision to insert the 1s there can be made based on the following:\n\nIf the previous element is 0 and the next element is 2, inserting the 1s here is optimal.\n\nIf the previous element is 0 and the next element is 0, inserting the 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the 0s (since inserting between the 0s would make the string have 0, 1s, 0, which is worse than 0s followed by 1s).\n\nWait, but inserting between two 0s would result in 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than inserting the 1s after the 0s. Because inserting after the 0s would give 0s followed by 1s. Which is better. So, in this case, inserting between two 0s is worse than inserting after the 0s.\n\nSimilarly, inserting between two 2s would be worse than inserting after the 2s. \n\nSo, the optimal gap is the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would be between a 0 and a 2. If such a gap exists, insert all the 1s there. Otherwise, insert them in the earliest possible gap where inserting them would not make the string worse. \n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible gap, compute the best possible insertion point. The best insertion point is the one where inserting the 1s would result in the lex smallest string.\n\nTo compare two gaps, say gap i and gap j, we can compare the strings generated by inserting the 1s into each gap. But for a large number of gaps, this could be computationally expensive. However, given that the 1s are all the same, perhaps we can find the optimal gap in O(n) time.\n\nLet me think about the possible insertion points. The insertion points can be considered as positions between elements of the fixed list. For example, the fixed list is [a_0, a_1, ..., a_m], and there are m+1 gaps (before a_0, between a_0 and a_1, ..., after a_m).\n\nFor each gap, inserting the 1s into that gap would generate a string that starts with the elements up to that gap, followed by the 1s, then the rest of the fixed elements.\n\nWe need to choose the gap where inserting the 1s would make the entire string lex smallest.\n\nLet's think of the insertion into a gap as follows: for each gap, the first position where the 1s are inserted is at the gap. So, the first position where the 1s are inserted is between the previous element and the next element.\n\nThe lex order of the string depends on the earliest position where the 1s are inserted. For example, inserting the 1s into an earlier gap would make them appear earlier in the string, which may be better or worse depending on the surrounding elements.\n\nSo, to find the best gap, we can compare the possible insertion positions and choose the one that gives the lex smallest string.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently.\n\nLet's think of the following: for each gap, the insertion of the 1s into that gap would create a prefix of the string up to that gap, then the 1s, then the rest. The best gap is the one where inserting the 1s gives the earliest possible 1s that are as small as possible.\n\nFor example, inserting the 1s into the earliest possible gap where the previous element is 0 and the next element is 2 would be optimal.\n\nIf there are no such gaps, then inserting the 1s into the earliest possible gap where the previous element is 0 (and the next element is 0 or 2) or the next element is 2 (and the previous is 0 or 2).\n\nAlternatively, the best gap is the one where inserting the 1s would be in the earliest possible position where the previous element is as small as possible and the next element is as large as possible.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n- Iterate through all possible gaps (including before the first element and after the last element).\n\n- For each gap, determine the optimal insertion point based on the previous and next elements.\n\n- The optimal insertion point is the one where inserting the 1s would result in the lex smallest string. Among all gaps, choose the one that gives the lex smallest string when inserting the 1s.\n\nBut how to compare two gaps.\n\nLet me think of two gaps, gap1 and gap2. For each, inserting the 1s into that gap would generate a string. We need to compare which of these two options is better.\n\nFor example, gap1 is between a and b, and gap2 is between c and d. How to compare inserting into gap1 vs gap2.\n\nThe comparison can be done by looking at the first position where the two options differ. \n\nBut how to do that without generating the entire string.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would be as good as possible.\n\nLet me think of the possible gaps:\n\nCase 1: inserting before the first element. The string would start with 1s followed by the fixed list. This is better than inserting in other gaps only if the fixed list starts with a 2. For example, if the fixed list is [2, 0], inserting the 1s before the 2 gives [1s, 2, 0], which is better than inserting them between 2 and 0 (which would be [2, 1s, 0]) or after 0 (which is [2, 0, 1s]).\n\nBut if the fixed list starts with a 0, inserting the 1s before the 0 would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0.\n\nSo inserting before the first element is only good if the first element is 2.\n\nCase 2: inserting between two elements. For example, between a and b. The decision depends on a and b.\n\nIf a is 0 and b is 2, inserting the 1s here is optimal. Because inserting them here gives 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nIf a is 0 and b is 0, inserting the 1s here would give 0 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than inserting them after the 0s (so that the 1s are after all 0s).\n\nSimilarly, if a is 2 and b is 2, inserting the 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the 2s.\n\nIf a is 0 and b is 2, this is the best possible insertion point.\n\nIf a is 2 and b is 0, inserting the 1s here would give 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than inserting the 1s after the 0 (since the first difference would be between the 2 and the 0 in the latter case).\n\nSo, the best insertion point is the earliest occurrence of a gap where a is 0 and b is 2.\n\nIf there are no such gaps, then the next best option is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gap where inserting them would not cause the string to be worse. For example, inserting them after all 0s (if there are any 0s) or before all 2s (if there are any 2s).\n\nAlternatively, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Find all the gaps where inserting the 1s would be better than other options.\n\n- Among those, choose the earliest one.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Split the original string into the fixed list (all 0s and 2s in their original order) and the list of 1s.\n\n2. Find all possible insertion positions (gaps) for the 1s.\n\n3. For each insertion position, determine the best way to insert the 1s.\n\nBut how to find the best insertion position.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe best insertion position is the earliest one where inserting the 1s would be as early as possible, but not causing the string to be worse. For example, inserting between a 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 0 and 0, which is better than inserting between 2 and 2, etc.\n\nSo, we can iterate through the gaps and for each gap, compute a priority based on the following:\n\n- The priority is determined by the previous element and the next element. For example, the priority for inserting between a and b is:\n\n   - If a is 0 and b is 2: highest priority (best insertion point).\n\n   - Else if a is 0: higher priority than inserting between 2 and something else.\n\n   - Else if b is 2: higher priority than inserting between something else and something else.\n\n   - Else: lower priority.\n\nBut how to compare between different gaps.\n\nAlternatively, for each gap, we can generate a key that represents the best insertion point. For example, the key for inserting between a and b would be:\n\n- (prev_char, next_char). For example, (0, 2) is better than (0, 0), which is better than (2, 2), etc.\n\nThen, among all gaps, the best one is the one with the lowest (prev_char, next_char) key, but this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the best insertion point is the one that allows the earliest possible insertion of the 1s. For example, inserting the 1s as early as possible where they can be placed between a 0 and a 2. If there are no such gaps, then insert them as early as possible where inserting them between a 0 and something else, or between something else and a 2.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAnother idea: the optimal insertion point is the earliest possible position where the previous character is as small as possible and the next character is as large as possible. So, for example, inserting between 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 0 and 0, which is better than inserting between 2 and 2, etc.\n\nSo, we can iterate through the gaps in order from first to last, and for each gap, check if inserting the 1s here would be better than inserting them in any previously considered gaps.\n\nOnce we find the first gap where inserting the 1s would be optimal, we can insert them there.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the fixed list is [0, 2, 0, 2]. The gaps are:\n\ngap 0: before 0\n\ngap 1: between 0 and 2\n\ngap 2: between 2 and 0\n\ngap 3: between 0 and 2\n\ngap 4: after 2\n\nSo, the best",
