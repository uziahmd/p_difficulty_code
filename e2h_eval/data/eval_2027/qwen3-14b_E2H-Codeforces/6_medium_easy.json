Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the task is to find two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the sum of their costs is as small as possible. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the duration is. Oh right, the duration of a voucher is ri - li + 1. So for each voucher, we can precompute that. Then, for each voucher i, we need to find another voucher j such that:\n\n- The durations of i and j sum to x. So if voucher i has duration d, then voucher j must have duration x - d.\n- The vouchers don't overlap. Which means either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\nSo the approach could be: for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with the required duration that doesn't overlap with it. And track the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently? Because n can be up to 2e5, so O(n^2) would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think. Let's group vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we look for vouchers with duration (x - d). But how to find the ones that don't overlap?\n\nBut even then, for each voucher, checking all vouchers of the required duration might be expensive. So perhaps we need a way to quickly find the minimum cost voucher of a certain duration that doesn't overlap with the current voucher.\n\nWait, but for each voucher i with duration d, we need to find a voucher j with duration (x - d), such that j's interval does not overlap with i's. And among all such j's, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can check for vouchers of duration (x - d_i). But how to find the minimal cost among those that don't overlap with i's interval.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently? Let's think about the structure of the vouchers. For example, suppose we have a list of vouchers with duration k. For a given voucher i with duration d, we need to find vouchers in the k group (where k = x - d) that end before i starts, or start after i ends.\n\nSo for each voucher in the k group, we can check if they are non-overlapping with i. But again, doing this for every voucher in the group would be O(n) per query, leading to O(n^2) time overall, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: pre-process for each duration, the vouchers sorted by their end time and start time. Then, for a given voucher i, when looking for vouchers in the k group that end before li, we can find the minimal cost among those. Similarly, find vouchers that start after ri, and take the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for vouchers of duration k, if we sort them by their end time, then for a given li, we can find all vouchers in that group with end time < li. The minimal cost among them can be found using a prefix min array. Similarly, if we sort them by start time, and find all vouchers with start time > ri, then find the minimal cost in that subset.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think. Let's say for each duration k, we have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time (ri), and for each position, we have the minimum cost up to that point. So that when we want to find the minimal cost for vouchers ending before some value, we can perform a binary search on the end times and then get the min from the prefix up to that index.\n\n- Another sorted by start time (li), and similarly for the suffix.\n\nBut how to manage this. Let's think for each duration k, we can have two structures:\n\n1. A sorted list of vouchers by their end time, along with a prefix min array. So for any end time, we can find the earliest end time that is less than li, and get the minimum cost in that prefix.\n\n2. A sorted list of vouchers by their start time, along with a suffix min array. So for any start time, we can find the earliest start time that is greater than ri, and get the minimum cost in that suffix.\n\nBut how to build these structures. For example, for each duration k, we can collect all vouchers of that duration, sort them by end time, then create a prefix min array. Similarly, sort them by start time, and create a suffix min array.\n\nSo, for example, for a voucher i with duration d, and looking for vouchers of duration k = x -d. For each such voucher in the k group, we need to check if they are non-overlapping with i. So:\n\nCase 1: voucher j ends before i starts. That is, rj < li. So for the k group, we can find the minimal cost among all vouchers with rj < li.\n\nCase 2: voucher j starts after i ends. That is, lj > ri. So for the k group, find the minimal cost among all vouchers with lj > ri.\n\nSo for each voucher i, we can compute these two possibilities, and take the minimum between them. Then, for each voucher i, we check if there are any vouchers in the k group that satisfy either of these conditions, and take the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, where the key is duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Let's call this duration_dict.\n\n2. For each duration in duration_dict, we process the vouchers to create two sorted lists:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time (ri), and a prefix min array of costs. So for each index in the sorted list, the prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from 0 to i.\n\n   b. Sorted by start time (li), and a suffix min array of costs. So for each index in the sorted list, the suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end.\n\n3. Then, for each voucher i in the original list:\n\n   a. Compute d = duration of i. Check if (x - d) exists in duration_dict. If not, skip.\n\n   b. Else, for the k = x - d group, check both cases:\n\n      i. Find the minimal cost voucher in k group that ends before li. How? Since the list is sorted by end time, we can perform a binary search to find the largest end time that is less than li. Then, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\n      ii. Find the minimal cost voucher in k group that starts after ri. Since the list is sorted by start time, we can perform a binary search to find the first start time that is greater than ri. Then, the suffix min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\n   c. Take the minimum of the two options (if any) and add it to the current voucher's cost. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\n4. After checking all vouchers, if there's a valid pair, output the minimum, else -1.\n\nBut how to handle the binary searches?\n\nFor case i: For the list sorted by end time, we can find the maximum end time that is less than li. Let's say the list is sorted as [r1, r2, ..., rn], sorted in increasing order. We can use bisect_left to find the insertion point of li, and then the index is insertion_point - 1. If insertion_point is 0, then there are no such vouchers. Else, the prefix_min up to insertion_point -1 is the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly for case ii: For the list sorted by start time, we can find the first start time that is greater than ri. Using bisect_right for ri, and then the suffix_min from that index onwards.\n\nWait, let's think about the start time sorted list. Suppose we have a list of start times sorted in increasing order. We want to find vouchers with start time > ri. So the first element in the list that is > ri. The bisect_right function returns the insertion point for ri in the list, which is the index of the first element greater than ri. So all elements from that index onwards are candidates. The suffix_min array for that list would allow us to get the minimal cost from that index to the end.\n\nSo, for each duration k, we need to have:\n\n- A sorted list of (end time, cost) sorted by end time, with prefix min array.\n\n- A sorted list of (start time, cost) sorted by start time, with suffix min array.\n\nSo, for example, for the k group vouchers:\n\nsorted_end = sorted by ri, and for each position, prefix_min[i] is min(prefix_min[i-1], cost)\n\nsorted_start = sorted by li, and for each position, suffix_min[i] is min(suffix_min[i+1], cost)\n\nBut how to build these.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps again.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen read each voucher, compute its duration (ri - li + 1). Then, group them into the duration_dict. For each duration, we'll store two lists: sorted by end time and sorted by start time, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nBut for each duration in duration_dict, we need to process the vouchers. For example, for each duration k, we have:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.end)\nprefix_min = [ ... ] where each element is the minimum cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.start)\nsuffix_min = [ ... ] where each element is the minimum cost from that index to end.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher i in the original list, we can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, for the code, perhaps we can represent each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost). Then, for each duration, we can process the list.\n\nBut how to handle the prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nLet me think about an example. Suppose for a duration k, we have vouchers sorted by end time. The list is [(r1, cost1), (r2, cost2), ...], sorted by r in ascending order. The prefix_min array is computed as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = cost1\n\nprefix_min[1] = min(prefix_min[0], cost2)\n\nand so on.\n\nSo for each index i in the sorted_by_end list, prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers.\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_by_start list, which is sorted by li in ascending order. The suffix_min array is computed as follows:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = cost of last voucher.\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min( cost of voucher i, suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nSo for each index i, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end.\n\nOnce these structures are built, during processing each voucher i:\n\nWe check if x - d_i exists in duration_dict. If not, skip.\n\nElse, for the k = x - d_i group:\n\nCheck for case 1: vouchers in k group that end before li.\n\nTo do this, we take the sorted_by_end list for k. We perform a binary search to find the largest end time less than li. The index is found, and if it exists, the prefix_min at that index is the minimum cost for that case.\n\nSimilarly, check case 2: vouchers in k group that start after ri. For this, take the sorted_by_start list for k. Perform a binary search to find the first start time greater than ri. Then, the suffix_min at that index gives the minimum cost for that case.\n\nIf either case is possible, take the minimum of those two options (if both exist) and add to the current voucher's cost, then compare with the global minimum.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this correctly.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search in Python?\n\nFor case 1, sorted_by_end is a list of end times. Wait, no. Actually, the sorted_by_end list is a list of vouchers sorted by their end time. So for the binary search, perhaps we can extract the end times into a separate list for easier handling.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search, we can use the list of end times. For example, for the sorted_by_end list, we can have a list called ends = [voucher.ri for voucher in sorted_by_end].\n\nSo for case 1, given li, we can find the rightmost end time that is less than li. Using bisect_left on ends, which gives the insertion point. The index would be insertion_point - 1. If insertion_point is 0, then no such voucher exists. Otherwise, the prefix_min[insertion_point - 1] is the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, for the sorted_by_start list, we have a list starts = [voucher.li for voucher in sorted_by_start]. We need to find the first start time that is greater than ri. Using bisect_right on starts for ri, which gives the insertion point. All elements from that index onwards have start time > ri. Then, if the insertion point is less than len(starts), then we can take the suffix_min[insertion_point].\n\nSo, for each duration k, we need to have:\n\n- sorted_end_list: list of vouchers sorted by ri.\n\n- ends: list of their ri values.\n\n- prefix_min: list of min costs up to each index.\n\n- sorted_start_list: list of vouchers sorted by li.\n\n- starts: list of their li values.\n\n- suffix_min: list of min costs from each index to end.\n\nNow, how to build these for each duration.\n\nOnce all that is set up, the rest is manageable.\n\nNow, considering that for each voucher, we have to process two cases (case 1 and case 2), and for each case, possibly find a minimal cost. Then, for each voucher, we check both possibilities and take the minimum.\n\nBut what about overlapping vouchers? For example, if a voucher j is in the same duration group as voucher i, but they are not overlapping. But since the problem requires i and j to be different vouchers, but in our approach, when we process voucher i, we are looking for vouchers in the k group (which may include vouchers that are same as i? Well, only if x -d_i = d_i, and the voucher j is another voucher with same duration. But in that case, the code would check for vouchers in the same group, and the binary search would find other vouchers. However, when the voucher j is the same as voucher i, but that's allowed only if there are multiple vouchers with same duration and same start/end. But since we are looking for i != j, but in our approach, the code would find the minimal cost, which may include the same voucher. Wait, but the problem says that the two vouchers must be different. So how to avoid that?\n\nAh, this is a problem. For example, if a voucher has duration d, and x = 2d. Then, when processing voucher i, looking for vouchers in the same duration group. The code may find voucher i itself as a candidate. But that's invalid because i and j must be different vouchers.\n\nSo how to handle that?\n\nHmm. So during the processing of voucher i, when we check the k group (which may be same as d_i), we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis complicates things. Because for example, if there's only one voucher in the k group, which is the same as voucher i, then the code would consider it, but that's invalid. So we need to ensure that when we look for vouchers in the k group, we exclude the current voucher i if it's in that group.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's think: when we process voucher i, and the k group is the same as d_i, then during the case checks (case 1 and case 2), we need to check whether the voucher j is different from i.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nWell, for example, during the case 1 check, when we find the minimal cost in the k group that ends before li, but if that minimal cost comes from voucher i itself, then we can't use it. However, there could be other vouchers in the same group that also meet the condition.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. How to handle this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to allow the code to find the minimal cost, but then check if there's at least one voucher in the group that meets the condition and is not the current voucher.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nPerhaps, during the processing of voucher i, when we are checking the k group (same as d_i), we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i. But how?\n\nOne possible way is to pre-process for each duration group, and during the binary search steps, if the voucher that gives the minimal cost is the same as i, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in that group that also meet the condition.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, during the grouping, for each voucher, when building the sorted lists, we can store all vouchers, including duplicates. Then, during the processing of voucher i, when we find the minimal cost in the k group (which may include i), we need to check if there's another voucher that meets the condition. For example, if the minimal cost is achieved by voucher i itself, but there are other vouchers in the group that also meet the condition (i.e., end before li or start after ri), then we can take the next minimal cost. However, if the only voucher in the group that meets the condition is i itself, then we cannot use it.\n\nBut how to check this?\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we handle this?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose voucher i has duration d, and x=2d. So k=x-d =d. So when processing voucher i, we look for vouchers in the same duration group. Now, if there is another voucher j in the same group that does not overlap with i, then that's acceptable. But if the only voucher in the group is i itself, then no.\n\nBut how to check that during the processing.\n\nAnother approach: during the initial grouping, for each duration, we have all vouchers. When we process voucher i, and check for vouchers in the k group, we can check if the voucher j is not i. However, the problem is that during the binary search steps, the code may find the minimal cost voucher, which could be i itself. In that case, we need to ignore it and see if there's another voucher.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAn alternative idea: when we are building the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays, we can include all vouchers, but when checking for the case where the voucher j is the same as i, we can subtract that voucher from consideration. However, this seems difficult.\n\nBut maybe, given that the voucher i is part of the k group, when we find the minimal cost in the group, we can check if that minimal cost is from voucher i. If yes, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the group that meet the condition. If not, then we can't use this case.\n\nBut how to track which voucher gives the minimal cost in the prefix or suffix.\n\nThis seems complicated. However, given that the problem allows for multiple vouchers in the same group, perhaps the probability that the minimal cost is from voucher i is low, but in some cases, it's possible. For example, if there's only one voucher in the group (i itself), then it can't be used. But if there are multiple vouchers in the group, and the minimal cost is from i, but there are others, then we can still use the others.\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to pre-process for each duration group, and for each voucher, during the binary search steps, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if that voucher is i. If it is, then we can check if there's another voucher in the same group that meets the condition and has a cost that is not worse than the current one.\n\nBut this seems very complex and may not be feasible within the time constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered, but the code will automatically ignore it if it's the only one. Wait, but the code would find that voucher j is i, but since i and j must be different, that's invalid. So how to avoid that?\n\nThis seems like a critical edge case that needs to be handled.\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the code would incorrectly select the same voucher.\n\nSuppose n=2, x=2. Each voucher has duration 1. The vouchers are:\n\nVoucher 1: [1,1], cost 1.\n\nVoucher 2: [2,2], cost 2.\n\nThen, the correct answer is 1+2=3. But during processing voucher 1, looking for vouchers of duration 1 (x -1 =1). For case 1, vouchers in the group that end before 1 (voucher 1's li is 1). The end time of voucher 1 is 1, which is not less than li (1). So case 1 is not possible. For case 2: find vouchers that start after ri=1. Voucher 2 has li=2>1. So the minimal cost is 2. So total cost is 1+2=3. Similarly for voucher 2, it finds voucher 1. So the code would return 3, which is correct.\n\nBut what if there's only one voucher in the group. For example, n=1, but the problem says n is at least 2. So in the problem, n is >=2. So in the code, during the processing, for a voucher i, when looking for a voucher j in the same group, the group must have at least one other voucher.\n\nWait, no. Because the group could have multiple vouchers, but during the binary search steps, the minimal cost is found in the same voucher. For example, if there are two vouchers with same duration, but during the case check, the voucher j is the same as i. But how?\n\nLet me think of a scenario. Suppose there are two vouchers:\n\nVoucher A: li=1, ri=1 (duration 1), cost 5.\n\nVoucher B: li=1, ri=1 (duration 1), cost 3.\n\nx is 2. So each voucher has duration 1. So for voucher A, when looking for vouchers in the same group (duration 1), case 1: find vouchers ending before li (1). The end time of voucher A is 1, which is not less than li (1). So case 1 is not possible. Case 2: find vouchers starting after ri (1). Voucher B's li is 1, which is not greater than ri (1). So no. So voucher A cannot find any voucher in the group. But voucher B can also not find any. However, the two vouchers are overlapping. So the answer is -1. Which is correct.\n\nBut suppose voucher B has li=2, ri=2. Then, for voucher A, case 2 is to find vouchers in the same group (duration 1) that start after ri (1). The voucher B has li=2>1. So the code would find voucher B's cost (3), and the total cost would be 5+3=8. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if voucher B is the same as voucher A? Like, voucher A and voucher B are the same. Then, during the processing of voucher A, the code would find voucher B (same as A) in the group. But since they are different vouchers, it's allowed. So the code would return the correct answer.\n\nSo, the problem arises only when the group contains only voucher i. But since n >=2, but the group could have only one voucher. For example, if there are two vouchers, but one has duration d and the other has duration d. So the group has two vouchers. So during processing, when looking for vouchers in the same group, it's possible to find another voucher.\n\nBut how to ensure that during the case checks, the code doesn't select the same voucher.\n\nAh, here's the problem. Suppose voucher i is in the group, and during the case check, the minimal cost voucher in the group is i itself. But there's another voucher in the group that also meets the condition. Then, the code would take that other voucher. But how to know that.\n\nBut how can the code know that? Because the minimal cost could be from voucher i, but there are other vouchers in the group with the same cost. Or higher cost. But in that case, the code would have to find the minimal cost excluding voucher i.\n\nThis seems really complicated.\n\nAn alternative approach: during the preprocessing, for each duration group, we can have the sorted lists, but when we are checking for voucher i, we can exclude it from the group. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nBut that's impossible unless we have a way to dynamically exclude a particular voucher from the group.\n\nHmm. Perhaps this is a problem that can be ignored in practice. Let's think: when the code processes voucher i, and looks for vouchers in the k group (including possibly the same duration), but during the binary search steps, the minimal cost is found. However, if that minimal cost is from voucher i itself, then the code would have to check if there are other vouchers in the group that meet the condition. But how?\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. So perhaps, given the time constraints, we can proceed with the initial approach, and assume that the code will not select the same voucher. But this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher i, when the k group is the same as the duration of i, we can check if the voucher j found in the case 1 or case 2 is not i. However, how to track that?\n\nBut how can we know which voucher gives the minimal cost? For example, during the case 1 processing, the code finds the minimal cost in the prefix up to insertion_point -1. However, that minimal cost could come from any of the vouchers up to that index. But how to know if it's the same as voucher i?\n\nThis seems impossible unless we store more information in the prefix_min array, like the indices of the vouchers. But that would complicate things.\n\nAnother idea: when we process voucher i, during the case checks, we can check if the voucher j is in the same group (k group) and is not i. But how to do that?\n\nWait, for example, during case 1 processing, the code finds the minimal cost in the k group's sorted_end list. Suppose the minimal cost is m. Now, if there is at least one voucher in the group that ends before li and is not i, then m is valid. But how to know that?\n\nBut how to know if the voucher that gives the minimal cost is i itself?\n\nPerhaps, during the processing of voucher i, when the k group is the same as i's duration, we can check if the voucher i is in the group. Then, during the binary search steps, if the minimal cost is found in the group, but the voucher i is part of that group, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the group that meet the condition.\n\nBut again, how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can allow the code to consider the same voucher, and then after finding the minimal cost, check if there is at least one other voucher in the group that meets the condition. If not, then ignore this case.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nThis seems very complicated, and perhaps beyond the scope of a competitive programming problem. Maybe the test cases don't have such cases, or the code can pass despite this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows the same voucher to be considered as long as there are at least two vouchers in the group. But that's not the case. For example, if there are two vouchers in the group, and during the case check, the code selects the same voucher. But that's impossible because the code would have to find another voucher.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose voucher i is in the group, and there's another voucher j in the group. During the case check, the code finds voucher i as the minimal cost. But since j is also in the group and meets the condition, the code should take j's cost. But how to know that.\n\nBut the code is using the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays, which are built based on all vouchers in the group. So if there are other vouchers that meet the condition, then the minimal cost would be the minimum of all of them, including i and others. But if i is the only one that meets the condition, then it's invalid.\n\nBut how to know that i is the only one.\n\nThis seems very challenging. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial code, and then handle this edge case by checking if the voucher j is the same as i. However, how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers in the k group, we can check if the voucher j is in the group and not the same as i.\n\nBut how to do that during the binary search steps.\n\nAnother Idea: for each duration group, when building the sorted_end and sorted_start lists, we can include all vouchers. Then, during the case processing, after finding the minimal cost, we can check if there exists at least one voucher in the group that meets the condition and is not i.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nFor example, in case 1: vouchers in the k group that end before li. Suppose we found the minimal cost in this group. Now, if the voucher i is in the k group, and ends before li, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the group that also end before li. Because if there are, then the minimal cost can be achieved by another voucher. But if not, then the only voucher is i, which can't be used.\n\nBut how to check this.\n\nThis seems like a lot of work. However, perhaps for the purposes of passing the given examples and most test cases, we can proceed with the initial code and assume that the same voucher is not selected. Because, for example, in the case where the voucher i is the only one in the group that meets the condition, the code would select it, but since it's the same voucher, it's invalid and we should not consider it.\n\nBut how to detect this.\n\nAlternatively, during the case processing, after finding the minimal cost, we can check if there are any vouchers in the group that meet the condition and are not i. For example, in case 1, after finding the minimal cost, we can check if the number of vouchers in the group that end before li is at least 1. If yes, then proceed, else skip.\n\nBut how to find the count.\n\nBut this would require additional data structures, such as for each sorted_end list, having a count of vouchers up to each index.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search steps, after finding the insertion_point, if insertion_point is 0, then no vouchers. Else, the count is insertion_point. So if insertion_point >=1, then there are at least one voucher. But if the voucher i is in the group and ends before li, then it's possible that the count includes it, and thus we need to check if there are other vouchers.\n\nBut how to know if voucher i is among those counted.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach, and then in the code, when the k group is the same as the current voucher's duration, I'll check if there are at least two vouchers in the group. If not, then skip. But that's not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, I'll proceed with the initial approach and hope that the test cases don't have this edge case, or that the code passes even if it includes the same voucher.\n\nBut this is risky. However, given that the problem says that the two vouchers must be different, and that the code may include the same voucher, which would be invalid, the code may fail some test cases.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think of a test case where this would be a problem.\n\nTest case:\n\nn=2, x=2.\n\nvoucher 1: li=1, ri=1, cost=1 (duration 1).\n\nvoucher 2: li=2, ri=2, cost=1 (duration 1).\n\nSo x is 2. So each voucher has duration 1. So the sum is 2.\n\nThey don't overlap. So the answer should be 1+1=2.\n\nNow, during processing voucher 1:\n\nk = x - d_i = 2-1 =1. So check the group for duration 1.\n\nFor case 1: vouchers ending before li=1. The vouchers in the group are voucher 1 and voucher 2. Their end times are 1 and 2. So for voucher 1's li=1, the end times must be <1. There are none. So case 1 is invalid.\n\nFor case 2: vouchers starting after ri=1. The start times are 1 and 2. We want start time >1. So voucher 2 has start time 2>1. So the minimal cost is 1. So the total is 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSimilarly for voucher 2, the same applies. So the code would return 2.\n\nBut what if voucher 2 has the same start and end as voucher 1? Like:\n\nvoucher 1: li=1, ri=1, cost=1.\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, ri=1, cost=1.\n\nx=2.\n\nThe duration of each is 1. So the sum is 2. But the vouchers overlap (they are the same interval). So they are not allowed. Thus, the answer is -1.\n\nIn this case, during processing voucher 1, the case 2 would look for vouchers with start time > ri=1. The vouchers in the group have start time 1. So no such vouchers. Hence, no valid pairs. The code would return -1, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case where voucher i is in the group, and the code selects it, but there's another voucher:\n\nvoucher 1: li=1, ri=1, cost=5.\n\nvoucher 2: li=2, ri=2, cost=3.\n\nx=2.\n\nProcessing voucher 1: k=1.\n\ncase 1: end < li=1. None.\n\ncase 2: start > ri=1. voucher 2's start is 2>1. So minimal cost is 3. So total is 5+3=8. Correct.\n\nSo the code works here.\n\nAnother test case where voucher i is in the group, and during case 1, the minimal cost is from i itself, but there's another voucher.\n\nvoucher 1: li=1, ri=2 (duration 2), cost 5.\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, ri=2 (duration 2), cost 3.\n\nx=4. So duration of each is 2, x is 4. So sum is 4. Need to find two vouchers that don't overlap. But both have the same interval. So they overlap. So answer is -1.\n\nDuring processing voucher 1, k=4-2=2. So group is duration 2.\n\ncase 1: vouchers ending before li=1. vouchers have end time 2. So no.\n\ncase 2: vouchers starting after ri=2. vouchers have start time 1. No. So no valid.\n\nThus, code returns -1.\n\nBut if there's another voucher in the group that doesn't overlap.\n\nvoucher 3: li=3, ri=4, duration 2, cost 1.\n\nThen, for voucher 1, case 2: find vouchers starting after 2. voucher 3 starts at 3>2. So minimal cost is 1. Total is 5+1=6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the case where the same voucher is chosen is handled automatically because there are other vouchers in the group. Only when there is only one voucher in the group, but that is not possible because n >=2, but the group may have only one voucher if the other voucher has a different duration. But no, because for the current voucher's group, it's possible that there is only one voucher. For example, if n=2, and one voucher has duration 3, the other has duration 5. Then, for the voucher with duration 3, when x is 6, the k group would be 3. But if there is only one voucher in that group (the current voucher), then during the case checks, the code would try to find vouchers in the group, but there are none except itself. But since it's the same voucher, it's invalid. However, in this case, there is no other voucher in the group, so the code would not find any valid pairs.\n\nThus, the code would correctly return -1.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach may not have to worry about the case where the same voucher is selected, because in that case, there are no other vouchers in the group that meet the condition, and hence the code would not find any valid pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can proceed without worrying about this case.\n\nSo, moving forward with the code.\n\nNow, the steps for code:\n\nImplement the following:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nFor each voucher, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup vouchers into duration_dict, where each key is duration, and value is list of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration in duration_dict, prepare:\n\nsorted_by_end: list of vouchers sorted by ri.\n\nsorted_by_start: list of vouchers sorted by li.\n\nAlso, for sorted_by_end, create ends list and prefix_min array.\n\nFor sorted_by_start, create starts list and suffix_min array.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original list:\n\nd = duration of voucher.\n\nk = x -d.\n\nif k not in duration_dict: continue.\n\nelse:\n\nfor the k group:\n\ncase1: find vouchers in k group that end before li.\n\ncase2: find vouchers in k group that start after ri.\n\nfind the minimal cost for case1 and case2.\n\nif any of them exists",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers from a list such that their combined duration equals exactly x days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that can sum up to the required duration x.\n2. **Preprocess for Efficient Lookup**: For each duration group, we sort the vouchers by their end time and start time. We also create prefix minimum arrays for the sorted end times and suffix minimum arrays for the sorted start times. This allows us to quickly find the minimum cost of valid vouchers that meet the non-overlapping criteria.\n3. **Check Non-overlapping Vouchers**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher in the appropriate duration group (i.e., duration = x - current voucher's duration) that does not overlap with it. This involves checking two cases:\n   - Vouchers ending before the current voucher starts.\n   - Vouchers starting after the current voucher ends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    duration_dict = dict()\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost, duration))\n        if duration not in duration_dict:\n            duration_dict[duration] = []\n        duration_dict[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess each duration group\n    preprocessed = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # Sort by end time\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        # Compute prefix min\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_by_end:\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_cost)\n        # Sort by start time\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        # Compute suffix min\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_cost\n        preprocessed[d] = (sorted_by_end, ends, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, starts, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost, duration in vouchers:\n        k = x - duration\n        if k not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Get the preprocessed data for k\n        sorted_by_end, ends, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, starts, suffix_min = preprocessed[k]\n        \n        # Case 1: find vouchers in k group that end before li\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, li)\n        if pos > 0:\n            case1 = prefix_min[pos - 1]\n            min_total = min(min_total, case1 + cost)\n        \n        # Case 2: find vouchers in k group that start after ri\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(starts, ri)\n        if pos < len(starts):\n            case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n            min_total = min(min_total, case2 + cost)\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick lookups when checking for pairs that sum to x.\n- **Sorting and Prefix/Suffix Arrays**: Sorting vouchers by their end and start times allows efficient binary search operations.
