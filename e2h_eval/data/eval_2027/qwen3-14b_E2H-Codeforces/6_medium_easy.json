Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose durations add up to exactly x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nHmm. So first, each voucher has a duration of ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers where the sum of their durations is x. Also, they can't overlap. So for two vouchers i and j, either the first ends before the second starts (ri < lj) or the second ends before the first starts (rj < li).\n\nThe challenge is to find such pairs efficiently given the constraints on n (up to 2e5). A brute-force approach checking all pairs would be O(n²), which is definitely not feasible here. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that for each voucher, we can check if there's another voucher that can pair with it. For example, suppose a voucher has duration d. Then we need another voucher with duration x - d. And they must not overlap.\n\nSo maybe we can group vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we can have a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we look for vouchers with duration (x - d), and check if they are non-overlapping.\n\nBut even then, for each voucher, checking all vouchers of the required duration might be expensive. How can we optimize this?\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher, we can check for possible vouchers that come before it (ending before it starts) or after it (starting after it ends). But how to find the minimal cost ones?\n\nAnother idea: For each possible duration d, pre-process the vouchers with that duration. For example, for vouchers with duration d, we can keep track of their earliest end time and the minimal cost for that. Or maybe for each possible d, we can have two structures: one sorted by end time, and another sorted by start time. Wait, perhaps for each duration, we can have the vouchers sorted by their end time, and for a given voucher, we can find the minimal cost of vouchers with the complementary duration that end before the current voucher starts. Similarly, find the minimal cost of vouchers with complementary duration that start after the current voucher ends.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, store a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time (or start time?), and also keep track of the minimum cost up to each point.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have a voucher A with duration d, and we want to find a voucher B with duration x-d that ends before A's start. So for voucher A, we can look for all vouchers B with duration x-d, where B's end time is less than A's start time. Among those, we want the one with minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers B that start after A's end time. So for each voucher A, we can check both possibilities.\n\nTo do this efficiently, for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time (for checking vouchers that end before a certain time)\n- One sorted by start time (for checking vouchers that start after a certain time)\n\nBut maybe we can precompute for each duration, the minimal cost vouchers in certain ranges.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can have a list of vouchers sorted by their end time, and for each such list, we can have a prefix minimum array. So when looking for vouchers that end before a certain time (like A's start time), we can perform a binary search to find the latest voucher in that list that ends before the time, and then get the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers that start after a certain time (like A's end time), we can sort them by start time and use binary search to find the earliest start time that is after A's end time, and then find the minimal cost in that part.\n\nSo here's the detailed plan:\n\n1. Precompute for each duration d, a list of vouchers with that duration. For each such list, we can sort them by their end time, and create a prefix min array. Also, sort them by their start time and create a suffix min array? Or maybe for the start time, we can sort and have a prefix min array?\n\nWait, for example, if we need to find vouchers with duration d that start after a certain time (say, t). If we have a list sorted by start time, then we can binary search for the first voucher with start time > t. All vouchers from that index onwards have start time > t. Among those, we need the minimal cost.\n\nSo for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\na) Sorted by end time, and for each position in this list, we have the minimum cost from the beginning up to that position. This helps when looking for vouchers that end before a certain time (so we can binary search for the maximum end time <= t, and then take the min cost up to that index).\n\nb) Sorted by start time, and for each position in this list, we have the minimum cost from that position to the end. This helps when looking for vouchers that start after a certain time (binary search for the first start time > t, then take the min cost from that index onwards).\n\nAlternatively, for the start time sorted list, we can have a prefix min array, but that's not directly helpful. Wait, no. Suppose the list is sorted by start time. For any t, the vouchers that start after t are those in the sublist starting at the first index where start time > t. To find the minimal cost among those, we can have a suffix min array. So for the sorted list by start time, we can compute a suffix min array where suffix_min[i] = min(cost of vouchers from i to end).\n\nSimilarly, for the list sorted by end time, we can compute a prefix min array where prefix_min[i] = min of costs from 0 to i.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each duration d:\n\n- collect all vouchers with duration d.\n\n- sort them by end time, create a prefix min array (prefix_min_end).\n\n- sort them by start time, create a suffix min array (suffix_min_start).\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher A with duration d, we need to find vouchers B with duration x-d. So:\n\nCheck if x-d is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our preprocessed data). If not, skip.\n\nThen, for voucher A:\n\nCase 1: Find vouchers B with duration (x-d) that end before A's start time (i.e., B's end < A's start). For this, we look into the list of vouchers with duration (x-d), sorted by end time. We can binary search for the largest end time <= A's start - 1. Then, the minimal cost up to that index is the prefix_min_end value. If there are any such vouchers, we can take that min cost.\n\nCase 2: Find vouchers B with duration (x-d) that start after A's end time (i.e., B's start > A's end). For this, we look into the list of vouchers with duration (x-d), sorted by start time. Binary search for the first start time > A's end. Then, the suffix_min_start from that index gives the minimal cost in that part.\n\nWe can then take the minimal between case 1 and case 2 for each voucher A, and track the global minimum.\n\nBut since each voucher could be part of multiple pairs (as either A or B), we need to process all vouchers and check both possibilities.\n\nBut how to avoid processing the same pair twice? Well, since for each voucher A, we check for B's that are compatible, and the pair (A,B) and (B,A) would be considered once each. However, since we're looking for the minimal total cost, even if we check both, the minimal would still be found. But for efficiency, perhaps we can process each voucher once, and for each possible pairing, check both cases.\n\nBut let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, for each voucher, calculate its duration: duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nWe need to group vouchers by their duration. So, create a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\nFor each duration d in duration_dict, we need to process the two sorted lists:\n\nFor the end-sorted list:\n\nSort the vouchers by end time (ri). Then, create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from 0 to i (inclusive). So, for each i, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], current voucher's cost).\n\nFor the start-sorted list:\n\nSort the vouchers by start time (li). Then, create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end. So, for i from len(list)-1 downto 0, suffix_min[i] = min( current voucher's cost, suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher A in the original list, we can check for possible B's.\n\nBut wait, the original list of vouchers is not grouped by duration. So, perhaps we should loop through all vouchers, and for each voucher A, check if there's a duration (x - duration_A) in the duration_dict.\n\nSo, for each voucher A:\n\nd_A = ri - li + 1\n\ntarget_d = x - d_A\n\nif target_d is not in duration_dict, then skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for vouchers with duration target_d that end before A's start (li_A), and those that start after A's end (ri_A).\n\nSo, for the first part (vouchers ending before A's start):\n\nWe look into the list of vouchers with duration target_d, sorted by end time. We can binary search for the largest end time <= (A's li - 1). If such exists, then the minimal cost in that part is the prefix_min_end value at that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the second part (vouchers starting after A's end):\n\nWe look into the list of vouchers with duration target_d, sorted by start time. We binary search for the first start time > (A's ri). Then, the suffix_min_start from that index gives the minimal cost in that part.\n\nWe take the minimum between these two possibilities (if any), and add it to A's cost. Then, compare this to the global minimum.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as voucher A. Wait, but the problem says i != j. However, in our approach, when we process voucher A, and check for B's in the target_d group, which may include voucher A itself if target_d equals d_A and x is 2*d_A. But in that case, since the voucher A's duration is d_A, and target_d is x - d_A = d_A. So, if x is 2*d_A, then for voucher A, we check for vouchers with duration d_A. However, during the check, the voucher B can't be the same as A. How to handle this?\n\nWell, during the grouping, the vouchers are stored in the duration_dict. So, if voucher A is part of the target_d group (i.e., target_d is same as d_A), then when we check for B's in that group, we need to make sure that B is not the same voucher as A.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because when we process voucher A, and check for B's in the target_d group (which may include A itself), we need to exclude A from consideration. However, this complicates the matter, because during the binary search steps, the voucher A may be present in the list, and if it's the only one, we have to ignore it.\n\nThis seems tricky. How to handle this?\n\nAlternative approach: when building the duration_dict, for each duration, store all vouchers. Then, when checking for voucher A, and the target_d is same as d_A, then during the binary search steps, we need to check if the voucher B is different from A.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nWell, during the check for case 1 (vouchers ending before A's start), the list is sorted by end time. Suppose we find that there is a voucher B in the target_d group that ends before A's start. But if B is the same as A, then we can't take it. However, if there are other vouchers in the list, then the minimal cost would be taken from those. But if the only voucher in the list is A itself, then we can't take it.\n\nSo, this suggests that during the processing of voucher A, when the target_d is same as d_A, we need to ensure that the voucher B is not A.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nOne way is to process all vouchers, and for each voucher A, when considering the target_d group, we need to check whether the voucher B is different from A. But that would require, for each candidate B found in the target_d group, to verify that it's not A. However, that seems computationally expensive, as for each voucher A, we would have to check the possible B's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing steps, for each duration d, we can have two structures: one that includes all vouchers, and another that excludes the current voucher. But that's not feasible.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is rare enough that we can handle it by checking if the voucher B is the same as A. For example, during the case when target_d is same as d_A, and when the voucher A is in the list of vouchers for target_d, then during the binary search steps, the minimal cost may include voucher A itself. In that case, we have to check if the minimal cost comes from voucher A. If so, then we need to see if there are other vouchers in the list. If not, then we can't take that.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps, for the purposes of this problem, it's acceptable to allow the same voucher to be considered, but then subtract the case where it's the same voucher. However, that would complicate the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered as long as i != j. But if the voucher is processed once, and during the check, the code considers all possible vouchers in the target_d group except the current one. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the same voucher is considered, but during the processing of voucher A, the code will check for B's in the target_d group. For example, when voucher A is in the target_d group, then during the binary search steps, the code may find voucher A itself. But in that case, the code would have to check if the voucher B is the same as A. If yes, then skip it.\n\nBut how to do that? Because the binary search steps give us the minimal cost in the list, but not the actual voucher. So, perhaps we need to find the minimal cost excluding voucher A.\n\nThis seems difficult. So, perhaps the approach is to process all vouchers, and for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher in the target_d group that meets the criteria. However, during the binary search steps, if the voucher A is part of the target_d group, then the code may include it. But when the code finds that the minimal cost is from voucher A, then we have to check if there's another voucher in the list with the same minimal cost, or else ignore it.\n\nBut this seems very complex and may not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows that the same voucher is considered, but in reality, since we are processing all vouchers, the same pair (A, B) will be considered twice: once when processing A and looking for B, and once when processing B and looking for A. However, in this case, when we process A and B, the code would check for the same pair, but the minimal cost would be considered once. However, the code would generate the same pair twice, but when taking the overall minimum, it would not affect the result. However, in the case where the same voucher is considered as both A and B, like when x=2d and the voucher is the only one in the group, then the code would try to pair it with itself, which is invalid. But how to avoid that?\n\nThis suggests that during the processing of voucher A, when the target_d is same as d_A, and the code checks for B in the same group, it's possible that the code finds voucher A itself. Therefore, during the binary search steps, we need to ensure that the voucher B is not the same as A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nMaybe the solution is to pre-process all vouchers for each duration, and when checking for voucher B in the target_d group, we can check if the voucher B is the same as A. However, this would require that for each voucher in the list, we can compare it with A. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher A, when checking for B's in the target_d group, we can first check if the target_d is same as d_A. If so, then during the binary search steps, we need to make sure that the voucher B is not A. But how?\n\nPerhaps, during the binary search steps, we can find the minimal cost, and then check if that minimal cost is achieved by a voucher different from A. For example, if the minimal cost in the target_d group is the same as A's cost, then we need to check if there's another voucher in the group with the same cost. Otherwise, we can't take that voucher.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think about an example. Suppose there's only one voucher in the target_d group, which is A itself. Then, when processing A, the code would try to pair it with itself, which is invalid. Therefore, the code must not consider that case.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nAn alternative approach: during the preprocessing steps, for each duration, store all the vouchers. Then, for each voucher A, when checking for B's in the target_d group, we can check if there are any vouchers in that group except for A. If there are, then proceed with the binary search steps. However, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the binary search steps, we can check for the presence of vouchers that are not A. But again, how?\n\nMaybe the problem is rare enough that we can proceed with the initial approach, and then during the processing, when the code finds that the minimal cost is from the same voucher, we can check if there are other vouchers in the group. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process all vouchers, and for each voucher, when checking the target_d group, we can allow the same voucher to be considered, but then subtract the case where i == j. However, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows that even if the same voucher is considered, but the code would not select it. For example, when the code looks for vouchers that end before A's start. If the voucher is A itself, then its end time is ri_A. Which is >= li_A (since li <= ri). So, for the case where we are looking for vouchers that end before A's start (li_A), the voucher A's end time is ri_A, which is >= li_A. So, voucher A cannot be part of the case 1 (end before A's start). Similarly, for case 2, voucher A's start time is li_A. So, if we are looking for vouchers that start after A's end time (ri_A), then voucher A's start time is li_A, which is <= ri_A. So, voucher A cannot be part of case 2. Therefore, during the processing of voucher A, when checking for vouchers in the same target_d group, the voucher A itself cannot be considered in either case 1 or 2. Therefore, even if the target_d is same as d_A, the code can proceed without worrying about the same voucher being selected. Because voucher A cannot be in the case 1 or case 2.\n\nWait, this is a crucial observation!\n\nBecause case 1 requires that B's end < A's start (li_A). But for voucher A, its own end is ri_A. Since li_A <= ri_A (as per the input constraints), then ri_A >= li_A. So, B can't be voucher A in case 1.\n\nSimilarly, case 2 requires that B's start > A's end (ri_A). Voucher A's start is li_A, which is <= ri_A. So B can't be voucher A in case 2.\n\nTherefore, when processing voucher A, even if the target_d is same as d_A, the code can safely check the target_d group for B's, because voucher A itself cannot be in the case 1 or case 2. Therefore, there's no need to worry about i == j. Because when we process voucher A, the code will look for B's in the target_d group that are either before A or after A, but voucher A itself cannot be in those groups. Hence, the code can proceed without checking for i != j.\n\nThat's a relief! So this solves the problem of same voucher being considered. Because when you process voucher A, the code looks for B's that are either before or after A. So, even if the target_d group contains voucher A, it's not included in the B candidates. Therefore, the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo now, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, we need to group vouchers by their duration.\n\nIn Python, perhaps using a defaultdict to map durations to lists of vouchers.\n\nThen, for each duration d, we need to sort the vouchers in two ways:\n\n- sorted by end time (ri), and create a prefix min array.\n\n- sorted by start time (li), and create a suffix min array.\n\nLet's think about the data structures.\n\nFor example, for a duration d, the list of vouchers is vouchers_d. For the end-sorted list, we can sort vouchers_d by their ri, and then compute the prefix_min array. Similarly, for the start-sorted list, we sort vouchers_d by their li, and compute the suffix_min array.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher A with duration d_A, we can compute target_d = x - d_A. If target_d is not in the duration_dict, skip. Else, for the vouchers in target_d group, check both cases.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing the binary searches.\n\nFor case 1: find all vouchers in the target_d group that end before A's li. So, the end time of B is <= A's li - 1. Because ri_B < li_A.\n\nSo, in the end-sorted list (sorted by ri), we can binary search for the largest ri that is <= (li_A - 1). If such exists, then the minimal cost in the prefix up to that index is available.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: find all vouchers in the target_d group that start after A's ri. So, li_B > ri_A. In the start-sorted list (sorted by li), find the first li that is > ri_A. All vouchers from that index onwards have li_B > ri_A. The minimal cost in that range is the suffix_min array at that index.\n\nNow, how to perform these binary searches.\n\nFor case 1, the end-sorted list is sorted in non-decreasing order of ri. We can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of (li_A - 1), then the index is insertion_point - 1. If insertion_point is 0, then there are no such vouchers.\n\nFor example, if the end_sorted list is [1,3,5], and we're looking for values <= 4. The bisect_right returns 2 (since 4 would be inserted after 3 and before 5). So the index is 1, which is the last element <= 4.\n\nOnce we have the index, if it is >=0, then we can get the prefix_min_end[index].\n\nFor case 2, the start-sorted list is sorted in non-decreasing order of li. We need to find the first li that is > ri_A. Using bisect_right for ri_A. The insertion point gives the first index where li > ri_A. All elements from that index onwards are candidates. If the insertion point is equal to the length of the list, then there are no such vouchers. Otherwise, the suffix_min_start[insertion_point] gives the minimal cost in that range.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing the grouping and preprocessing.\n\nIn Python:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = r - l + 1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\nfor l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n    duration_dict[dur].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n# Now preprocess each duration's data\n# For each duration d, we have two sorted lists and their min arrays\npreprocessed = dict()\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    lst = duration_dict[d]\n    # Sort by end time (r), and compute prefix_min_end\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    prefix_min_end = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for l, r, cost in sorted_by_end:\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost)\n        prefix_min_end.append(min_so_far)\n    # Sort by start time (l), and compute suffix_min_start\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n        suffix_min_start[i] = min_so_far\n    preprocessed[d] = (sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start)\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list, check for possible pairs.\n\nInitialize the answer to infinity.\n\nans = infinity\n\nfor l_a, r_a, cost_a, dur_a in vouchers:\n    target_d = x - dur_a\n    if target_d not in preprocessed:\n        continue\n    # Get the preprocessed data for target_d\n    sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[target_d]\n    # Case 1: find vouchers in target_d that end before l_a\n    # sorted_by_end is sorted by r (end time)\n    # find the largest r <= l_a - 1\n    # using bisect_right on the end times\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, l_a - 1)\n    if idx > 0:\n        min_cost_case1 = prefix_min_end[idx-1]\n        total = cost_a + min_cost_case1\n        ans = min(ans, total)\n    # Case 2: find vouchers in target_d that start after r_a\n    # sorted_by_start is sorted by l (start time)\n    # find the first l > r_a\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(start_times, r_a)\n    if idx < len(start_times):\n        min_cost_case2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n        total = cost_a + min_cost_case2\n        ans = min(ans, total)\n\nAfter processing all vouchers, if ans is still infinity, output -1 else ans.\n\nWait, but in the preprocessed data for target_d, the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start are stored. However, in the code above, for each target_d, we have to generate the end_times and start_times lists. But for large n, this could be time-consuming. Alternatively, during preprocessing, we can store the sorted lists and their keys.\n\nBut in the code above, for each target_d, during the processing of the voucher, we need to extract the end_times and start_times. However, for each sorted_by_end, we can have a list of the end times. But in the code above, during preprocessing, we can store these lists.\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing step, for each duration d, we can store the sorted_by_end list and the sorted_by_start list. Then, during the binary search steps, we can use the sorted lists to extract the necessary values.\n\nBut for bisect, we need a list of the end times. So, perhaps during preprocessing, we can also store for each duration d, the list of end times (sorted) and start times (sorted). However, that would take more memory, but for the problem constraints, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search steps, we can generate the list on the fly. For example, for sorted_by_end, which is a list of tuples (l, r, cost), sorted by r. So the end times are [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]. Similarly for the start times.\n\nBut generating this list each time may be expensive. However, given that for each voucher, this is done once, and the number of vouchers is O(n), and for each target_d, the size of the list is O(k), where k is the number of vouchers with that duration. The total time for all these steps would be O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nBut in practice, for each target_d, during the processing of a voucher, we have to generate the end_times and start_times lists. However, for large n, this could be slow. So perhaps during preprocessing, we can store these lists.\n\nLet me adjust the preprocessing step:\n\npreprocessed = dict()\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    lst = duration_dict[d]\n    # Sort by end time (r), and compute prefix_min_end\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n    prefix_min_end = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for l, r, cost in sorted_by_end:\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost)\n        prefix_min_end.append(min_so_far)\n    # Sort by start time (l), and compute suffix_min_start\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n        suffix_min_start[i] = min_so_far\n    preprocessed[d] = (sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min_start)\n\nThen, during processing of each voucher:\n\nfor l_a, r_a, cost_a, dur_a in vouchers:\n    target_d = x - dur_a\n    if target_d not in preprocessed:\n        continue\n    # Get the preprocessed data for target_d\n    sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[target_d]\n    # Case 1: find vouchers in target_d that end before l_a\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, l_a - 1)\n    if idx > 0:\n        min_cost_case1 = prefix_min_end[idx-1]\n        total = cost_a + min_cost_case1\n        ans = min(ans, total)\n    # Case 2: find vouchers in target_d that start after r_a\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(start_times, r_a)\n    if idx < len(start_times):\n        min_cost_case2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n        total = cost_a + min_cost_case2\n        ans = min(ans, total)\n\nThis seems better.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo, the vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 0: l=1, r=3, cost=4, duration 3\n\nvoucher 1: l=1, r=2, cost=5, duration 2\n\nvoucher 2: l=5, r=6, cost=1, duration 2\n\nvoucher 3: l=1, r=2, cost=4, duration 2\n\nx is 5.\n\nSo, for each voucher:\n\nFor voucher 0, duration is 3. target_d is 5-3=2. Check if 2 exists in preprocessed.\n\nYes. The preprocessed data for duration 2 includes vouchers 1, 2, 3.\n\nsorted_by_end for duration 2:\n\nthe vouchers are:\n\nvoucher1: l=1, r=2 → end 2\n\nvoucher3: l=1, r=2 → end 2\n\nvoucher2: l=5, r=6 → end 6.\n\nsorted by end time: [ (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1) ] ?\n\nWait, no. The vouchers for duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher1: (1, 2, 5)\n\nvoucher3: (1, 2, 4)\n\nvoucher2: (5,6,1) → duration is 2 (6-5+1=2).\n\nSo sorted by end time (r), which is 2, 2, 6. So sorted_by_end would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? Or sorted by r, which for the first two is same. So the order depends on the sort. However, the prefix_min_end would be:\n\nfor the first element, min is 5.\n\nsecond element: min(5,4)=4.\n\nthird element: min(4, 1) = 1.\n\nSo prefix_min_end is [5,4,1].\n\nend_times for this group is [2, 2, 6].\n\nSo, for voucher0, l_a is 1, r_a is 3. So case 1: looking for vouchers in duration 2 with end time <= l_a -1 = 0. But the end_times are 2, 2, 6. So bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) → returns 0. idx is 0, which is not >0. So case 1 is not possible.\n\nCase 2: looking for vouchers in duration 2 with start time > r_a (3). The start_times for duration 2 sorted_by_start is sorted by l. The vouchers are:\n\nvoucher1: l=1, voucher3: l=1, voucher2: l=5. So sorted_by_start is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. start_times is [1,1,5].\n\nbisect_right(start_times, 3) → looking for first element >3. The start_times are [1,1,5]. The value 3 is inserted between 1 and 5. bisect_right returns 2. idx is 2. which is less than len(start_times) (3). So suffix_min_start[2] is 1. So total cost is 4 + 1 = 5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo this case is handled.\n\nAnother example: voucher2 (duration 2). target_d is 5-2=3. Check if duration 3 exists. Yes, voucher0.\n\nsorted_by_end for duration 3 is [(1,3,4)], end_times [3]. prefix_min_end [4].\n\ncase 1: looking for vouchers in duration 3 with end <= l_a -1. voucher2's l is 5. l_a -1 is 4. end_times is [3]. bisect_right([3],4) → returns 1. idx is 1>0. So prefix_min_end[0] is 4. total cost is 1 (voucher2's cost) + 4 = 5. Which is the same as before.\n\ncase 2: looking for vouchers in duration 3 with start time > r_a (6). voucher0's start is 1. So start_times is [1]. bisect_right([1], 6) → returns 1. which is equal to len(start_times) (1). So no case 2.\n\nThus, this pair is considered.\n\nSo the code would find the correct answer.\n\nNow, let's think about the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 → duration 3 (6-4+1=3)\n\n2 4 1 → duration 3 (4-2+1=3)\n\n3 5 4 → duration 3 (5-3+1=3)\n\nx is 2. So for each voucher, target_d is 2 - 3 = -1. Which is not present. Hence, no pairs. Output is -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: x is 0. But according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. So no.\n\nEdge case 2: two vouchers with durations adding to x, but overlapping. For example, voucher1 (1-2, duration 2), voucher2 (2-3, duration 2), x=4. They overlap. So the code would not select them.\n\nAnother case: two vouchers with durations adding to x, and non-overlapping. For example, voucher1 (1-2, duration 2), voucher2 (3-4, duration 2). x=4. The code would find them.\n\nAnother case: multiple vouchers in the same duration group. The code should find the minimal cost.\n\nNow, what about the preprocessing steps?\n\nFor example, for vouchers with same duration, the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start are properly generated.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut we need to be careful",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently searching for pairs of vouchers that meet the required total duration.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers into two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end time of the voucher, along with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - Another sorted by the start time of the voucher, along with a suffix minimum cost array.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (such that their durations sum up to the given value). Using binary search, we efficiently determine if there are valid non-overlapping vouchers that can be paired with the current voucher.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost, duration))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[dur].append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    preprocessed = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        lst = duration_dict[d]\n        # Sort by end time and compute prefix min end\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for l_val, r_val, cost_val in sorted_by_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost_val)\n            prefix_min_end.append(min_so_far)\n        # Sort by start time and compute suffix min start\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        suffix_min_start = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min_start[i] = min_so_far\n        preprocessed[d] = (sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min_start)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for l_a, r_a, cost_a, dur_a in vouchers:\n        target_d = x - dur_a\n        if target_d not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[target_d]\n        # Case 1: end before l_a\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, l_a - 1)\n        if idx > 0:\n            min_cost_case1 = prefix_min_end[idx-1]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost_a + min_cost_case1)\n        # Case 2: start after r_a\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(start_times, r_a)\n        if idx < len(start_times):\n            min_cost_case2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost_a + min_cost_case2)\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each represented by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end time and start time. Prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays are computed to quickly determine the minimum cost of valid vouchers during binary search operations.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we use binary search to find valid non-overlapping vouchers with the complementary duration. This ensures efficient lookup and minimizes the total cost while checking all possible valid pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum cost pair of non-overlapping vouchers meeting the duration requirement, leveraging sorting and binary search for optimal performance.",
