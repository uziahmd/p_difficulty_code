    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. We need to find the number of different arrays of N sets, each containing integers from 1 to K, such that there's a rearrangement of the array where each set is a child of the next one. \n\nFirst, let's clarify what a child set is. A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1,2}, then B must have 2 and 3. Wait, no. For each x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So for each x in A, B must contain x+1. So if A has 1, B must have 2. If A has 2, B must have 3. So B must contain all x+1 for elements in A.\n\nNow, the problem says that there exists a rearrangement of the array of sets such that S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1} for each consecutive pair. So we can arrange the sets in some order where each is a child of the next.\n\nThe challenge is to count all possible arrays of N sets that satisfy this condition.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the constraints. Each set can be any subset of {1..K}, but when arranged in some order, each must be a child of the next.\n\nBut how do we model this? Since the order can be rearranged, perhaps there's some way to model dependencies between the sets. But since the order can be arbitrary, maybe we can model the sets in a way that allows them to be ordered in a chain where each is a child of the next.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to find for each set S, what are the possible sets that can come after it in the chain. But with N sets, how do we model this?\n\nBut considering that the problem requires that there exists some permutation of the array where each set is a child of the next. So the array of sets must form a sequence that can be ordered in such a way. So the problem reduces to finding all arrays of N sets where the sets can be ordered in a sequence S_1', S_2', ..., S_N' such that S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}'.\n\nWait, but the array itself is [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N], and we can permute the order. So the actual order of the array doesn't matter as long as there's a permutation that satisfies the child condition.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to: the array of sets must form a collection of N sets such that there exists a permutation where each set is a child of the next. So the question is to count all such arrays.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think about the properties of the sets. Let's consider the possible sets and their relationships.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the sets. For a set to be a child of another, it must have elements that are all one less than elements in the parent set. For example, if a set S has elements {x}, then the parent set must have x+1. So for the parent set, it's allowed to have other elements as well. So the parent set can have any elements as long as they include x+1 for each x in the child.\n\nThis suggests that the sets can be ordered in some way based on their elements. For example, a set that contains higher numbers can be a parent of a set with lower numbers. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the sets in terms of their maximum element. Suppose a set S has maximum element m. Then, for S to be a child of another set T, T must contain m+1. Because the maximum element of S is m, so there must be an element m in S, which requires that T contains m+1. However, T may have other elements as well. Therefore, the maximum element of T must be at least m+1. So, if we have a sequence of sets S_1', S_2', ..., S_N', then the maximum element of S_i' must be less than the maximum element of S_{i+1}'.\n\nWait, no. Suppose S is a child of T. Then, for every x in S, T must have x+1. So the maximum element of S is m. Then T must have m+1. Therefore, the maximum element of T is at least m+1. So the maximum elements of the sets in the chain must be strictly increasing. Therefore, the maximum elements of the sets in the permutation must be strictly increasing.\n\nBut wait, if S has maximum m, and T has maximum m+1, then S can be a child of T. However, T could have a maximum higher than m+1. But in any case, the maximum of T is greater than",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of different arrays of sets such that there exists a permutation where each set is a child of the next one. The key insight is to model the sets based on their maximum elements and use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Child Sets**: A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there exists an element x+1 in B. This implies that if a set has a maximum element m, the set it can be a child of must have a maximum element at least m+1.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to form sequences of length i with the maximum element j. This helps us build up the solution incrementally.\n\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each length `i` and maximum element `j`, we consider all possible previous maximum elements `k` such that `k < j`. This ensures that the sequence of sets can be ordered such that each set is a child of the next.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation Using Prefix Sums**: To optimize the transitions, we use prefix sums to quickly compute the sum of valid previous states, reducing the time complexity from O(N*K^2) to O(N*K).\n\n5. **Final Result Calculation**: The result for given N and K is derived by summing up all valid sequences of length N with maximum elements ranging from 1 to K.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    N = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    K = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # dp[i][j]: number of ways to have a sequence of i sets with max element j\n    # We can use two 1D arrays to save space\n    # Initialize dp_prev as for i=1\n    dp_prev = [0] * (K + 2)\n    for j in range(1, K + 1):\n        dp_prev[j] = 1  # Each single set can be considered as a sequence of length 1\n    \n    for i in range(2, N + 1):\n        dp_curr = [0] * (K + 2)\n        # Compute prefix sums of dp_prev\n        prefix = [0] * (K + 2)\n        for j in range(1, K + 1):\n            prefix[j] = (prefix[j - 1] + dp_prev[j]) % MOD\n        \n        for j in range(1, K + 1):\n            # The number of ways to choose the previous max element less than j\n            # which is prefix[j-1]\n            dp_curr[j] = prefix[j - 1] * pow(2, (j - 1) * (j - 2) // 2, MOD) % MOD\n            # Wait, no.

So for the transition, we need to know how many sets have max exactly j.\n            # But in our dp_prev, dp_prev[k] counts the number of sequences of length i-1 with max k.

Then, for each such sequence, the previous set in the permutation must have a max less than j.
