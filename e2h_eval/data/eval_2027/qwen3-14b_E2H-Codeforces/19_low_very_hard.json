The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So the problem reduces to selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes that maximizes the sum of 2^i for those nodes. Then, the districts not in this subtree are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how do I find this subtree? Since the sum is based on 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, it's better to keep higher-numbered districts. But we have to ensure that the subtree is connected.\n\nWait, but the problem is that even if we want to keep higher-numbered districts, they might not be connected. So perhaps the approach is to select a subtree that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring connectivity.\n\nSo maybe the optimal strategy is to keep the largest possible nodes, but in a way that they form a connected subtree. However, since the tree is connected, perhaps the best approach is to find a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, possibly starting from the highest node and greedily adding the next highest nodes that are connected.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as choosing which nodes to remove. The sum of the fans is maximized when we remove the nodes with the smallest values of 2^i. But since the remaining nodes must be connected, we can't just remove the k smallest districts. Because if those districts are spread out, removing them would disconnect the tree.\n\nSo the challenge is to find the set of k districts to remove such that the remaining districts are connected and the sum of 2^i for the remaining is maximum.\n\nAnother thought: The sum is maximized when we keep the districts with the largest possible 2^i values. So the problem is equivalent to selecting (n - k) districts that form a connected subtree, and have the maximum sum of 2^i. Since 2^i increases with i, the optimal solution would be to include as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nSo the question becomes: find the connected subtree of size (n - k) that contains the largest possible numbers. How to do that?\n\nLet me think of the tree structure. Suppose we want to select a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. For example, the highest node is n. Then, we need to include it and some of its neighbors. But maybe the optimal subtree is rooted at the highest node, and includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can perform a priority-based approach. Let's think of it as a problem where we want to select the nodes with the highest possible values, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where you have to select a subset of nodes with maximum sum, under the constraint that they form a connected subtree. The way to approach this is to use a priority queue (max heap) and greedily add nodes, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: since the value of each node is 2^i, which is exponentially larger than lower-numbered nodes, the optimal subtree must contain the node with the highest number (n), unless forced otherwise. Because if we exclude n, then we can include other nodes, but the sum would be smaller than including n. So the optimal subtree must include the node n. Then, we can proceed recursively.\n\nBut how to ensure connectivity? Let's think of building the subtree starting from the highest-numbered node. Then, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, connected to the existing subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to perform a greedy algorithm where we start with the highest-numbered node, and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. However, this might not work because adding a high node may require adding lower nodes that are in the path.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the following: we need to choose (n -k) nodes that form a connected subtree. Since the sum is maximized by including the highest possible nodes, the optimal subtree will be the one that includes the highest possible nodes, possibly starting from the highest node and then including the next highest nodes that are connected to it.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree?\n\nAnother approach: The problem is equivalent to finding the subtree of size m = n - k, which has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the maximum sum is achieved by including the m largest possible nodes. However, these nodes must form a connected subtree.\n\nBut the problem is that the m largest nodes might not be connected. For example, if the tree is a chain 1-2-3-4-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts' contestants should be removed such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is that the value of each district's fans increases exponentially with the district number, so we should prioritize keeping the highest-numbered districts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: Since the fan count for a district `i` is `2^i`, higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more to the total fan count. Thus, we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n3. **Subtree Selection**: We start from the highest-numbered district and build a connected subtree by including the highest possible districts while ensuring connectivity. This is done using a priority queue (max-heap) to always consider the next highest-numbered districts that can be connected to the current subtree.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    m = n - k\n    if m == 0:\n        print()\n        return\n    \n    # Start from the highest node\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n    # Use a max heap, but Python has min heap, so store negatives\n    # Start with node n\n    visited[n] = True\n    count = 1\n    # Push all neighbors of n into the heap\n    for neighbor in edges[n]:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    while count < m:\n        if not heap:\n            break\n        neg_node, node = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if visited[node]:\n            continue\n        visited[node] = True\n        count += 1\n        # Push its neighbors\n        for neighbor in edges[node]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    # Collect the nodes not visited\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts `n` and the number of contestants to remove `k`.\n2. **Tree Construction**: The tree is represented using an adjacency list.\n3. **Greedy Subtree Construction**: Starting from the highest-numbered district `n`, we use a max-heap (implemented as a min-heap with negative values) to explore the highest-numbered districts first. This ensures we always add the highest possible districts that can be connected to the current subtree.\n4. **Result Collection**: After constructing the subtree of size `m = n - k`, the districts not included in this subtree are collected and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the remaining districts form a connected subtree with the maximum possible sum of fans, leveraging the exponential growth of the fan counts with district numbers.",
