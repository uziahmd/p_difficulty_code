The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every two districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nSo the key here is to select which districts to keep such that they form a connected subtree, and the sum of their 2^i is as large as possible. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the districts with higher i values, but we have to ensure connectivity.\n\nWait, but the problem is that removing k districts means keeping n - k districts. So we need to choose a connected subtree of size (n - k) that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i. Then, the districts not in this subtree are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how do we find this subtree?\n\nSince 2^i increases exponentially with i, the optimal strategy would be to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. However, they must form a connected subtree. So perhaps we can think of this as selecting a subtree that includes the highest possible districts, and then trimming down to the required size.\n\nLet me think. For example, in the first sample input, n=6, k=3. So we need to keep 3 districts. The maximum sum would be 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. Which is achieved by keeping districts 2,5,6. But how do we get there?\n\nThe idea is that the highest districts are 6,5,4,3,2,1. So we want to include as many high-numbered districts as possible. But they need to be connected. So perhaps we can start with the highest node and greedily include as many high nodes as possible, ensuring connectivity.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the problem differently. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible nodes, the optimal set would be a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes, and the rest are pruned. So maybe we can perform a priority-based selection where we start with the largest node and then add the next largest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to select a subtree of size (n - k) that has the maximum sum. Since the sum depends on the nodes, and each node's value is 2^i, which is very large for higher i, we need to prioritize keeping higher-numbered nodes.\n\nThis sounds similar to a problem where we need to find a subtree of certain size with maximum sum. How can we approach that?\n\nOne approach is to consider that the optimal subtree will include the node with the highest number, and then include as many of the next highest nodes as possible, ensuring connectivity.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe using a priority queue approach where we start from the highest node, then add its neighbors, but in a way that ensures we can collect as many high nodes as possible.\n\nAnother thought: since the tree is connected, and we need to choose a connected subtree of size m = n -k. The problem reduces to selecting m nodes that are connected and maximize the sum of their 2^i. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the optimal solution will include the largest possible nodes. However, the challenge is to find the largest m nodes that are connected.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to select the largest m nodes, and check if they form a connected subtree. If they do, then that's our answer. If not, we need to remove some lower nodes and include others to maintain connectivity.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nFor example, if the largest m nodes are not connected, we need to find a way to connect them by including some lower nodes. But that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to find the minimal number of nodes to remove (from the higher ones) to make the remaining nodes connected.\n\nBut this seems complex. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since the nodes are numbered from 1 to n, and their values are 2^i, which is exponentially increasing. So the highest node (n) is the most valuable. So we need to include it. Then, the next highest nodes, but ensuring that they are connected to the subtree.\n\nSo maybe the solution is to perform a greedy algorithm where we start with the highest node, and then iteratively add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. But how to manage that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to select the nodes in such a way that the subtree includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps we can use a",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected subtree with the maximum possible total number of fans. The districts are numbered from 1 to n, and each district i has 2^i fans. The goal is to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the sum of their fans.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree structure, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since the number of fans for district i is 2^i, higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans. Therefore, we should prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connected Subtree**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected subtree. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and iteratively adding the next highest-numbered districts that maintain connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    tree = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n    \n    m = n - k\n    \n    # We need to select m nodes with the highest possible values, ensuring they form a connected subtree.\n    # Start with the highest node, then use BFS/DFS to collect as many high nodes as possible.\n    \n    # First, find the highest node (n)\n    # Use a priority queue (max heap) to select the next nodes to include\n    # But we need to manage the subtree connectivity.\n    \n    # We can use a reverse approach: start from the highest node, and for each node, keep track of the ones we have included.\n    # Use a priority queue to process nodes in decreasing order of their value, but only add them if they are connected to the current subtree.\n    \n    # Let's build a max heap of all nodes, but we will process them in order and check if they can be added to the subtree.\n    \n    # However, since the tree is undirected, we need to track visited nodes and ensure that we build the subtree correctly.\n    \n    # Alternative approach:\n    # We can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the highest node, and greedily include the highest possible nodes.\n    # But since the order of processing matters, perhaps we can use a priority queue to always pick the next highest node that is adjacent to the current subtree.\n    \n    # To do this:\n    # 1.

This ensures that the subtree remains connected.\n4. **Result Collection**: After selecting the required number of nodes (m = n - k), the remaining nodes (not included in the subtree) are collected, sorted, and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by prioritizing higher-numbered districts while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining districts.",
