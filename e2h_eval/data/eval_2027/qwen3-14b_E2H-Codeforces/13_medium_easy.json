For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone? Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Wait, the problem says that the distance between consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone? Or maybe that's a mistake. Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone.\" Oh right, so each semitone is 0.5 tones. So the distance between consecutive notes is 1 semitone, which equals 0.5 tones. Wait, but maybe the problem uses \"semitone\" as a unit. For example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. Then between C and D is 2 semitones. So when they say the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, that's 4 steps of semitone. So perhaps the problem is using semitone as a unit, but the wording says that between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. But maybe that's just a way of saying that each step is a semitone. Maybe the actual calculation is done in semitones, not in tones. Because for example, the example says that between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check that. Let's list the notes:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then back to C.\n\nSo from C to E: let's count the steps. C to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3, D# to E is 4. So yes, that's 4 semitones. So the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Similarly, between E and G: E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, F# to G is 3. So 3 semitones. So the example of C E G is major because X-Y is 4, Y-Z is 3.\n\nSo the problem is about checking the distances between the notes in semitones. So the key is to compute the number of semitones between two notes, considering the cyclic order.\n\nSo the first step is to represent each note as a numerical value, so that we can compute the distances between them.\n\nLet me think. Let's assign each note an index. For example:\n\nC is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Then, since the notes are cyclic, the distance from note A to note B is (B - A) mod 12, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper note. So if you have two notes, the distance is the number of semitones you need to go upwards from the lower note to reach the upper note. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones (since going up from E to C would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps).\n\nSo for two notes, the distance is (target - source) mod 12, but if the result is negative, then add 12. Wait, no. Let's think: if you have two notes, X and Y. The distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X. Otherwise, it's (12 - X + Y). For example, X is E (4), Y is C (0). Then the distance is (0 -4) mod 12? Well, (0-4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) % 12. But wait, if Y is higher than X, then Y - X is positive. If Y is lower, then Y - X is negative, and mod 12 gives the correct positive value. So for example, X is C (0), Y is E (4): 4-0 = 4 mod 12 is 4. Correct. For X is E (4), Y is C (0): (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nBut how to compute this? So for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) % 12. But wait, no. Because if X is C (0) and Y is H (11), then the distance is 11 semitones. Which is (11 - 0) mod 12 = 11. Correct. If X is H (11) and Y is C (0), then (0 - 11) mod 12 is 1, but the actual distance is 1 semitone (H to C is one semitone). Wait, no! Wait, H is the same as B. So the next note after H is C. So the distance from H to C is 1 semitone. But according to (Y - X) mod 12, (0 - 11) mod 12 is ( -11 ) mod 12 = 1. Which is correct. So the formula (Y - X) mod 12 gives the correct distance between X and Y. So that's the way to compute the distance.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lowest to the upper. So the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones you need to move up from X to reach Y. So if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then it's 12 - (X - Y). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo the first thing is to create a mapping from note names to their indices. Let's make a list of the notes in order. The order is given as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\"\n\nWait, but in the example, the third input is 'A B H'. Let's check what the order is. So the list is:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but in the list, after A comes B, then H. So the index for A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. So the distance between B and H is (11 - 10) = 1 semitone. Between H and B, it's (10 - 11) mod 12 = ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. Which is correct. So that's the correct way.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Create a dictionary that maps each note to its index (0-11).\n\n- For the three input notes, generate all permutations (since the order matters for checking the major/minor conditions).\n\n- For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. If so, it's a major triad.\n\n- Also check if the distance between X and Y is 3 semitones and between Y and Z is 4 semitones. If so, it's a minor triad.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, we have to check all possible orderings of the three notes. For example, for three notes, there are 3! = 6 possible permutations. For each of these permutations, check if the conditions are met.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a major triad, the three notes must have two intervals: 4 and 3. So, in the ordered triplet (X, Y, Z), the distance from X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. So the total from X to Z is 7. But since the notes are in a cycle, perhaps there are multiple ways to arrange them.\n\nBut since the problem says that the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. So for each of the three notes, we can consider each of them as the middle note (Y) for the major or minor condition.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible permutation of the three notes, check if the first two have a distance of 4 and the next two have 3. Or for minor, check if first two have 3 and next two have 4.\n\nBut since there are 6 permutations, perhaps it's feasible to check all of them.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n\n2. For each permutation of the three notes (X, Y, Z):\n\n   a. Compute distance between X and Y (d1).\n\n   b. Compute distance between Y and Z (d2).\n\n   c. Check if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3. If yes, then it's a major triad.\n\n   d. Check if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4. If yes, then it's a minor triad.\n\n3. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them meet the major or minor conditions.\n\nNow, how to generate all permutations of the three notes. For example, for a list [A, B, C], the permutations are all 6 possible orderings.\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. So for the three notes, generate all permutations, and check each one.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nFirst, create a mapping of note names to their indexes. Let's create a list of the note names in order, then use a dictionary.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given in the notation like C, C#, etc. So for example, the input could be 'C#', which is present in the list.\n\nOnce we have that, for each note in the input, we can get their index.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, say, a, b, c, then for each permutation (x, y, z) of (a, b, c), compute:\n\nd1 = (y - x) % 12\n\nd2 = (z - y) % 12\n\nCheck if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 → major.\n\nOr d1 == 3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones and between Y and Z is 3. So the order is X, Y, Z. So for the permutation (X, Y, Z), the first distance is between X and Y, and the second between Y and Z.\n\nSo for each permutation of the three notes, check those two distances.\n\nNow, for example, in the first sample input: C E G.\n\nThe indexes are C=0, E=4, G=7.\n\nPermutation (C, E, G):\n\nd1 = (4-0) mod 12 = 4 → yes. d2 = (7-4) mod 12 = 3 → yes. So major.\n\nAnother permutation, say (E, G, C). Then d1 is (7-4)=3, d2 is (0-7) mod 12 = 5? Wait, (0 -7) is -7 mod 12 is 5? Wait, 0 -7 is -7. Adding 12 gives 5. Yes. So d2 is 5. Which is not 3 or 4. So that permutation would not satisfy.\n\nBut other permutations may not be valid. However, the first permutation (C, E, G) is valid, so the answer is major.\n\nAnother example: C# B F → the input is ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nLet's check their indexes. Let's see:\n\nC# is index 1. B is index 10. F is index 5.\n\nNow, considering the permutation (B, C#, F). Let's compute:\n\nB is 10, C# is 1. So distance between B and C# is (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 is 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5-1=4. So that's 3 and 4. So minor.\n\nSo that permutation would trigger the minor condition.\n\nSo the code needs to check all permutations.\n\nSo the steps for code:\n\nRead the three notes as a list.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   x, y, z = permutation\n\n   compute d1 = (y's index - x's index) mod 12\n\n   compute d2 = (z's index - y's index) mod 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major found.\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor found.\n\nOnce any of these is found, return the corresponding result.\n\nIf after checking all permutations, neither is found, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to do this?\n\nIn Python, for the input, the input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes. Wait, the input is given as a list of three elements, but in the example, the input is written as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but that's probably an example of the input format. Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo for example, the sample input is:\n\nC E G\n\nBut in the example given, the input is written as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but that's probably part of the example for the output. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nOutput:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nWait, but that's probably an example of multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line with three notes. So perhaps the actual input is three notes, e.g., for the first case, the input is \"C E G\", and the output is \"major\".\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into three notes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, read the input line:\n\ninput_line = input().strip()\n\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\nThen, for the three notes in 'notes' list, generate all permutations.\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n   y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n   z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n   d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print(\"major\")\n\n       exit()\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print(\"minor\")\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, print 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the code will check all permutations. However, once any permutation meets the major or minor condition, the code can immediately output the result and exit.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once any permutation meets the condition, we can return the answer.\n\nBut for example, if there are two permutations that meet the major condition, but the code would exit on the first occurrence.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unique, it's safe.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input: 'C E G' → permutations include (C, E, G) → d1 is 4, d2 is 3 → major.\n\nSample Input: 'C# B F' → permutations include (B, C#, F). Let's compute:\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1. So y_idx - x_idx is 1 - 10 = -9 mod 12 → 3. Then z is F (index 5). y_idx is 1. z_idx - y_idx is 5 -1 =4. So d1 is 3, d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nAnother sample input: 'A B H' → let's check.\n\nNotes are A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nFor example, permutation (A, B, H):\n\nd1 between A and B: 10-9=1 → mod 12 is 1. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: (A, H, B). d1 is (11-9) = 2. d2 is (10 -11) mod 12 = 11. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. d1 is (9 - 10) mod 12 → ( -1 ) mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. d1 is (11 -10) =1. d2 is (9 -11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 → 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. d1 is 9 - 11 = -2 mod 12 → 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. d1 is 10 - 11 = -1 mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nOther permutations:\n\nA, B, H → checked.\n\nB, A, H → checked.\n\nH, A, B → checked.\n\nWhat about permutation (A, H, B)? d1 is 11-9=2. d2 is 10 - 11 = -1 mod 12 → 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. d1 is 9-10= -1 → 11. d2 is 11-9=2. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. d1 is 10 - 11 = -1 → 11. d2 is 9 -10 = -1 → 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, possible edge cases. For example, when the notes are C, E, G. Another permutation could be E, G, C. Let's check:\n\nd1 between E and G is 7-4=3. d2 between G and C is (0 -7) mod 12 = 5. So 3 and 5 → no. So not major or minor.\n\nAnother example: C, G, E. d1 between C and G is 7-0=7. d2 between G and E is 4-7 = -3 mod 12 = 9. No.\n\nSo the code checks all permutations, but only the correct one triggers the condition.\n\nAnother test case: what about a minor triad. Let's take B, C#, F. Let's check the permutation B, C#, F. As before, d1 is 3, d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nAnother example: C#, E, G#. Let's see. Let's check if it's a major or minor.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think of the code handling all cases.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code will generate all permutations of the three notes, check for each permutation.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNeed to import permutations from itertools.\n\nBut in some programming contest environments, itertools may not be available. However, the problem says that the code is for Python, and the user is to write a Python script. So assuming that itertools is allowed.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    # Generate all permutations of the three notes\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what about the case where the same note is repeated? But the problem says that the input is three notes, but it's possible that they are not distinct. However, according to the problem statement, the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So perhaps the input will always be three distinct notes. But the code doesn't need to check for that. For example, if the three notes are the same, then the distances would be zero. But the code would check all permutations and find nothing, so output 'strange'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a valid chord. However, the code can handle any three notes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input: 'C E G' → outputs 'major'.\n\nSample input 'C# B F' → outputs 'minor'.\n\nSample input 'A B H' → outputs 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: what about 'C E G#'? Let's see.\n\nC is 0, E is 4, G# is 8.\n\nCheck permutations:\n\nC, E, G# → d1 = 4-0=4. d2 = 8-4=4. So 4 and 4 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, G#, C. d1 is (8-4) =4. d2 is (0-8) mod 12 = 4. So 4 and 4. No.\n\nAnother permutation: C, G#, E. d1 is 8-0=8. d2 is 4-8 = -4 mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nAnother permutation: G#, C, E. d1 is (0 -8) mod 12 =4? Wait, 0-8 is -8 mod 12 is 4. So d1 is 4. Then d2 is 4-0=4. So again 4 and 4. No.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C, G#. d1 is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. d2 is 8-0=8. No.\n\nAnother permutation: G#, E, C. d1 is (4 -8) mod 12 → -4 mod 12 → 8. d2 is (0-4) mod 12 → 8. No. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code would output strange.\n\nAnother test case: let's take a minor triad. For example, B, C#, F. Let's check permutations. One of them is B, C#, F. d1 is (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5 -1) =4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So code returns minor.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is neither. The solution involves checking the distances between the notes in semitones according to specific criteria for major and minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to an index based on their position in the cyclic order of musical notes. This helps in calculating distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes meet the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. A major triad requires distances of 4 and 3 semitones between consecutive notes, while a minor triad requires distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its corresponding index for quick lookup.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into three individual notes.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is computed using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. If a permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, the result is printed immediately and the program exits.\n5. **Result Determination**: If none of the permutations meet the criteria for a major or minor triad, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to determine the correct classification.",
