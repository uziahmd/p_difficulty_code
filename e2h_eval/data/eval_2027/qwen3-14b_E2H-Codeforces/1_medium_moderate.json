    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. And each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take the perimeter of that rectangle. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width w and height h is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each side contributes (w) and (h), but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Wait, for example, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter cells would be 2*(m + n - 2). Because the top and bottom rows contribute n cells each, and the left and right columns contribute (m-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2n + 2(m-2) = 2(n + m -2). Right.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of a rectangle of size (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1) and h' = h -4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So that rectangle's perimeter is the ring. But for that rectangle, the perimeter is 2*( (w') + (h') - 2 ), as discussed.\n\nBut wait, let's take the first example input: 3 3 1. Then the first ring is perimeter of 3x3. Which is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first sample output of 8. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: the third input is 7 9 2. Let's compute for each ring.\n\nFirst ring: i=1. w' =7 - 0 =7, h'=9-0=9. Perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Second ring: i=2. w' =7 -4*(1) =3, h'=9-4*(1)=5. Perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the third sample output. So yes.\n\nSo the approach is to compute for each i from 1 to k, the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), then sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a condition here. For each i, the rectangle must be valid. For example, when i increases, the dimensions must be at least 1. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w,h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. So for each i up to k, the dimensions will be valid. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the perimeter of the rectangle with width w_i = w - 4*(i-1), height h_i = h -4*(i-1). Sum all those perimeters.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k, then compute sum over i=1 to k of 2*( (w_i + h_i - 2) ), where w_i = w -4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1).\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example: 3 3 1. Sum is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. Perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. First ring 28, second 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 40. Correct.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, read the input as three integers. Then compute the sum.\n\nBut wait, for each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum += perimeter\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, let me check for i starting from 1 to k. For example, for i=1, 4*(i-1) is 0. So yes.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, what about when the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's <= floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see: For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k is 1. So for i=1, current_w and current_h are 3 - 0 = 3, and same for h. So valid.\n\nAnother example: suppose w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=2, current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h same. So perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code it.\n\nRead input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\nThen loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me test for another case. Let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct. For example, a 5x5 square's perimeter is 16 cells.\n\nAnother case: k=2. For w=5, h=5, then i=1: 5x5, perimeter 16. i=2: 5-4*(1) =1, h same. So perimeter is 2*(1 +1 -2) = 0? Wait, but 1x1 rectangle. The perimeter would be 4 cells? Wait, wait, the formula gives 2*(1 +1 -2) = 0. That's wrong. But according to the problem statement, the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. But for a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 4 cells. But according to our formula, it's 2*(1+1-2) = 0. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a mistake in the formula. Wait, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle with m rows and n columns is 2*(m + n - 2). Let's think for m=1, n=1. Then the perimeter is 4 cells. But according to the formula 2*(1 + 1 -2) = 0. Which is wrong. So why?\n\nAh, because the formula is incorrect. Let me re-derive it.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is the number of cells in the border. For a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter is:\n\nTop row: n cells.\n\nBottom row: n cells.\n\nLeft column (excluding top and bottom): (m-2) cells.\n\nRight column (excluding top and bottom): (m-2) cells.\n\nTotal: 2n + 2(m-2) = 2(n + m - 2). Which is the same formula as before. But when m=1 and n=1, that gives 2(1 +1 -2) = 0. But the actual perimeter is 4. So why?\n\nBecause when m=1 and n=1, the formula is not applicable. Because the formula assumes that m and n are >= 2? Or perhaps the formula is wrong for cases where m or n is 1.\n\nWait, let's think again. For a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 4 cells. But according to the formula, it gives 0. So that's a problem.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the i-th ring is the bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nBut for that rectangle, when it's 1x1, the bordering cells would be all four cells. However, according to the formula, it's 0. So the formula is wrong here.\n\nSo what's the correct way to calculate the perimeter?\n\nAnother approach: the perimeter of a rectangle with width m and height n is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells is (m * 2) + (n-2)*2. Wait, no. Wait, for example, for m=3, n=3. The perimeter is 3*2 + (3-2)*2 = 6 + 2 = 8. Which is correct. Which is 2*(3 + 3) - 4 = 12-4=8. Yes. So general formula is 2*(m + n) -4. Which is same as 2*(m + n - 2). Which is the same as before. But for m=1, n=1, 2*(1 + 1 -2) = 0. But the actual perimeter is 4. So why?\n\nAh, because when m=1 and n=1, the formula 2*(m + n - 2) is 0. Which is wrong. So how to fix this?\n\nWait, maybe the formula is correct only when m and n are >= 2. Otherwise, for m=1, n=1, the perimeter is 4. For m=1, n>1: the perimeter is 2*(1 + n) -4 = 2n + 2 -4 = 2n -2. For example, if m=1, n=3. Then perimeter is 2*(1+3) -4 = 8-4=4. Which is correct: the top row has 3 cells, but since it's a single row, the left and right are part of the perimeter. Wait, no. For a 1x3 rectangle, the perimeter is the entire row. Which is 3 cells. But according to the formula, 2*(1+3) -4 = 4. Which is wrong.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the formula is incorrect. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. How many cells are in the perimeter of a rectangle of size m x n?\n\nThe perimeter is the set of cells that are on the edge. So for a rectangle with m rows and n columns:\n\nThe number of perimeter cells is 2*m + 2*(n-2). Because:\n\n- The top and bottom rows have n cells each (so 2n cells).\n- The left and right columns have (m-2) cells each (since the top and bottom are already counted). So 2*(m-2) cells.\n\nTotal is 2n + 2(m-2) = 2(n + m -2). Which is the same formula as before.\n\nBut for m=1, n=1: 2(1+1-2) = 0. But the actual perimeter is 4. So this formula is not working here. What's the problem?\n\nAh! Because when m=1, the left and right columns are not present. So the formula 2(n + m -2) is not applicable for m=1 or n=1. So perhaps we need to adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is 2*(m + n) - 4, but when m and n are both 1, then it's 0, but the actual perimeter is 4. So how to handle that?\n\nWait, maybe the formula is correct for m >= 2 and n >= 2. For cases where either m or n is 1, we need to adjust.\n\nLet me think:\n\nCase 1: m=1, n=1. Perimeter is 4 cells.\n\nCase 2: m=1, n>1. The perimeter is 2n (the entire row), but since the top and bottom are same, but in this case, since m=1, the top and bottom are the same row. So the perimeter is 2n - 2 (since the corners are counted twice?) No, wait. For a 1x3 rectangle, the perimeter is the entire row. So 3 cells. But according to the formula 2*(1 + 3 -2) = 2*2=4. Which is wrong. So the formula is not working here.\n\nSo what's the correct way to calculate the perimeter?\n\nAlternative approach: the perimeter is the total number of cells in the rectangle minus the number of cells in the inner rectangle (if any). For example, for a rectangle of m x n, the perimeter is m*n - (m-2)*(n-2). But this is only true if m and n are >=2. If m or n is less than 2, then the inner rectangle is invalid.\n\nFor example, for m=1, n=1: the inner rectangle is (1-2) x (1-2) which is negative, so the perimeter is 1*1 - 0 = 1? Which is not correct. Hmm.\n\nBut for m=3, n=3: perimeter is 3*3 - (3-2)*(3-2) = 9 - 1 = 8. Which is correct.\n\nFor m=1, n=3: the perimeter is 3 (the entire row). Using the formula m*n - (m-2)*(n-2) would be 3 - (-1*-1) = 3-1=2. Which is wrong.\n\nSo that approach also doesn't work for m=1 or n=1.\n\nSo perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nIf the rectangle is 1x1: perimeter is 4.\n\nIf the rectangle is 1xn (n>1): perimeter is 2n.\n\nIf the rectangle is mx1 (m>1): perimeter is 2m.\n\nElse (m>1 and n>1): perimeter is 2*(m + n - 2).\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nCase 1: 1x1 → 4. Correct.\n\nCase 2: 1x3 → 2*3 = 6? But the actual perimeter is 3 cells. So that's not correct. So this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, what's the perimeter of a 1x3 rectangle? It's all the cells. So 3 cells. But according to the formula 2*(1 + 3 -2) = 2*(2) =4. Which is wrong.\n\nSo there's a problem here. How to correctly compute the perimeter?\n\nAlternative idea: the perimeter is the number of cells in the border, which can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor a rectangle with width w and height h (number of columns and rows), the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. But this formula gives for 1x1: 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. Which is wrong.\n\nBut for 1x3: 2*(1+3) -4 = 8-4=4. Which is still wrong (should be 3).\n\nSo why is this discrepancy happening?\n\nBecause the formula 2*(w + h) -4 is derived for rectangles where both dimensions are at least 2. Let's think again.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (in terms of cells) is:\n\nIf the rectangle is a single row (h=1), then the perimeter is w (since all cells are on the perimeter). Similarly, if it's a single column (w=1), then the perimeter is h.\n\nBut for a rectangle with both dimensions ≥2, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2).\n\nSo combining these, the formula is:\n\nif w == 1 and h == 1: perimeter is 4\n\nelif w == 1: perimeter is 2 * h (but wait, for w=1 and h=3, the perimeter is 3 cells. So this is not correct.)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nFor a rectangle of w columns and h rows:\n\nThe perimeter is the number of cells on the border. For example:\n\n- For 1x1: 4 cells (all four sides, but there's only one cell. So the perimeter is 1 cell? No, that's not right. Wait, the cell is a single cell. So it's surrounded by four edges, but the perimeter is the number of cells in the border. So for a single cell, the entire cell is part of the perimeter. So the perimeter is 1 cell. But earlier examples contradict that.\n\nBut the problem says that the first ring is along the edge of the plate. For example, in the first sample input, 3x3, the first ring is the perimeter of the 3x3 rectangle. Which is 8 cells. Which is correct. So how is that calculated?\n\nIn that case, the perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 -2) = 8. Which is correct.\n\nBut for a 1x3 rectangle, the perimeter is the entire row. So 3 cells. How to calculate that.\n\nSo perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nperimeter = 2*(w + h) - 4 if both w and h are ≥2.\n\nOtherwise, if either is 1, then perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4? Or something else?\n\nWait, let's try for 1x3:\n\nIf we use the formula 2*(w + h) -4 = 2*(1+3) -4 = 8-4=4. But actual perimeter is 3. So that's wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4 if both w and h are ≥2. Otherwise, if one of them is 1, then perimeter is 2*max(w, h).\n\nFor example:\n\n1x3: max(w, h) is 3. 2*3 = 6. Which is still wrong.\n\nWait, but for 1x3, the perimeter is 3 cells. How to get that?\n\nMaybe the correct formula is:\n\nif w == 1 and h ==1: perimeter is 1.\n\nelif w ==1: perimeter is h * 2 - 2 (because the two ends are counted once each, and the middle is counted once. Wait, for 1x3: the perimeter is 3 cells. So 2*3 - 2 = 4. Still wrong.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps I need to find the correct formula for the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of cells.\n\nLet me think of the perimeter as the number of cells that are on the border. For a rectangle of m rows and n columns:\n\nThe number of cells on the border is equal to:\n\ntop row: n cells.\n\nbottom row: n cells.\n\nleft column (excluding top and bottom): m-2 cells.\n\nright column (excluding top and bottom): m-2 cells.\n\nTotal: 2n + 2*(m-2) = 2n + 2m -4 = 2(n + m - 2).\n\nBut this formula assumes that m ≥ 2 and n ≥ 2. Because if m=1, then the left and right columns are not present. So for m=1, the formula would give 2n + 2*(1-2) = 2n - 2. Which for m=1 and n=3 is 2*3 -2 = 4. Which is not correct (actual is 3).\n\nSo what's wrong with the derivation?\n\nWhen m=1, the top and bottom rows are the same row. So adding them gives n + n = 2n cells. But that counts all cells twice. So for m=1, the top and bottom rows are the same, so the total is n cells, not 2n. So the formula for m=1 is:\n\ntop and bottom rows: n cells (since they are the same row).\n\nleft and right columns: since m=1, there are no left and right columns (since they are part of the same row). So no additional cells.\n\nTotal: n cells.\n\nSimilarly, for n=1 and m ≥ 2: the perimeter is 2m cells (top and bottom rows are the same column, left and right columns are m cells each, but that's not correct. Wait, for a 3x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 3 cells (the entire column). But according to the formula 2*(m + n -2) = 2*(3+1-2) = 4. Which is wrong.\n\nSo the formula works only when both m and n are ≥2. So for other cases, we need to adjust.\n\nSo the correct way to compute the perimeter is:\n\nif m == 1 and n ==1: perimeter is 1.\n\nelif m == 1: perimeter is n * 2 - 2 (since the top and bottom rows are same, but overlapping. Wait, for m=1, n=3: the perimeter is 3 cells. So how to get that?\n\nWait, for m=1, the perimeter is the entire row. So n cells. So for m=1, the perimeter is n.\n\nSimilarly, if n=1, the perimeter is m.\n\nSo, the correct formula is:\n\nif m == 1 and n == 1: perimeter is 1.\n\nelif m == 1: perimeter is n.\n\nelif n == 1: perimeter is m.\n\nelse: 2*(m + n - 2).\n\nBut wait, for m=1 and n=3, the perimeter is 3. For m=3, n=1, perimeter is 3. For m=1, n=1, perimeter is 1. For m=2, n=2, perimeter is 2*(2+2-2) = 4, which is correct. For m=3, n=3, 2*(3+3-2) = 8, correct. For m=1, n=2, perimeter is 2. Which is correct (the row has two cells, both are on the perimeter).\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo now, the problem is that in our code, for each ring, we need to compute the perimeter of the current_w and current_h. But for some cases, current_w or current_h may be 1, which requires different handling.\n\nSo the code needs to handle those cases.\n\nSo in the previous example where current_w=1 and current_h=1, the perimeter is 1. But according to the earlier code, it would compute 2*(1+1-2) = 0, which is wrong.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted to account for this.\n\nSo the code for calculating the perimeter for current_w and current_h is:\n\nif current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n    perimeter = 1\n\nelif current_w == 1:\n\n    perimeter = current_h\n\nelif current_h == 1:\n\n    perimeter = current_w\n\nelse:\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nSo how does this affect the earlier example?\n\nLet's take the case where current_w=1 and current_h=1. Then perimeter is 1. For example, if w=5, h=5, k=2. Then for i=2, current_w =5-4*(1) =1, current_h=5-4*(1)=1. So perimeter is 1. So the code would add 1 to the total.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, what's the correct number of cells for this ring? The i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size 1x1. Which is the entire rectangle. So it's 1 cell. Which is correct.\n\nBut earlier, the code would have added 0. Now it adds 1.\n\nSo the code must be modified to use this new formula.\n\nSo the code should be updated to calculate the perimeter correctly.\n\nNow, let's see for the previous example where the code would have failed.\n\nFor example, in the case where w=5, h=5, k=2:\n\ni=1: current_w=5, current_h=5. perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. sum is 16.\n\ni=2: current_w=1, current_h=1. perimeter is 1. sum is 17.\n\nSo the total is 17.\n\nBut what is the actual number of cells?\n\nFor the first ring, it's the perimeter of 5x5, which is 16 cells. For the second ring, it's the perimeter of 1x1, which is 1 cell. So total 17.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nSo in the code, for each i, after computing current_w and current_h, we need to calculate perimeter as per the conditions above.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nfor each i in 1..k:\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = 1\n\n    elif current_w == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_h\n\n    elif current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_w\n\n    else:\n\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nBut what about when current_w is 1 and current_h is 2? For example, current_w=1, current_h=2. Then perimeter is 2. Which is correct (the entire row of 2 cells).\n\nBut according to the formula, since current_w is 1, perimeter is current_h=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: current_w=2, current_h=1. perimeter is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: current_w=2, current_h=2. perimeter is 2*(2+2-2) = 4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: current_w=1, current_h=3. perimeter is 3. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's re-test the previous example where the code would have failed.\n\nLet me think about the case where the code would have had current_w=1 and current_h=1. The code now adds 1 instead of 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, what is the correct value?\n\nYes, the ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. For a 1x1 rectangle, the bordering cells are all cells (only one cell), so it's 1 cell. So the code is correct now.\n\nSo this adjustment is necessary.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample: 3 3 1. current_w=3, current_h=3. Not 1, so perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: 7 9 1. current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 7 9 2. i=1: perimeter 28. i=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. Neither is 1. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=2. As discussed, total is 16+1=17.\n\nAnother test case: w=1, h=1, k=1. Then current_w=1, current_h=1. perimeter is 1. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: w=1, h=3, k=1. perimeter is 3. Output is 3.\n\nAnother test case: w=2, h=2, k=1. perimeter is 2*(2+2-2) = 4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=2, h=3, k=1. perimeter is 2*(2+3-2) = 2*3=6. Let's see. The rectangle is 2x3. The perimeter is 2*3 (top and bottom) + 2*(2-2) (left and right) = 6 + 0 = 6. Which is correct. So yes.\n\nSo the code now handles all these cases.\n\nSo the code must be modified to include these conditions.\n\nNow, the code in Python would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = 1\n\n    elif current_w == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_h\n\n    elif current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_w\n\n    else:\n\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, what about when current_w is 1 and current_h is 1? For example, if i=1, and w=1, h=1. But according to the input constraints, the minimum w and h is 3. Wait, the input constraints say that 3 ≤ w, h ≤ 100. So in the input, w and h are at least 3. However, during the iteration for i=1 to k, current_w and current_h may become 1, but the code handles that.\n\nFor example, if w=3, h=3, k=1: current_w=3, current_h=3. So perimeter is 8. Correct.\n\nIf w=5, h=5, k=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. So perimeter is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is now correct.\n\nBut wait, the input constraints for k are:\n\nk is between 1 and floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 )\n\nFor example, if w=3 and h=3, then min(w,h) is 3. So floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. So in this case, the code works.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5. min is 5. floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can be 1. But if someone passes k=2, but according to the input constraints, the code is supposed to receive valid inputs. So the code doesn't need to handle invalid k values.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the previous example where the code would have failed.\n\nFor example, input 5 5 2. The code computes:\n\ni=1: current_w=5, current_h=5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2)= 16.\n\ni=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1 → perimeter is 1. Total is 17.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=1 → 16.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=2 → 17.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=3. But according to the input constraints, for w=5, min(w,h)=5. So floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1.5 → 1. So k=3 is invalid. But the code is supposed to handle valid inputs only.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code should pass all test cases.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → output 28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → output 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 5 2 → output 17.\n\nAnother test case: input 1 1 1 → but input constraints say w and h are at least 3. So no need to handle.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 3 1. So w=5, h=3. For k=1. current_w=5, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(5+3-2) = 2*6=12. Which is correct. For a 5x3 rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(5+3-2) = 12. Let's see: top and bottom rows are 5 each (total 10), left and right columns (excluding top and bottom) are 3-2=1 each. So 2*1=2. Total 12. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed at increasing distances from the edge of the plate, and each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: The i-th ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. This means each subsequent ring is 2 cells inward from the previous one on all sides.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, we calculate the perimeter of the corresponding inner rectangle. The perimeter calculation varies based on the dimensions of the rectangle:\n   - If both dimensions are 1, the perimeter is 1.\n   - If one dimension is 1, the perimeter is equal to the other dimension.\n   - Otherwise, the perimeter is calculated using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n        perimeter = 1\n    elif current_w == 1:\n        perimeter = current_h\n    elif current_h == 1:\n        perimeter = current_w\n    else:\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`).\n2. **Iterating Over Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, we compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - If the inner rectangle is 1x1, the perimeter is 1.\n   - If either dimension is 1, the perimeter is the value of the other dimension.\n   - For rectangles with both dimensions greater than 1, we use the standard perimeter formula adjusted for cell count.\n4. **Summing Perimeters**: Each calculated perimeter is summed to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly handle all edge cases and efficiently compute the required number of gilded cells for each ring.",
