    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is the edge, the second is two cells in, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\nHmm. Let me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For each i-th ring (starting from 1 to k), we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle that's formed at that level. But wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for the first ring, it's the original rectangle's perimeter. For the second ring, it's the perimeter of a rectangle that's 4 less in both width and height? Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So for example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The second ring would be the perimeter of a rectangle that's (w-4) by (h-4), but then subtract the inner part. Wait, no. Wait, the description says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, maybe I should think of each ring as the perimeter of a rectangle of size (current width) × (current height), but then subtract the inner part. Or perhaps the perimeter is calculated as 2*(width + height - 2) because for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because each side has m or n cells, but the corners are counted twice. So for example, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter cells are 2*(m + n) - 4. Because the top and bottom have n cells each, left and right have (m-2) each (since top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2n + 2(m-2) = 2n + 2m -4 = 2*(m + n) -4. \n\nSo for each ring i, the current width is w_i = w - 4*(i-1), and current height is h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then the perimeter for that ring is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Wait, no: 2*(w_i + h_i) -4? Let me check. Let's take a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter would be 3*4 -4? No. Wait for 3x3, the perimeter is 8 cells. Which is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Yes. So that formula works. So for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). \n\nBut wait, the problem says that each ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. So for example, the first ring is the border of the original rectangle. The second ring is the border of a rectangle that's 4 less in width and height. Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. Suppose the original rectangle is 7x9. Then for the first ring, it's the perimeter of 7x9. Then for the second ring, the rectangle is (7 - 4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So the inner rectangle is 3x5. The border of that would be 2*(3 +5) -4 = 16-4=12? Wait, but the example given in the input is for 7 9 2, which outputs 40. Let me check that.\n\nWait the sample input includes '7 9 2' with output 40. Let's compute that. For the first ring, the perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Then for the second ring, the rectangle is 7-4*(2-1) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So the perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. So total is 28 +12=40. Which matches the sample. So yes, that formula works. \n\nSo the approach is to compute for each ring i (from 1 to k), the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h -4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch here. For each i, the rectangle must be valid. For example, if the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1), the dimensions are still at least 3? Well, according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's <= floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For i=1, 4*(i-1) is 0, so the rectangle is 3x something. For i=2, 4*(2-1) =4, so the min(w, h) would be 3-4= -1, but since k is constrained, that's not possible. So the input ensures that for all i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to worry about negative numbers here.\n\nSo the plan is: for each i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle with width w_i = w - 4*(i-1), height h_i = h -4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 1..k:\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    sum += perimeter\n\nreturn sum\n\nWait, but let's check the first sample input. First sample input is 3 3 1. Then current_w is 3, current_h is 3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the sample output of 8. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7+9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the sample output of 28. Then for 7 9 2, it's 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward. Now, let's code this.\n\nIn Python, read the input as three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, compute for each step.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Well, according to the input constraints, k is such that it's allowed. For example, the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see: For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3 +1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For i=1, 4*(i-1) is 0. So current_w and current_h are 3 and whatever. For i=2, 4*(i-1) is 4, so min(w, h) -4*(i-1) would be 3-4= -1. But since k is limited, that's not possible. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for another example. Let's say w=7, h=9, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_w =7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9 -2) = 2*14=28.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)= 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: let's take w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be 16. If k=2, then for i=2, current_w =5-4*(1) =1, current_h=5-4=1. Then perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Which would be 0. But according to the input constraints, k is limited. Let's see: min(w, h) is 5. (5 +1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code will not have such cases.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\nThen compute the sum as described.\n\nSo the code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for another case. Let's say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=7. perimeter is 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24.\n\ni=2: current_w =7-4=3, current_h=7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nYes. So for example, if input is 7 7 2, output is 32.\n\nAnother test case: let's take w=4, h=4, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(4+4-2) = 2*6=12. But according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(4,4)+1)/4 ) = (4+1)/4 = 1.25 → floor is 1. So k=1 is allowed. So code returns 12.\n\nYes. So the code seems correct.\n\nSo this should handle all cases. Let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Which is correct.\n\nSample input 2: 7 9 1 → output 28. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 7 9 2 → 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nLooks good. So the code should be correct.\n",
