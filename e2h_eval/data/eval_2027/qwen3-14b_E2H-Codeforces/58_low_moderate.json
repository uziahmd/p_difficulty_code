You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to create an odd-length cycle, and also count the number of ways to do that. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The graph is undirected, no loops or parallel edges. We need to find the minimum t such that adding t edges creates a simple cycle of odd length. Also, compute w, the number of ways to add exactly t edges to achieve this.\n\nWhat's a simple cycle here? It's a cycle where each vertex appears once except the starting/ending one. So, for example, a triangle (3 nodes) is a cycle of length 3, which is odd.\n\nThe key thing here is that if the original graph already has an odd-length cycle, then t is 0 and w is 1? Wait, no. Because the problem says to find the minimum t. So if there's already an odd cycle, then t is 0, and w is the number of ways to add zero edges (which is 1?), but maybe the problem requires that we count the number of possible ways to add edges that result in such a cycle. But if the graph already has an odd cycle, then adding zero edges would be one way. However, maybe there are multiple existing odd cycles. Wait, but the question says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges. So if the graph already has at least one odd cycle, then t is 0 and w is 1? Or maybe it's the number of possible ways to choose edges to add (but since t is 0, there's only one way: add nothing). But that can't be right. For example, in the second sample input, the input is a triangle (3 nodes connected in a cycle). Then the output is 0 1. Which matches that. So if the graph already contains an odd cycle, then t is 0, and w is 1. Because adding zero edges is the only way. So the first thing I need to check is whether the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If yes, then output t=0 and w=1.\n\nBut how to check if the graph has an odd-length cycle? Well, that's equivalent to checking if the graph is bipartite. Because a bipartite graph cannot have any odd-length cycles. So if the graph is bipartite, then there are no odd cycles. Otherwise, there is at least one.\n\nSo the first step is to check if the graph is bipartite. If it's not bipartite, then t is 0 and w is 1. But wait, maybe there are multiple ways to form an odd cycle. But the problem says that when t is 0, we need to count the number of ways to add t edges (i.e., zero edges) that form such a cycle. But since the graph already has at least one, but perhaps multiple, but the way to add zero edges is just one way. Because adding nothing is the same regardless of how many existing cycles there are. So the answer for w is 1 in that case. Because the problem says that two ways are considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. So adding zero edges is one way, regardless of how many existing cycles there are. Therefore, if the graph is not bipartite, then the answer is t=0, w=1.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple existing odd cycles? For example, a graph with two separate triangles. Then adding zero edges would result in having multiple odd cycles. But the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges. Since t is zero, there's only one way (adding nothing). So regardless of how many existing odd cycles there are, the answer is w=1. So the first case is: if the graph is not bipartite, then t=0 and w=1.\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, then we need to find the minimal t and count the ways. So the next part is when the graph is bipartite. How to find the minimal t?\n\nIn a bipartite graph, all cycles are even-length. So adding edges to create an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo, the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle. How can we do that?\n\nLet me think. To create an odd cycle, we need to have a cycle of odd length. Since the graph is bipartite, any existing cycle is even. So adding edges can create new cycles.\n\nFor example, consider a bipartition (A, B). Suppose we have a tree (which is bipartite). Then, adding any edge between two nodes in the same partition will create a cycle. Let's say the tree is a chain of nodes A-B-A. Adding an edge between the two A's would create a cycle of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to an undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and also count the number of ways to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Odd Cycles**: If the graph already contains an odd-length cycle, the answer is trivial: `t = 0` and `w = 1`.\n2. **Bipartite Graph Check**: If the graph is bipartite (no odd cycles), we need to determine the minimum edges required to create an odd cycle. This involves:\n   - **Component Analysis**: For each connected component in the bipartite graph, determine the sizes of the two partitions.\n   - **Minimum Edges Calculation**: The minimum number of edges needed to form an odd cycle from a bipartite component is determined by the sizes of the partitions. Specifically, if one partition is larger, adding an edge between two nodes in the larger partition will create an odd cycle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        v = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n    \n    # Check if the graph is bipartite\n    color = [-1] * n\n    is_bipartite = True\n    components = []\n    for start in range(n):\n        if color[start] == -1:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(start)\n            color[start] = 0\n            cnt = [0, 0]\n            cnt[0] += 1\n            comp = []\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                comp.append(u)\n                for v in graph[u]:\n                    if color[v] == -1:\n                        color[v] = color[u] ^ 1\n                        cnt[color[v]] += 1\n                        queue.append(v)\n            components.append(cnt)\n    \n    # Check if the graph is bipartite\n    # If any component is not bipartite, then there's an odd cycle\n    # But since we are here, it's bipartite\n    # So check if the graph is bipartite\n    # Wait, the code above checks if it's bipartite?\n    # Actually, the code above assumes that the graph is bipartite.

Let me think again.\n        # If all components are bipartitions where one partition is empty, then they are trees with all nodes in one partition.\n        # For example, a component with all nodes in partition 0. Then, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd cycle.\n        # But in this case, the component has only partition 0, so adding an edge between two nodes in partition 0 would create a cycle of length 2 (but it's not allowed as it's a loop, but since the graph is bipartite, the component is a tree, so adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create a cycle of odd length? No. Wait, the component is a tree, which is bipartite. Adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create a cycle of odd length? Let's see: suppose the tree is a chain of nodes A-B-A. Adding an edge between the two A's creates a cycle of length 2 (which is even). Wait, no. That would create a cycle of length 3 (A-B-A)? No, the path from A to B to A is a cycle of length 2 (edges AB and BA?), but since it's undirected, that's not a valid cycle. Hmm, this seems confusing.\n        # Alternatively, if all components are trees (so they are bipartitions with one side empty?), then to create an odd cycle, we need to connect three nodes from different components. For example, take three components, each with one node. Connect them in a triangle. That requires adding 3 edges. But that's not minimal. So perhaps in this case, the minimal t is 3.\n        # However, in this case, if all components are trees (so they are bipartitions with only one partition non-zero), then the minimal way to create an odd cycle is to connect three components. Because adding edges between two components (say, component A and component B) would create a tree (still bipartite), but adding edges between three components would create a cycle.\n        # So the minimal t is 3. But how to compute the number of ways?\n        # Let's think. The number of ways is the number of triplets of nodes from different components. Since each component has at least one node, and all are isolated (trees with only one node).\n        # Wait, but the components may have more than one node. For example, a component could be a tree with multiple nodes, but all in one partition.\n        # In this case, the minimal t is 3. How to compute the number of ways?\n        # We need to choose three nodes from three different components, and connect them in a triangle. The number of such triplets is the combination of choosing three components and then choosing one node from each component.\n        # So first, count the number of components. Let's say there are k components. Each component has c_i nodes (since all nodes are in one partition).\n        # The number of ways is (sum_{i < j < l} (c_i * c_j * c_l))).\n        # But how to compute this efficiently?\n        # Let's proceed step by step.\n        # First, collect the sizes of all components. For each component, the size is the number of nodes in it. Since in this case, the component's partitions are (size, 0) or (0, size).\n        # So for each component, the size is max(cnt[0], cnt[1]).\n        # So collect all component sizes into a list called 'sizes'.\n        sizes = []\n        for cnt in components:\n            sizes.append(max(cnt[0], cnt[1]))\n        \n        k = len(sizes)\n        if k < 3:\n            # If there are less than 3 components, we can't form a triangle.\n            # For example, if there are 2 components, then we can't form a triangle with 3 nodes from different components.\n            # So in this case, we need to add edges to connect two components and then add another edge to form a cycle.\n            # Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.\n            # If all components have only one partition non-zero, then the graph is a collection of trees (each component is a tree with all nodes in one partition).\n            # To create an odd cycle, we need to connect three components. For example, take three components with at least one node each. Add edges between them in a triangle. That would form an odd cycle.\n            # If there are fewer than three components, then we can't form such a cycle. For example, if there are two components, then connecting them would form a tree (still bipartite), so adding edges between them won't create an odd cycle. Hence, we need to add three edges to form a triangle between three components. But if there are less than three components, this is impossible. Therefore, the minimal t would be 3 if there are at least three components. Otherwise, it's impossible, but the problem says that it's always possible to add edges to form an odd cycle.\n            # Wait, the problem says that the graph is not necessarily connected. So if the graph is completely disconnected (all nodes are isolated), then to form an odd cycle, we need to connect three nodes in a triangle. Which requires adding 3 edges. So the minimal t is 3, and the number of ways is C(n,3), but only if n >= 3.\n            # So back to our case. If there are less than three components, but the sizes are such that there are enough nodes, then what?\n            # Let's proceed with the code logic.\n            if k < 3:\n                # Need to add 3 edges.

But for example, if n=2, m=0, then you need to add 3 edges to form a cycle of 3 nodes. Which is impossible because you can't have 3 nodes.

Let me think again.\n        # If all components are bipartitions where one partition is empty, then they are trees with all nodes in one partition.\n        # For example, a component with all nodes in partition 0. Then, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd cycle.\n        # But in this case, the component has only partition 0, so adding an edge between two nodes in partition 0 would create a cycle of length 2 (but it's not allowed as it's a loop, but since the graph is bipartite, the component is a tree, so adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create a cycle of odd length? No. Wait, the component is a tree, which is bipartite. Adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create a cycle of odd length? Let's see: suppose the tree is a chain of nodes A-B-A. Adding an edge between the two A's creates a cycle of length 2 (which is even). Wait, no. That would create a cycle of length 3 (A-B-A)? No, the path from A to B to A is a cycle of length 2 (edges AB and BA?), but since it's undirected, that's not a valid cycle. Hmm, this seems confusing.\n        # Alternatively, if all components are trees (so they are bipartitions with one side empty?), then to create an odd cycle, we need to connect three nodes from different components. For example, take three components, each with one node. Connect them in a triangle. That requires adding 3 edges. But that's not minimal. So perhaps in this case, the minimal t is 3.\n        # However, in this case, if all components are trees (so they are bipartitions with only one partition non-zero), then the minimal way to create an odd cycle is to connect three components. Because adding edges between two components (say, component A and component B) would create a tree (still bipartite), but adding edges between three components would create a cycle.\n        # So the minimal t is 3. But how to compute the number of ways?\n        # Let's think. The number of ways is the number of triplets of nodes from different components. Since each component has at least one node, and all are isolated (trees with only one node).\n        # Wait, but the components may have more than one node. For example, a component could be a tree with multiple nodes, but all in one partition.\n        # In this case, the minimal t is 3. How to compute the number of ways?\n        # We need to choose three nodes from three different components, and connect them in a triangle. The number of such triplets is the combination of choosing three components and then choosing one node from each component.\n        # So first, count the number of components. Let's say there are k components. Each component has c_i nodes (since all nodes are in one partition).\n        # The number of ways is (sum_{i < j < l} (c_i * c_j * c_l))).\n        # But how to compute this efficiently?\n        # Let's proceed step by step.\n        # First, collect the sizes of all components. For each component, the size is the number of nodes in it. Since in this case, the component's partitions are (size, 0) or (0, size).\n        # So for each component, the size is max(cnt[0], cnt[1]).\n        # So collect all component sizes into a list called 'sizes'.\n        sizes = []\n        for cnt in components:\n            sizes.append(max(cnt[0], cnt[1]))\n        \n        k = len(sizes)\n        if k < 3:\n            # If there are less than 3 components, we can't form a triangle.\n            # For example, if there are 2 components, then we can't form a triangle with 3 nodes from different components.\n            # So in this case, we need to add edges to connect two components and then add another edge to form a cycle.\n            # Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.\n            # If all components have only one partition non-zero, then the graph is a collection of trees (each component is a tree with all nodes in one partition).\n            # To create an odd cycle, we need to connect three components. For example, take three components with at least one node each. Add edges between them in a triangle. That would form an odd cycle.\n            # If there are fewer than three components, then we can't form such a cycle. For example, if there are two components, then connecting them would form a tree (still bipartite), so adding edges between them won't create an odd cycle. Hence, we need to add three edges to form a triangle between three components. But if there are less than three components, this is impossible. Therefore, the minimal t would be 3 if there are at least three components. Otherwise, it's impossible, but the problem says that it's always possible to add edges to form an odd cycle.\n            # Wait, the problem says that the graph is not necessarily connected. So if the graph is completely disconnected (all nodes are isolated), then to form an odd cycle, we need to connect three nodes in a triangle. Which requires adding 3 edges. So the minimal t is 3, and the number of ways is C(n,3), but only if n >= 3.\n            # So back to our case. If there are less than three components, but the sizes are such that there are enough nodes, then what?\n            # Let's proceed with the code logic.\n            if k < 3:\n                # Need to add 3 edges. But how many ways?\n                # Only possible if there are at least three nodes.\n                if n < 3:\n                    # Not possible, but the problem says that the graph must be able to form an odd cycle. But according to the problem statement, the input is such that it is possible.\n                    # However, the input constraints say that n is at least 1. But for example, if n=2, m=0, then you need to add 3 edges to form a cycle of 3 nodes. Which is impossible because you can't have 3 nodes. So this case might not be covered in the problem's test cases. But according to the sample input, when n=3 and m=0, the output is 3 1.\n                else:\n                    # The number of ways is C(n, 3)\n                    # But in this case, all components are isolated nodes.
