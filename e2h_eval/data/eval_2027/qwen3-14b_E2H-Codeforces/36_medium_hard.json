The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the conditions required for such a configuration to exist. The key here is to model the valid configurations of towers that allow this setup.\n\nFirst, the towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower. That implies that any tower in town 1 must have a power of 1, because if it's higher, it would reach town 0. Similarly, a tower in town n must have power 1, since otherwise it would reach town n+1. But wait, the signal power p for a tower at i must satisfy that |c - i| < p. So for town 0 to not be covered by any tower, all towers in town 1 must have p=1 (so their range is [i-p+1, i+p-1] ? Wait, no. Wait, the signal reaches cities c where |c - i| < p. So for a tower at i with power p, it covers cities from i - p + 1 to i + p -1? Or maybe i - p +1 to i + p -1? Let me think: for example, if p=1, then |c - i| < 1 implies c = i. So the tower covers only itself. If p=2, then |c-i| <2 means c can be i-1, i, i+1. So the coverage is from i - p + 1 to i + p -1. Because for p=2, the range is i-1 to i+1, which is length 3.\n\nSo for town 0 to not be covered by any tower, any tower in town 1 must not cover town 0. That requires that the tower's power is less than 1 (but since power is at least 1) or that the tower's power is exactly 1. Because if a tower is in town 1 and has power 1, it covers only town 1. If it had power 2, it would cover town 0 (since |0 - 1| = 1 < 2). So, the tower in town 1 must have power 1. Similarly, the tower in town n must have power 1.\n\nBut how does this affect the overall configuration? Well, perhaps the configuration of towers must be such that they can be partitioned into intervals where each tower is responsible for covering certain towns, and their ranges don't overlap except in the way that each town is covered exactly once.\n\nWait, but the problem allows the signal powers to be set in any way as long as the constraints are met. So what's the necessary and sufficient condition on the set of built towers?\n\nLet me think of the problem as requiring that the towers form a structure where each tower can cover a certain range of towns, and the entire range from 1 to n is covered exactly once by these ranges, and also that the ranges do not extend beyond town 0 or n+1.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe the towers must be arranged in such a way that there's a way to assign ranges that partition the towns 1..n, and each tower's range doesn't spill over to 0 or n+1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the towers must form a set where each tower is responsible for covering a segment of towns, and the segments are non-overlapping and cover all towns exactly once. Also, the ranges of the towers must not include town 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but the way the signal is set can vary. For example, a tower at position i could have a power that covers a certain number of towns. But how to ensure that each town is covered exactly once.\n\nThis seems similar to tiling or some kind of partitioning problem. Let's think recursively. Suppose that for the towers built, there's a way to assign ranges such that:\n\n- Each tower's range covers a contiguous block of towns, and the blocks are non-overlapping and cover all towns from 1 to n.\n\n- Additionally, the leftmost tower (the one covering the leftmost part) must not cover town 0, so its power is chosen such that its left end is town 1. Similarly for the rightmost tower.\n\nWait, but how does the tower's position and power determine the coverage? For example, a tower at position i with power p must cover towns from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. But to ensure that town 0 is not covered, the leftmost tower must have i - p + 1 > 0. For example, if the leftmost tower is at position i, then the minimal p is 1 (covers only itself), but if it's at position 1, then p can't be more than 1, else it would cover town 0.\n\nSo perhaps the towers must be arranged in such a way that each tower is responsible for covering a certain interval, and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover the entire 1..n range. Moreover, each tower's coverage must not go beyond 0 or n+1.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the towers as being placed in positions such that there's a way to split the towns into segments, each handled by a single tower. For example, for a segment from a to b, there must be a tower at some position i in [a, b], and the power p is chosen so that the coverage of i is exactly a to b. How?\n\nFor a tower at i to cover exactly the interval [a, b], the power p must be such that:\n\ni - p + 1 = a\n\ni + p - 1 = b\n\nSolving these equations gives:\n\nAdding them: 2i - 2 + 2p = a + b → ?\n\nWait, solving for p:\n\nFrom the first equation: p = i - a + 1\n\nFrom the second equation: p = b - i + 1\n\nTherefore, combining both gives i -a +1 = b -i +1 → 2i = a + b → i = (a + b)/2. Therefore, the tower must be located at the midpoint of the interval [a, b]. And the power is p = i -a +1 = ( (a + b)/2 - a + 1 ) = (b -a + 2)/2. Which must be integer. Therefore, the interval [a, b] must have even length? Or perhaps the length is odd? Let me see. For example, if a=1 and b=3, then i=2. Then p=2-1+1=2. The coverage would be from 2-2+1=1 to 2+2-1=3. Correct. So the length of the interval is 3 (from 1 to 3) and the midpoint is at 2. So the length is even? No, 3 is odd. So the interval length is (b - a + 1). For the midpoint to be integer, a + b must be even. So the sum a + b must be even, which implies that a and b are both even or both odd. So the length of the interval is (b - a + 1) = ( (a + b) - 2a + 1 ). Not sure. Anyway, the conclusion is that for a tower to cover exactly [a, b], it must be placed at the midpoint of [a, b], and the length of the interval must be such that the midpoint is an integer. So the interval [a, b] must have length odd, so that a + b is even. Because if a and b are such that their sum is even, then their average is integer.\n\nSo, this suggests that the valid configurations of towers are those that can be partitioned into intervals, each of which has an odd length, and each interval has a tower at the midpoint. Moreover, the tower must be present in the midpoint of each interval. \n\nWait, but the tower is built with probability 1/2. So for the configuration to be valid, the set of built towers must include exactly the midpoints of these intervals. \n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of towers (each tower is present with probability 1/2) that can be partitioned into intervals where each interval has a tower at the midpoint. \n\nBut how can we count that? Let's think of dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (i.e., towns 1 to i). Then, for each position i, we can consider whether there is a tower at i. If there is, then perhaps this tower is the midpoint of some interval. For example, if there's a tower at i, then the interval could be from i - k to i + k, but that depends on the length. Alternatively, for a tower at position i, it could be the midpoint of a segment of length 2k+1. So for example, the segment [i - k, i +k], which has length 2k+1. Then, the tower at i is the midpoint. \n\nIn order for this to be valid, the segment [i -k, i +k] must be entirely within 1 to n. So for the tower at i to be the midpoint of a segment, we can choose k such that i -k >= 1 and i +k <=n. For example, the maximum possible k for position i is min(i-1, n - i).\n\nBut how does this fit into the DP approach? Well, for the DP state, dp[i] represents the number of valid ways to arrange the towers up to town i. Then, when considering town i, if there is a tower here, then it could be the midpoint of a segment that ends at i. For example, the segment could be of length 1 (k=0), which is just the tower at i. Then, the previous part (up to i-1) must be valid. Alternatively, the tower could be the midpoint of a longer segment. For example, if the segment is [i -k, i +k], then the previous part up to i -k -1 must be valid. \n\nWait, but the tower at i must be the midpoint of a segment that starts at some a and ends at i + k. But since the segment is [a, b], where b = i +k, and a = i -k. So for the segment to end at i +k, which must be <=n. But for the DP, perhaps we can think of transitions where, for each position i, if there is a tower, then we can look back to j = i -k, and check if the segment from j to i is covered by this tower. But how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the recurrence as follows: dp[i] = dp[i-1] * 1 (if there is no tower at i) plus ... something else if there is a tower. Wait, but the presence of towers is part of the configuration. So the DP needs to account for the possibilities of towers being present or not, but only considering those configurations that are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP should track the number of valid configurations for the first i towns, considering whether the i-th town is covered by a tower or not. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: think of the valid configurations as those where the set of towers forms a structure where each tower is the midpoint of some interval, and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns from 1 to n. This is similar to tiling the line with certain tiles. Each tile is a segment of length 2k+1, with the tower at the center. So, for each position i, if there's a tower, then it could be the end of a tile. So the DP recurrence would be something like:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] (if the i-th town is not built) + sum_{k} dp[i - (2k+1)] * 1 (if the i-th town is built and is the end of a tile of length 2k+1). But wait, the tile of length 2k+1 would end at position i, which is the midpoint. Wait, no. For example, a tile of length 2k+1 has a midpoint at i, so the tile spans from i -k to i +k. So the end of the tile is i +k. But for the DP to work, we need to process up to i +k. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the DP[i], which represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. To compute dp[i], we can consider that the last tile ends at i. For that, there must be a tower at position j, where j is the midpoint of a tile that ends at i. So for example, the tile could be of length 1 (j = i, and the tile is [i, i]). Or of length 3, with j = i -1, and the tile is [i-1-1, i-1+1] = [i-2, i]. But that would end at i. So the midpoint is at i-1, and the tile ends at i. Then, the previous part is up to i-2 -1 = i-3?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's think again. Suppose we have a tile that ends at position i. The tile's midpoint is at position m. The tile spans from m - k to m + k, where k is such that m +k = i. So m +k = i → k = i -m. Also, the tile starts at m -k = m - (i -m) = 2m -i. Since the start of the tile must be ≥1, 2m -i ≥1 → m ≥ (i +1)/2. Also, since m is the midpoint of the tile, which ends at i, m must be ≤i. \n\nBut for the tile to be valid, the start must be ≥1 and the end must be ≤n. However, since we're considering the DP for the first i towns, the end is exactly i. So the tile's start is 2m -i. But since the tile must be entirely within the first i towns, the start must be ≥1. \n\nMoreover, m must be the position of a tower. So for the DP[i], the number of ways where the last tile ends at i is equal to the sum over all possible m (positions of towers) such that the tile [start, i] is valid, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the first (start-1) towns. \n\nSo for each i, dp[i] = dp[i-1] (if the i-th town is not built) plus sum_{m} dp[start -1] * (ways to have the tower at m and not have any other towers in the tile?), but no, the presence of the tower at m is already considered. \n\nWait, the DP counts all valid configurations. So for the case where the last tile ends at i, the tower at m must be present. The rest of the configuration up to start-1 must be valid, and the towns in the tile (start to i) must be covered by the tower at m. However, the towns in the tile must not have any other towers that would interfere. Wait, but in the valid configurations, the towers are exactly the midpoints of the tiles. So in the tile [start, i], there is exactly one tower at m, and no other towers in this tile. So the presence of the tower at m is required, and the absence of any other towers in the tile. \n\nAh! So the problem is not just about choosing which towers to build, but ensuring that the set of towers is exactly the midpoints of the tiles. Therefore, the configuration is valid if and only if the towers form such a tiling. \n\nSo the number of valid configurations is the number of ways to tile the line from 1 to n with tiles of odd lengths, where each tile has exactly one tower at its midpoint, and no other towers in the tile. \n\nBut since each tower is built independently with probability 1/2, the total number of valid configurations is equal to the number of such tilings multiplied by 1 (since for each tiling, the towers are exactly the midpoints of the tiles, and the other towns have no towers). \n\nWait, no. Because for each tiling, the towers are exactly the midpoints. So for each tiling, there's exactly one way to choose the towers (the midpoints are present, others are absent). Thus, the total number of valid tower configurations is equal to the number of such tilings. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to tile the interval [1..n] with tiles of odd lengths. Each tile has length 2k+1, and the tiling must cover the entire interval. Then, the answer is (number of tilings) / 2^n, since each tower is present with probability 1/2, and the total number of possible configurations is 2^n. \n\nBut how to compute the number of tilings? Let's think of this as a dynamic programming problem. Let dp[i] be the number of ways to tile the first i towns. \n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty tiling). For i ≥1, dp[i] = sum_{k} dp[i - (2k+1)] for all k such that 2k+1 ≤i. \n\nWait, for each i, the last tile can be of length 1, 3, 5, etc. For example, if the last tile is of length 1 (k=0), then it contributes dp[i-1] (since the first i-1 towns are tiled, and the last tile is 1). If the last tile is of length 3 (k=1), then it contributes dp[i-3], etc. \n\nBut this seems like a standard recurrence. Let's see for small values:\n\nFor n=1: the only tiling is a single tile of length 1. So dp[1] = 1.\n\nFor n=2: the possible tiles are length 1 and 1 (two tiles). So dp[2] = dp[1] + ...? Wait, the last tile can be of length 1, so dp[2] = dp[1] + ... but can there be a tile of length 3? No, since 3>2. So dp[2] = dp[1] = 1. But wait, the tiling for n=2 is two tiles of length 1. But according to the earlier analysis, the number of tilings is 1. So yes. \n\nBut according to the example given in the problem statement: for n=2, the answer is 1/4. Which matches with the number of tilings being 1. Because 1/2^2 = 1/4. Which aligns with the first example. \n\nAnother example: for n=3. The possible tilings are:\n\n- three tiles of 1 each. \n\n- one tile of length 3. \n\nSo dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nWhich would mean the answer is 2/(2^3) = 2/8 = 1/4, which matches the second example. Because in the note for n=3, the answer is 1/4. \n\nYes! For n=3, the valid configurations are:\n\nEither towers are built in all three towns (but according to the tiling, the towers are only the midpoints. So for the tiling of three 1-length tiles, the towers are at 1, 2, 3. But in that case, the towers are present, and the signal powers can be set to 1 for each. However, according to the note, the valid configurations for n=3 are when towers are built in all three (probability 1/8) or when only tower 2 is built (probability 1/8). So total of 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches with dp[3] = 2. \n\nSo the recurrence seems correct. Therefore, the number of valid configurations is dp[n], and the answer is dp[n] / 2^n. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to computing dp[n], then computing dp[n] * inv(2^n) mod 998244353. \n\nBut how to compute dp[n] efficiently for n up to 2e5?\n\nThe recurrence is dp[i] = sum_{k} dp[i - (2k+1)] for all k where 2k+1 ≤i. \n\nBut for each i, the possible terms are for 2k+1 = 1, 3, 5,... up to i. Which means that the sum is over all odd numbers l such that l ≤i. So dp[i] = sum_{l is odd, l ≤i} dp[i - l]. \n\nBut this can be rewritten as dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-5] + ... \n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), this would take O(n^2) time if done naively. However, we can find a way to compute this more efficiently. \n\nLet's think about the recurrence. Let's note that for each i, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] - dp[i-3] ? No, perhaps not. Wait, let's think about the sum for dp[i]. \n\nAlternatively, note that the sum for dp[i] is equal to the sum for dp[i-1] plus dp[i-2] (if i-2 is ≥0). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we have for dp[i], the sum over all odd l ≤i. For example, for i, the possible l's are 1,3,..., up to i. \n\nNow, for dp[i], the sum is equal to the sum for dp[i-1] (since for i-1, the same l's are considered except when l=i, which is only possible if i is odd). \n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think of another approach. Let me consider that dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2], but I need to find a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the recurrence for dp[i]. Let's denote that for each i, the sum of dp[i - l] for all odd l ≤i. \n\nBut this can be rewritten as the sum over all j ≤i-1, where j = i - l, and l is odd. So l = i -j must be odd. Which implies that i -j is odd → j and i have different parity. So j must be of opposite parity to i. \n\nSo for each i, dp[i] is equal to the sum of dp[j] for all j < i where j and i have different parity. \n\nWait, this is interesting. Let me think: j = i - l, where l is odd. So l = i-j. So l is odd iff i-j is odd → j and i have different parity. \n\nThus, dp[i] = sum_{j < i, j and i have different parity} dp[j]. \n\nBut how does that help us compute dp[i]? Let's think of the sum for dp[i] as the total sum of dp[0..i-1] minus the sum of dp[j] where j has the same parity as i. \n\nLet's denote S[i] = sum_{k=0}^i dp[k]. Then, the sum of dp[j] for j <i and j has different parity from i is equal to S[i-1] - sum_{j <i, same parity as i} dp[j]. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the parity. Let's say i is even. Then, the sum of dp[j] for j <i with j even is sum_even, and the sum for j odd is sum_odd. So, for i even, the sum of dp[j] with j odd and <i is sum_odd. \n\nSimilarly, for i odd, the sum of dp[j] with j even and <i is sum_even.\n\nSo, if we track the sum of dp for even indices and odd indices up to i-1, then we can compute dp[i] as follows:\n\nIf i is even:\n\ndp[i] = sum_odd (sum of dp[j] for j odd <i)\n\nIf i is odd:\n\ndp[i] = sum_even (sum of dp[j] for j even <i)\n\nBut how to track sum_even and sum_odd?\n\nLet me define:\n\nsum_even[i] = sum of dp[j] for j even and j ≤i.\n\nsum_odd[i] = sum of dp[j] for j odd and j ≤i.\n\nBut since dp[0] is 1 (for i=0), which is even. Then, for each i, we can compute sum_even and sum_odd incrementally.\n\nLet me think. For each i ≥0:\n\nif i is even:\n\nsum_even[i] = sum_even[i-1] + dp[i]\n\nsum_odd[i] = sum_odd[i-1]\n\nelse:\n\nsum_odd[i] = sum_odd[i-1] + dp[i]\n\nsum_even[i] = sum_even[i-1]\n\nBut then, for the recurrence:\n\ndp[i] = (sum_odd[i-1] if i is even else sum_even[i-1]).\n\nBecause, for i even, dp[i] = sum_odd (sum of dp[j] for j odd <i, since j <i and j is odd). Similarly for i odd.\n\nYes! Because for i even, the sum of j <i with j odd is sum_odd[i-1], since sum_odd[i-1] is the sum of dp[j] for j odd up to i-1 (which is j <i). Similarly for i odd.\n\nSo this gives us a way to compute dp[i] in O(1) time per step, with precomputed sum_even and sum_odd.\n\nLet me test this with the earlier examples.\n\nBase case:\n\ndp[0] = 1.\n\nsum_even[0] = 1, sum_odd[0] = 0.\n\nFor i=1 (odd):\n\ndp[1] = sum_even[0] = 1. \n\nsum_odd[1] = sum_odd[0] + dp[1] = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nsum_even[1] = sum_even[0] = 1.\n\nFor i=2 (even):\n\ndp[2] = sum_odd[1] = 1.\n\nsum_even[2] = sum_even[1] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nsum_odd[2] = sum_odd[1] = 1.\n\nFor i=3 (odd):\n\ndp[3] = sum_even[2] = 2. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nsum_odd[3] = sum_odd[2] + dp[3] = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nsum_even[3] = sum_even[2] = 2.\n\nFor i=4 (even):\n\ndp[4] = sum_odd[3] = 3.\n\nsum_even[4] = sum_even[3] + 3 = 2 +3=5.\n\nsum_odd[4] = sum_odd[3] =3.\n\nCheck for i=4, what's dp[4]?\n\nAccording to the original recurrence, dp[4] = sum of dp[4-l] for all odd l ≤4. The odd l's are 1,3.\n\nSo dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[1] = 2 +1 =3. Which matches.\n\nYes! So this recurrence works. So the approach is:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 1.\n\nsum_even and sum_odd are maintained as we go.\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\nif i is even:\n\n   dp[i] = sum_odd_prev (sum_odd[i-1])\n\nelse:\n\n   dp[i] = sum_even_prev (sum_even[i-1])\n\nthen update sum_even and sum_odd accordingly.\n\nThis allows us to compute dp[i] in O(1) per step, leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nOnce we have dp[n], the answer is dp[n] / 2^n mod MOD.\n\nBut since MOD is 998244353, which is a prime, we can compute this as dp[n] * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute dp[0...n], using the above method.\n\n2. Compute pow(2, n, MOD), then compute its modular inverse.\n\n3. Multiply dp[n] by the inverse, mod MOD.\n\nBut how to compute inv(2^n)? Well, since MOD is prime, inv(2^n) is equal to pow(2, MOD-1 -n, MOD).\n\nAlternatively, compute inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD), then compute inv_2^n mod MOD as pow(inv_2, n, MOD).\n\nEither way.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: n=2. dp[2] is 1. 2^2 is 4. 1/4 mod MOD is 748683265 (since 1/4 mod 998244353 is 748683265). Which matches the first example.\n\nSample input 2: n=3. dp[3] is 2. 2^3 is 8. 2/8=1/4 → same as before. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: n=5. Let's compute dp[5].\n\nLet's compute step by step.\n\ndp[0] = 1.\n\ni=1 (odd): dp[1] = sum_even_prev (sum_even[0] = 1). sum_odd becomes 1.\n\ni=2 (even): dp[2] = sum_odd_prev (sum_odd[1] = 1). sum_even becomes 1 +1=2.\n\ni=3 (odd): dp[3] = sum_even_prev (sum_even[2] =2). sum_odd becomes 1+2=3.\n\ni=4 (even): dp[4] = sum_odd_prev (sum_odd[3] =3). sum_even becomes 2+3=5.\n\ni=5 (odd): dp[5] = sum_even_prev (sum_even[4]=5). So dp[5] =5. \n\nThen the answer is 5 / 2^5 = 5/32, which matches the third example's note. So this seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to compute dp[n] as per this recurrence.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute dp array up to n.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, it's manageable.\n\nWe can initialize dp as a list of size n+1.\n\nInitialize sum_even and sum_odd variables.\n\nInitially, for i=0:\n\ndp[0] = 1.\n\nsum_even = 1 (since 0 is even).\n\nsum_odd = 0.\n\nThen, for i from 1 to n:\n\nif i is even:\n\n   current_dp = sum_odd\n\nelse:\n\n   current_dp = sum_even\n\nthen, dp[i] = current_dp.\n\nthen, update sum_even and sum_odd:\n\nif i is even:\n\n   sum_even += current_dp\n\nelse:\n\n   sum_odd += current_dp\n\nWait, no. Because sum_even and sum_odd are cumulative sums. Let me think:\n\nAt each step i, after computing dp[i], we need to add it to sum_even or sum_odd, depending on the parity of i.\n\nSo for example, when i is even, after computing dp[i], we add it to sum_even. Similarly for odd.\n\nSo during the loop:\n\nfor i in 1..n:\n\n   if i is even:\n\n      dp_i = sum_odd_prev (sum_odd before this step)\n\n   else:\n\n      dp_i = sum_even_prev (sum_even before this step)\n\n   then, if i is even:\n\n      sum_even_new = sum_even_prev + dp_i\n\n      sum_odd_new = sum_odd_prev\n\n   else:\n\n      sum_odd_new = sum_odd_prev + dp_i\n\n      sum_even_new = sum_even_prev\n\nBut how to track sum_even and sum_odd? We can keep two variables, say, sum_even and sum_odd, which are updated as we go.\n\nLet me code this:\n\nInitialize:\n\ndp = [0]*(n+1)\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\nsum_even = 1  # since i=0 is even\n\nsum_odd = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n\n        # current i is even, dp[i] = sum_odd (sum of dp[j] for j odd <i)\n\n        dp_i = sum_odd\n\n    else:\n\n        # current i is odd, dp[i] = sum_even (sum of dp[j] for j even <i)\n\n        dp_i = sum_even\n\n    dp[i] = dp_i\n\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n\n        sum_even += dp_i\n\n    else:\n\n        sum_odd += dp_i\n\nWait, but for i=1 (odd), sum_even is 1 (from previous step). dp_i = sum_even (which is 1). Then, since i is odd, sum_odd increases by dp_i (1). So sum_odd becomes 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nYes. So this seems correct.\n\nOnce we have dp[n], compute the answer as dp[n] * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this for large n (up to 2e5). Let's proceed.\n\nNow, for the modular inverse part. Let's compute pow(2, n, MOD), then compute its inverse. Since MOD is a prime, the inverse is pow(2, MOD-1 -n, MOD). Alternatively, compute inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD), then inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD). Either way.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, it's manageable.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = input value.\n\nif n ==0: ... but n starts from 1.\n\nCompute dp as above.\n\nThen, numerator = dp[n]\n\ndenominator = pow(2, n, MOD)\n\nans = numerator * pow(denominator, MOD-2, MOD) % MOD\n\nprint(ans)\n\nNow, testing for n=2, dp[2] =1, denominator is 4, inverse is 748683265. 1*inv(4) mod MOD is 748683265, which matches the first example.\n\nAnother test case for n=3, dp[3] is 2, denominator is 8. 2 * inv(8) mod MOD. inv(8) is 124780544 (since 8 * 124780544 mod MOD = 1). 2*124780544 mod MOD = 249561088 mod MOD. But 2/8 is 1/4, which is 748683265. Wait, why?\n\nWait 2/8 = 1/4. So 2 * inv(8) mod MOD should be equal to inv(4) mod MOD. Let's check:\n\npow(8, MOD-2, MOD) is inv(8). 2 * inv(8) mod MOD is (2 * inv(8)) mod MOD. But 2 * inv(8) = inv(4) since 2/8 = 1/4. So yes. So the code will correctly compute 2 * inv(8) mod MOD as 748683265.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, the code will run in O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, handle the edge case when n=0? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nInitialize dp array. However, for n up to 2e5, creating a list of size n+1 is feasible.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, even with 2e5+1 elements, it's manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for n=2e5, it's okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen compute the dp array as described.\n\nBut for n=1, the code would compute dp[1] = sum_even_prev (sum_even is 1, since for i=1, which is odd, the previous sum_even is 1 (from i=0). So dp[1] = 1. The answer is 1/2^1 = 1/2 mod MOD, which is 499122177.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, for n=2, the answer is 1/4. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nBut for large n (like 2e5), the code must be efficient. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 0:\n\n    print(1) # but n >=1\n\nelse:\n\n    dp = [0]*(n+1)\n\n    dp[0] = 1\n\n    sum_even = 1\n\n    sum_odd = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), we can set their signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. The solution involves dynamic programming and modular arithmetic to efficiently compute the required probability.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation is derived based on tiling the interval [1..n] with tiles of odd lengths, where each tile has a tower at its midpoint.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Use two cumulative sums, `sum_even` and `sum_odd`, to keep track of the sum of DP values for even and odd indices respectively. This allows us to compute each `dp[i]` in constant time.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Compute the result modulo 998244353. The final probability is calculated as `dp[n] / 2^n` modulo 998244353 using modular inverse.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    n = int(input)\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    sum_even = 1  # since dp[0] is for i=0 which is even\n    sum_odd = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            current = sum_odd\n        else:\n            current = sum_even\n        dp[i] = current\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            sum_even += current\n        else:\n            sum_odd += current\n        # Keep sum_even and sum_odd within MOD?\n        # Since n can be up to 2e5, and each step adds up to previous sums, but MOD is large enough to not overflow in Python\n    \n    # Compute denominator: 2^n mod MOD\n    denominator = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    # Compute modular inverse of denominator\n    inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    # Result is (dp[n] * inv_denominator) mod MOD\n    result = (dp[n] * inv_denominator) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n2. **Cumulative Sums**: `sum_even` and `sum_odd` are used to maintain cumulative sums of `dp` values for even and odd indices, allowing efficient calculation of `dp[i]` using previously computed values.\n3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The probability is computed as `dp[n] / 2^n` using modular arithmetic. The modular inverse of `2^n` is calculated using Fermat's Little Theorem, which is efficient given the constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required probability in linear time, making it suitable for large values of `n` up to 200,000.",
