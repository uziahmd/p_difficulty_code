A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFirst, calculate how much total drink they have. That's k multiplied by l. Then, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, because each of the n friends needs nl per toast. Wait, no. Wait, for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because all friends make a toast at the same time. So for t toasts, total drink required is t * n * nl. But the total available is k*l. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So per toast, total is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. The total available is k*l. So t can't exceed (k*l) / (n * nl). But since t must be integer, it's floor division.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total slices available is c * d. So maximum toasts based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, total is n * np. So maximum toasts based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources are needed for each toast. So the maximum possible t is the minimum of the three possible values.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends. Drink total is 4*5=20ml. For each toast, each friend needs 3ml. So per toast, 3*3=9ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation. Then limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices (since 3 friends each have one slice). So 80 / 3 is 26.666, floor 26. But sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nAh, wait the sample says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but that's because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices. So for 80 slices, the number of toasts is 80 / n. Wait, in the first sample, n is 3. So 80 / 3 is 26.666, which would be 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that doesn't make sense. Wait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So per toast, there are n slices needed. So total slices available is c * d. So the maximum number of toasts based on limes is (c*d) // n. \n\nIn the first sample input, c is 10, d is 8. So 10*8=80 slices. Divided by n=3, gives 26.666, so 26. But according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that seems conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have",
