A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (bottles of drink), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend?), wait no. Wait, each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. Oh right. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, all n friends together need n * nl ml. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink for a toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends uses nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml. Because each of the n friends has their own portion.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice of lime per friend. So for one toast, each friend needs a slice. So total slices needed per toast is n slices. Because each friend uses one slice. So for t toasts, total slices needed is n * t. But the total available slices are c * d. So the maximum t based on lime slices is (c*d) // (n).\n\nSimilarly for salt. Each toast, each friend needs np grams. So per toast, total salt needed is n * np grams. So total available p grams can be divided by (n * np) to get the maximum number of toasts. So p // (n * np).\n\nBut then there's the drink. The total drink available is k * l ml. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So total toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nSo the answer is the minimum of these three values: drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts.\n\nWait, but let me check the first example. Let me see:\n\nFirst input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. Let's compute each part.\n\nDrink: 4 *5 =20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends *3 ml per toast? Wait, no. Wait, nl is 3. Each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So per toast, each friend uses 3 ml. For one toast, total is 3 *3 =9 ml. So total toasts possible from drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222... which floor to 2. Which matches the example's note. Then the limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 friends * 1 slice each. So per toast, 3 slices. 80 / 3 is 26.666, floor to 26. But the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nThe note says that in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to my calculation, the total slices is 10 *8=80. Each toast requires n slices (since each friend needs one slice). So for each toast, 3 slices. So 80 / 3 = 26.666, which would be 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, what's the problem statement again. \"each friend needs a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the total number of slices available is c*d. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n. So for the first sample, 10*8=80 slices. Divided by n=3. 80//3 is 26. So why does the note say that limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to this calculation, it's 26. So clearly, I have a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The goal is to find the minimum number of toasts that can be made based on the most limiting resource.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Drink Available**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n2. **Determine Maximum Toasts Based on Drink**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters per toast).\n3. **Calculate Total Lime Slices Available**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n4. **Determine Maximum Toasts Based on Limes**: Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend).\n5. **Calculate Maximum Toasts Based on Salt**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams per toast).\n6. **Determine the Result**: The number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the values calculated from the drink, limes, and salt.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input line as integers\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate total drink available (ml)\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\n# Calculate maximum toasts based on drink\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\n# Calculate total lime slices available\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\n# Calculate maximum toasts based on limes\ntoast_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\n# Calculate maximum toasts based on salt\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n# The answer is the minimum of the three\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (`k`) by the volume per bottle (`l`).\n2. **Drink-Based Toasts**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink, so the number of possible toasts is determined by dividing the total drink by this value.\n3. **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is found by multiplying the number of limes (`c`) by the slices per lime (`d`).\n4. **Lime-Based Toasts**: Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend), so the number of possible toasts is determined by dividing the total slices by `n`.\n5. **Salt-Based Toasts**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt, so the number of possible toasts is determined by dividing the total salt (`p`) by this value.\n6. **Result Determination**: The final result is the minimum of the three values calculated from drink, limes, and salt, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.",
