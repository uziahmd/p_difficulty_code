The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's consider the order of tasks. Since each task must be done in order, we need to process them sequentially. For each task, we need to calculate the time taken to get from the previous position to the current task's house, considering the direction (clockwise only).\n\nWait, the movement is clockwise. So, for example, if she's at house x and needs to go to house y, how much time does that take?\n\nIf x is less than y, then moving clockwise would be y - x steps. But if x is greater than y, then she has to go around the circle. For example, from house 4 to 1, it's 1 step (since moving clockwise, 4 → 1). So the general formula for moving from x to y is (y - x) mod n? Wait, no. Because if x is 3 and y is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - x + y) steps. Let me think.\n\nWait, the number of steps between x and y in clockwise direction is (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - x + y). So that's equivalent to (y - x + n) % n. But since the movement is only allowed clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nBut in the problem, the movement is along the ringroad, which is clockwise. So, for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate the distance between the previous position and the current task's position, and add that to the total time.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is house 1. So for the first task, she starts at 1 and moves to a_1. Then, for the second task, she's at a_1, and moves to a_2, etc.\n\nBut the tasks may have multiple consecutive entries. For example, if the tasks are [3, 2, 3], then the first task is at 3, then second at 2, then third at 3 again. So for each step, we need to compute the movement between previous position and current task's position.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1.\n\n- For each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   - Compute the distance from current position to a_i, add that to total time.\n\n   - Update current position to a_i.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current position and a_i?\n\nYes. For example, if current is at x, and the next is y, then the steps needed are (y - x) if y >= x, else (n - x + y). Or, equivalently, (y - x) % n if the movement is allowed only clockwise. Wait, no. Let's take an example: x=4, y=1, n=4. Then (1 -4) = -3 mod 4 is 1. Which is correct. So the formula (y - x) mod n gives the correct steps. But since in Python, the modulo operation returns non-negative results, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in Python, (-3) % 4 is 1, yes. So for any x and y, the steps needed is (y - x) if positive, else (y -x + n). Which is the same as (y -x + n) % n. So for example, x=3, y=2, n=4: (2-3 +4) =3 mod4 is 3. Which is correct. Because moving from 3 to 2 clockwise would take 3 steps: 3→4→1→2.\n\nSo the formula for the steps between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x else (y -x +n). Which can be written as (y -x +n) %n. But since in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers, perhaps (y -x) %n would give the same result. Let me check.\n\nFor example, x=3, y=2, n=4. (y -x) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the steps between x and y is (y -x) %n. But wait, what if x is 1 and y is 1? Then the steps is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the steps between current position and next position is (y -x) %n. But wait, for example, when x=1 and y=3, n=4. (3-1) mod4 is 2. Which is correct. So that's the right formula.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time =0.\n\nfor each a_i in the list:\n\n   steps = (a_i - current_pos) %n\n\n   total_time += steps\n\n   current_pos = a_i\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nSo the steps:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3.\n\nsteps = (3-1) mod4 = 2. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. steps = (2-3) mod4 = (-1) mod4 = 3. total_time becomes 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. steps = (3-2) mod4 = 1. total_time is 5+1=6. Which matches the example's output of 6. Correct.\n\nAnother example given is input 4 3, with a = [2,3,3]. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps (2-1) mod4 =1. total_time=1. current_pos=2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps (3-2) mod4=1. total_time=2. current_pos=3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps (3-3) mod4=0. total_time remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nNow, the problem is to read n and m, then the list of a_i's, and compute this sum.\n\nBut what about the constraints? n and m can be up to 1e5, which is manageable with O(m) time.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of m integers.\n\nThen, initialize current_pos as 1, total_time as 0.\n\nLoop through each a_i in the list:\n\n   compute steps = (a_i - current_pos) %n\n\n   add steps to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos to a_i.\n\nFinally, print total_time.\n\nWait, but what about the case where a_i is same as current_pos? Then steps is zero, which is correct.\n\nSo that's the plan. Now, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns the correct value. For example, (2-3) %4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and m. Then the list a.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime =0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) %n\n\n    time += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(time)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: (3-1) mod4 is 2. time is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4=3. time is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. time is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, a=[2,3,3]. The code gives 1+1+0=2. Correct.\n\nWhat about when the list is empty? Well, m is at least 1, according to the input constraints. Because m is given as 1<=m<=1e5.\n\nWait, the input says m can be 1. So for m=1, the code will process one a_i.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then steps is (1-1) mod2=0. So total is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Steps are (1-1)=0, then (2-1) mod2=1. Total 1. Which is correct: move from 1 to 2 (1 step).\n\nAnother case: n=5, a=[5,1,2]. Steps:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst step to 5: (5-1) mod5 =4. Time 4.\n\nThen from 5 to 1: (1-5) mod5 = (-4) mod5=1. So time is 4+1=5.\n\nThen from 1 to 2: 1 step. Total 5+1=6.\n\nWhich is correct: 1→5 (4 steps), 5→1 (1 step), 1→2 (1 step). Total 6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, reading input can be done via input().split(), but for large inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin. However, for the problem constraints, even with m=1e5, using split() is acceptable.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen process as per above.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the first example, the input is '4 3\\n3 2 3' which is read as n=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]. Which works.\n\nYes.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nAnother test case: when the a list has multiple same elements. Like a = [3,3,3]. Then the steps are (3-1) mod4 =2, then 0, then 0. Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task is located at a specific house, and movement between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Since the ringroad is circular, moving from a house with a higher number to a lower number (clockwise) requires wrapping around the end of the list.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses `x` and `y` on a circular road with `n` houses can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, the distance from house `x` to house `y` is `(y - x) % n`, which correctly handles both clockwise and wrap-around movements.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, iterate through each task, compute the distance to the next task's house, accumulate the total time, and update the current position after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        diff = (num - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially with large input sizes.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `current` set to 1 and initialize `total` time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location in the list:\n  - Calculate the distance from the current position to the task's house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature.\n  - Add this distance to the total time.\n  - Update the current position to the task's house.\n- **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that each movement is calculated optimally, leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular structure efficiently, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(m), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
