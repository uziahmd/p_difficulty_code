The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them sequentially.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she's currently at position current_pos. For each task in order, she needs to move from current_pos to a_i. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the time between two positions depends on their positions.\n\nWait, for example, if current_pos is 3 and the next a_i is 2, then moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going through 4, then 1, then 2. So that's (n - 3 + 1) + (2 - 1) ? Wait, no. Let's think: moving clockwise from 3 to 2 in a 4-house setup. The distance is (2 - 3 + n) % n? Or maybe (a_i - current_pos) if a_i is larger than current_pos, else (a_i + n - current_pos). Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, the number of steps between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, otherwise (a_i + n - current_pos). But wait, that's not correct. Let's take an example. If current_pos is 3, and a_i is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - current_pos + a_i) steps. For example, n=4, current_pos=3, a_i=2. Steps are 3→4 (1 step), 4→1 (2nd), 1→2 (third). Total of 3 steps. Which is (2 + 4 - 3) = 3. So yes, the formula would be (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i + n - current_pos). Alternatively, (a_i - current_pos + n) % n. Wait, because if a_i is larger than current_pos, then (a_i - current_pos) is positive, and mod n would give the same. But if a_i is smaller, then adding n and mod n gives the correct value. So the distance between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i + n - current_pos). Which can be written as (a_i - current_pos) % n, but wait, no. Because if a_i is less than current_pos, (a_i - current_pos) is negative, and mod n would give the correct positive value. For example, (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 which is 3. Which is correct. So the distance between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) mod n. But wait, in the case where current_pos is 3 and a_i is 2, the distance is 3 steps. Which is (2 -3) mod 4 = -1 mod4 = 3. Correct. So the formula for the distance is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, when a_i is equal to current_pos, the distance is zero. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the movement is along the ringroad clockwise. So the time to move from current_pos to a_i is the number of steps moving clockwise. Which is exactly (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i + n - current_pos). Which is equivalent to (a_i - current_pos + n) % n. So yes.\n\nSo for each task, we need to compute the time from the current position to the next a_i, add that to the total, and then update the current position to a_i.\n\nBut there's a catch. The tasks are given in a list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. But Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if the tasks are [3,3,3], then she doesn't need to move between them. So the total time would be the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, but if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the distance is zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1 (since she starts at house 1).\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n    compute distance between current_pos and a_i, add to total_time\n\n    set current_pos to a_i\n\nBut wait, the problem says that she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i before doing task i. So the tasks are processed in order. So the order of the a_i's is important. So for example, if the tasks are [3,2,3], then the first task is 3, then 2, then 3. So the movement is from 1 to 3 (distance 2 steps?), then from 3 to 2 (distance 3 steps?), then from 2 to 3 (distance 1 step). Total is 2+3+1=6. Which matches the first example. Let me check the first example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the a's are 3,2,3. So:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3 is (3-1) = 2 steps. So total is 2. Now current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2 is (2 -3 +4) mod4 = 3 steps. So total becomes 2+3=5. Now current position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total becomes 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this sum.\n\nBut how to handle the a_i's? Let's think about the code.\n\nRead n and m. Then read m integers as a list.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nThen loop through each ai in the list:\n\nfor ai in a_list:\n\n    distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nBut wait, wait. Because (ai - current_pos) mod n could be zero, which would mean no movement. But when ai equals current_pos, the distance is zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut let's test the second example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the a's are 2,3,3.\n\nInitial current_pos is 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2. (2-1) mod4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3. (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3. (3-3) mod4 =0. total remains 2. So output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So this approach works.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nBut what about the data types? Since n and m can be up to 1e5, and each step is O(1), the total time is O(m), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All tasks are in the same house. For example, n=2, m=3, a=[1,1,1]. The total time is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: Moving around the ring multiple times. For example, n=5, m=3, a = [1, 5, 1]. The steps would be:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 1: distance 0. total 0.\n\nSecond task is 5: distance (5-1) mod5 = 4. total is 4. current is 5.\n\nThird task is 1: distance (1-5) mod5 = ( -4 ) mod5 = 1. So total is 4+1=5. Which is correct: moving from 5 to 1 is one step clockwise (since 5 → 1 is one step).\n\nAnother example: n=5, current is 5. Next is 1. So (1-5) mod5 is -4 mod5 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the code structure in Python would be:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of m integers.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each ai in the list:\n\n   distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = ai\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operation can return negative results? Wait no, because in Python, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So for example, (2-3) %4 is ( -1 ) %4 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nYes, so (ai - current_pos) %n will give the correct distance.\n\nBut wait, let's test for ai=2, current_pos=3, n=4. (2-3) mod4 is (-1) mod4 = 3. Which is correct. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3. (3-1) mod4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2. (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3. (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1. total 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: 0. total remains 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the time is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Time is (1-1) mod2 =0, then (2-1) mod2 =1. Total 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. First step: (5-1) mod5 =4. Then (1-5) mod5 = 1. Total 5. Which is correct: 1→5 (4 steps), then 5→1 (1 step). Total 5.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the input examples, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nThe input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nSo in code, we can read the first line as n and m, then the second line as a list of integers.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the list a is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. Because the constraints say m ≥ 1? Wait, no. The input says m can be 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So m is at least 1. So the code is okay.\n\nBut let's check for m=0? Well, the problem says m is given as per input. But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So the code is okay.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nThe code returns 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3]. total is 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[5,1,5]. The steps:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 5: (5-1) mod5 =4. total=4. current=5.\n\nSecond ai is 1: (1-5) mod5 = ( -4 ) mod5 = 1. total 5. current=1.\n\nThird ai is 5: (5-1) mod5 =4. total 9. So output is 9.\n\nWhich is correct: 1→5 (4 steps), 5→1 (1 step), 1→5 (4 steps). Total 4+1+4=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task must be completed in sequence, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to move to a specific house, and she can only move clockwise. The time taken to move from one house to another is calculated based on their positions on the ringroad.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses on a ringroad can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. If Xenia needs to move from house `current_pos` to house `ai`, the distance is `(ai - current_pos) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This formula ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in sequence, compute the distance from Xenia's current position to the target house of the task, accumulate the total time, and update her current position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        diff = (num - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: Xenia starts at house 1, and we initialize `total` to accumulate the total time.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular movement. Update the total time and current position accordingly.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, resulting in an optimal O(m) time complexity.",
