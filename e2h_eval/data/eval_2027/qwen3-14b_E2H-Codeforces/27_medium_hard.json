On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some interval [l, r] in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. The goal is to choose the best interval to reverse so that when we do that, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. Since the array can be up to 2000 elements, a brute-force approach of checking all possible intervals and for each reversed array computing the LNDS would be O(n^2 * n) = O(n^3), which for n=2000 would be around 8e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the original array and how reversing a segment affects the LNDS.\n\nFirst, note that the original array's LNDS can be computed, but we are allowed to reverse any interval to maximize it. Let's think about what reversing an interval can do. For example, if there's a segment that's decreasing, reversing it might make it increasing, thus contributing more to the LNDS.\n\nBut how can we model the optimal reversal?\n\nAn alternative idea: the optimal reversal is one that connects as many 1s and 2s in a non-decreasing way. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is simply the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after the last 1. Wait, no. Actually, the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 comes before a 1. But maybe that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since the elements are only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between the number of 1s, the number of 2s, or the count of 1s followed by 2s. Wait, no. Actually, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. Or perhaps the maximum number of 1s and 2s arranged in order. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4 (the entire array is non-decreasing? No, because 2 is followed by 1. Wait, no. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1, 2, 2, which is length 3? Wait, but in the first example, after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing, hence length 4. So the maximum possible is 4.\n\nSo the original array's LNDS may be less than the maximum possible after reversal.\n\nSo, how can reversing a segment help? Well, reversing a segment can turn a decreasing part into an increasing part. For example, if the segment is [2,1], reversing it gives [1,2], which is better.\n\nBut how do we find the best such reversal?\n\nAnother thought: since the elements are only 1 and 2, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s, or something else. But when we reverse a segment, we can possibly increase the number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the array. Let's consider that the optimal reversal is one that connects two parts of the array. For example, suppose there is a block of 1s followed by a block of 2s. If there's a dip in the middle (like 1, 2, 1, 2), reversing a segment that turns the 2,1 into 1,2 would help.\n\nBut how to model this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach: the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal can be found by considering all possible pairs of positions where a reversal could connect more 1s and 2s. For example, if we can find a segment that has some 2s followed by 1s, reversing that would turn them into 1s followed by 2s, which contributes to the LNDS.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. However, given the time constraints, perhaps there's another approach.\n\nAnother observation: The maximum possible LNDS after reversal is equal to the original LNDS plus some gain from the reversal. But how to compute that gain?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: The LNDS of the modified array can be calculated by considering the original array and how the reversal affects transitions between 1s and 2s.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the best interval [l, r] such that when reversed, the number of transitions from 2 to 1 is minimized, thereby maximizing the LNDS.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think about the original array. The LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last occurrence of 1. Alternatively, it's the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but that's not correct. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 1, 2], the LNDS is 3 (like 1, 2, 2). But if you reverse [2,3], you get [1,1,2,2], which gives LNDS 4.\n\nSo the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. Wait, no. Because if there are multiple 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be formed by taking all 1s and then all 2s. But if there are 1s after some 2s, that would break the non-decreasing order.\n\nSo, the LNDS is equal to the maximum number of 1s and 2s arranged in order. Which is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, or the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that appear after the last 1. Wait, no. For example, the array [1,2,1,2] has 2 ones and 2 twos. The LNDS is 3 (like 1, 2, 2). But the count of 1s is 2, and the count of 2s after the last 1 is 1 (the last element is 2, but the first 2 is before the last 1). So perhaps the LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last occurrence of 1. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS can be found by counting the number of 1s and 2s in such a way that all 1s are before 2s. So, the maximum possible is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. But how to find that?\n\nBut maybe I'm getting off track. Let's think about the problem again. We can reverse any interval. How can that help us?\n\nSuppose the original array has some 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that interval would turn it into 1s followed by 2s. This would increase the LNDS.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal reversal is to find the maximum number of 2s followed by 1s in the original array, and reverse that segment. Each such reversal would convert a 2->1 transition into a 1->2 transition, which is good.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nCompute for each possible interval [l, r], the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in that interval. Reversing it would change those transitions into transitions from 1 to 2. So for each such reversal, the total number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the entire array would decrease by the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original interval, and add transitions from 1 to 2 in the reversed interval. But how does that affect the LNDS?\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS for the modified array is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of 2-1 transitions in the array. Because each 2-1 transition is a \"break\" in the non-decreasing sequence. For example, if the array is non-decreasing, there are zero such transitions, so the LNDS is n. If there are k such transitions, then the LNDS is n - k. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the array is [1,2,1,2]. The transitions between elements are 1→2 (ok), 2→1 (bad), 1→2 (ok). So there's one bad transition. The LNDS is 3. The total elements are 4, and 4 - 1 = 3. That matches. Another example: [1,1,2,2] has 0 bad transitions. LNDS is 4. So that's 4-0=4. Another example: [2,1,2,1]. Transitions are 2→1 (bad), 1→2 (ok), 2→1 (bad). Total of 2 bad transitions. The LNDS would be 2 (for example, 1,2, but there's also 2,2, etc. Wait, the LNDS is 2? No. For [2,1,2,1], the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 2 (like 2,2 or 1,2). Wait, but maybe there's a longer one. Let's see: indices 1,3 (values 2,2) is length 2. Or indices 2,3,4 (1,2,1) which is not non-decreasing. So yes, LNDS is 2. And n is 4, 4 - 2 = 2. So the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo the LNDS equals n minus the number of 2→1 transitions in the array. Therefore, to maximize the LNDS, we need to minimize the number of 2→1 transitions in the array.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find an interval [l, r] such that when reversed, the number of 2→1 transitions in the array is minimized. Then, the LNDS is n minus that number.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the interval [l, r] whose reversal reduces the number of 2→1 transitions as much as possible.\n\nNow, how to compute the effect of reversing a segment on the number of 2→1 transitions.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the original number of 2→1 transitions as T. When we reverse [l, r], how does T change?\n\nReversing a segment will affect the transitions inside the segment and the transitions between the segment and the rest of the array.\n\nSpecifically, the transitions that are affected are:\n\n1. The transition before l (i.e., between position l-1 and l).\n\n2. The transition after r (i.e., between position r and r+1).\n\n3. All transitions within the segment [l, r].\n\nAdditionally, the transitions inside the reversed segment will be reversed. For example, if there was a transition from a[i] to a[i+1] inside the segment, after reversal, it becomes a transition from a[r - (i - l)] to a[r - (i - l) + 1], which is the reverse of the original.\n\nSo the steps to compute the change in T when reversing [l, r] would be:\n\n- Compute the original contribution of the transitions in the segment and the adjacent transitions.\n\n- Compute the new contribution after reversal.\n\nThe difference between the original and new contribution is the delta. We want to find the interval [l, r] that gives the maximum delta (since T decreases by delta, which increases the LNDS).\n\nBut how to compute this delta efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the original transitions. Let me define the original number of 2→1 transitions in the entire array as T. When we reverse [l, r], the new number of transitions is T - old_contribution + new_contribution, where old_contribution is the number of 2→1 transitions in the original segment and adjacent transitions, and new_contribution is the same after reversal.\n\nBut perhaps I should break it down into parts.\n\nOriginal transitions:\n\n- The transitions inside the segment [l, r]. Let's call this C_in.\n\n- The transitions between l-1 and l (if l > 1), call this C_left.\n\n- The transitions between r and r+1 (if r < n), call this C_right.\n\nSo the original contribution to T is C_in + C_left + C_right.\n\nAfter reversing the segment [l, r], the new transitions inside the segment are different. Also, the transitions between l-1 and l and between r and r+1 are different.\n\nLet me think about how reversing the segment affects these parts.\n\nFirst, the transitions inside the segment [l, r]. Reversing the segment would invert the order of elements. So for each pair of consecutive elements in the original segment, their positions are reversed. For example, if the original segment had a[i] and a[i+1], after reversal, they become a[r - (i - l)] and a[r - (i - l) + 1]. So the transitions between elements inside the segment would be reversed. So the number of 2→1 transitions in the segment would be equal to the number of 1→2 transitions in the original segment. Because each original 2→1 transition becomes a 1→2 transition after reversal, and vice versa.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the original segment has elements [a, b]. If a=2 and b=1, then the original transition is 2→1, which contributes 1 to T. After reversal, it becomes [b, a] = [1, 2], which is a 1→2 transition, which doesn't contribute to T. So the contribution for this transition changes by -1 (original 1, new 0). Similarly, if the original transition is 1→2, after reversal it's 2→1, contributing 1 to T. So the number of 2→1 transitions inside the segment after reversal is equal to the number of 1→2 transitions in the original segment.\n\nSo the change in C_in is (number of 1→2 transitions in original segment) - (number of 2→1 transitions in original segment). Let's denote the original number of 2→1 transitions in the segment as C_in_2to1. The original number of 1→2 transitions in the segment is C_in_1to2. After reversal, the number of 2→1 transitions in the segment is C_in_1to2. So the delta for C_in is (C_in_1to2 - C_in_2to1).\n\nBut how to compute C_in_1to2 and C_in_2to1? Well, for the original segment, C_in_2to1 is the count of 2→1 transitions in the original segment. The total transitions inside the segment is (r - l) transitions. Each transition is either 2→1, 1→2, or same (so no contribution). So C_in_1to2 is the number of 1→2 transitions in the original segment. So the delta for C_in is (C_in_1to2 - C_in_2to1).\n\nThen, the transitions between the segment and the outside. For example, the transition between l-1 and l. Originally, it's between a[l-1] and a[l]. After reversal, the new a[l] is the original a[r], and the new a[l-1] is the same as before. So the transition between l-1 and l is now between a[l-1] and a[r]. Similarly, the transition between r and r+1 is between a[l] (original a[l]) and a[r+1].\n\nSo, for C_left and C_right, we need to compute their original contributions and their new contributions.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nOriginal C_left: if l > 1, check if a[l-1] is 2 and a[l] is 1. If so, contributes 1 to T. Otherwise 0.\n\nNew C_left: after reversal, the new a[l] is a[r], so check if a[l-1] is 2 and a[r] is 1. If so, contributes 1 to T. Otherwise 0.\n\nSimilarly for C_right: original is between a[r] and a[r+1] (if r <n). New is between a[l] (original a[l]) and a[r+1].\n\nSo the delta for C_left is (new_C_left - original_C_left), and similarly for C_right.\n\nTherefore, the total delta for reversing [l, r] is:\n\ndelta = (C_in_1to2 - C_in_2to1) + (new_C_left - original_C_left) + (new_C_right - original_C_right)\n\nBecause the original contribution was (C_in_2to1 + C_left_original + C_right_original), and the new contribution is (C_in_1to2 + new_C_left + new_C_right). So the total change in T is (new_contribution - original_contribution) = (C_in_1to2 - C_in_2to1) + (new_C_left - original_C_left) + (new_C_right - original_C_right). Therefore, the new T is original_T + delta. To minimize T, we want to find the maximum delta.\n\nWait, no. Because original_T is the original number of 2→1 transitions. After reversal, the new_T is original_T - (C_in_2to1 + C_left + C_right) + (C_in_1to2 + new_C_left + new_C_right). So the delta is (new_T - original_T) = (C_in_1to2 - C_in_2to1) + (new_C_left - original_C_left) + (new_C_right - original_C_right). But we want to find the maximum delta (since that would reduce T the most, leading to higher LNDS). Wait, no. If delta is negative, that means new_T = original_T + delta, so delta is (new_T - original_T). So to minimize new_T, we want delta to be as negative as possible. So the maximum possible reduction in T is achieved by finding the interval [l, r] that gives the minimum delta (since delta is new_T - original_T, so if delta is negative, then new_T is smaller than original_T by |delta|).\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me rephrase:\n\nWe have original_T. After reversing [l, r], the new_T is original_T + delta, where delta is the change. So to minimize new_T, we want delta to be as small as possible (possibly negative). Therefore, the best interval is the one that gives the maximum possible (original_T - new_T) = -delta. So the maximum value of (original_T - new_T) is the maximum possible reduction in T.\n\nThus, our goal is to find the maximum (original_T - new_T) over all intervals [l, r]. This is equivalent to finding the maximum value of (original_T - new_T) = -(delta) = (original_C_in_2to1 + original_C_left + original_C_right) - (C_in_1to2 + new_C_left + new_C_right).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute for each interval [l, r], the amount by which reversing it reduces T. Let's call this reduction R. Then R = original_T - new_T. We need to find the maximum R.\n\nSo how to compute R for each interval [l, r]?\n\nR = (original_C_in_2to1 + original_C_left + original_C_right) - (C_in_1to2 + new_C_left + new_C_right).\n\nBut since C_in_1to2 is the number of 1→2 transitions in the original segment, and original_C_in_2to1 is the number of 2→1 transitions in the original segment, then C_in_1to2 + original_C_in_2to1 is the total number of transitions (either 1→2 or 2→1) inside the segment. Because for each pair of consecutive elements in the segment, either it's 1→2, 2→1, or same. So the sum of C_in_1to2 and C_in_2to1 is equal to the number of transitions inside the segment that are not same elements. But perhaps that's not important.\n\nBut back to R:\n\nR = original_C_in_2to1 + original_C_left + original_C_right - C_in_1to2 - new_C_left - new_C_right.\n\nBut since C_in_1to2 = (number of transitions inside the segment that are 1→2), and original_C_in_2to1 is the number of transitions inside the segment that are 2→1. So original_C_in_2to1 - C_in_1to2 is (original_C_in_2to1 - C_in_1to2). Let me see:\n\noriginal_C_in_2to1 - C_in_1to2 = (original_C_in_2to1 - (total transitions inside segment - original_C_in_2to1 - same transitions)) ?\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, for the segment, the original_C_in_2to1 and C_in_1to2 are two separate counts. So their difference is original_C_in_2to1 - C_in_1to2.\n\nSo R can be rewritten as:\n\nR = (original_C_in_2to1 - C_in_1to2) + (original_C_left - new_C_left) + (original_C_right - new_C_right).\n\nBecause original_C_left + original_C_right - new_C_left - new_C_right = (original_C_left - new_C_left) + (original_C_right - new_C_right).\n\nSo R is the sum of three terms:\n\nTerm1: original_C_in_2to1 - C_in_1to2\n\nTerm2: original_C_left - new_C_left\n\nTerm3: original_C_right - new_C_right\n\nSo how to compute each term?\n\nTerm1: For the segment [l, r], how many 2→1 transitions are there, minus the number of 1→2 transitions.\n\nBut since the original_C_in_2to1 is the number of 2→1 transitions inside the segment, and C_in_1to2 is the number of 1→2 transitions inside the segment. So Term1 is (original_C_in_2to1 - C_in_1to2).\n\nBut note that for each transition inside the segment, if it's 2→1, it contributes +1 to Term1. If it's 1→2, it contributes -1. If it's same, it contributes 0. So overall, Term1 is equal to (number of 2→1 transitions - number of 1→2 transitions) inside the segment.\n\nWhich is the same as the sum over all transitions in the segment of (if it's 2→1: +1, if 1→2: -1, else 0).\n\nLet me think of this as a value for the segment. For example, if the segment is [2, 1], then the transition is 2→1, so Term1 is 1 - 0 = 1. If the segment is [1,2], Term1 is 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nSo Term1 can be calculated as the difference between the number of 2→1 transitions and 1→2 transitions in the segment.\n\nNow, how to compute Term1 for all possible segments [l, r] efficiently?\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps we can precompute prefix sums for certain values.\n\nLet me think. Let's define for each position i, the value of a[i]. Let's create a 2D array, but that might not be feasible. Alternatively, for each position i, we can compute the contribution to Term1 for a segment ending at i.\n\nAlternatively, for each segment [l, r], Term1 is the sum over i from l to r-1 of (if a[i] is 2 and a[i+1] is 1, then +1, if a[i] is 1 and a[i+1] is 2, then -1, else 0).\n\nSo Term1 for [l, r] can be calculated by summing these values for all positions between l and r-1.\n\nIf we can precompute a prefix array for this, then for any segment [l, r], Term1 can be computed quickly.\n\nYes! Let's define a prefix array dp where dp[i] is the sum of the values for the first i transitions. Then, for a segment [l, r], the Term1 is dp[r] - dp[l-1], where the transitions are between positions 1-2, 2-3, etc.\n\nWait, the transitions between positions i and i+1. So for the original array, there are n-1 transitions. Let's create an array trans where trans[i] is 1 if a[i] is 2 and a[i+1] is 1 (contributes +1 to Term1), -1 if a[i] is 1 and a[i+1] is 2 (contributes -1 to Term1), and 0 otherwise. Then, the Term1 for a segment [l, r] is the sum of trans[l ... r-1].\n\nSo with this, we can compute the Term1 for any segment [l, r] in O(1) time using a prefix sum array.\n\nGreat! So that's manageable.\n\nNow, Term2 and Term3 involve the transitions between the segment and the outside.\n\nFor Term2: original_C_left - new_C_left.\n\noriginal_C_left is 1 if l > 1 and a[l-1] is 2 and a[l] is 1. Else 0.\n\nnew_C_left is 1 if l > 1 and a[l-1] is 2 and a[r] is 1. Else 0.\n\nSo Term2 is original_C_left - new_C_left.\n\nSimilarly, Term3 is original_C_right - new_C_right.\n\noriginal_C_right is 1 if r < n and a[r] is 2 and a[r+1] is 1. Else 0.\n\nnew_C_right is 1 if r < n and a[l] is 2 and a[r+1] is 1. Else 0.\n\nSo Term3 is original_C_right - new_C_right.\n\nPutting it all together, for each interval [l, r], the R is:\n\nsum_trans[l..r-1] + (original_C_left - new_C_left) + (original_C_right - new_C_right)\n\nwhere sum_trans is the prefix sum array for the trans array.\n\nOnce we compute R for all possible [l, r], the maximum R is the maximum possible reduction in T, and the answer is original_T - max_R, since original_T - new_T = R. Wait, no. Because original_T is the original number of transitions, and new_T is original_T - R. Wait, earlier we said that R = original_T - new_T. So the new_T = original_T - R. Then, the LNDS is n - new_T = n - (original_T - R) = (n - original_T) + R.\n\nBut original_T is the original number of 2→1 transitions. The original LNDS is n - original_T. So the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is (original_LNDS) + R_max, where R_max is the maximum R over all intervals [l, r].\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the original_T (number of 2→1 transitions in the original array), compute R_max as the maximum R over all intervals [l, r], and then the answer is (original_LNDS) + R_max.\n\nBut original_LNDS is n - original_T. So the answer is (n - original_T) + R_max.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Compute original_T.\n\n2. Precompute the trans array and its prefix sums.\n\n3. For all possible intervals [l, r], compute R for that interval.\n\n4. Find the maximum R among all intervals.\n\n5. The answer is (n - original_T) + max_R.\n\nNow, how to compute R for all intervals [l, r]?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through all possible l and r. For each l from 1 to n, and for each r from l to n.\n\nBut with n up to 2000, that's O(n^2) = 4 million operations, which is acceptable.\n\nFor each interval [l, r], compute sum_trans[l..r-1], then compute Term2 and Term3.\n\nLet me code this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the original_T. That's the sum of all trans[i] where trans[i] is 1 for 2→1 transitions, and 0 otherwise. Wait, no. Because the trans array is built as follows: for each i from 1 to n-1, trans[i] is 1 if a[i] is 2 and a[i+1] is 1, -1 if a[i] is 1 and a[i+1] is 2, else 0. Then the original_T is the number of 2→1 transitions in the original array. Which is the sum of all trans[i] where trans[i] is 1. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, original_T can be computed as the number of positions i (from 1 to n-1) where a[i] is 2 and a[i+1] is 1. So for each i, check if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1. Count that.\n\nBut the trans array is built with 1 for those cases, -1 for 1→2 transitions, and 0 otherwise. So original_T is the sum of all trans[i] where trans[i] is 1. But that's not directly the same as the sum of trans[i]. Wait, no. Because for each transition that is 2→1, trans[i] is 1. For 1→2, trans[i] is -1. For others, 0. So the sum of all trans[i] is (number of 2→1 transitions) - (number of 1→2 transitions). Which is not the same as original_T. So original_T is the count of 2→1 transitions, which is sum over i (if trans[i] == 1 then 1 else 0).\n\nBut for our purposes, we don't need to compute original_T directly. Because the answer is (n - original_T) + max_R. However, original_T can be computed as the count of 2→1 transitions in the original array.\n\nBut how to compute original_T?\n\nWell, original_T is the number of transitions from 2 to 1. So for each i in 1..n-1, check if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1. Sum those.\n\nOnce that's done, the next step is to compute for all intervals [l, r] the R value.\n\nNow, for each [l, r], sum_trans is the sum of trans[i] for i from l to r-1. Because the trans array is for transitions between positions i and i+1. So for the segment [l, r], the transitions inside are between l and l+1, l+1 and l+2, ..., r-1 and r. So the indices in trans are l to r-1.\n\nThus, the sum_trans is prefix[r-1] - prefix[l-1], where prefix is the prefix sum of the trans array. So we need to precompute the prefix sum array.\n\nOnce that's done, for each [l, r], sum_trans = prefix[r-1] - prefix[l-1].\n\nThen, compute Term2 and Term3.\n\nTerm2: original_C_left - new_C_left.\n\noriginal_C_left is 1 if l > 1 and a[l-1] is 2 and a[l] is 1. Else 0.\n\nnew_C_left is 1 if l > 1 and a[l-1] is 2 and a[r] is 1. Else 0.\n\nSo Term2 is original_C_left - new_C_left.\n\nSimilarly for Term3: original_C_right is 1 if r < n and a[r] is 2 and a[r+1] is 1. Else 0.\n\nnew_C_right is 1 if r < n and a[l] is 2 and a[r+1] is 1. Else 0.\n\nTerm3 is original_C_right - new_C_right.\n\nThus, for each [l, r], R is:\n\nsum_trans + (original_C_left - new_C_left) + (original_C_right - new_C_right)\n\nSo for each interval [l, r], compute this R and track the maximum.\n\nOnce we have the maximum R, the answer is (n - original_T) + max_R.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example input: 4 elements [1, 2, 1, 2]\n\noriginal_T is the count of 2→1 transitions. Let's look at the transitions:\n\nBetween 1 and 2: 1→2 → no.\n\nBetween 2 and 3: 2→1 → yes. Count 1.\n\nBetween 3 and 4: 1→2 → no. So original_T is 1.\n\noriginal_LNDS is n - original_T = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nNow, the best interval is [2,3], which when reversed becomes [1,1,2,2].\n\nLet's compute R for [l=2, r=3].\n\nsum_trans is for transitions from l=2 to r-1=2. So trans[2] (which is the transition between positions 2 and 3, which is 2→1. So trans[2] is 1. So sum_trans = 1.\n\noriginal_C_left: l=2>1. a[l-1] is a[1] = 1, a[l] is a[2] = 2. So original_C_left is 0 (since a[l-1] is 1, not 2).\n\nnew_C_left: a[l-1] is 1, a[r] is a[3] = 1. So new_C_left is 0. So Term2 is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\noriginal_C_right: r=3 <4. a[r] is 1, a[r+1] is 2. So original_C_right is 0 (since a[r] is 1, not 2). new_C_right: a[l] is a[2] = 2, a[r+1] is 2. So new_C_right is 0 (since a[l] is 2 and a[r+1] is 2, so no 2→1 transition). So Term3 is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nSo R = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. Thus, the answer is (4-1) + 1 = 4, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: let's take the original_T = 1, and max_R is 1, which gives 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input:\n\nInput is 10 elements: 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1\n\nOriginal array: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n\nLet's compute original_T (number of 2→1 transitions).\n\nLooking at transitions:\n\nBetween positions 1-2: 1→1 → no.\n\nBetween 2-3: 1→2 → no.\n\nBetween 3-4: 2→2 → no.\n\nBetween 4-5: 2→2 → no.\n\nBetween 5-6: 2→1 → yes. Count 1.\n\nBetween 6-7: 1→1 → no.\n\nBetween 7-8: 1→2 → no.\n\nBetween 8-9: 2→2 → no.\n\nBetween 9-10: 2→1 → yes. Count 2.\n\nSo original_T is 2. original_LNDS is 10 - 2 = 8.\n\nIn the sample output, after reversing [3,7], the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. The number of 2→1 transitions in this array is 1 (the last transition between 9 and 10). So new_T is 1. So the answer is 10 -1 =9. Which is 8 + 1 =9. So the max_R is 1.\n\nSo according to our approach, the maximum R is 1. Let's see how that would be computed.\n\nLet's take the interval [3,7], which is l=3, r=7. Let's compute R for this interval.\n\nsum_trans for l=3 to r-1=6. The trans array entries for positions 3-6 (original transitions between positions 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7).\n\nOriginal transitions:\n\ntrans[3] (positions 3 and 4): 2→2 → 0.\n\ntrans[4] (positions 4 and 5): 2→2 → 0.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s.
