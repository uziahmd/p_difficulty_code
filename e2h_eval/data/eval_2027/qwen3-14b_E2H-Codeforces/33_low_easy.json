You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits from a sequence to make the maximum possible number. The key points are that each element in the sequence can be used at most once, and I can choose which positions to replace. The goal is to maximize the number after replacements.\n\nHmm. So the approach should be to replace the digits in the original number with the largest possible digits from the sequence s. But how to do that optimally?\n\nLet me think. The maximum number is achieved by making the leftmost digits as large as possible. So for each position in the original number, starting from the left, I want to replace it with the largest possible digit available in s, but only if that digit is larger than the current digit. Because replacing a digit with a larger one increases the overall value. But if the current digit is already larger than all available digits in s, then there's no point in replacing it. Also, once I use a digit from s, it can't be used again.\n\nWait, but the sequence s can have multiple digits. So perhaps I should sort the digits in s in descending order. Then, for each digit in the original number, starting from the left, I check if there's a digit in the sorted s that's larger than the current digit. If so, replace it with the largest possible available digit. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the sequence s in descending order. So the largest digits come first.\n2. Iterate through each digit of the original number a from left to right.\n3. For each digit in a, check if the first element in the sorted s is larger than the current digit. If yes, replace it with that element and remove that element from s. If not, leave the current digit as is.\n4. Continue until all digits in a are processed or all elements in s are used.\n\nThis way, we're greedily replacing the leftmost digits with the largest possible available digits, which maximizes the overall number.\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple digits in s that could be used? For example, if the original digit is 5, and s has 6 and 7. We should use the 7 first, then the 6. So sorting s in descending order makes sense here.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Take the original number as a string (since it's easier to process each digit).\n- Convert the sequence s into a list, sort it in descending order.\n- Then, for each character in the original string:\n   - if the sorted s list is not empty and the first element of s is larger than current digit:\n       - replace the current digit with that element, and remove the first element from s.\n   - else:\n       - leave the digit as is.\n- Finally, output the resulting string.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? The problem says that the original number doesn't have leading zeros, and the output shouldn't either. However, since the original number doesn't have leading zeros, and we are replacing digits with digits from s. But if the first digit is replaced with a zero, that would introduce leading zeros. Wait, but the original first digit is non-zero, and the s digits are digits. So if the original first digit is, say, 1, and the sorted s starts with 0, then replacing it would make the first digit 0. Which is invalid. But the problem says that the output shouldn't have leading zeros. So how to handle that?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the original number a doesn't have leading zeros. However, when replacing digits, we can't have leading zeros. So for example, if the original number is '1024' and the s is '010', then the sorted s would be ['1','0','0'].\n\nSo for the first digit (1), we check if the first element of s (1) is larger than current digit (1). Since it's equal, we don't replace. Then, the next digits. But in the example given, the input is '1024' and s is '010'. The output is '1124'.\n\nWait, in that example, the sorted s is ['1','0','0']. So for the first digit (1), the first element in s is 1. Since it's equal, we don't replace. Then, for the second digit (0), the first element of s is 1. Which is larger than 0. So we replace it with 1. Then the s becomes ['0','0']. Then the third digit is 2. The first element of s is 0, which is smaller than 2. So no replacement. Fourth digit is 4, same as before. So the result is 1124. Which matches",
    "response": "To solve the problem of replacing digits in a number to maximize its value, we can use a **greedy approach**. The idea is to replace the leftmost digits with the largest possible available digits from the sequence `s`, ensuring that the resulting number remains as large as possible.\n\n---\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Sort the sequence `s` in descending order**: This allows us to always pick the largest available digit for replacement.\n2. **Iterate over each digit of the number `a` from left to right**: We want to make the number as large as possible starting from the most significant digit.\n3. **Replace a digit only if the current digit in `a` is smaller than the largest available digit in `s`**: This ensures that we are increasing the number's value at the earliest possible positions.\n4. **Remove the used digit from `s` after replacement**: Each digit in `s` can be used at most once.\n5. **Construct the final result string** after processing all digits.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number efficiently and avoid unnecessary replacements.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Case Handling\n\n- **Leading zeros**: Since the input number `a` does not have leading zeros, and we only replace digits with larger or equal values, there is no scenario where a leading zero would be introduced.\n- **Empty `s` or all digits in `s` are smaller than those in `a`**: In such cases, no replacement is needed, and the original number is returned unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Python Implementation\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    a = input[0]\n    s = list(input[1])\n    \n    # Sort s in descending order to prioritize larger digits\n    s.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    result = []\n    s_ptr = 0\n    \n    for ch in a:\n        if s_ptr < len(s) and s[s_ptr] > ch:\n            result.append(s[s_ptr])\n            s_ptr += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(ch)\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input:\n```\n1024\n010\n```\n\n#### Output:\n```\n1124\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n- `s = ['0', '1', '0']` → sorted descending: `['1', '0', '0']`\n- Replace the second digit (0) with '1' → becomes `1124`.\n\n---\n\nThis solution runs in **O(n log m)** time due to sorting the sequence `s`, where `n` is the length of `a` and `m` is the length of `s`. It is efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 10⁵ digits).",
