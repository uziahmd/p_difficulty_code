Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and perform multiple substitution queries. Then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. But directly performing substitutions for each query might be inefficient, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. So if I process each substitution naively by replacing every occurrence of di in the string with ti, that would be O(n * len(s)) which could be 1e10 operations, which is way too slow. That's not going to work.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Hmm. Let's think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But substitutions are done in order, so later substitutions can affect earlier ones. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's become '11's. So the order of processing queries matters.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each query is processed in the order given. So the substitutions are applied sequentially. So if we have a query that replaces 'd' with some string, then any subsequent queries that replace other digits would affect the current state of the string. However, if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can find a way to model the transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the substitutions as a mapping from each digit to its replacement. But since substitutions can overwrite previous mappings, we need to track the current mapping for each digit. But when you replace a digit, say 'd', with a string, then any future replacements of other digits will not affect the existing 'd's unless they are replaced again. Wait, no. Once you replace 'd' with some string, that string's digits are part of the current string, and if a later query replaces one of those digits, then those will be replaced.\n\nBut trying to model this directly seems complicated. Let me think: for example, suppose we have a sequence of substitutions. Each substitution replaces all occurrences of a certain digit in the current string. So the problem is similar to building a tree of substitutions, where each digit may be replaced by another string, which may contain other digits that are later replaced.\n\nBut how can we compute the final value efficiently? Since the string can be very large, we can't store it as a string. Instead, we need to compute the value modulo 1e9+7, but in a way that allows us to handle substitutions.\n\nLet me think about the following approach: instead of keeping track of the actual string, keep track of the value modulo MOD, and also for each digit, track what it represents in terms of the current value. But since substitutions can change digits into other strings, perhaps we need to model for each digit, a function that maps it to its current value. However, since substitutions are applied in order, maybe we can process them in reverse order, building up a mapping from each digit to its replacement.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some substitution problems. Let's consider that each substitution replaces a digit d with some string t. If we process the substitutions in reverse order, then for each substitution, we can compute how replacing d affects the value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the final result as a combination of the initial digits and the substitutions. Let's imagine that each digit in the original string is transformed through a series of substitutions. For example, if the original string has a digit 'd', and during the queries, 'd' is replaced by t1, then later t1's digits may be replaced by other strings, etc. So each original digit in the initial string is transformed into some string, and the entire final string is the concatenation of these transformed strings.\n\nBut how can we compute the final value? The key is to compute for each original digit, what is the contribution to the final number when all substitutions are applied. But since substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution can affect any digit, we need to track for each digit, what it is replaced by after all substitutions.\n\nWait, but if substitutions are done in order, then when you process a query \"d -> t\", you replace all current instances of d in the string with t. However, if after that, another substitution replaces some digit in t, then those replacements would affect the string. So the order of substitutions is crucial.\n\nSo, for example, if we have two substitutions:\n\nFirst, replace 2 with 3.\n\nThen replace 3 with 4.\n\nThe original string '2' would first become '3', then '4'.\n\nBut if the substitutions were reversed, the original '2' would remain as 2, because the first substitution would be replacing 3 (which isn't present yet) with 4, then the second substitution replaces 2 with 3, which becomes 3, but then no further substitution.\n\nSo the order of",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly applying each substitution to the string is infeasible due to potential performance issues with large input sizes. Instead, we can use a more efficient approach by maintaining a mapping for each digit and calculating the resulting value using modular arithmetic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Digits**: Maintain a dictionary that maps each digit to its current replacement string. This allows us to track how each digit evolves through the substitutions.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo $10^9 + 7$, we use modular arithmetic to keep the numbers manageable and avoid overflow.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each query, update the mapping for the digit being replaced. After all queries, compute the final value by iterating over the original string and using the mappings to build the result incrementally.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize the mapping: each digit maps to itself\n    # We'll represent the mapping as a dictionary where each key is a digit (char)\n    # and the value is the corresponding string (could be empty)\n    # However, since substitutions are applied in order, we need to process them\n    # in reverse order to build up the value correctly.\n    # Wait, no.
