There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament with certain rules. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, the challenge is to model this and find the maximum possible games for the winner given n players.\n\nFirst, let's think about the examples given. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays against player 3, the first game was against player 2. So the winner has 1 game already, and player 3 has 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that works. For n=4, the answer is 2. The example says that the optimal way is to have two rounds: first (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4), then the winners play. So the winner plays two games. If you tried to make the winner play three games, that would require three rounds. But how? Let's think. For example, if the winner plays three games, then he needs to have three matches. But each time, the opponents must have a game count differing by at most one. Let's think about the structure.\n\nThis feels similar to building a binary tree. In a standard knockout tournament, the winner plays log2(n) games. But here, the constraints on the matches might require a different structure. Wait, but the problem allows the organizers to arrange the grid optimally. So we need to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can have, given the constraints.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time he plays, he must have opponents that have a game count differing by at most one. So for the first game, the opponent has 0 games. Then, after winning, he has 1 game. The next opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. But since the winner has to reach as many games as possible, perhaps each time he plays against someone who has the same number of games as him. Or maybe not.\n\nWait, the maximum number of games would be achieved when each time the winner plays against an opponent who has the same number of games as him. Because that way, each game increases his count by 1. For example, if he plays against someone with same games, then after winning, he has one more game than before. So, how can that happen?\n\nLet's think of the structure. For the winner to play k games, he must have defeated k opponents. Each of those opponents must have been in a path where they had to play a certain number of games before facing him.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the winner's path. Each time he plays, the opponent must have a game count that is either equal to his current count or one less. Because the difference can't exceed one. So, for example, if the winner has played m games so far, the next opponent must have played m-1, m, or m+1 games. But since the opponent is still in the tournament, they must have won all their previous games. So how does this structure work?\n\nLet me think about the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can play k games. Then, the answer for the problem is the maximum k such that f(k) ≤ n.\n\nSo, what is f(k)? Let's try to find a recurrence relation. For the winner to play k games, he must have played in the first game (against someone with 0 games). Then, in the second game, he must have played against someone who has either 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the optimal way is to have each opponent have the same number of games as the winner before the match. So, for each step, the winner's opponent has the same number of games as him. That way, each time he plays, he can increase his count by 1.\n\nBut how does that translate into the number of players required?\n\nFor example:\n\nk=1: requires 2 players. f(1)=2.\n\nk=2: the winner plays two games. The first game against one player (so 2 players). Then, the second game against someone who has played once. How can that happen? Well, that someone must have had a path where they played once. So, for the second game, the winner has to have another player who has played once. So, the minimal case would be that the winner plays against someone who has already played once. So, that requires that there are two players in that subtree. So, for the first game, the winner has 1 game. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have 1 game. So that requires that there are two players in the opponent's path. So, total players would be 2 (for the first game) + 2 (for the second game's opponent's path) = 4? But wait, the example says that for n=3, the answer is 2. Which suggests that for k=2, f(k) is 3. So my previous reasoning is conflicting with that. Let me think again.\n\nIn the case of n=3, the winner plays two games. How is that possible? First, he plays against player 2 (game 1). Then, he plays against player 3. Now, player 3 has zero games. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So the minimal number of players for k=2 is 3. So f(2) = 3.\n\nSo how can we model f(k)?\n\nLet's think recursively. To have the winner play k games, he must have played in the k-th game. Let's say that in the k-th game, he faces an opponent who has played (k-1) games. Because before that game, the winner has played (k-1) games. So the opponent must have played (k-1) games. But how does that opponent get to that point?\n\nAlternatively, for the winner to have played k games, he must have defeated k opponents. Each of these opponents must have a certain number of games. Let's think of the structure as a tree. For example, the first game is against someone with 0 games. The second game is against someone who has 0 or 1 games. Let's say the opponent has 1 game. That opponent must have played one game before. So, that requires that there's a subtree of players that allows that.\n\nAlternatively, think of f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, he must have played in the k-th game. For that, the opponent in the k-th game must have played (k-1) games. Because the winner has played (k-1) games before that. So the difference between them is 0. So the opponent must have played (k-1) games. Therefore, the minimal number of players required would be f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the winner's path requires that he has to have an opponent who has played (k-1) games. So that opponent's path requires f(k-1) players. And the winner's path up to the (k-1)th game requires f(k-1) players? Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the winner's path to the (k-1)th game requires that he has played (k-1) games. So, to get to that point, he must have a certain number of players. But the opponent in the k-th game must have a path that requires f(k-1) players. However, the winner's path up to the (k-1)th game is part of the same structure. So, the total number of players needed for the winner to play k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-1) - 1 ?\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think about the base cases.\n\nFor k=1: f(1) = 2.\n\nFor k=2: the winner has to play two games. The first game is against one player (2 players). The second game is against an opponent who has played one game. To have that opponent, you need f(1) players. So total players is 2 (the winner's initial path) plus f(1) (the opponent's path) minus 1 (since the winner is part of both paths?), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the opponent in the second game must have played one game. So that requires that there's a subtree of f(1) players. But the winner's first game is part of the same structure. So the total number of players is f(k-1) + f(k-1) - 1? Because the winner is part of both.\n\nWait, for example, when k=2, the opponent's path is f(1) = 2 players (the opponent and someone else). The winner's path is also f(1) players. But the winner is part of both. So total players would be 2 + 2 - 1 = 3. Which matches the case where n=3 gives k=2. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the recurrence would be f(k) = 2 * f(k-1) - 1. Let's check this:\n\nFor k=1: f(1)=2.\n\nk=2: 2*2 -1 =3. Correct.\n\nk=3: 2*3-1=5. So for f(3)=5. Let's see if that's correct. For the winner to play 3 games, the third game's opponent must have played 2 games. So that requires f(2) =3 players for that opponent's path. The winner's path up to 2 games is f(2) =3 players. So total players is 3 +3 -1 =5. Which makes sense.\n\nSo for k=3, the minimal players is 5. So for n=5, the answer is 3. Let's see.\n\nNow, for the example input of n=4, the output is 2. Because f(2)=3, and f(3)=5. Since 4 is between 3 and 5, the maximum possible is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where f(k) ≤n. And f(k) is defined by the recurrence f(k) = 2*f(k-1) -1, with f(1)=2.\n\nWait, but what's the closed-form formula for f(k)? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the recurrence f(k) = 2*f(k-1) -1. Let's compute some terms:\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = 2*2 -1 =3\n\nf(3) = 2*3 -1=5\n\nf(4)= 2*5-1=9\n\nf(5)=17, etc.\n\nThis looks familiar. It's f(k) = 2^k -1 +1? Wait:\n\nWait 2^1 +1 =3? No. Let me think:\n\nWait, f(1) = 2 = 2^1 + 0.\n\nf(2)=3 = 2^1 + 1.\n\nf(3)=5= 2^2 +1.\n\nf(4)=9= 2^3 +1.\n\nf(5)=17= 2^4 +1.\n\nAh! So for k ≥1, f(k) = 2^{k-1} +1 ?\n\nWait for k=1, 2^{0} +1= 1+1=2 yes.\n\nk=2, 2^1 +1=3 yes.\n\nk=3, 2^2 +1=5 yes. k=4: 2^3 +1=9 yes. So yes. So the general formula is f(k) = 2^{k-1} +1 ?\n\nWait, but let's check for k=3. 2^(k-1) +1 = 4 +1 =5. Which matches. So the recurrence f(k) = 2*f(k-1) -1 gives us f(k) = 2^{k-1} +1 ?\n\nYes. Let's see:\n\nWe can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is f(k) = 2*f(k-1) -1, with f(1) = 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f_h(k) = C * 2^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is -1, let's assume a constant solution f_p(k) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: A = 2*A -1 → A =1.\n\nSo the general solution is f(k) = C*2^k +1. Apply initial condition f(1) = 2:\n\n2 = C*2^1 +1 → 2C +1 = 2 → 2C=1 → C=1/2.\n\nThus, f(k) = (1/2)*2^k +1 = 2^{k-1} +1. Yes! So the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, for each k, the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games is 2^{k-1} +1. So the maximum k for which 2^{k-1} +1 ≤n is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's check for n=3. 2^{k-1}+1 ≤3 → 2^{k-1} ≤2 → k-1 ≤1 →k≤2. So answer is 2. Which is correct.\n\nFor n=4, 2^{k-1}+1 ≤4. Let's see for k=2: 3 ≤4. For k=3: 2^{2}+1=5>4. So answer is 2. Correct.\n\nFor n=5, 2^{2}+1=5, so k=3. So answer is 3.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where 2^{k-1} +1 ≤n.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where n is not exactly of the form 2^{k-1}+1?\n\nFor example, take n=6. The maximum k is 3, since 2^{2} +1 =5 ≤6. The next value is 2^3+1=9>6. So answer is 3. But what's the actual maximum number of games possible?\n\nLet's think. For k=3, the minimal players is 5. So with n=6, we can have the winner play 3 games. How?\n\nWell, the tournament has 6 players. The winner's path requires 5 players, but there's one more player. How is that handled? Well, the extra players can be arranged in the tournament in such a way that they don't interfere with the winner's path. For example, the winner's path would be as follows:\n\nFirst, the winner plays against someone (game 1). Then, in the second game, he plays against someone who has played once. Then, in the third game, against someone who has played twice. So, the minimal players is 5, but with 6 players, there's an extra player. But the problem is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play, so even if there are more players, as long as the minimal required is met, the answer is k.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest k where 2^{k-1} +1 ≤n.\n\nBut how do we compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nWe can compute k by checking for the maximum value such that 2^{k-1} +1 ≤n.\n\nLet me think about solving for k:\n\nWe can rearrange the inequality:\n\n2^{k-1} +1 ≤n → 2^{k-1} ≤n-1 → k-1 ≤ log2(n-1) → k ≤ floor(log2(n-1)) +1.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we can compute this via binary search.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute k as the floor of log2(n-1) +1.\n\nBut let's test this with examples.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. n-1=3. log2(3) is ~1.58, floor is 1. So k is 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. n-1=2. log2(2)=1, floor is 1. k=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2. n-1=1. log2(1)=0. k=0+1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5. n-1=4. log2(4)=2. So k=2+1=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6. n-1=5. log2(5) is ~2.32. floor is 2. k=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for k is floor(log2(n-1)) +1.\n\nBut how to compute this in Python for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nBut wait, there's a problem. For example, when n=2^{m} +1, then log2(n-1) is m, so k is m+1. For example, n=5 (2^2+1). log2(4)=2. k=3. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if n is exactly 2^{k-1} +1? Then the answer is k.\n\nBut what if n is larger than 2^{k-1} +1 but less than 2^k +1? For example, n=6, which is between 5 (2^2+1) and 9 (2^3+1). The answer is k=3.\n\nSo the maximum k is the largest integer such that 2^{k-1} +1 ≤n.\n\nSo how to compute k?\n\nWe can compute it by finding the maximum k where 2^{k-1} +1 <=n.\n\nLet me think of binary search approach. For example, the possible values of k can be from 1 up to log2(n) +1. But since n can be up to 1e18, the maximum k is around 60, because 2^60 is about 1e18.\n\nSo for example, for n up to 1e18, the maximum k is 60.\n\nSo we can iterate k from 1 upwards until 2^{k-1}+1 exceeds n.\n\nAlternatively, compute the maximum k where 2^{k-1} +1 <=n.\n\nLet me think of code steps:\n\nGiven n, compute the maximum k such that 2^{k-1} +1 <=n.\n\nBut for n=1, but according to input constraints, n is at least 2.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nWe can start with k=1, and check 2^{k-1}+1 <=n. Then increment k until it's no longer true.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the maximum k is about 60, so this is feasible.\n\nBut how to compute 2^{k-1}?\n\nBut for k=60, 2^59 is about 5.7e17. For n up to 1e18, 2^59+1 is 5.7e17 +1, which is less than 1e18. So for k=60, 2^59+1 <=n (if n is 1e18).\n\nBut for k=60, 2^{59} +1 is 576460752303423489. For n=1e18, which is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is larger than 5.7e17. So yes.\n\nSo the code could be:\n\nInitialize k=1. While 2^{k} +1 <=n? Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nWait the formula is 2^{k-1} +1 <=n.\n\nSo for each k, compute 2^{k-1} +1 and check if it's <=n.\n\nLet me think of code:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor k in 1 to ...:\n\n    if 2^{k-1} +1 <=n:\n\n        max_games =k\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nreturn max_games\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut in code, we can compute it with a loop. Let's see:\n\nInitialize k=1.\n\nWhile True:\n\n    current = 2^{k-1} +1\n\n    if current <=n:\n\n        k +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nThen, the maximum is k-1.\n\nWait, but for example, for n=2:\n\nk starts at 1. current is 2^0 +1=1+1=2 <=2 → yes. So increment k to 2.\n\nCheck for k=2: current is 2^1 +1=3. Is 3 <=2? No. So break. So the maximum is k-1=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example, n=3. For k=1: 2^0 +1=2 <=3 → yes. k becomes 2. Check for k=2: 2^1 +1=3 <=3 → yes. k becomes 3. Check for k=3: 2^2 +1=5 <=3? No. Break. So maximum is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example, n=5. For k=1: yes. k=2: yes. k=3: 2^2+1=5 <=5 → yes. k=4: 2^3+1=9 <=5? No. So maximum is 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\ndef max_games(n):\n\n    if n <2:\n\n        return 0  # but input is >=2\n\n    k =1\n\n    while True:\n\n        current = (1 << (k-1)) +1  # 2^{k-1} +1\n\n        if current <=n:\n\n            k +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            break\n\n    return k-1\n\nBut wait, for very large k, 1 << (k-1) can be very big. But for n up to 1e18, the maximum k is about 60, so 1<<60 is manageable in Python as integers.\n\nBut let's check for n=1e18.\n\nLet's compute what is the maximum k such that 2^{k-1} +1 <=1e18.\n\nWe can approximate 2^{k-1} ≈1e18 → k-1 ≈ log2(1e18) ≈ 60 (since 2^60 is approx 1.15e18). So for k-1=59, 2^59 is 5.76e17, adding 1 gives 5.76e17 +1 which is <=1e18. So k=60 would be allowed. Then for k=60, current is 2^59+1 <=1e18. Then increment to k=61. current is 2^60 +1 =1.15e18 +1 which is larger than 1e18. So the maximum k is 60.\n\nSo the code returns 60.\n\nBut in code, how to handle the calculation of 2^{k-1}?\n\nBut in Python, shifting is okay.\n\nBut for k up to 60, 1 << (k-1) is manageable.\n\nBut what about when k is 60, 1 << 59 is 576460752303423488. Adding 1 gives 576460752303423489.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nBut let's test for the sample inputs:\n\nSample input 2: n=3. The code returns 2, which is correct.\n\nSample input 4: n=10. Let's see:\n\nLet's compute for k=1,2,3,4,5:\n\nk=1: current=2^0 +1=2 <=10 → yes. k=2.\n\nk=2: current=2^1+1=3 <=10 → yes. k=3.\n\nk=3: 2^2+1=5 <=10 → yes. k=4.\n\nk=4: 2^3+1=9 <=10 → yes. k=5.\n\nk=5: 2^4+1=17 <=10? No. So break. return 5-1=4. Which matches the sample output of 4 for input 10.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nBut wait, the sample input for 10 gives output 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is exactly 2^{k-1} +1?\n\nLike n=5. Then the code returns k=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example, n=9. Then 2^{3} +1 =9. So the code will check for k=4: current is 2^3 +1=9. So yes, increment k to 4. Then check for k=4: current is 2^3+1=9? No, for k=4, current is 2^{4-1}+1= 8+1=9. So yes. Then increment to k=5. Now current is 2^4 +1=17. Which is larger than 9. So return 5-1=4. Which is correct. So for n=9, the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's think: for k=4, the minimal players is 2^{3} +1=9. So the answer is 4. So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase n=2: returns 1.\n\nCase n=3: returns 2.\n\nCase n=4: returns 2. Because for k=3, 2^2+1=5>4. So the maximum is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=5, returns 3.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n as integer. Then compute the maximum k as per the above loop.\n\nBut wait, for n=1, but the input constraints say n≥2.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for very large numbers, like 1e18, the loop is acceptable as it runs up to 60 steps.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen:\n\nk = 1\n\nwhile True:\n\n    current = (1 << (k-1)) + 1\n\n    if current <= n:\n\n        k +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nreturn k-1\n\nBut in Python, for very large exponents, 1 << (k-1) can be calculated as 2^(k-1).\n\nBut what if k-1 is up to 60? That's manageable.\n\nBut let's code this.\n\nBut for example, when k is 1, 1 << 0 is 1. So current is 2.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    k = 1\n\n    while True:\n\n        # compute 2^{k-1} +1\n\n        # but for k=1, 2^0 +1 = 2\n\n        current = (1 << (k-1)) + 1\n\n        if current <= n:\n\n            k +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            break\n\n    print(k-1)\n\nWait, but let's test this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3.\n\nLoop steps:\n\nInitially k=1.\n\ncurrent = 1 << 0 +1 =1+1=2 <=3 → yes. k becomes 2.\n\ncurrent for k=2: 1 <<1 +1= 2+1=3 <=3 → yes. k becomes 3.\n\ncurrent for k=3: 1<<2 +1=4+1=5 <=3? No. break. return k-1=3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10.\n\nLoop steps:\n\nk starts at 1.\n\ncurrent=2 → yes. k=2.\n\ncurrent=3 → yes. k=3.\n\ncurrent=5 → yes. k=4.\n\ncurrent=9 → yes. k=5.\n\ncurrent= 1<<4 +1 = 16+1=17 >10. break. return 5-1=4. Correct.\n\nSample input 4: output is 2. Let's see for n=4.\n\nk=1: current=2 <=4 → yes. k=2.\n\ncurrent=3 <=4 → yes. k=3.\n\ncurrent=5 <=4? No. break. return 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: n=2. returns 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5. returns 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=9. returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about n=1?\n\nBut input is n≥2.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nBut let's test for n=1. But the problem says n≥2.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nBut wait, what about n=1? Well, the code would have if n<2: print 0. But the input constraints say n≥2. So the code is okay.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut let's check for n=6. The code returns k-1=3. Because for k=4, current is 9>6. So the maximum is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be reduced to finding the maximum number of games `k` such that the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games does not exceed the given number of players `n`. This minimum number of players required for `k` games can be derived using a recurrence relation, which simplifies to a formula involving powers of two.\n\nThe formula for the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is `2^(k-1) + 1`. We need to find the largest `k` such that this value is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        current = (1 << (k - 1)) + 1\n        if current <= n:\n            k += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    print(k - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is less than 2, the output is 0, but since the problem constraints specify `n ≥ 2`, this check is primarily for robustness.\n3. **Loop to Determine Maximum Games**: The loop calculates the minimum number of players required for increasing values of `k` using the formula `2^(k-1) + 1`. This is efficiently computed using bit shifting (`1 << (k - 1)` which is equivalent to `2^(k-1)`).\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until the calculated number of players exceeds `n`, at which point the loop breaks and the maximum valid `k` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using a logarithmic number of iterations relative to the value of `n`, ensuring it handles the upper constraint of `n` up to 10^18 efficiently.",
