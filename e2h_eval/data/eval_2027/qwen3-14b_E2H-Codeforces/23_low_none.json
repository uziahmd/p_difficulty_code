            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and I have to output the minimum number of extra tiles needed.\n\nSo the task is to check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If not, figure out how many more tiles she needs to draw to make it possible.\n\nLet me think about the steps required.\n\nFirst, for the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then find the minimal number of tiles to add so that after adding those tiles, there exists a mentsu.\n\nBut since the problem allows her to draw any tiles, including duplicates, we need to find the minimal steps required.\n\nLet me think about possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The three tiles already form a mentsu. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Not. Then, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to get a mentsu.\n\nSo for each possible scenario, how can we compute that?\n\nLet me think about the possible ways to form a mentsu with the existing tiles plus some new ones.\n\nFirst, check if the current tiles can be part of a triplet or sequence when adding some tiles.\n\nBut since the problem allows adding any number of tiles, but wants the minimal, perhaps we can consider all possibilities for forming a triplet or sequence, and compute the minimal required additions.\n\nLet me break it down into checking for possible triplet and possible sequences.\n\nFirst, let's check for triplet (koutsu). For that, we need three identical tiles. So the current three tiles may have two of the same, and need one more. Or maybe only one of a tile, needing two more. Or none, needing three.\n\nBut wait, the current three tiles may have multiple counts. For example, if the three tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m], then to form a triplet, you need another 1m (so one more tile). Or maybe form a sequence?\n\nBut for the triplet case, the current three tiles may have counts of a certain tile. Let's think:\n\nFor each tile type in the current hand, count how many there are. For example, if there are two of a certain tile, then you need 1 more to make a triplet. If there's one, you need two. If zero, then three.\n\nBut the current hand has three tiles. So for example, if all three are the same, then already a triplet. So answer is 0.\n\nBut if the current tiles are two of one and one of another, then to form a triplet, you need to add one more of the first tile. But maybe there's a better way with sequences.\n\nBut the problem requires that after adding some tiles, there exists at least one mentsu. So we need to check all possibilities of forming either a triplet or a sequence, and find the minimal steps required.\n\nNow, for sequences (shuntsu), which require three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for example, 1s, 2s, 3s.\n\nSo given the three tiles, maybe they can form a sequence with adding some tiles. For example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding 3s would make a sequence. So that's one tile.\n\nBut how do I check all possibilities for possible sequences?\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, for the current three tiles, check if they already form a triplet or a sequence. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then for each possible way to form a triplet or a sequence, compute how many tiles are needed, and take the minimal among all possibilities.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck for existing mentsu. If exists, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal steps required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo how to check for existing mentsu?\n\nFor triplet: check if all three tiles are same. For example, '9m 9m 9m' → yes.\n\nFor sequence: check if they are three consecutive numbers in same suit. For example, '1s 2s 3s' → yes. But also, the order doesn't matter. So the three tiles must be in same suit, and their numbers are consecutive. So for example, 3s, 2s, 1s is a sequence.\n\nSo for the existing three tiles, check if they can form a triplet or sequence.\n\nIf they can, then answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for the case where they don't have a mentsu, what's the minimal steps?\n\nWe need to find the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the current hand already forms a mentsu and, if not, calculating the minimum additional tiles required to form one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current three tiles already form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence). If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Check for Triplet Potential**: If the current tiles do not form a mentsu, evaluate how many additional tiles are needed to form a triplet. This involves counting occurrences of each tile type and determining how many more are needed to complete a triplet.\n3. **Check for Sequence Potential**: Evaluate how many additional tiles are needed to form a sequence. This involves checking all possible sequences that can be formed with the current tiles and determining the minimum additions required.\n4. **Determine Minimum Tiles**: Compare the minimum tiles required for forming a triplet and a sequence, and return the smallest value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef is_triplet(tiles):\n    return tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]\n\ndef is_sequence(tiles):\n    # Check if all suits are the same\n    suit = tiles[0][1]\n    for t in tiles:\n        if t[1] != suit:\n            return False\n    # Extract numbers\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n    return nums[0] + 1 == nums[1] and nums[1] + 1 == nums[2]\n\ndef count_tiles(tiles):\n    counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for t in tiles:\n        counts[t] += 1\n    return counts\n\ndef min_draws_for_triplet(tiles):\n    counts = count_tiles(tiles)\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n    # Check for each tile type how many are needed to form a triplet\n    for tile in counts:\n        needed = 3 - counts[tile]\n        if needed < min_draws:\n            min_draws = needed\n    return min_draws\n\ndef min_draws_for_sequence(tiles):\n    # Group by suit\n    suits = defaultdict(list)\n    for t in tiles:\n        suits[t[1]].append(int(t[0]))\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n    # For each suit, check possible sequences\n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        # Sort the numbers\n        nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n        # Try to find all possible sequences that can be formed with these numbers\n        # We need to find the minimal tiles to add to form a sequence of 3 consecutive numbers\n        # For example, if we have [1, 2], need 3 (add 1)\n        # If we have [1, 3], need 2 (add 1)\n        # If we have [1, 4], need 2 or 3 (add 1)\n        # So for all possible combinations of 2 numbers, check what's the minimal to complete\n        # But since we have only 3 numbers, let's check all possibilities\n        # Let's consider all possible triplets that can be formed with the existing numbers and see how many are missing\n        # Generate all possible sequences that can include the existing numbers\n        # For example, if existing numbers are [1, 2], possible sequences are [1,2,3], [2,3,4], etc.\n        # But we need to find the minimal draws required\n        # To cover all possibilities, we can generate all possible sequences that can be formed with the existing numbers\n        # Let's collect all unique numbers in the current suit\n        unique_nums = set(nums_sorted)\n        # For each possible start in 1-7 (since 1,2,3 is the first sequence, 7,8,9 the last)\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            end = start + 2\n            required = {start, start+1, start+2}\n            current = set(unique_nums) & required\n            needed = len(required) - len(current)\n            if needed < min_draws:\n                min_draws = needed\n    return min_draws\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    inputs = input.split('\\n')\n    results = []\n    for line in inputs:\n        tiles = line.strip().split()\n        # Check if already has mentsu\n        if is_triplet(tiles) or is_sequence(tiles):\n            results.append('0')\n            continue\n        # Compute min draws for triplet and sequence\n        min_triplet = min_draws_for_triplet(tiles)\n        min_sequence = min_draws_for_sequence(tiles)\n        results.append(str(min(min_triplet, min_sequence)))\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Existing Mentsu Check**: The functions `is_triplet` and `is_sequence` check if the current tiles form a valid triplet or sequence.\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: The function `min_draws_for_triplet` calculates the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet by checking the counts of each tile type.\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: The function `min_draws_for_sequence` evaluates all possible sequences for each suit and determines the minimum additional tiles needed to form a sequence.\n4. **Main Function**: Reads input, processes each case, and prints the minimum number of tiles required for each scenario.",
