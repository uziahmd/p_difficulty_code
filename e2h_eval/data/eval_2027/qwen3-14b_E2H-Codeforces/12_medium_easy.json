The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks in certain houses arranged in a ringroad. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. \n\nSo the problem says that each task i requires her to be in house ai, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). Oh right, and moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Also, the houses are arranged in a circle, clockwise. So moving from house n to 1 is allowed, but that's a movement of 1 step.\n\nThe input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks). Then the list of a_i's. The output is the total time taken.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's take the first example:\n\nInput is n=4, m=3, tasks [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps.\n\nInitially, she's at house 1. For the first task, she needs to get to 3. How long does that take? From 1 to 3 clockwise: 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, for the second task, which is at 2. But since she's at 3, she needs to move clockwise to 2. Wait, but moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going all the way around? Wait no. Wait, the ringroad is clockwise. So moving from 3 to 2 is not possible directly clockwise. Wait, the movement is only allowed clockwise. So if you are at house 3, moving clockwise to 4, then 1, then 2. So that's three steps. But wait, the problem says that moving from a house to neighboring one along the road takes 1 unit. So the movement is only in the clockwise direction. So to go from house x to house y, the time is (y - x) mod n if that's the clockwise direction. Or maybe (y - x + n) % n? Because if y is larger than x, then it's y - x steps. If y is smaller, then (n - x + y) steps. For example, from 3 to 2: (2 - 3 + 4) = 3 steps. Which matches the example.\n\nSo for each consecutive task, we need to compute the time taken to move from the current position to the next required house, and accumulate that.\n\nBut how do we process the tasks?\n\nThe key is that the tasks must be done in order. So for each task i (from 1 to m), we have to process them in order. So the first task is a1, then a2, then a3, etc. And for each of these, Xenia must be at the correct house. So the initial position is 1. Then, for each task, we compute the time needed to get from the previous position to the current a_i, and add that to the total.\n\nBut how to compute the steps between two positions?\n\nLet me think. Suppose current position is prev, and next is curr. The number of steps is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev. Otherwise, (curr - prev + n). Wait, no. Because if curr is less than prev, then moving clockwise would require going around the ring. For example, prev is 3, curr is 2. So steps are (2 - 3 + 4) = 3 steps. Which is (curr - prev + n) % n. But since n is the total number of houses, that formula would give the correct steps. So the formula is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which can be written as (curr - prev + n) % n. But wait, if curr is 3 and prev is 2, then (3-2) =1, which is correct. If curr is 2 and prev is 3, then (2-3 +4) =3, which is correct.\n\nSo the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Alternatively, (curr - prev + n) % n. But since the movement is only clockwise, that's the correct calculation.\n\nBut wait, for example, when prev is 1 and curr is 3, steps are 2. Which is (3-1) = 2. Correct. If prev is 4 and curr is 1, steps are (1 -4 +4) = 1. Which is correct. So yes, the formula (curr - prev + n) % n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\ncurrent_position = 1\n\nfor each task in the list a:\n\n    compute steps from current_position to task's house\n\n    add steps to total_time\n\n    set current_position to task's house\n\nSo for the first example:\n\na is [3, 2, 3]\n\nFirst step: current is 1. steps to 3 is (3-1) = 2. total becomes 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond step: steps from 3 to 2. (2 -3 +4) = 3. total is 2+3=5. current is 2.\n\nThird step: steps from 2 to 3. (3-2) =1. total is 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example given is input 4 3, tasks [2,3,3]. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps from 1 to 2 is 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps from 2 to 3 is 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps from 3 to 3 is 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem says that the a_i can be 1. Also, there can be multiple consecutive tasks in the same house. For example, if a task is [3,3], then the steps between them is zero.\n\nSo the code needs to process each a_i in order, and accumulate the steps between current position and the next a_i.\n\nSo the code structure is straightforward.\n\nNow, for the input, the first line is n and m. The second line is m integers. So in Python, we can read the input as:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, initialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each element in a:\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    steps = (num - current_pos + n) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = num\n\nWait, but wait: (num - current_pos + n) % n ?\n\nYes. Because for example, if num is 2 and current_pos is 3, then 2-3 = -1. Adding n (4) gives 3. mod n (4) is 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values if the numerator is negative. Wait, but (num - current_pos + n) is always positive? Let's see: num and current_pos are between 1 and n. So num - current_pos can be between -(n-1) and n-1. Adding n gives between 1 and 2n-1. So taking mod n would give the correct steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (num - current_pos) % n ?\n\nWait, let's take the example where num is 2 and current_pos is 3. num - current_pos is -1. (-1) %4 is 3. Which is correct. So (num - current_pos) %n would be the same as (num - current_pos +n) %n. So perhaps the steps can be calculated as (num - current_pos) %n. Because in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (2-3) %4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the steps between current_pos and num is (num - current_pos) %n. Wait, but wait: if current_pos is 3 and num is 2, then (2-3) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the steps can be calculated as (num - current_pos) %n. But wait, when num is equal to current_pos, then (num - current_pos) is zero. So mod n is zero. Which is correct. So this formula works.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += diff\n\n    current_pos = num\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nFor the first step, current_pos is 1, num is 3. (3-1) mod4 is 2. Correct. Then current_pos is 3. Next step, num is 2. (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4 = 3. So adds 3. Then current is 2. Next step, num is 3. (3-2) mod4 is 1. Total is 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about the case when the a_i is 1, and current_pos is 1? Then steps is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of a.\n\nBut wait, in the input, the second line is m integers. So for example, in the first example, the input is '4 3\\n3 2 3'. So the code reads n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of m integers.\n\nThen process as above.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    time += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, but let's test the second example. Input is 4 3, and a is [2,3,3]. Let's see:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 2. (2-1) mod4 =1. time is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2)=1 mod4 is 1. time is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-3) mod4 is 0. time remains 2. So output is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the a is [1,1,1], then the time is 0. Because all steps are zero.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Then steps:\n\ncurrent is 1. first num is 1: steps 0. current is 1. Then next num is 2: (2-1) mod2=1. total is 1. So output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Steps:\n\nFirst, from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod2=1. time is 1. Then from 2 to 1: (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2 =1. total time is 2. Which is correct. Because moving from 2 to 1 is 1 step (clockwise).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, considering the constraints: n and m can be up to 1e5. So the code is O(m), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me write it.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the input reading may need to handle multiple lines. For example, the input could be given as two lines. So for example, the first input line is '4 3', the second is '3 2 3'.\n\nBut in Python, when using input().split(), it's okay.\n\nBut for the case when the second line is read as m integers, but the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as follows.\n",
