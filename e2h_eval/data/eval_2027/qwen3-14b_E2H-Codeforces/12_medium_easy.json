The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task must be done in a specific house, and she can only do the i-th task after all tasks before it (with numbers less than i) are done. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nSo, the input is n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of m integers representing the house numbers for each task. The output is the total time taken.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to model her movement. Since the ringroad is circular, moving clockwise. Each move between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. She starts at house 1.\n\nThe key here is to calculate the time taken to move from one task's house to the next, considering the direction (clockwise) and the circular arrangement.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are in order. So, for each task i, she must be at a_i. But since she must complete all previous tasks first, the order of tasks is fixed. So, the problem reduces to calculating the total time taken to move from the starting position (house 1) to the first task's house, then from there to the second task's house, and so on, with each movement being the minimal steps required in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate the steps between two consecutive houses?\n\nFor example, if she's currently at house x and needs to go to house y (clockwise), the number of steps is (y - x) mod n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Because if x is 3 and y is 2 in a 4-house setup, moving clockwise would require 3 steps (3→4→1→2). So the formula is (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - x + y). Or equivalently, (y - x + n) % n.\n\nYes. So between two consecutive positions, the time taken is (current_position to next_position) in clockwise direction. So for each consecutive pair of tasks, we compute the steps needed and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is house 1. So the first task is a_1. So the time from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) steps if a_1 >=1. But since a_1 can be 1, which would take zero steps. Then, for the next task a_2, we need to compute steps from a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nFor each task in the list a:\n\n   compute the steps from current_position to a_i (clockwise)\n\n   add that to total_time\n\n   set current_position to a_i\n\nSo, the steps between current and a_i is (a_i - current_position) if a_i >= current_position, else (n - current_position + a_i). Or more simply, (a_i - current_position) % n? Wait, no. Because if a_i is less than current_position, then (a_i - current_position) would be negative. For example, current is 3, a_i is 2. (2-3) is -1. Mod n (say 4) would be 3, which is correct. So yes, (a_i - current_position) % n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results. So for example, (2-3) %4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula for steps between current and next is (next_pos - current_pos) % n.\n\nBut wait, let's check some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nLet's walk through:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Steps from 1 to 3: (3-1) = 2 steps. So total_time is 2.\n\nThen, current is 3. Next task is 2. Steps: (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod4 = 3. So add 3. Total is 5.\n\nThen, current is 2. Next task is 3. Steps: (3-2) = 1. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So the formula works.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput is 4 3, and a is [2,3,3]. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial position is 1. First task is 2. Steps: 1. Total is 1.\n\nCurrent is 2. Next is 3: steps 1. Total 2. Next is 3 again: steps 0. Total remains 2. So output is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate through the list of a's, and for each step, calculate the difference between current and next, mod n, and add to total.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current = 1, total = 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list:\n\n   steps = (ai - current) % n\n\n   total += steps\n\n   current = ai\n\nThen output total.\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nBecause each step is moving clockwise, and the minimal steps required to get from current to ai.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code.\n\nIn Python, read input. Let's see.\n\nThe input is given as two lines. First line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings, like ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'].\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So for each test case, the first line is n and m, the second line is m integers.\n\nBut the user provided two examples, perhaps as two separate test cases. But the code should read from stdin, not process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user says that the input is given as per the problem statement. So in the code, we need to read from standard input. The sample input shows that for example, the first input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be read as n=4, m=3, and a list [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code should read two lines: first line is n and m, second line is the m integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in some cases, the second line may have leading or trailing spaces, but splitting by whitespace should handle that.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm above.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead first line: n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that len(a) is m. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nOnce that is done, initialize current = 1, total = 0.\n\nLoop over each ai in a:\n\nsteps = (ai - current) % n\n\ntotal += steps\n\ncurrent = ai\n\nAt the end, print(total).\n\nWait, but let's test the first sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod4 = 2 → total is 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4 = 3 → total is 5.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1 → total is 6. Correct.\n\nSample 2: n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1 → total 1.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2)=1 → total 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3)=0 → total remains 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the a list is [1,1,1], then the steps would be 0 for all steps. So total is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then steps is (1-1) mod2 = 0. So output 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1, a=[2]. Steps is (2-1) mod2 = 1 → output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    steps = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total += steps\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if the list a is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. Because in input constraints, m is ≥1? Let me check:\n\nProblem statement says m is between 1 and 1e5. So m can be 1. So the code handles that.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample 1: input is 4 3, then 3 2 3 → output 6. Which is correct.\n\nSample 2: input is 4 3, then 2 3 3 → output 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Steps:\n\nStart at 1. First ai is 2: (2-1) mod2 = 1 → total 1. Then current is 2. Next ai is 1: (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2 = 1. So total 2. Which is correct. The path is 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses numbered clockwise from 1 to n. Each task must be completed in a specific house, and she can only start the i-th task after completing all previous tasks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1. Each move between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. The movement is clockwise, so moving from house x to house y (where y is clockwise from x) takes (y - x) % n steps if y >= x, otherwise (n - x + y) steps.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house for the task. Sum these times to get the total time.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Using modulo operation simplifies the calculation of steps between two houses considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n    diff = (ai - current) % n\n    total += diff\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses (n) and the number of tasks (m). The second line reads the list of house numbers where each task must be completed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the steps needed to move from the current house to the target house using the modulo operation to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Add these steps to the total time and update the current house.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total time accumulated after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time with a linear pass through the list of tasks, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(m), which is suitable given the constraints.",
