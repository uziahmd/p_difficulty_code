The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers so that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for such a configuration to exist. \n\nFirst, the signal coverage. For each town i (from 1 to n), exactly one tower must cover it. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nLet me think about how the towers can be arranged. For example, if there's a tower in position i, its signal power p must be such that it covers some towns. But the way the coverage works is that |c - i| < p. So for a tower at i, the range is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Wait, because if p is the power, then the distance from c to i must be less than p. So the maximum distance is p-1. So the tower covers towns from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). So the length of coverage is 2p-1, but the exact towns covered depend on the power.\n\nBut how do we arrange the towers and their powers such that all the towns are covered exactly once, and 0 and n+1 are not covered?\n\nLet me think of a possible arrangement. For instance, if there's a tower in position i, then perhaps it's responsible for covering a certain interval of towns. And these intervals must be non-overlapping and cover all towns from 1 to n.\n\nWait, but since each town is covered exactly once, the coverage regions must partition the towns 1..n. Also, the coverage of each tower cannot include town 0 or town n+1. So for any tower at position i, the power must be such that:\n\ni - p + 1 > 0? Or wait, the coverage for a tower at i with power p reaches up to i + p - 1. So for town 0 to not be covered, we need that i - (p-1) > 0? Because if i - (p-1) <= 0, then town 0 would be covered. Wait, no. The tower's coverage includes towns where |c - i| < p. So for town 0, |0 - i| < p → i < p. So if a tower is placed at i, then to avoid covering town 0, the power p must be ≤ i. Similarly, for town n+1, the distance from i to n+1 is (n+1 - i). For this to not be covered, we need (n+1 - i) ≥ p → p ≤ (n+1 - i). So for any tower at position i, the power must be at most min(i, n+1 - i). But since the power can be chosen as needed, perhaps the way to arrange the towers is such that they can be assigned power in a way that their coverage regions are non-overlapping and cover all towns 1..n.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems like the problem reduces to finding a valid arrangement of towers such that there exists a way to assign their ranges so that they form a partition of the towns 1..n. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the towers must be arranged in such a way that they form a set of non-overlapping intervals, each covering some towns, and their union is exactly 1..n. Also, each tower must be able to cover its interval with some power. \n\nWait, but how can a tower's coverage be an interval? For example, suppose a tower is placed at position i, and it's responsible for covering towns from a to b. Then, the power p must be such that a ≥ i - (p-1) and b ≤ i + (p-1). But since the coverage is symmetric around i, the maximum distance from i is p-1. So the entire interval [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] is covered. Therefore, if we want the tower to cover exactly the interval [a, b], then a must be i - (p-1) and b must be i + (p-1). Which implies that the length of the interval is 2(p-1) + 1 = 2p-1. So the length of the interval is 2p-1. However, the interval must be such that a ≥ 1 and b ≤ n. Also, the tower must be placed in the middle of the interval. So for example, if a tower is covering an interval of length l, then l must be odd (since 2p-1 is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Coverage**: Each tower at position `i` can cover a range of towns symmetrically around `i`. The key is to ensure that the coverage intervals do not overlap and do not extend beyond towns 0 or n+1.\n2. **Valid Configurations**: For a valid configuration, the towers must be placed such that they can be assigned power values that exactly cover towns 1 to n without overlapping and without covering towns 0 or n+1.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to count valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid ways to place towers up to position `i` such that the conditions are met.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses for division operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: no towns considered\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i, so dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        # Case 2: tower at i, and it covers from i - k to i + k (but must not go beyond)\n        # The tower at i can be the right end of a segment that starts at i - (k)\n        # For the tower to be responsible for exactly its own segment, the previous segment must end at i-1\n        # So the previous segment ends at i-1, which can be achieved by a tower at i-1 with power 1\n        # Or by a tower at i-2 with power 2, etc. But this seems complex.\n        # However, the recurrence can be simplified as dp[i] += dp[i-2]\n        # Because placing a tower at i and ensuring that it covers only i (power 1) and the previous state is up to i-2\n        # Wait, the correct recurrence is dp[i] += dp[i-1] (no tower at i) + dp[i-2] (tower at i, and previous ends at i-2)\n        # This is based on the idea that if we place a tower at i, then it must cover i, and the previous part must be valid up to i-2\n        # So the recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n        # But wait, this is similar to Fibonacci numbers!\n        # Let's check for small cases:\n        # For n=2, the answer is 1/4. The total possible configurations is 4. Valid is 1 (towers at 1 and 2)\n        # dp[0] = 1\n        # dp[1] = dp[0] (no tower at 1) + ...? If we have a tower at 1, then it must cover only 1, but that would require the previous part to be up to 0 (which is allowed). So dp[1] = dp[0] + dp[-1] (but dp[-1] is 0). So dp[1] = 1\n        # dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2. The total number of valid configurations is 2, but the actual valid is 1. Wait, this suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n        # Hmm, perhaps the correct recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2], but the answer is dp[n] / 2^n\n        # Let's see for n=2: dp[2] = 2. 2 / 2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2, which contradicts the example where the answer is 1/4.\n        # Therefore, this approach is wrong. Need to rethink.\n        \n        # Alternative approach: the valid configurations are those where the towers form a valid partitioning of the towns into intervals covered by exactly one tower.\n        # This is equivalent to the number of ways to tile the interval [1, n] using tiles of length 1 or more, such that each tile is centered at a tower.\n        # But each tile of length 2k+1 must have a tower in the middle.

Let's see for n=2: the valid configuration is when towers are at 1 and 2. So the number is 1. But according to Fibonacci sequence, Fib(2) is 1. For n=3, the answer is 1/4 (from the note). The total number of valid configurations would be 2: either towers at 1,2,3 (with power 1 each) or tower at 2 with power 2. So the count is 2, which is Fib(3)=2. Then for n=2, Fib(2)=1, which matches. For n=3, Fib(3)=2. Then the answer is 2/(2^3) = 1/4, which matches the example. For n=5, the answer is 5/32. 5 is Fib(5) = 5. So the pattern seems to be that the number of valid configurations is Fib(n), and the answer is Fib(n)/2^n.\n        # So the problem reduces to calculating Fib(n) / 2^n mod MOD.\n        # But wait, the sample input for n=5 gives 5/32.

For n=2, which is even, we take (c, d) where c is Fib(2) = 1, d is Fib(3) = 2. So for n=2, returns (1, 2).

For n=2, which is even, we take (c, d) where c is Fib(2) = 1, d is Fib(3) = 2. So for n=2, returns (1, 2). So the function returns (Fib(n), Fib(n+1)).\n    # Therefore, to get Fib(n), we can call fib(n)[0].\n    \n    # So for the problem, we need to compute Fib(n) mod MOD.\n    # So the code becomes:\n    \n    def fast_doubling(n):\n        def fib_pair(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return (0, 1)\n            a, b = fib_pair(n >> 1)\n            c = a * (2 * b - a)\n            d = a * a + b * b\n            if n & 1:\n                return (d % MOD, (c + d) % MOD)\n            else:\n                return (c % MOD, d % MOD)\n        return fib_pair(n)[0]\n    \n    fib_n = fast_doubling(n)\n    \n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    pow2 = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Compute inverse of pow2\n    inv_pow2 = pow(pow2, MOD-2, MOD)\n    \n    # Result is fib_n * inv_pow2 mod MOD\n    result = (fib_n * inv_pow2) % MOD\n    print(result)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
