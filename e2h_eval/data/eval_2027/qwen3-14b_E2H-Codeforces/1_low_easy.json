The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. And each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take the perimeter of that rectangle. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width w and height h is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each side contributes (w) and (h), but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Wait, for example, a rectangle of 3x3. The perimeter would be 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. The perimeter in terms of cells: for a rectangle of width w and height h, the number of cells in the perimeter (the outer ring) is 2*w + 2*(h-2). Because the top and bottom rows have w cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the top and bottom) have (h-2) each. So total is 2w + 2(h-2) = 2(w + h -2). Alternatively, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because each side has m or n cells, but subtracting 4 for the four corners that are counted twice. So yeah, 2*(m + n - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i, the rectangle is of size (w' × h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1) and h' = h - 4*(i-1). Wait, but wait. Let me check the example given. Let's take the first sample input: 3 3 1. So the first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. Which would be 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the sample output of 8. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: the third input is 7 9 2. Let's compute. For the first ring, it's 7x9. The perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 - 2) = 2*14 = 28. Then the second ring is 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So the rectangle is 3x5. The perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the sample output. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is to compute for each i from 1 to k, the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that for each i, the rectangle is valid. For example, when i increases, the dimensions decrease by 4 each time. But for the problem statement, the k is given such that it's allowed. The constraints on k are that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Wait, the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(n, m) + 1)/4 ), but maybe that's to ensure that the rings can be formed. For example, for each ring i, the width and height must be at least 3? Because for the first ring, the rectangle is w × h, which is at least 3×3. For the second ring, it's w-4 and h-4. So for that to be at least 3×3, we need w-4 >=3 and h-4 >=3. Which implies that min(w, h) must be >= 3 + 4*(k-1). But the problem says that k is given such that this is possible. So the code doesn't have to handle invalid cases.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each ring from 1 to k:\n\n   - Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - Compute perimeter: 2*(",
