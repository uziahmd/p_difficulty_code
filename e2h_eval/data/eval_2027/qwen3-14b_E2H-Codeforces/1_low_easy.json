The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, and for the i-th ring, it's the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle is 4 less in both width and height. Because for example, the first ring is the outermost layer. Then the next ring would be 2 cells in from each edge, which would require that the width and height are reduced by 4*(i-1) for the i-th ring. Wait, for i=1, it's the original dimensions. For i=2, the rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4), but that's because each side is reduced by 2 (so total 4 from the original). So the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle.\n\nSo the number of cells in each ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. Wait, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4, because each side is counted once. Wait, for example, a rectangle of m rows and n columns. The number of cells in the perimeter is 2*m + 2*(n-2) = 2*(m + n) -4. Because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (m-2) each. So total is 2n + 2(m-2) = 2(n + m - 2) = 2(m + n) -4.\n\nSo for each ring i, the dimensions are (w_i, h_i) where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then the perimeter is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. Let me take the example given.\n\nIn the first example input: 3 3 1. So the first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. The perimeter cells would be 3*3 - (3-2)*(3-2) = 9 - 1 = 8. Which matches the output. So that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula 2*(w + h) -4. For 3 and 3, that's 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Correct.\n\nSo for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(w_i + h_i) -4, where w_i and h_i are the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring. But wait, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(width + height) - 4. So yes.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions are valid. For example, when i=1, the rectangle is w x h. For i=2, it's w-4 x h-4. But what if w or h is too small? Well, according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's <= floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. So for i up to k, the dimensions w_i and h_i must be at least 3? Or maybe not. Let's think.\n\nWait, the formula for the i-th ring is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). For the ring to exist, the rectangle must have at least 3 rows and columns? Because otherwise, the perimeter would be zero or negative? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. So the problem says that the input is valid. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the plan is: loop from i=1 to k. For each i, compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h -4*(i-1). Then compute perimeter as 2",
