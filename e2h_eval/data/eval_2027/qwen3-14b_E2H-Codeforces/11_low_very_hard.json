A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them must make the same number of toasts.\n\nSo, the input gives me several numbers: n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend). \n\nWait, right. For each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink. So for one toast, all n friends together need n * nl milliliters. Because each of the n friends has nl per toast. Similarly, each toast requires one slice of lime per friend. So total slices needed per toast is n slices. And for salt, each toast requires n * np grams, since each friend uses np grams.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the total amount of drink available: k * l. Then, how many toasts can be made based on the drink? Each toast requires n * nl ml. So total toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nThen, the total lime slices available is c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So total toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt, total available is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources are required for each toast. So the maximum possible toasts is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nWait, but the example given in the note:\n\nFirst sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nDrink: 4*5 =20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends *3 ml per toast per friend? Wait, no. Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. So for 3 friends, 3 * 3 =9 ml per toast. So total toasts from drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222..., which floored to 2. Which matches the example's explanation.\n\nLimes: 10 limes, each cut into 8 slices. Total 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since n=3 friends). So 80 /3 is 26.666... floored to 26. But the example says 80 toasts? Wait wait, no. Wait in the note they said the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but that's because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices are needed. So total toasts from limes is (c*d) // n. In the first example, that's 10*8=80 slices. Divided by 3 (n=3) gives 26.666, which is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. Wait what's the correct way here?\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, it's 80 slices divided by 3 slices per toast. Which would be 26. So why does the note say 80?\n\nWait I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So total slices per toast is n. So for the first example, 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. So total toasts possible from limes is 80 / n (since each toast needs n slices). For n=3, that's 80 /3 = 26.666, so 26. But in the note, they said that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That contradicts. So where is the error here?\n\nWait looking back at the note's explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available from the bottles.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available from the limes.\n   - **Salt**: Use the given amount of salt directly.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Requirement**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink for all friends.\n   - **Lime Requirement**: Each toast requires `n` slices of lime for all friends.\n   - **Salt Requirement**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt for all friends.\n\n3. **Compute Maximum Possible Toasts**:\n   - For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made given the total available resources and the per toast requirements.\n   - The result is the minimum of the three computed values, as all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split into individual numbers\n    numbers = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the parameters\n    n = numbers[0]\n    k = numbers[1]\n    l = numbers[2]\n    c = numbers[3]\n    d = numbers[4]\n    p = numbers[5]\n    nl = numbers[6]\n    np = numbers[7]\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Drink per toast for all friends\n    drink_per_toast = n * nl\n    toasts_drink = total_drink // drink_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Lime slices per toast for all friends\n    lime_per_toast = n\n    toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // lime_per_toast\n    \n    # Calculate salt per toast for all friends\n    salt_per_toast = n * np\n    toasts_salt = p // salt_per_toast\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers for processing.\n- **Resource Calculation**: The total available resources (drink, lime slices, and salt) are calculated based on the given inputs.\n- **Toast Requirements**: For each resource, the number of toasts that can be made is determined by dividing the total available resource by the per toast requirement for all friends.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the calculated possible toasts from each resource is the answer, ensuring all resources are sufficient for the same number of toasts. This approach efficiently handles all edge cases and constraints provided in the problem statement.",
