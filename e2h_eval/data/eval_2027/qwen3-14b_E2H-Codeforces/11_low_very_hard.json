A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine how many toasts each friend can make, given certain resources. All friends must make the same number of toasts. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the inputs. The input consists of several integers: n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend). \n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of toasts (let's call it t) such that each friend can make t toasts. So, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. \n\nSo, the total resources required for all friends for t toasts would be:\n\nDrink: n * t * nl ml. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts, each needing nl ml. \n\nLime slices: n * t slices. Each toast per friend requires one slice. \n\nSalt: n * t * np grams. \n\nNow, we need to check how much of each resource is available and compute the maximum t possible.\n\nLet's calculate the available resources:\n\nTotal drink available: k * l ml. \n\nTotal lime slices: c * d. \n\nTotal salt: p grams. \n\nSo for each resource, the maximum t allowed is:\n\nFor drink: (k*l) // (n * nl). Because total drink divided by the per-toast requirement. But wait, since each toast requires per friend nl, multiplied by n friends. So yes.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: (c*d) // (n * 1) → since each toast requires one slice per friend. So total slices needed is n * t. So t can be up to (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: p // (n * np). \n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources must be sufficient. \n\nWait, but let me check the example. \n\nIn the first sample input: \n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. \n\nEach toast requires 3 ml per friend. For t toasts, total drink needed is 3 * t * 3 = 9t? Wait no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl. So total per toast is n * nl. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl. \n\nYes. So for the first sample, the drink available is 20. The required per t is 3 * 3 * t = 9t. Wait, no. Wait, t is the number of toasts per friend. So for each toast, each friend has one. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nYes. So in the first sample, 3 friends, t toasts each. So total drink is 3 * t * 3 = 9t. The available is 20. So 9t ≤ 20 → t ≤ 2.222..., so floor division gives 2. \n\nThe lime slices: total available is 10 * 8 = 80. Each toast requires per friend one slice. So total slices needed is 3 * t. So 3t ≤ 80 → t ≤ 26.666, so 26. But the drink limits it to 2. \n\nSalt: 100 / (3 * 1) = 33.333, so 33. So the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the example. \n\nSo the approach is to compute for each resource the maximum possible t, then take the minimum of those. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nmax_lime = total_lime_slices // n \n\ntotal_salt = p \n\nmax_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nThen answer is min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nWait, but what if any of these divisions result in zero? For example, if the total drink is less than n * nl, then max_drink is zero, so the answer is zero.\n\nYes. So that's the approach. \n\nSo the code should read the input numbers, compute these three values, take the minimum, and output that.\n\nBut wait,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices from the limes, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**: For each resource, determine how many toasts can be made given the constraints:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available divided by the required drink per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total lime slices available divided by the required slices per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available divided by the required salt per toast for all friends.\n3. **Determine the Minimum Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Thus, we take the minimum value from the three calculated constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split into individual numbers\n    numbers = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the parameters\n    n = numbers[0]\n    k = numbers[1]\n    l = numbers[2]\n    c = numbers[3]\n    d = numbers[4]\n    p = numbers[5]\n    nl = numbers[6]\n    np = numbers[7]\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Maximum toasts based on drink\n    max_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime = c * d\n    # Maximum toasts based on lime\n    max_lime = total_lime // n\n    \n    # Calculate maximum toasts based on salt\n    max_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers for processing.\n- **Resource Calculation**: The total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt are calculated based on the given inputs.\n- **Constraints Calculation**: Each resource's capacity to support toasts is computed using integer division to ensure we only consider whole toasts.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is determined by taking the minimum of the three constraints, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limits.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by directly addressing each resource constraint and ensuring the solution adheres to the problem's requirements.",
