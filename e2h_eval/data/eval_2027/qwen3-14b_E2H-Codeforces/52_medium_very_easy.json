Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones into new candles. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new candle can be used again, burning for another hour, and so on. The question is to find the total number of hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He uses all 4, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned candles are turned into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 burned ones are turned into 2/2 = 1 new candle. He uses that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is burned, but he can't make any more because 1 < 2. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 candles give 6 hours. Then 6 / 3 = 2 new. Use them, +2 hours. Now, 2 burned. But 2 <3, so can't make more. Wait, but the output is 8. Oh wait, 6 + 2 = 8. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but what if after making some new candles, you have some leftovers? Like if you have 5 candles and b=2. Let's say:\n\nInitial 5 candles: 5 hours. Then 5 burned, which can make 5//2 = 2 new (with 1 leftover). Then 2 hours. Now, 2 burned, plus the leftover 1 from before? Wait, no. Wait, after making the 2 new candles, you have 5 - (2*2) = 1 left? Or maybe the process is that each time you collect all the burned candles, then make as many as possible.\n\nWait, the process is that after each hour, the candles that are burned are collected. So, let's think of it as:\n\nTotal hours is the initial a, plus the number of times you can make new candles from the burned ones, considering that each time you make new ones, they burn again, adding to the total.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nStart with a candles. Each time you burn them, you get some number of burned candles. Then, you can make new ones from them. But each time you make new ones, you can burn them again, and so on.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize total_hours = a\n\nThen, collect the burned candles (initially a), then while the number of burned candles is >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned_candles // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burned_candles = (burned_candles % b) + new_candles\n\nRepeat until burned_candles < b.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let's test the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4.\n\nburned_candles = 4.\n\nLoop:\n\n4 >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. total_hours becomes 4+2=6.\n\nburned_candles = 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles=2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7.\n\nburned_candles = 0 +1 =1 <2. exit loop.\n\nTotal is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 6. burned_candles=6.\n\nLoop:\n\n6//3=2. total becomes 6+2=8. burned_candles is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So stop. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=2.\n\nInitial total is 5. burned_candles=5.\n\nFirst iteration: 5//2=2. total is 5+2=7. burned_candles is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nSecond iteration: 3//2=1. total is 7+1=8. burned_candles is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nThird iteration: 2//2=1. total is 8+1=9. burned_candles is 0 +1=1. Now stop. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually:\n\nStart with 5 candles. 5 hours. Burned 5.\n\nMake 2 new (using 4), 1 left. 2 hours. Now burned 2 + 1 (leftover) = 3?\n\nWait, no. Wait, after making 2 new candles, the burned_candles is 5 - (2 * 2) = 1? Or maybe the way to think is that when you make new candles, you take 'b' per new one. So for 5 burned candles, you can make 2 new ones (using 4), leaving 1. Then, when you burn those 2 new ones, you add 2 more burned. So after that step, you have 1 + 2 = 3 burned. Then, you can make 1 new (using 2 of the 3), leaving 1. Burn that 1, add 1. Now you have 1 + 1 = 2. Make 1 new. Burn it. Now 1 left. So total steps:\n\nInitial 5 → 5 hours.\n\nThen 2 → +2 (total 7), then 1 → +1 (total 8), then 1 → +1 (total 9). Then 1 left. So yes, 9 hours. Which matches the calculation.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read a and b.\n\n- Initialize total = a.\n\n- current_burned = a.\n\n- while current_burned >= b:\n\n   new = current_burned // b\n\n   total += new\n\n   current_burned = (current_burned % b) + new\n\n- return total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, we can do this with a loop.\n\nSo, for example, the code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input. Then:\n\ntotal = a\n\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n\n    new = current // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    current = current % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 4 2 → total starts as 4, current is 4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew = 4//2 = 2 → total 6. current = 0 +2=2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1 → total 7. current is 0 +1=1. Exit. Output 7.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 → total starts as 6. current is 6.\n\nnew = 6//3=2 → total 8. current is 0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. Exit. Output 8.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2 → output 9 as above.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if a=1, b=2? Then total is 1. Because current is 1 <2.\n\nAnother edge case: a=2, b=2. Then total is 2 +1=3. Because after burning 2, you have 2 burned, make 1. Burn that, add 1. Now current is 1, which is less than 2. So total is 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Initial total 3. current is 3. new is 1. total 4. current is 0 +1=1. done. So 4.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5. Then initial 5, then 1 new. total 5+1=6. current is 1. done.\n\nWhat if a=7, b=3?\n\nInitial total 7. current is 7.\n\n7//3 is 2. total is 7+2=9. current is 7%3=1 +2=3.\n\nAgain, 3//3=1. total 10. current is 0 +1=1. done. So total is 10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is straightforward. So the Python code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input. Split the input line into two integers.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers a and b. Wait, the example shows that the input is given as ['4 2', '6 3'], but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nBut the example shows two inputs. Oh, perhaps the example is showing two test cases. But for the code, the code should read one line of input, split into a and b.\n\nWait, the user says that the input is a single line with two integers. So for example, in the sample input, the first case is 4 2, and the output is 7. So the code needs to read a and b from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a line from input, split into two integers.\n\nThen compute as per the algorithm.\n\nSo the code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n\n    new = current // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    current = current % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nThat should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFor input 4 2 → output 7.\n\nAnother sample input 6 3 → output 8. Which works.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2 → output 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
