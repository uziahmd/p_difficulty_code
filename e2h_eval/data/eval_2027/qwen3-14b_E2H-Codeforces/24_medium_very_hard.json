She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. We need to find the minimum number of seconds required for her to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem thoroughly. \n\nSo, there are n tabs, and the cursor is at position pos. She needs to leave only tabs from l to r. All other tabs must be closed. The operations allowed are moving left/right (each taking 1 second) or closing tabs to the left or right of the current position (each taking 1 second). But when she closes tabs, the a and b values (the min and max of the current open tabs) change. So, after closing some tabs, the available range changes.\n\nThe key here is to model the steps needed to close all tabs outside [l, r], considering that each closing operation can eliminate a bunch of tabs at once, but you have to position the cursor correctly to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the possible scenarios. Let's consider the cases where the current [l, r] is already the entire range. Then no action is needed. For example, if n=5, l=1, r=5, then output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. But how?\n\nLet me think about the steps required. For example, to close tabs to the left of l, she needs to move the cursor to l, then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to move to r and close all tabs to the right. However, the order might matter, and there might be overlaps.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are cases where she can close both sides in a more optimal way. Let's think about the first example given:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4. The initial position is 3. The desired range is 2-4. So, she needs to close tabs 1 and 5-6.\n\nIn the example explanation, she moves to tab 2, closes left (which closes tab 1), then moves to tab 3, then to 4, then closes right (tabs 5-6). Let's count the steps:\n\nMoving from 3 to 2: 1 sec. Then closing left: 1 sec. Then moving from 2 to 3 (1 sec?), then to 4 (another sec), then closing right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way? Like, perhaps closing right first? Let's see. Suppose she moves to 4, closes right (tabs 5-6), then moves to 2 and closes left. But how long would that take?\n\nOriginal position is 3. To get to 4: 1 sec. Close right (1 sec). Now, the remaining tabs are 1-4. Then she needs to close tabs 1. So she has to move from 4 to 2 (but how? Because after closing right, the a and b would be 1 and 4. So moving left from 4 would take her to 3, then 2. So two steps. Then close left (1 sec). So total steps: 1 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) + 2 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) = 5. Same as before. So same steps.\n\nSo the order of closing left and right may not affect the total steps. But perhaps there are cases where it's better to do one first or the other.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the possible steps required. The main idea is that she needs to perform two operations: close all tabs to the left of l, and close all tabs to the right of r. However, each of these requires that she is positioned at l (for closing left) or r (for closing right). But depending on the initial position and the positions of l and r, the steps to reach those positions vary.\n\nBut also, there's the possibility that some of these operations are not needed. For example, if l is 1, then there's no need to close tabs to the left. Similarly, if r is n, then no need to close tabs to the right.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Determine whether we need to close left (i.e., if l > 1) and/or close right (if r < n).\n\nFor each of these, calculate the steps required to reach the correct position and perform the close operation.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the case where we need to close both left and right.\n\nFor example, suppose the current position is pos. We need to get to l (to close left), then get to r (to close right). Or vice versa. Which order is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps. For example, if the current position is between l and r, then perhaps moving to l, then moving to r, or moving to r first then l. Which is better?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose l=2, r=4, pos=3. So to close left, need to move to 2. To close right, need to move to 4. If we do left first: moving from 3 to 2 takes 1 step. Then closing left (1 step). Then moving from 2 to 4: 2 steps. Closing right (1 step). Total steps: 1+1+2+1 = 5. Alternatively, moving to 4 first: from 3 to 4 (1 step), close right (1 step). Then move to 2 (2 steps), close left (1 step). Total steps again 1+1+2+1=5. Same result.\n\nSo regardless of the order, the steps are same. So perhaps for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the steps are (steps to reach l) + 1 (close left) + (steps to reach r from l) + 1 (close right). Or alternatively, (steps to reach r) + 1 + (steps to reach l from r) + 1. Which one is better?\n\nBut maybe the steps to reach l and then r is same as steps to reach r and then l? Let's see. Suppose l is 2, r is 4, pos is 3. Then steps to reach l is 1, steps to reach r from l is 2. Total steps for moving is 1 + 2 = 3. Then adding 2 for the closing steps. Total 5. If we reverse the order, steps to reach r is 1, steps to reach l from r is 2. Again 3 steps for moving. So same total.\n\nBut what if the initial position is such that moving to l and then to r is shorter than moving to r and then to l? For example, suppose l is 2, r is 5, and pos is 3. Then moving to l (2) takes 1 step, then moving to r (5) takes 3 steps. Total moving steps 4. If we go to r first (from 3 to 5 is 2 steps), then to l (from 5 to 2 is 3 steps). Total moving steps 5. So the order here affects the total moving steps. Therefore, the order in which we perform the closing operations (left first or right first) affects the total steps. Hence, we need to consider both possibilities and choose the minimum.\n\nAh! So in this case, the optimal approach is to choose between closing left first or right first, whichever gives a shorter total time.\n\nSo, for the general case where both left and right need to be closed, the minimal steps would be the minimum between:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then close right.\n\nTime for this option is:\n\ntime to move from pos to l (steps) + 1 (close left) + time to move from l to r (steps) + 1 (close right).\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then close left.\n\nTime for this option is:\n\ntime to move from pos to r (steps) + 1 (close right) + time to move from r to l (steps) + 1 (close left).\n\nWe need to take the minimum between these two options.\n\nBut how do we compute the time to move from pos to l?\n\nWell, moving from current position to target position. Since the movement is allowed to left or right, step by step. So the number of steps is the absolute difference between the current position and the target.\n\nWait, yes. Because each move is one step. So moving from x to y takes |x - y| steps.\n\nBut wait, but when you are moving, the a and b values are changing? No. Because during the movement, the tabs are still open. Because the closing operations are done only after moving. So during movement, all tabs are still open. So the movement steps are just based on the original positions.\n\nWait, but when you are moving, the a and b are the original min and max. Because you haven't closed any tabs yet. So the movement steps are straightforward. For example, moving from pos to l is |pos - l| steps. Because the movement is possible as long as the tabs are open. But since we're moving before closing any tabs, the movement is possible.\n\nSo, the steps for movement are based on the original positions. So for example, if the initial position is pos, and we need to move to l, then the steps is |pos - l|.\n\nOnce we close the left, then the a becomes l, and the b is still n. Then, when moving to r, the movement is possible. But since after closing left, the tabs to the left of l are closed. However, the movement is allowed to the left and right, but the a and b are adjusted. But when moving from l to r, the movement is possible because the current open tabs are from l to n. So moving from l to r is possible. So the steps would be |l - r| steps. Wait, but that's the same as if we were moving in the original setup. Because the movement steps are based on the current open tabs. But in this case, the movement is from l to r, which is within the current open tabs. So the movement steps is |l - r|. Which is the same as the original positions. So the movement steps are calculated based on the original positions, regardless of the current a and b.\n\nWait, but when you have already closed some tabs, the movement is constrained. For example, if you have closed some tabs on the left, then the a is l. So when moving, the movement is allowed to the left only up to a (which is l). So, if you are at position l, you can't move left anymore. But in our case, when moving from l to r, since r is >= l, you can just move right. So the steps would be (r - l) steps.\n\nSo, the movement steps between positions are based on the original positions. Because during movement, the a and b are not changing until you perform a closing operation. So, during movement, you can move freely between the original positions.\n\nSo, for example, when you are moving from pos to l, the steps are |pos - l| steps. Then, after closing left, when moving from l to r, the steps are |l - r| steps. So the movement steps are calculated as if the entire original range is open.\n\nSo, the total steps for option 1 is:\n\n(|pos - l|) + 1 (closing left) + (|l - r|) + 1 (closing right) ?\n\nWait, but after closing left, the a becomes l. But when moving from l to r, the movement is allowed. So the steps between l and r is (r - l) steps. Which is same as |l - r|. So yes.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, pos is 3, l=2, r=4. Then moving to l (2) takes 1 step. Then moving to r (4) takes 2 steps. So total steps for movement is 1 + 2 = 3. Then add 2 for the closing steps.\n\nSo the total steps for option 1 is 3 + 2 = 5 steps. Which matches the first example.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where we need to close only left or only right.\n\nFor example, if l=1, r=3, and n=5. So, we need to close tabs to the right of 3. So, the steps would be to move to r (3) and close right. But if the initial position is already at 3, then it's 1 step (closing right). If the initial position is at 2, then steps to move to 3 is 1 step, plus 1 to close. Total 2 steps.\n\nAnother case: if l=2, r=4, and the initial pos is 2. Then, we need to close the right side (tabs 5-6, assuming n=6). So steps: move to 4 (2 steps from 2 to 4), then close right (1 step). Total 3 steps.\n\nSo, for the case where only left or only right needs to be closed, we can calculate accordingly.\n\nBut what if the current pos is already in the correct place to close?\n\nLike, if we need to close left, and the current pos is l. Then, moving steps is zero. Then close left (1 step).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the steps are:\n\nFirst, check whether we need to close left and/or right.\n\nCase 1: No need to close left or right. That is, l=1 and r=n. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Need to close left only (l > 1, r =n). Then steps are (steps to move to l) + 1.\n\nCase 3: Need to close right only (r <n, l=1). Steps are (steps to move to r) + 1.\n\nCase 4: Need to close both left and right. Then choose between option1 and option2 as discussed earlier.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. Maybe after closing left, the movement to r is easier. Or maybe there's a smarter way. But according to previous analysis, considering both options (close left first or right first) and taking the minimum is the way to go.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCalculate the steps required for closing left and/or right.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nneed_left = l > 1\n\nneed_right = r < n\n\nIf need_left and need_right:\n\nthen compute option1 and option2 as:\n\noption1: move to l, close left, then move to r, close right.\n\nsteps1 = |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1\n\noption2: move to r, close right, then move to l, close left.\n\nsteps2 = |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1\n\ntotal_steps = min(steps1, steps2)\n\nIf need_left but not need_right:\n\nsteps = |pos - l| + 1\n\nIf need_right but not need_left:\n\nsteps = |pos - r| + 1\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, for example, if need_left but not need_right. So, l>1 and r =n. Then, the steps needed are to move to l, then close left. Because after that, all tabs to the left of l are closed, and the rest are kept. Since r is n, no need to close anything else.\n\nBut what if the current position is already l? Then steps is 1 (closing left).\n\nYes. So steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already l? Then |pos - l| is 0 steps, then 1 step to close. So total 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly for need_right.\n\nBut wait, there's another scenario. Suppose that the current position is already in the correct place for closing. For example, if need to close left, and pos is l. Then steps is 1.\n\nBut what about if the pos is already to the left of l? For example, l=3, pos=2. Then, need to move to l (steps 1), then close left (1). But if pos is 2, and l is 3, then the current position is to the left of l. How can you move to l? Because the initial a is 1, and b is n. So movement is possible. So steps is |pos - l|.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nBut wait, there's another case. Suppose that the current position is already in the [l, r] range. For example, l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, moving to l (2) takes 1 step. Then closing left (which closes tabs 1). Then moving to r (4) takes 2 steps. Then closing right (tabs 5-6). So steps is 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nBut what if the current position is already l? For example, pos = l. Then steps for option1 would be 0 + 1 + (distance from l to r) + 1. Which is (r - l) + 2 steps.\n\nBut in that case, the steps to move from l to r is (r - l) steps.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if you can close both left and right with a single movement. But I don't think so. Because you have to be at l to close left, and at r to close right.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nBut let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample 1: Input is 6 3 2 4.\n\nSo l=2, r=4. So need to close left (since l=2>1) and right (since r=4 <6). So need both.\n\noption1 steps: |3-2| +1 + |2-4| +1 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\noption2 steps: |3-4| +1 + |4-2| +1 = 1 + 1 + 2 +1 = 5. So min(5,5)=5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample 2: Input is 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. So need to close right (since r=3 <6). So steps is |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 +1=1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample 3: Input is 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5. So no need to close anything. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: let's say n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3. So need to close right (r=3 <5). So steps is |2-3| +1 = 1 +1=2 steps. Let's see: move from 2 to 3 (1 step), close right (tabs 4-5). Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=2, l=3, r=4. So need to close left (since l=3>1) and right (since r=4 <5). So steps for option1: |2-3| +1 + |3-4| +1 = 1+1+1+1=4. Option2: |2-4| +1 + |4-3| +1 = 2+1+1+1=5. So min is 4 steps.\n\nBut what's the actual steps? Move to 3 (1 step), close left (tabs 1-2). Then move to 4 (1 step), close right (tabs 5). So total steps 1+1+1+1=4. Correct.\n\nBut what if the pos is 4, l=3, r=4. Need to close left (l=3>1) and r is 4 <5. So steps:\n\noption1: move to l (3) from 4: 1 step. Close left (1 step). Then move to r (4) from 3: 1 step. Close right (1 step). Total 1+1+1+1=4 steps.\n\noption2: move to r (4) from 4: 0 steps. Close right (1 step). Then move to l (3) from 4: 1 step. Close left (1 step). Total 0+1+1+1=3 steps. So min(4,3) is 3 steps.\n\nWait, but according to our previous formula, steps1 would be |pos - l| + ... ?\n\nWait in this case, pos is 4, l is 3, r is 4. So need to close left and right.\n\noption1 steps:\n\n|4-3| (1) +1 (close left) + |3-4| (1) +1 (close right) = 1+1+1+1=4 steps.\n\noption2 steps:\n\n|4 - r| (r is 4) is 0 steps. +1 (close right). Then |r - l| is |4-3|=1 steps. +1 (close left). So total steps is 0+1+1+1=3 steps. Which is better. So our formula for option2 is |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1. Which in this case is 0 + 1 + 1 +1 = 3 steps. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo the code should compute both options and take the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute need_left and need_right.\n\nif not need_left and not need_right: return 0.\n\nelse if need_left and need_right:\n\ncompute steps1 = |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1.\n\ncompute steps2 = |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nreturn min(steps1, steps2).\n\nelse if need_left:\n\nreturn |pos - l| + 1.\n\nelse:\n\nreturn |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what about if the current position is already in the correct place for closing?\n\nLike, for example, need_left and pos is l. Then |pos - l| is 0 steps, so steps is 0 + 1 = 1 step. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: need_left and pos is l-1. So steps is 1 step to move to l, then close. So 1 +1 = 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about when l is 1? Then need_left is false. Because l is 1, so no need to close left. So the code handles that.\n\nBut wait, the code checks if need_left is true. So need_left is l>1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code would be structured as follows.\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nneed_left = l > 1\n\nneed_right = r < n\n\nif not need_left and not need_right:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif need_left and need_right:\n\n    steps1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n\n    steps2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n\n    print(min(steps1, steps2))\n\nelif need_left:\n\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\nWait, but let's check the second sample input.\n\nSample 2: input is 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. So need_left is l>1? No, l is 1. So need_left is false. need_right is r <n (3 <6) yes. So code enters else clause: print abs(3 - 3) + 1 = 0 +1 =1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample 3: input is 5 2 1 5. So need_left is false, need_right is false. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=3, r=4. So need_left is 3>1 → yes. need_right is 4 <5 → yes. steps1 is |2-3| +1 + |3-4| +1 → 1+1+1+1=4. steps2 is |2-4| +1 + |4-3| +1 → 2+1+1+1=5. min is 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case where the order matters: pos=4, l=3, r=4. need_left and need_right. steps1 is |4-3| +1 + |3-4| +1 = 1+1+1+1=4. steps2 is |4-4| +1 + |4-3| +1 = 0+1+1+1=3. So min is 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut according to the code, steps2 is computed as abs(pos - r) +1 + abs(r - l) +1. So in this case, r is 4, l is 3. So steps2 is (0) + 1 + (1) +1 = 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut wait, what about when the current position is already in the [l, r] range. For example, pos is 3, l=2, r=4. So steps for option1 is |3-2| +1 + |2-4| +1 = 1 +1 + 2 +1 = 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l? Let's say pos is 2, l=2, r=4. steps1 is |2-2| +1 + |2-4| +1 → 0 +1 +2 +1 =4 steps. steps2 is |2-4| +1 + |4-2| +1 → 2+1+2+1=6. So min is 4 steps.\n\nWhich makes sense. Moving to l (already there), close left (1 step). Then move to r (4) from l (2) is 2 steps, then close right (1 step). Total 0+1+2+1=4 steps.\n\nBut why is the steps for moving from l to r equal to |l - r|? Because that's the number of steps to move from l to r. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if after closing left, the a is l, and the movement to r is allowed. So, for example, after closing left, the a is l, and the current position is l. Then moving to r is possible.\n\nYes. So the steps are correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to cover all cases.\n\nBut wait, let's think of another case where after closing left, you can close right without moving. For example, if l = r. For instance, n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3. So need to close left (l=3>1) and need to close right (r=3 <5). So steps1 is |3-3| +1 + |3-3| +1 = 0+1+0+1=2 steps. steps2 is |3-3| +1 + |3-3| +1 = same. So total steps is 2. What does that mean?\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nClose left (current position is 3). Close left (which closes tabs 1-2). Then close right (current position is 3). Close right (closes tabs 4-5). So two steps. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: pos is 1, l=2, r=3, n=5. need_left (l=2>1) and need_right (r=3 <5). steps1: |1-2| +1 + |2-3| +1 = 1 +1 +1 +1 =4 steps. steps2: |1-3| +1 + |3-2| +1 → 2+1+1+1=5. So min is 4 steps.\n\nWhich would involve moving to 2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1). Then move to 3 (1 step), close right (tabs 4-5). Total steps 1+1+1+1=4 steps. Correct.\n\nBut what if the initial position is to the right of r? Like, n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. need_left and need_right. So steps1: |5-2| =3 steps to move to l. Then close left (1). Then move from l (2) to r (3): 1 step. Close right (1). Total 3+1+1+1=6 steps. steps2: |5-3| =2 steps to move to r. close right (1). Then move from r (3) to l (2): 1 step. close left (1). total 2+1+1+1=5 steps. So min is 5 steps. Which is better.\n\nSo the code would compute steps1 as 3+1 + 1+1= 6 steps, steps2 as 2+1 + 1+1=5 steps. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nBut what about when the current position is already in the middle of the [l, r] range, but the steps to move to l or r is zero?\n\nWait, for example, pos is l. So need_left and need_right. steps1 is 0 +1 + |l - r| +1. steps2 is |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1. So steps1 is (1 + |l - r| + 1) steps. steps2 is (|pos - r| + ...). Which depends on the position.\n\nBut in this case, steps1 is better if moving to l is already done.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: l = r = 1, n=1. Then need_left is false (l=1), need_right is false (r=1 = n). So output 0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=2. Then no need to close anything. Output 0.\n\nEdge case 3: n=2, pos=1, l=2, r=2. So need to close left (since l=2>1). So steps is |1-2| +1 = 1 +1 = 2 steps. Let's see:\n\nMove from 1 to 2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1). So yes, 2 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, pos=2, l=1, r=3. So no need to close anything. Output 0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=2, l=1, r=2. So need to close right (r=2 <3). steps is |2-2| +1 = 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these.\n\nThus, the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input line as four integers n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute need_left = l > 1\n\nneed_right = r < n\n\nif not need_left and not need_right:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif need_left and need_right:\n\n    steps1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n\n    steps2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n\n    print(min(steps1, steps2))\n\nelif need_left:\n\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\nBut wait, what about if the current position is already in the correct place for closing? Like, if need_left and pos is l, then steps is 0 +1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut let me test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → need_left and need_right.\n\nsteps1 = |3-2| +1 + |2-4| +1 = 1+1+2+1=5\n\nsteps2 = |3-4| +1 + |4-2| +1 → 1+1+2+1=5 → min 5. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3 → need_right. steps is |3-3| +1 → 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 5 2 1 5 → 0. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input from the problem's examples:\n\nThird input is '5 2 1 5' → output 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nBut wait, let's think about another case where the cursor is already in the correct position to close both left and right. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. So need_left (l=2>1) and need_right (r=3 <5). So steps1: |3-2| +1 + |2-3| +1 → 1+1+1+1=4 steps. steps2: |3-3| +1 + |3-2| +1 → 0+1+1+1=3 steps. So min is 3 steps. Which is correct: move to r (3) is already there. Close right (tabs 4-5). Then move to l (2) from r (3) is 1 step. Close left (tabs 1). So steps: 0+1 (close right) +1 (move) +1 (close left) = 3 steps. Correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead input as four integers. The input is given as a single line, but in the example given in the problem statement, the input is given as multiple lines? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user shows three inputs, like:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So the code needs to read one line of input.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the sample input shows multiple lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So the code should read a single line.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is a single line with four integers. The sample input shows three examples, but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the code is supposed to read a single line of input. So the code should process one line.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and print the output. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases? Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nSo, the code should read one line of input (as per the problem's input description) and output one line of output.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three input lines. However, that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem's input is described as a single line. So perhaps the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one line per test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut that's probably for three separate test cases. However, the code is supposed to read one line of input, and output one line of output. So, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is a single line. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers ...\n\nSo the code should read a single line, and output a single integer. The sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case at a time.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the code should read input from",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal steps required to move the cursor and close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Needs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` (need_left) and/or to the right of `r` (need_right) that need to be closed.\n2. **Handle Edge Cases**: If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., the current segment [l, r] already spans the entire range of tabs), the answer is 0.\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - If both left and right tabs need to be closed, compute the steps required for two scenarios: closing left first then right, and closing right first then left. Choose the minimum of these two.\n   - If only left tabs need closing, calculate the steps to move to `l` and close the left tabs.\n   - If only right tabs need closing, calculate the steps to move to `r` and close the right tabs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nneed_left = l > 1\nneed_right = r < n\n\nif not need_left and not need_right:\n    print(0)\nelif need_left and need_right:\n    steps1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n    steps2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n    print(min(steps1, steps2))\nelif need_left:\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Needs**: We check if `l` is greater than 1 (indicating tabs to the left of `l` need closing) and if `r` is less than `n` (indicating tabs to the right of `r` need closing).\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If neither left nor right tabs need closing, the result is immediately 0.\n- **Steps Calculation**:\n  - For both left and right closures, we consider two strategies: moving to `l` first or moving to `r` first. Each strategy involves moving to the target position and closing the respective tabs, summing up the movement and closing steps.\n  - For single-sided closures (either left or right), we directly compute the steps needed to move to the target position and close the tabs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum steps required by considering all possible optimal paths for closing tabs.",
