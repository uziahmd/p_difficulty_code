Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from the guest and host, the total count of each letter should exactly match the count in the pile. If there are any extra letters in the pile or missing letters, then the answer is NO.\n\nSo, the approach here is to take the first two input lines, concatenate them, then check if the combined count of letters matches exactly with the third line's count.\n\nHow to do this in Python?\n\nWell, I can use the collections.Counter class for this. Because Counter allows us to count the occurrences of each character in a string. Then, if we add the counts from the guest and host names, and compare that to the counts from the pile, they should be equal.\n\nWait, but how to handle the concatenation? For example, guest + host's letters. So:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host. Then create a Counter for combined and a Counter for pile. Then check if the two Counters are equal.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So if the counts are the same, regardless of order, it's okay.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n- Read the three lines.\n- Combine the first two into one string.\n- Create a Counter for the combined string and a Counter for the third string.\n- Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length is different from the pile's length? For example, if the combined length is 5 and the pile is 6 letters. Then obviously, the answer is NO. But checking the Counter would automatically take care of that, since the counts would differ. Because, for example, if the pile has an extra letter, the Counter would have an entry for that.\n\nBut let me think. Suppose the combined string has a total length of N, and the pile has a total length of M. If N != M, then the answer is definitely NO. But the Counter approach would catch that because the sum of counts in the combined Counter would be N, and the pile's Counter would sum to M. So if N != M, the Counters can't be equal. So the code can just check if the Counters are equal, which would automatically include checking the total length.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the pile has letters that are not present in the combined string? Like, if the combined has 'A' once, and the pile has 'A' once and 'B' once. Then the Counters would differ, because the pile's Counter has an extra 'B'. So the code would correctly return NO.\n\nYes. So this approach should work.\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines are:\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count all letters.\n\nLet me think. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check the counts.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compare them.\n\nIn the first sample, the code returns YES, which matches the example.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nWait, let's check the counts. For example, the guest is PAPAINOEL (letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L). Host is JOULUPUKKI (J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I).\n\nCombined letters: guest + host.\n\nLet me count the letters. For example, the letter P: guest has 2, host has 1. Total 3. In the pile, let's see: the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile. Let's see:\n\nBreaking down the pile: J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nWait, maybe I should count letters in the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the character counts in the pile exactly match the combined character counts from the guest and host names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string of names and the pile of letters.\n4. **Comparison**: Check if the character counts from the combined string match exactly with those from the pile. If they match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` to handle the input efficiently.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to aggregate all characters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Counter Usage**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile. This allows for an efficient and straightforward comparison of character counts.\n- **Comparison Check**: By comparing the two counters, we ensure that every character in the pile matches exactly with the combined characters from the guest and host names, both in count and type. If they match, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters required, handling all edge cases such as differing lengths or extra characters in the pile.",
