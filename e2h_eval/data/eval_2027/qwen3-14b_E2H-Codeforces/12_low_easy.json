The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task must be done in a specific house, and she can only do the i-th task after all tasks before it (with numbers less than i) are done. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nSo, the input is n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of m integers representing the house numbers for each task. The output is the total time taken.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to model her movement. Since the ringroad is circular, moving clockwise. Each move between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. She starts at house 1.\n\nThe key here is to calculate the time taken to move from one task's house to the next, considering the direction (clockwise) and the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The steps are:\n\nStart at 1. She needs to go to 3. How many steps? Well, moving clockwise from 1 to 3: 1→2→3, which is 2 steps. Then, the next task is 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then, the third task is 3 again. She's at 2, so moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2+3+1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to track her current position and accumulate the time needed to get to each task's house, considering the direction.\n\nBut how to compute the steps between two houses?\n\nFor two consecutive houses, current and next, the steps needed would be (next - current) mod n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Because if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - current + next) steps? Let me think.\n\nWait, the houses are arranged in a circle. For example, if current is at position a and needs to go to position b, moving clockwise. The number of steps is (b - a) if b >= a. But if b < a, then it's (n - a + b). So overall, (b - a + n) % n. But wait, because if a is 3, b is 2, then (2-3 +4) = 3 steps. Which is correct for n=4. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair of tasks, we calculate the steps between them using that formula. But wait, the tasks are given in order. So for the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m, we need to process them in order. So the initial position is 1. Then, for each task in order, compute the steps from the previous position to the current task's house, add that to the total, and update the current position.\n\nWait, but the tasks are in order. So for example, the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So Xenia must do them in sequence. So the movement is from the initial position (1) to a_1, then from a_1 to a_2, then from a_2 to a_3, etc. So the total time is the sum of the steps between each consecutive pair of positions, including the initial position.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   steps = (current_task - current_position + n) % n\n\n   total_time += steps\n\n   current_position = current_task\n\nWait, but why? Because for each task, you have to move from your current position to the new task's position. And since the tasks are processed in order, you can't skip any. So even if a task is in the same house as the previous one, you still have to account for that (but steps would be zero).\n\nWait, but for example, if the previous position is 3 and the current task is 3, then steps is (3-3 +n) mod n = 0. So adding zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo that seems right.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through the list of tasks, compute the steps between current position and next task's house, add to total, update current position.\n\nBut what about the initial position? Let's see. The first task is a_1. The initial position is 1. So steps from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1 + n) % n. Then for the next task, steps from",
