The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the time between consecutive tasks. Suppose she is currently at position current, and the next task is at position next. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n if we take the shortest path. Wait, no. Wait, because moving clockwise, if current is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But (next - current) would be -1, but mod n would be 3. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be written as (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is less than current, then (next - current) is negative. For example, current is 3, next is 2. (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) % n. But wait, no. Because if next is 3 and current is 1, then (3-1) is 2, which is correct. If next is 1 and current is 3, then (1-3) is -2 mod 4 is 2. Which is correct, because moving clockwise from 3 to 1 would take 2 steps (3→4→1). So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n. But wait, in the first example given:\n\nIn the first example input, n=4, m=3, and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. Let's see the steps.\n\nShe starts at 1. The first task is at 3. The distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the next task is at 2. So from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct: 3→4→1→2, 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3: 1 step. So total steps are 2 + 3 + 1 = 6, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is: for each consecutive pair of tasks, calculate the distance between them, sum them all. But wait, the initial position is 1. So the first task's distance is from 1 to a_1. Then from a_1 to a_2, etc. So the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, including the first step from 1 to a_1.\n\nBut wait, what if the tasks are in the same house? Like, if a_i is same as a_{i-1}, then the distance is zero. So we can process all the tasks in order, and for each step, calculate the distance between current position and the next task's position.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a:\n\n    distance = (task - current_position) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_position = task\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but why? Because each time, moving from current_position to the next task's position, which is the minimal steps required.\n\nYes. Let's test this with the first example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2 → add 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3 → add 3. total 5. current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3",
