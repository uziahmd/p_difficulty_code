Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Well, since swaps between 0 and 1 can be done any number of times, and similarly between 1 and 2, but not between 0 and 2. So, maybe the 0s can move past 1s, and 2s can move past 1s, but 0s and 2s can't pass each other. Wait, that's an important point. Because if you can't swap 0 and 2, then their relative order can't be changed. So, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, they can't swap. But 0s can move past 1s, and 2s can move past 1s. So the 1s can act as a sort of bridge between 0s and 2s. But the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order.\n\nWait, so the idea is that the 0s can be rearranged among themselves, but only in positions where they can move through 1s. Similarly for 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. So the overall structure of the string would have the original order of 0s and 2s, but with 1s possibly moved around between them. But how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of grouping. For example, suppose the original string has some 0s, 1s, and 2s. Since 0s can move past 1s, but not 2s, and 2s can move past 1s but not 0s, the relative order of 0s and 2s must remain the same. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 2 in the original string, you can't swap them. So in the final string, all 0s must appear before any 2s that were originally before them. Wait, no. Suppose there's a 0 followed by a 2. Then in the final string, that 0 must still be before that 2. Because you can't swap them. But if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, then you can move the 0 past the 1, and the 2 past the 1. So maybe the 0s and 2s can be arranged in their original order, but with 1s in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the relative order of 0s and 2s cannot change. Because any 0 and 2 that are not adjacent can't be swapped. So for example, if the original string has a 0 at position i and a 2 at position j where i < j, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. Because you can't swap them. Therefore, the 0s and 2s in the original string must appear in the same order as in the original string. However, the 1s can be rearranged freely between them, but also can be moved around.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n- The 0s and 2s must maintain their original order. So, the positions of 0s and 2s in the original string determine their order in the final string. The 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s, but how?\n\nBut wait, the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. For example, if there's a 1 next to a 0, they can be swapped. Similarly with 2s. So the 1s can be moved around, but the 0s and 2s can't pass each other.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Split the original string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s, but considering that 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. Then, arrange the 1s in between them in a way that minimizes the lex order.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about this is that the 0s and 2s can be considered as fixed in their relative order, but the 1s can be placed in any positions between them. However, the 1s can be moved freely. So, for example, if there are multiple 1s in the original string, they can be grouped together. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be broken down as follows: the final string will consist of the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, but with 1s inserted between them. However",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string from a given ternary string by performing specific adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be directly swapped, so their relative order in the original string must be preserved.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preserve Relative Order of '0's and '2's**: Since '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly, their relative order in the original string must remain unchanged.\n2. **Group '1's**: All '1's can be moved freely around '0's and '2's. Therefore, we can collect all '1's and place them in between the '0's and '2's in such a way that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.\n3. **Construct the Result**: We construct the result by iterating through the original string, collecting '0's and '2's in their original order and placing the collected '1's between them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    # Split the string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(char)\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append(char)\n        else:\n            twos.append(char)\n    \n    # Now, combine them with the 1s placed between 0s and 2s\n    result = []\n    i = j = k = 0\n    while i < len(zeros) or j < len(ones) or k < len(twos):\n        # Add as many 1s as possible at the beginning\n        if j < len(ones):\n            result.append('1')\n            j += 1\n        # Then add the next 0 if available\n        if i < len(zeros):\n            result.append('0')\n            i += 1\n        # Then add the remaining 1s\n        if j < len(ones):\n            result.append('1')\n            j += 1\n        # Then add the next 2 if available\n        if k < len(twos):\n            result.append('2')\n            k += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and process each test case\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    test_cases = input_str.split(' ')\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(min_ternary_string(case))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The input string is split into three separate lists: one for '0's, one for '1's, and one for '2's. This helps in maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's while allowing '1's to be rearranged.\n2. **Constructing the Result**: The result string is constructed by first placing as many '1's as possible at the beginning, followed by the '0's and '2's in their original order. This ensures that the '1's are placed optimally to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently processes the string in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 characters.",
