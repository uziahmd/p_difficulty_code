Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need to find the minimal number of such cards required.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The target is to have the total sum be zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards (each with value between -x and x) that sum up to T. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible ways. Each card can contribute between -x and x. So for each card added, the maximum possible contribution towards T is x, and the minimum is -x.\n\nBut since we want the minimal number of cards, we need to maximize the contribution per card. So, for example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute as much as possible (x) towards it. Similarly, if T is negative, each card can contribute as little as possible (-x). But wait, the sum of the new cards must be exactly T. So how do we find the minimal number of cards?\n\nLet me think about the absolute value of T. Let's say |T| is the total amount we need to cover. Each card can contribute up to x towards this. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(|T| / x). But wait, maybe not. Because if T is exactly divisible by x, then it's |T|/x. Otherwise, it's (|T|//x) + 1. Wait, but for example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then 5 / 2 is 2.5, so ceil(2.5) is 3. Which would be 2+2+1? But wait, each card can contribute up to x. So for T=5, x=2: two cards can contribute 2 and 2, which is 4. Then we need one more, which is 1. So three cards. So yes, the formula is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. So the answer is zero. But in the problem statement, the initial sum could be zero, but the input may have n=0? No, the input has n ≥ 1. Wait, no, the first line says n is between 1 and 1000. So the initial sum could be zero, but then the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S. This is the sum needed from the new cards.\n3. If T is zero, answer is zero.\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach T, given that each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think again. Let's take T as a positive number. Because if T is negative, then we can consider the same problem with absolute value, since the cards can contribute negative values. For example, if T is -5, then we can think of needing to get a sum of 5 with cards contributing negative values. But since each card can contribute up to -x, the minimal number of cards would be the same as for T=5, because each card can contribute -x (so for T=-5, the sum of the new cards is -5, which is equivalent to getting 5 with cards contributing positive values, but in reverse).\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is determined by the absolute value of T. So the formula is:\n\nnumber_of_cards = ceil( |T| / x )\n\nBut wait, let's check some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum S is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 = 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the example.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4. T is 4. x is 3. So |T| is 4. 4 / 3 is 1.333..., ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: suppose T is 5 and x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666, so ceil is 2. So two cards. How? 3 + 2 = 5. But each card can contribute up to 3. So yes, two cards.\n\nAnother example: T is 3, x is 3. Then 3/3 = 1, so one card.\n\nBut what if T is 1 and x is 1? Then 1/1 is 1. So one card.\n\nYes. So the formula seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute sum S of the found cards.\n\nIf S is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute T = -S. Then compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x )\n\nWait, but how to compute ceil of division in Python?\n\nWell, for integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b - 1) // b.\n\nSo for example, 5 / 3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. (5 +3 -1 )//3 = 7//3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for |T| divided by x, the minimal number of cards is (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut let's make sure that this works for all cases.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsum_S = sum of found cards.\n\nif sum_S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    T = -sum_S\n\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n\n    min_cards = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nBut wait, is there any case where this might not work?\n\nWait, what if x is larger than |T|? For example, T is 2, x is 3. Then (2 +3-1)//3 = 4//3=1. Which is correct. Because one card with 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: T=4, x=3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this formula seems correct.\n\nBut let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: sum is 2. T is -2. abs_T is 2. x is 2. (2 + 2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSample 2: sum is -4. T is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother example: sum is 5, x=5. Then (5 +5-1)/5 =9//5=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 6, x=5. (6+5-1)/5 =10//5=2. Which is correct (5+1=6, but 5+1 is two cards. Or 5+ (1) but 1 is allowed as x is 5. So yes.)\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum of the list.\n\nif sum_S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    T = -sum_S\n\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n\n    min_cards = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but why is this correct? Because each card can contribute up to x towards the sum. So the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of (abs_T / x).\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about if x is zero? No, the input constraints say x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nLet me check the sample input again.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1 and the number is 1. So sum_S is 1. T is -1. abs_T is 1. x=1. (1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Which is correct. So one card of -1.\n\nAnother test case: sum_S is 3, x=2. T is -3. abs_T is 3. (3+2-1)/2 =4/2=2. So two cards. For example, -2 and -1. Sum is -3. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead the input: first line is n and x. Second line is the list of numbers.\n\nIn Python, read from stdin. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nThe first input line is '3 2\\n-1 1 2' — but in code, we need to read two lines. Wait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and x, the second line is the list of numbers.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead first line: split into n and x.\n\nRead second line: split into list of integers.\n\nCompute sum_S.\n\nIf sum_S is zero, output 0.\n\nElse compute T = -sum_S, then compute (abs(T) + x -1 ) //x.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the numbers on the cards can be any integer from -x to x. So the maximum possible per card is x, but the minimum is -x. So for example, if T is 5, and x is 3, then you can have two cards: 3 and 2. So the sum is 5. So the formula works.\n\nBut what if T is 5, x is 3. So (5 +3 -1 )//3 = 7//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read list of numbers.\n\nsum_S = sum(numbers)\n\nif sum_S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    t = -sum_S\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    res = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n\n    print(res)\n\nYes.\n\nNow let's check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2. So t is -2. abs_t is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 → 3//2=1 → correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. t is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 → 6/3=2 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1 and the number is 0. sum_S is 0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1 and number is 1 → sum_S is 1 → t is -1. (1 +1-1)/1 = 1 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum_S is 4, x is 2. So t is -4. (4 +2-1)/2 =5//2=2. Which is correct (two cards of -2 each).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, when reading input, sometimes there may be leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead first line as n, x. Then read second line as list of integers.\n\nHandle the case where sum is zero.\n\nElse compute as above.\n\nSo:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnumbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_s = sum(numbers)\n\nif sum_s == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    t = -sum_s\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    res = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n\n    print(res)\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's check the example where sum is zero. Like input:\n\nn=2, x=3, numbers are 1 and -1. sum is 0 → output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: sum is 0 but with multiple numbers. So output is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nSo this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the current sum. This ensures that when added to the current sum, the total becomes zero.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: Using the absolute value of the target sum, determine the minimum number of cards required. Each card can contribute up to x towards the target sum. The minimum number of cards needed is calculated using the formula `ceil(|target| / x)`, which can be efficiently computed as `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnumbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_s = sum(numbers)\nif sum_s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t = -sum_s\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    res = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on a card). The second line contains the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards. If this sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed, and the result is zero.\n3. **Target Calculation**: If the sum is not zero, calculate the target sum needed from the new cards as the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, compute the minimum number of cards required by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by `x`, adjusting for ceiling division using the formula `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of cards required using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
