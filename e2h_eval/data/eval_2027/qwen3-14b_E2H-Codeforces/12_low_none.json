The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the time between consecutive tasks. Suppose she is currently at position current, and the next task is at position next. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n if we take the shortest path. Wait, no. Wait, because moving clockwise, if current is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But (next - current) would be -1, but mod n would be 3. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next is larger than current, else (n - current + next). Which can be written as (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is smaller than current, then (next - current) is negative. For example, current is 3, next is 2. (2-3) is -1. Mod 4 would be 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be calculated as (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is 2 and current is 3, (2-3) is -1. Mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the formula for the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be written as (next - current + n) % n. Because adding n and then mod n would give the correct value. For example, when next is 2 and current is 3: (2-3 +4) = 3, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. If next is 3 and current is 2, then (3-2 +4) mod4 is 1, which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current + n) % n. But wait, what if next is equal to current? Then the distance is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is to track Xenia's current position, and for each task in order, calculate the distance from her current position to the task's house, add that to the total time, and then update her current position to the task's house.\n\nBut wait, the tasks have to be done in order. So the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So even if a_2 is the same as a_1, she has to do it, but the time is zero. So the problem says that she can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if the tasks are [3,3], then the time between them is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   compute the distance between current_position and a_i, add to total_time.\n\n   set current_position to a_i.\n\nSo that's the plan. Now, the problem is to process each task in order, and accumulate the time.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current and next?\n\nYes, as discussed, (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because for example, when current is 3, next is 2, n is 4. (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance is (next - current) % n. Wait, but (next - current) mod n can be negative? No, because in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. Wait, in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3, so yes. So the formula (next - current) % n gives the correct distance.\n\nWait, but for example, if current is 1 and next is 3, n=4. (3-1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task in sequence, calculate the time required to move from Xenia's current position to the house where the task needs to be completed.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, the distance between two houses can be computed using modular arithmetic. Specifically, moving from house `current` to house `next` takes `(next - current) % n` units of time if moving clockwise. This formula accounts for both direct and wrap-around movements around the ringroad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor next_house in a:\n    diff = (next_house - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = next_house\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1, and initialize the total time to zero.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n- **Update Position**: After calculating the time for each move, update Xenia's current position to the house where the task was completed.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that each task is processed in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(m), which is efficient given the problem constraints.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases, including consecutive tasks at the same house and wrap-around movements around the ringroad.",
