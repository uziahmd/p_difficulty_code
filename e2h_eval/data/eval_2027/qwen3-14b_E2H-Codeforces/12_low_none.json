The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the time between consecutive tasks. Suppose she is currently at position current, and the next task is at position next. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n if we take the shortest path. Wait, no. Wait, because moving clockwise, if current is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But (next - current) would be -1, but mod n would be 3. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be written as (next - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if next is less than current, then (next - current) is negative. For example, current is 3, next is 2. (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) % n. But wait, in the case where next is equal to current, the distance is zero.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that moving from a house to a neighboring one takes one unit. So moving from current to next in clockwise direction requires (next - current) steps if next is larger than current. If next is smaller, then it's (n - current + next) steps. So the formula (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which is equivalent to (next - current) % n if the mod is handled properly. But since in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results, perhaps (next - current) % n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nWait, for example, when current is 3 and next is 2, (2-3) is -1. Mod 4 would be 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance is (next - current) % n. But wait, if current is 1 and next is 1, the distance is zero. So that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is: process the tasks in order, keeping track of Xenia's current position. For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house, add that to the total time, and then update the current position to the task's house.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given as a list a_1 to a_m. However, the note says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the time between them is zero. So processing them in order, the code will add zero for the movement between them.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m:\n\n   compute the distance between current_position and a_i.\n\n   add that distance to total_time.\n\n   set current_position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i before doing task i. So the order of the tasks is fixed as per their indices. So the list a_1 to a_m is the order in which the tasks must be done. So the code needs to process the list in order.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nThe initial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. The distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Add 2 to total_time. Now current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. So add 3. Total is 5. Now current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3 is 1. Add",
