Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings (guest and host), concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in that concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third string (the pile).\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from the collections module. Because Counter can count the frequency of each character in a string.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Combine the first two into one string.\n3. Create a Counter for the combined string and a Counter for the third string.\n4. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, how about the order? Well, Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both have the same counts for all characters, then it's a match.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases. For example, if the combined length of guest and host is different from the pile's length. Then it's automatically NO. But checking the Counter would take care of that, since if the counts are different, the Counter would differ.\n\nBut maybe checking the lengths first could be an optimization. Because if the lengths are different, we can immediately return NO. Otherwise, proceed to check the counts.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps just creating the Counters and comparing them is easier. Because even if the lengths are different, the Counter comparison would catch that. For example, if the combined string has a total length of 5 and the pile has 6, then the Counters would not be equal.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile), then YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the Counter is a subclass of dict. So comparing two Counters with == would check if all key-value pairs are equal. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about the case where there are letters in the pile that are not present in the combined string? For example, if the pile has an extra 'X', then the Counter would have that key, which the combined string's Counter doesn't. So the comparison would return False.\n\nYes. So that's handled.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS, host: DEDMOROZ. Combined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nLet me check the counts. Let's see:\n\nCombined string: Let's count letters. Let's think:\n\nSANTA CLAUS DED MOROZ. Wait, but the exact letters may vary. But the Counter would handle it.\n\nThe sample says that the first case outputs YES. So the code would return True.\n\nSecond example: guest is PAPAINOEL, host JOULUPUKKI. Combined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nWait, let's check the counts. Let me think:\n\nOriginal combined string: PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count letters. Let's see:\n\nP: Let's count in guest and host.\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL → P appears 2 times (P, P), A, etc.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So P once here.\n\nSo combined P count is 2 + 1 = 3?\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count P's here. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the pile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's see:\n\nBreaking down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nWait, maybe I should count letters. Let me think:\n\nIn the pile, how many P's? There's a P in \"NAP\" and another P in \"LUP\"? So maybe two P's? But the combined string has 3 P's. So the pile would have two, leading to a discrepancy. Hence, the output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code would catch that.\n\nThird example: guest is BABBONATALE, host FATHERCHRISTMAS. Combined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nWait, the sample says there's an extra L. Let me see:\n\nCombined string: BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. Let's count letters.\n\nFor example, the guest is BABBONATALE: B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E. Host is FATHERCHRISTMAS: F, A, T, H, E, R, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S.\n\nSo combined letters: Let's count the letters. Let's think about the letters in the pile.\n\nThe pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me check the counts. For example, the combined string has a certain number of Ls. Let's see:\n\nIn the guest's name: BABBONATALE → one L. Host's name: FATHERCHRISTMAS → no L. So combined has 1 L. But the pile may have more. Let me check the pile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nBreaking down the pile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let's count the Ls. Let's see:\n\nLooking for L's:\n\n- BONATALLE has two Ls (the 'LL' in BONATALLE?), maybe. Let me think:\n\nBONATALLE: B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E. So two Ls. So total Ls in pile is 2. But the combined string has only one. So that's why the answer is NO.\n\nSo the code would compare the Counters and find that the pile has an extra L, so output NO.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python, we need to read three lines. But how? Because the input is given as three lines. So in code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n\nThen, compare Counter(combined) with Counter(pile). If equal, print YES else NO.\n\nBut need to import Counter from collections.\n\nSo code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the combined string and pile have same length but different characters? Like, for example, combined is \"AB\" and pile is \"BA\" — then the Counter would be same. So that's correct.\n\nAnother case: combined is \"AAB\", pile is \"ABA\" — same counts, so YES.\n\nBut if combined is \"AAB\" and pile is \"ABB\", then counts would differ (A:2 vs A:1, B:2 vs B:1). So the code would return NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... ]\n\nWait, the first input line is 'SANTACLAUS', second 'DEDMOROZ', third 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's check the length.\n\nLength of guest: len(\"SANTACLAUS\") is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S → 10 letters?)\n\nWait, S-A-N-T-A-C-L-A-U-S: 10 letters. Host is DEDMOROZ: D-E-D-M-O-R-O-Z → 8 letters. Combined length is 18. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count the letters:\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → let me count letters. Let me check the length. Let's see:\n\nSANTAMOROZ is 10 letters (S A N T A M O R O Z). Then DEDCLAUS is D E D C L A U S → 8 letters. Total 18. So same length as combined. So the code would compare the counts.\n\nWhich would be correct.\n\nSo the code should output YES for the first case.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nguest is PAPAINOEL (length 9?), host JOULUPUKKI (length 10?), pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nCombined length is 9+10=19. The pile's length is len(\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\") → let me count letters:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's see:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → that's 20 letters? Let me count:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nJ (1), O (2), U (3), L (4), N (5), A (6), P (7), A (8), O (9), I (10), L (11), E (12), L (13), U (14), P (15), U (16), K (17), K (18), I (19). Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Or perhaps the actual length is 19? Well, the sample says that the output is NO because there's a missing P and an extra L. So the code would catch that.\n\nBut the code would compare the counts. So the code should work.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case when the combined string is empty? But the problem says that all lines are non-empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when all letters are same. For example, guest is \"AAA\", host is \"AAA\", pile is \"AAAAAA\". Then code returns YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. If pile is \"AA\", then NO.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in both the combined string of the guest and host names, and the pile of letters.\n4. **Comparison**: Compare the character counts of the combined string and the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure we handle any potential leading or trailing whitespace correctly.\n- **Combining Strings**: By concatenating the guest and host names, we create a single string that represents all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Character Counting with Counter**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module efficiently counts the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: Directly comparing the two counters checks if both have the same characters with the same frequencies, ensuring that the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names exactly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the presence of exactly the right number of each character, which is both time and space efficient given the constraints.",
