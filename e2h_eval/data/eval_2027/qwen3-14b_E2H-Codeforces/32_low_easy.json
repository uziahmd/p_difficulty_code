    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, I need to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think. The initial approach would be to consider each element, remove it, and compute the instability of the remaining array. But if I do this naively for each element, it would take O(n^2) time, which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5. That's way too slow. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but what's the instability of the array when we remove one element? The instability is max of the array minus min of the array. But when we remove an element, the new max and min could be the same as before or different. For example, if the original array has max and min at the ends, maybe removing one of them reduces the instability.\n\nSo, the key here is that the original array's max and min might be affected by which element we remove. So perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the first occurrence of the max or the first occurrence of the min, but not sure. Wait, but maybe not. For example, if there are multiple elements with the same value as the max or min.\n\nWait, let's think about the original array. Suppose the array is sorted. Then the instability is the last element minus the first. If we remove one element, the new instability would depend on which element we remove. For instance, if we have a sorted array, then removing the first element would leave the max as the last element and the min as the second element. Similarly, removing the last element would leave the max as the second last and min as the first. But if we remove an element in the middle, the min and max remain the same. So in that case, the instability would be the same as the original. Therefore, the best option is to remove either the first element or the last element, which would give us the minimal instability.\n\nWait, but that's only if the array is sorted. So maybe the problem can be approached by considering the sorted array. Let me think again.\n\nIf the array is sorted, then the instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, when you remove one element, the new instability depends on which element you remove. For example, if you remove the first element, the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If you remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. If you remove any other element, the instability remains a[-1] - a[0]. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, that's only if the array is sorted. So perhaps the solution is to sort the array first, then check the possible options of removing the first element, the last element, or some other element. Wait, but in the original array, maybe the max and min are not the first and last elements. Oh, but if we sort the array, then the min is the first element and the max is the last. So for the original array, the instability is a[-1] - a[0], but when we remove one element, the new instability would be determined by the new min and max. However, if the array is sorted, then the min and max of the new array would be either the same as the original (if we remove an element not at the ends) or adjusted if we remove one of the ends.\n\nWait, but in this case, the minimal instability after removing one element would be the minimum between (max of the array without the first element minus min of the array without the first element) and (max of the array without the last element minus min of the array without the last element). Because if you remove any element in the middle, the max and min remain the same as the original array. So the instability would be the same as original, which may not be better than the two options of removing the first or last element.\n\nWait, but in the sorted array, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If you remove an element that is not the first or last, then the new array's max is still a[-1], and min is a[0], so the instability is same as before. So in that case, the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nSo, the answer would be the minimum between these two values.\n\nWait, but that's only when the array is sorted. So the idea is: sort the array, then for each possible removal of one element, check the instability. However, since the array is sorted, the only possible",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. The optimal approach involves sorting the array and considering the effect of removing either the first or last element, which can potentially reduce the instability.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the potential minima and maxima after removing elements.\n2. **Evaluate Instability After Removal**: After sorting, the instability when removing the first element or the last element can be evaluated by considering the new minima and maxima. Removing any other element from the middle of the sorted array does not change the overall minima or maxima, hence the instability remains the same as the original array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    a.sort()\n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    # Check removing the first element\n    instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    # Check removing the last element\n    instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an integer `n` (number of elements) and a list of integers `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to facilitate efficient evaluation of potential minima and maxima.\n3. **Instability Calculation**: By considering the removal of the first and last elements of the sorted array, we calculate the resulting instability. The minimum of these two values is the answer, as removing any other element would not change the overall minima or maxima, thus leaving the instability unchanged.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is $O(n \\log n)$, making it suitable for large input sizes up to $10^5$.",
