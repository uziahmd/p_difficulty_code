He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a and b (or R), and a number c in base a. My task is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals correctly when required.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps needed:\n\n1. Parse the input: Read a and b (where b might be 'R'), then read the number c as a string in base a.\n2. Convert the number c from base a to a decimal integer.\n3. If b is not 'R', convert that decimal integer to base b, without leading zeros.\n4. If b is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n\nBut wait, there's a note that says when Roman numerals are involved, the number is guaranteed to be <= 3000 in decimal and not zero. So for the Roman case, we don't have to handle numbers beyond that.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n- Convert the input string c (base a) to a decimal number.\n- Then, depending on the target base (b or R), convert it to the appropriate representation.\n\nLet's think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have digits up to a-1. But since a can be up to 25, the digits can be letters (like A for 10, etc.)? Wait, the problem says that when converting to base b, for bases greater than 10, letters are used. But for the input c, which is in base a, how are the digits represented?\n\nWait, the input c is given as a string. For example, in the sample input, there's 'A' in one of the cases. So the input c may contain letters for digits higher than 9. For example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-9, A (10), B (11). So when converting from base a, each character in the input string represents a digit in base a. So, for example, if the input is 'A', then in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo first, I need to parse the input string into a decimal value. How to do that?\n\nFor each character in the string, convert it to its numerical value. For example, '0' is 0, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So for each character, we can check if it's a digit or a letter. For letters, uppercase? Probably, since the input examples have uppercase letters. The problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3.\n\nSo, for the conversion from base a to decimal, I need to process each character of the input string. Let's write a helper function to convert a string in base a to decimal.\n\nBut wait, the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. So for example, if a is 10, then the input is a normal decimal number. But if a is 16, then the input can have digits up to F (assuming letters are used for digits above 9). However, the problem says that in the input, the number c may have letters only if the base allows. But how are the digits represented in the input? The problem says that when converting to base b, for bases greater than 10, letters are used. But for the input c, which is in base a, the same applies. So for example, if a is 12, then digits in c can be 0-9, A (10), B (11).\n\nSo for the input string, each character represents a digit in base a. So, for example, the input 'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, the first step is to process the input string into a decimal integer. How to do that?\n\nLet me think: For each character in the string, we need to get its value. For example, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, ..., '9' is 9, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, up to 'Z' for 35? But since a can be up to 25, the maximum digit value is a-1. So for example, if a is 25, then the digits can be 0-24, which would be represented as 0-9, A-O (since 10 is A, 15 is F, 16 is G, ..., 24 is O?).\n\nBut the input c is given as a string. So, for each character in the input, we need to convert it to its numeric value. For example, the code for converting the input string to decimal would be something like:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but this assumes that the input is valid. The problem says that the input is correct, so we don't have to handle invalid characters.\n\nBut the input may have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, '001' in base 2 would be 1 in decimal.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert it to base b, or to Roman numerals.\n\nNow, the second part is converting from decimal to base b, or to Roman.\n\nCase 1: b is not R. So, convert the decimal number to base b. The output must not have leading zeros. For example, if the number is zero, but according to the note, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. However, in other cases, the input can be zero? Wait, the problem says that in the input, if Roman is involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the number can be zero? Let me check the problem statement.\n\nThe input says that \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\"\n\nSo, when the output is not Roman, the input can be zero? Well, the input c is a non-negative integer. So for example, if the input c is zero, then when converting to base b (non-R), the output is zero. But the problem says that the input may have leading zeros but the actual value can be zero. So, for example, if the input is '0' in base 10, then converting to base 2 would be '0'.\n\nBut the output must omit leading zeros. So, for example, if the converted number is zero, the output is '0'.\n\nSo, for converting decimal to base b (non-R), the steps are:\n\n- If the number is zero, output '0'.\n- Else, convert the number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for digits >=10. For example, if the base is 16, then 10 is 'A', 15 is 'F', etc.\n\nSo how to implement that?\n\nFor example, the code for converting decimal to base b:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # rem is 10 to base-1, so convert to letters\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    # digits are in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but what if the number is zero? Then the function returns '0'. Otherwise, for example, if n is 0, but the input is zero. But in the problem statement, when the output is not Roman, the input can be zero. For example, in the sample input, the first example is '10 2\\n1' which is converting 1 (base 10) to base 2, which is '1'.\n\nAnother sample input is '2 2\\n1111001' which is converting 1111001 in base 2 to base 2, which is same as input, but output is '1111001'.\n\nSo, the code for converting decimal to base b seems okay.\n\nCase 2: b is R. So, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nRoman numerals have specific rules. The standard way is to use the subtractive notation for certain values. For example, 4 is IV, 9 is IX, 40 is XL, 90 is XC, 400 is CD, 900 is CM.\n\nThe approach for converting to Roman numerals is to create a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. Then, for each value, subtract as many as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, the standard list is:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, while the number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nSo, for example, 4 becomes IV, 5 is V, etc.\n\nSo, the code for converting decimal to Roman would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman case is guaranteed to be between 1 and 3000 inclusive. So we don't have to handle zero or numbers beyond that.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe steps for the code:\n\nRead the input. The first line has a and b. The second line has c.\n\nBut the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as two lines per test case. But in the sample input, it's given as a list of strings. But the actual input for the code is via standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or is the input one test case?\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a...\n\nSo each test case is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, looking back, the sample input shows that the user provided multiple test cases, but the problem description says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case per run?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is two lines. So the sample input is a list of multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. Wait, but the sample input shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is a and b, then next line is c. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one test case. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1' which is a=10, b=2, c=1. The output is '1'.\n\nThe second input line is '16 R\\n5', which is a=16, b=R, c=5. Output is 'V'.\n\nSo the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. But perhaps in the actual problem, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. That's confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the sample input and output are presented as lists, which probably represent multiple test cases. But the problem's actual input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. But that's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of strings, each being a separate test case. For example, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich would produce output '1'.\n\nBut in reality, the code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases? But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So that suggests that each test case is two lines. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But that's not clear.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the problem's input format says that each test case is two lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But the problem's input description does not mention that. So perhaps the sample is written in a way that each element of the list is a separate test case. For example, the first test case is the first element of the list, which is two lines. So the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nBut how to know? Because the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then next line contains c. Which implies that the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps the sample input is just an example of multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the output for each test case is given as a list. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. But given that the sample input includes multiple test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is a single test case, but sometimes multiple. But the problem's input description says \"the first line contains...\" which implies a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a critical point. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's input section:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\nSo the input is two lines. Therefore, the code is supposed to read one test case. The sample input shows multiple test cases, but perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. However, the sample output shows the outputs for each of those test cases. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. But that would make the sample output not match. For example, the first sample input is '10 2\\n1' which is two lines, and the output is '1'.\n\nBut in programming contests, usually, the code reads from stdin. So the code should process multiple test cases if the input has them. But the problem's input description is unclear. However, the sample input shows that the code must process multiple test cases, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but each test case is given as two lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nSecond test case:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nThird test case:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTherefore, the code should process multiple test cases. But how to know how many test cases there are? The problem statement does not mention that. However, in the sample input, the code's input is given as a list of strings, but in practice, the code would read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read until EOF, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? For example, in programming contests, when multiple test cases are present, they are often given as multiple lines. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, but in this problem, that's not mentioned. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case, but the sample shows multiple. However, the sample's output is a list of outputs for each test case, which implies that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is confusing. But looking at the sample input and output, the code must read multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1' which is two lines. Then the next is '16 R\\n5', etc. But how to read them? Well, perhaps the code is supposed to read all lines from stdin, split into pairs of lines, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, the code can read all lines, then process them in pairs. For example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n    a_and_b_line = lines[i]\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n    # process test case\n\nBut this would work if the input is given as multiple test cases, each with two lines. However, the problem's input description says that the input is two lines. Therefore, perhaps the problem's sample input is a mistake, and the code should process one test case. However, the sample input and output suggest that multiple test cases are present.\n\nBut the user's problem says that the code should read input from standard input and print the desired outputs. So, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. But given the sample input and output, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of test cases, and the output is a list of outputs. So, for example, the first input is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich outputs '1'.\n\nBut how to read that in code? The code should read two lines per test case.\n\nTherefore, in the code, I will process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. However, the problem's input description may not mention this. But given that the sample shows multiple test cases, perhaps that's the intended approach.\n\nBut how to handle that in the code? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs, and process each pair.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to have one test case. However, given the sample input, I need to figure out what's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each element is a test case, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. For example, the first element is the first test case, but the code is supposed to read from stdin once. However, the sample input shows that the code must process multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's input is multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description is unclear. However, given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, and the output is a list of outputs, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code must read multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read lines until EOF, grouping them into pairs.\n\nBut how to handle this in code? For example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        # process a_b_line and c_line\n\nBut then, for the sample input, which has 5 test cases, each with two lines, this would process them correctly.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So perhaps the problem is intended for one test case, but the sample input shows multiple. However, the user's note says that the sample input and output are given as lists, but the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that, I'll proceed with writing the code to process multiple test cases.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead a_b_line and c_line.\n\nParse a and b from a_b_line. For example, split into parts. For example, a_b_line could be '10 2' or '16 R'.\n\nThen, parse c_line as the string in base a.\n\nConvert c_line to decimal.\n\nThen, depending on b, convert to base b or Roman.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, parsing a and b.\n\nFor example, split a_b_line into parts. Split by whitespace. So parts = a_b_line.split()\n\na = parts[0], b = parts[1].\n\nBut for the case where b is 'R'.\n\nThen, process c_line.\n\nNow, converting c_line from base a to decimal.\n\nBut what if a is 1? No, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25, inclusive. So no problem.\n\nNow, the code for converting c_line to decimal.\n\nImplementing the function to_decimal(s, base):\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut what if the input is '0'? Then, the value is 0.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then process based on b.\n\nIf b is not 'R', then convert to base b.\n\nElse, convert to Roman.\n\nNow, for the case when converting to base b, but the decimal value is zero. For example, if the input is '0' in base a, then output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the input is not zero. So when b is R, the input is not zero.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nRead c_str.\n\nConvert c_str to decimal.\n\nIf b is 'R':\n\n   convert decimal to roman.\n\nelse:\n\n   convert decimal to base b.\n\nNow, code for converting decimal to base b.\n\nBut what if the decimal value is zero? For example, input is '0' in base a. Then, output is '0'.\n\nNow, code for that:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut for example, if n is zero, return '0'.\n\nNow, the code for converting to Roman:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut what about leading zeros in the output? For example, when converting to base b, the output must omit leading zeros. The code for decimal_to_base returns the correct string, because when the number is zero, returns '0', otherwise, leading zeros are not present. For example, if the number is 1 in base 2, returns '1'.\n\nBut for example, if the decimal number is 0, returns '0'.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c=1.\n\nConvert 1 (base 10) to decimal is 1. Convert to base 2 is '1'.\n\nSample output is '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c=5.\n\nConvert 5 (base 16) to decimal is 5. Convert to Roman is 'V'.\n\nSample output is 'V'.\n\nTest case 3:\n\na=5, b=R, c=4.\n\nConvert 4 (base 5) to decimal is 4. Convert to Roman is 'IV'.\n\nSample output 'IV'.\n\nTest case 4:\n\na=2, b=2, c=1111001.\n\nConvert 1111001 in base 2 to decimal: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2: 121 in decimal is 1111001. So output is same as input. Which matches the sample.\n\nTest case 5: a=12, b=13, c=A.\n\nConvert A (base 12) to decimal is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. So output 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where the input is zero. For example, a=10, b=2, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=10, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting to Roman, e.g., 3000 is 'MMM'.\n\nAnother case: converting to base higher than 10, e.g., decimal 10 in base 16 is 'A'.\n\nBut what about when the input is zero and the target is Roman? According to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the input is not zero. So we don't need to handle that case.\n\nNow, code for the problem.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to handle the case when the input has an odd number of lines? Probably, the problem ensures that the input is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        # parse a and b\n        a_part, b_part = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(a_part)\n        b = b_part\n        # parse c_line\n        c_str = c_line\n        # convert c_str to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        # process based on b\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the converted value is zero, it returns '0', which is correct. For other cases, the code returns the correct digits without leading zeros.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nBut in the sample input, for the fourth test case, the input is 2 2 and c is 1111001. The decimal value is 121. Converting to base 2: 121 is 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 1111001. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 12 13 and c is A. The decimal value is 10. Converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal value is zero? For example, input is 10 2 and c is 0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nBut what if the input is '000' in base 10? Then decimal is 0, output is '0'.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, it's a non-negative integer, so it's not empty. Also, the problem says that the input may have leading zeros, but the length doesn't exceed 10^3.\n\nAnother possible issue is when converting to base b, which is larger than 10, but the code uses uppercase letters. The problem says that in the output, for bases greater than 10, letters are used. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the input c is '0' and the target base is R. But according to the problem statement, the input for Roman is not zero, so this case is not present.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input lines:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut in the code, the lines are read as splitlines. So for each pair of lines, the code processes them.\n\nBut the first line of the sample input is '10 2\\n1' — but that's a single line. Wait, no. The sample input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, each test case is two lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: 10 2\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nSo in the code, the lines list would have two elements for each test case.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem is written as a list of strings, each representing a pair of lines. For example, the first element is '10 2\\n1' which is a single string with two lines. But when splitlines is called, it would split into two lines.\n\nBut in the code, when we read the lines, each test case is two consecutive lines.\n\nBut the code is written as follows: for each i in 0, 2, 4..., take lines[i] and lines[i+1].\n\nBut if the input is given as a list of strings, each being a single line, then the code works. But in the sample input, the first element is a single string that contains two lines. But that's not how the code would read from stdin. For example, if the user inputs two lines, then the code would read them as two separate lines.\n\nBut the sample input is written as a list of strings, each being a test case. However, the actual code would read from stdin, which would have two lines per test case.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where c is '0' in base a, and target is base b. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting to base 1? But the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So no.\n\nAnother case: converting a very large number. For example, a=2, c is a long string of 1s. But the code uses Python's arbitrary precision integers, so it's okay.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 16, the code uses uppercase letters, which is correct.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, it's a non-negative integer, so it's not empty.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses splitlines(), which splits on \\n. So, for example, if the input is given with two lines, then lines will have two elements.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which could be a standard numerical base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to decimal, then converting it to the target base `b` or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input Number to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a` and may contain digits represented by letters (for bases greater than 10). We convert this number to its decimal (base 10) equivalent.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a standard numerical base or the Roman numeral system:\n   - **Standard Numerical Base**: Convert the decimal number to the specified base using standard digit representation (digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10).\n   - **Roman Numeral System**: Convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs that represent Roman numerals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        a_part, b_part = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(a_part)\n        b = b_part\n        c_str = c_line\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as multiple lines, with each test case consisting of two lines: the first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input number from base `a` to decimal by iterating through each character of the input string and computing its value.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: \n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', the function `decimal_to_roman` converts the decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs.\n   - For other bases, the function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the specified base, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10.\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code ensures that leading zeros are omitted and handles the special case of zero correctly when converting to the target base.",
