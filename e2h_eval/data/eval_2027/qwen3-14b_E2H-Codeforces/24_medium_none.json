She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. We need to find the minimum number of seconds required for her to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem thoroughly. So, there are n tabs, and the mouse is currently at position pos. She needs to close all tabs not in l to r. Each second she can move left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the open tabs), or close tabs to the left or right of the current position. \n\nThe key here is to determine the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize time. Let's think about what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, the target is to have only tabs from l to r open. So, any tabs outside this range must be closed. But how does closing work? When she closes tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position, that affects the a and b values. For example, if she closes all tabs to the left of her current position, then the new a becomes the current position + 1? Or wait, no. Wait, the a and b are the min and max of the open tabs. So when she closes tabs to the left of the current position, that would remove all tabs from a to i-1 (where i is the current tab). So after that, the new a would be i, since those tabs are closed. Similarly for closing to the right.\n\nBut during the process, the a and b change as tabs are closed. However, the initial a is 1 and b is n. But once some tabs are closed, the a and b adjust accordingly. However, the problem says that the initial state is all tabs open, and the process is to close the ones outside [l, r]. So the problem is to find the minimal steps to reach that state.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The minimal steps would depend on where the current position is relative to the target interval [l, r], and whether we need to close tabs on the left or right.\n\nLet me think of the cases:\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, perhaps we need to close tabs to the left and/or right. But how?\n\nBut the problem is that closing tabs requires moving the cursor to the correct position. For example, if we need to close tabs to the left of the target interval, we need to move the cursor to the leftmost tab of the target interval (l) and then close all tabs to the left. Similarly for the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can close tabs on both sides. Let's think of the steps needed.\n\nLet me take the first example from the input:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nSo n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nThe target is to have tabs 2,3,4 open. So tabs 1,5,6 need to be closed.\n\nHow to do it optimally? The example says 5 seconds.\n\nThe steps given in the note: move to tab 2 (from 3, that's one move), close left (which would close tab 1). Then move to tab 3 (another move?), then to 4 (another move?), then close right (closing 5 and 6). Let's count the steps:\n\nMoving from 3 to 2: 1 second.\n\nClose left: 1 second. Now, a is 2, b is 6. Then, the cursor is at 2. Then, need to move to 3 (current position is 2, so move right once: 1 sec. Then move to 4 (another sec). Then close right: 1 sec. Total steps: 1+1+1+1+1 = 5 seconds. That's correct.\n\nSo the idea is that to close the left side, you need to move to the leftmost tab of the target (l), and close left. Similarly, to close the right side, move to the rightmost tab of the target (r), and close right. But what if the current position is already in the target area?\n\nAnother example: input 6 3 1 3. Output is 1. Because the current position is 3, and the target is [1,3]. So she can close all tabs to the right (since the current position is 3, closing right would close tabs 4,5,6. So that's one second.\n\nSo the minimal steps depend on whether we need to close left and/or right, and how much movement is required to reach the positions where the closing operations can be done.\n\nLet me think of the general approach.\n\nFirst, check if the current pos is already in the [l, r] interval. If not, then we need to move to the correct position. But maybe not. Wait, but the initial position is pos. For example, if l is 2, r is 4, and pos is 3. Then, the current position is inside the target interval. So, the steps needed to close left and right would be:\n\nTo close left (tabs before l), you need to move to l, then close left. To close right (tabs after r), move to r, then close right.\n\nBut if the current position is already in the target interval, then moving to l or r may take some steps.\n\nBut what if the target is the entire range? Like in the third example, where l=1, r=5, n=5. Then no steps needed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nWe need to close all tabs to the left of l, and all tabs to the right of r. But how?\n\nBut to close the left part, you need to move to l, then close left. Similarly for the right part: move to r, then close right. However, if the current position is already in the target interval, then moving to l or r may take some steps. Also, if the target is such that l is 1 and r is n, then no steps are needed.\n\nSo, the steps required would be:\n\nFor closing left:\n\nIf l > 1, then we need to close tabs to the left of l. How to do that? Move to l, then close left. But moving to l from the current position (pos) takes |pos - l| steps. Then, closing takes 1 step.\n\nSimilarly, for closing right: if r < n, then move to r, then close right. Steps: |pos - r| steps, then 1 step.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already at l? Then moving steps is zero. Then, closing left takes 1 step.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the target interval, but l is 1? Then closing left is not needed. So, the steps for closing left would be zero.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nSo, the total steps would be:\n\nsteps = 0\n\nif l > 1:\n\n   steps += (distance from current pos to l) + 1 (for closing)\n\nif r < n:\n\n   steps += (distance from current pos to r) + 1 (for closing)\n\nBut wait, but after closing left, the current position is at l (since when you close left, you close all tabs to the left of the current position. So after closing, the a becomes the current position (since the tabs to the left are closed). So after closing left, the current position is at l. Then, when closing right, you need to move from l to r. So the distance is |l - r| steps, then 1 step for closing.\n\nWait, but in the first example, after closing left (tabs to the left of 2, which is tab 1), the current position is at 2. Then, to close the right, you need to move from 2 to 4 (two steps), then close (1 step). So that's 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Adding to the previous steps (moving to 2: 1 step, and closing left: 1 step) gives total 1+1 + 2+1 = 5 steps, which matches the example.\n\nBut according to the formula I thought earlier, the steps would be:\n\nFor l=2>1: distance from pos (3) to l (2) is 1, plus 1 → 2 steps.\n\nFor r=4 <6: distance from pos (3) to r (4) is 1, plus 1 → 2 steps. Total 2+2=4 steps. But the actual answer is 5. So this formula is wrong.\n\nAh, because the steps for closing left and closing right are not independent. Because after closing left, the position is at l. So when closing right, the movement is from l to r, not from the original pos.\n\nSo the initial formula is incorrect. It assumes that the movement for closing left and closing right are done from the original position, but in reality, after closing left, the position is at l, so the movement for closing right is from l to r.\n\nSo, the order in which we perform the closing operations matters. For example, if we first close the left, then the movement for closing right is from l to r. Alternatively, if we first close the right, then the movement for closing left is from r to l.\n\nWhich order gives the minimal steps?\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n\nMove to l: cost |pos - l| steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nThen, move to r: cost |l - r| steps.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1 = |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then close left.\n\nMove to r: |pos - r| steps.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nMove to l: |r - l| steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo which option is better depends on which of these two options is smaller. But also, perhaps there are other options. For example, maybe moving to a certain position and closing both sides in some way?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps is the minimum between the two options.\n\nBut what if l == r? Then, |l - r| is zero. So the steps would be either |pos - l| + 0 + 2, or |pos - r| + 0 + 2. Since l = r, both are same.\n\nBut in the case where l and r are adjacent, like l=2, r=3, then |l - r| is 1.\n\nBut in the first example, the steps for option 1 would be |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. Which matches the example. So that's correct.\n\nIn the first example, the option 1 is the correct approach. So the total steps is 5.\n\nSo, the formula for when both left and right need to be closed is min( (|pos - l| + |l - r| + 2 ), (|pos - r| + |r - l| + 2 )) ?\n\nBut since |l - r| is same as |r - l|, that's just min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |l - r| + 2 ?\n\nNo, because the first term is |pos - l| + ... and the second is |pos - r| + ... So the min between the two options is (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) ) + |l - r| + 2 ?\n\nYes. Because |l - r| is same in both options.\n\nSo, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the minimal steps would be min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |l - r| + 2.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the target interval?\n\nLike, suppose l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, |pos - l| is 1, |pos - r| is 1. So min is 1. |l - r| is 2. So 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. Which matches the first example.\n\nAnother example: if pos is l. Then, |pos - l| is 0, so steps would be 0 + (r - l) + 2. Which makes sense: move to r (r - l steps), close right (1 step). So total steps (r - l) + 1 + 1 (the 2 steps from the formula). Wait, the formula is 0 + |l - r| + 2 = (r - l) + 2. Which is correct: 0 steps to move to l, then 1 step to close left (but since l is already the left end, closing left would close nothing? Wait, no. Wait, if l is 2, and the current position is 2, then closing left would close all tabs from a to i-1. But a is 1, and i is 2. So closing left would close tabs 1. So that's correct.\n\nBut if the current position is already in the target interval, and we need to close left and right, then the steps would be moving to l (if needed) and then to r, etc.\n\nBut what if the target is [l, r], and the current position is already in that interval. So, for example, l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, we need to close left (tabs before 2) and right (tabs after 4). So, steps would be:\n\nMove to l (2 steps from 3 to 2?), no. Wait, pos is 3, l is 2. So moving from 3 to 2 is one step. Then close left (1 step). Then move to r (4) which is 2 steps (from 2 to 3, then 3 to 4). Then close right (1 step). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5 steps. Which is the same as the formula.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, what if only left needs to be closed? Like, if r = n. Then, we don't need to close the right. So steps would be:\n\nMove to l (distance |pos - l| steps), then close left (1 step). So total steps |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if only the right needs to be closed (l=1), then steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the target interval. For example, l=2, r=6 (n=6). So, need to close left (tabs before 2). So steps are moving to l (2) from pos (say, 3) is 1 step, then close left (1 step). Total 2 steps.\n\nAnother example: if the current position is already l, then steps are 0 + 1 = 1 step.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, what if the target is the entire range (l=1 and r=n)? Then, no steps are needed. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo, putting this all together:\n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n. Then answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, check if we need to close left (i.e., l > 1) and/or close right (r < n).\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    return 0\n\nelse:\n\n    steps = 0\n\n    if l > 1:\n\n        # need to close left\n\n        # steps to move to l and close left\n\n        # but also, if we have to close right as well, then the steps would be as discussed before\n\n    if r < n:\n\n        # need to close right\n\n    So, the problem is to calculate the steps based on whether we need to close left and/or right.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCompute whether left and right need to be closed.\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    return 0\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    # compute the steps as min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    # wait, but (r - l) is |l - r|, yes.\n\n    steps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    # only close left\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n    # only close right\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let's test with the second example:\n\nSecond example input is '6 3 1 3', output is 1. Let's see.\n\nIn this case, l=1, r=3. n=6. So, left_needed is (1 > 1?) no. So left_needed is false. right_needed is (3 < 6) yes. So steps = abs(3 - 3) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: third input is '5 2 1 5' → output 0. Because l=1 and r=5, which equals n=5. So returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. So, need to close left (tabs before 2) and right (tabs after 3). So left_needed is true (l=2>1), right_needed is (3 < 5) yes. So steps is min( |3-2|, |3-3| ) + (3-2) + 2 → min(1, 0) is 0. Then 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 steps.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOriginal pos is 3. Need to close left and right. So steps:\n\nOption: close right first. Move to r=3 (distance 0 steps). Close right (tabs 4 and 5). Then move to l=2 (distance 1 step). Close left (tabs 1). So steps: 0 + 1 (close right) + 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) → total 3 steps. Which matches the formula.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=4, l=2, r=5. So need to close left (tabs before 2) and right (tabs after 5). So steps would be min( |4-2|=2, |4-5|=1) → 1. Then add (5-2) =3, and +2. So 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 steps.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption: move to r=5 (distance 1 step). Close right (tabs 6,7). Then move to l=2 (distance 5-2=3 steps). Close left (tabs 1). So steps: 1 +1 +3 +1 = 6 steps. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nBut what about when the current position is already on the left or right side?\n\nLet's say n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (tabs before l=2, which is tab 1) and right (tabs after 4, which is 5). So steps would be min( |1-2|=1, |1-4|=3) → 1. Then (4-2)=2, + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps.\n\nLet's see: moving to l=2 (distance 1 step). Close left (which closes tab 1). Then move to r=4 (distance 2 steps). Close right (tab 5). Total steps: 1 +1 +2 +1 = 5 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother scenario: if the current position is to the left of l. For example, n=5, pos=1, l=3, r=4. So need to close left (tabs before 3, which includes tabs 1 and 2). So, steps for left_needed (3>1) and right_needed (4 <5). So steps would be min( |1-3|=2, |1-4|=3) → 2. Then (4-3)=1 + 2 → 2 +1 +2 =5 steps.\n\nLet's see: move to l=3 (steps 2). Close left (tabs 1, 2). Then move to r=4 (step 1), close right (tab 5). Steps 2+1 +1+1=5. Correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is to the right of r? For example, n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (tabs before 2) and right (tabs after 3). So steps would be min( |5-2|=3, |5-3|=2) → 2. Then (3-2)=1 + 2 → 2+1+2=5 steps. So steps would be:\n\nmove to r=3 (distance 2 steps). Close right (tabs 4,5). Then move to l=2 (distance 1 step). Close left (tabs 1). Total steps: 2+1 +1 +1 = 5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nNow, what about when only left or only right is needed?\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So, need to close right (tabs 4,5). Steps: |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=5. So need to close left (tabs 1). Steps: |3 - 2| +1 = 1 +1 = 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nNow, what about when the current position is already in the target interval and we need to close both left and right. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So, steps are min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1) + (4-2) +2 → 1 + 2 +2=5 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to cover all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the target is [l, r], and the current position is already at l? For example, n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4. Need to close right (tabs 5). So steps are |2 - 4| + 1 → 2 + 1 =3 steps. But according to the formula, since left_needed is (l=2>1) → yes, and right_needed (r=4<5) → yes. So steps would be min( |2-2|=0, |2-4|=2) → 0 + (4-2) + 2 → 0 + 2 +2 =4 steps. Wait, but why is that?\n\nWait, in this example, l=2, r=4. So the left_needed is true (l>1) and right_needed is true (r <5). So according to the formula, the steps would be min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\npos is 2. So |pos - l| is 0, |pos - r| is 2. So min is 0. (r-l) is 2. So 0 + 2 + 2 =4 steps.\n\nBut what's the actual steps needed? We need to close left (tabs before 2, which is tab 1) and right (tabs after 4, which is 5).\n\nSo, steps could be:\n\nMove to l (already there). Close left (1 step). Then move to r (4) which is 2 steps. Close right (1 step). Total steps: 1 + 2 + 1 =4 steps. Which matches the formula. But if you think, why not close left and right in a different way? Well, in this case, you can't avoid moving to l and then to r.\n\nBut what if you first close the right? Let's see:\n\nCurrent position is 2. Need to close right (tabs after 4). So move to r=4 (2 steps), close right (1 step). Then move to l=2 (distance 2 steps?), but since after closing right, the a and b are adjusted. Wait, after closing right, the current position is at 4. Then, to close left, you need to move to l=2. So steps: 2 steps (from 2 to 4) + 1 step (close right) + 2 steps (from 4 to 2) + 1 step (close left). Total steps: 2+1+2+1=6 steps. Which is worse than the previous approach. Hence, the formula's approach of taking the minimum between the two options is correct.\n\nThus, the formula for when both left and right are needed is correct.\n\nNow, let's code this logic.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute left_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    steps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    steps = 0\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r <n? Then left_needed is false, right_needed is true. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what if the current pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut let me check another example. Suppose n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3. So need to close right (tabs 4,5). So steps is |5 -3| +1 = 2 +1 =3 steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nMove from 5 to 3 (2 steps), then close right (tabs 4,5). So 2 +1 =3 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=5. Then, output is 0. Because l=1 and r=5 equals n=5. So the code checks that first.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the target is [l, r], but the current position is already in the target interval, and only one side needs to be closed.\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=5. So, need to close left (tabs 1). So steps is |3-2| +1 = 1 +1 = 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is already at l. For example, pos=2, l=2, r=5. So steps is |2-2| +1 = 0 +1 =1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the target is [l, r], and the current pos is in the target, but l=1 and r <n. So, need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think of the edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, pos=1, l=1, r=1. Output is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=1. So need to close tab 2. So steps is |1 - 1| (since r=1, which is equal to n=2? No, wait. Wait, r is 1, and n is 2. So r <n → yes. So steps is |1 - r| +1 → |1-1| +1 = 1. Which is correct. Because move to r (1) and close right (tabs 2). So 1 step.\n\nAnother case: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=2. Then, output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, pos=2, l=1, r=2. Output 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, pos=2, l=1, r=1. So need to close right (tabs 2). steps is |2 - 1| +1 = 1 +1=2 steps. But how?\n\nMove from 2 to 1 (1 step), then close right (tabs 2). So steps 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → output 5.\n\nIn this case, l=2, r=4. n=6. So left_needed is true (2>1), right_needed is true (4 <6). So steps is min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1) + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 =5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3 → output 1. Here, l=1, r=3. left_needed is false (1 is not >1). right_needed is true (3 <6). steps is |3-3| +1 = 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 2 1 5 → output 0. Since l=1 and r=5 equals n=5. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, code:\n\nWe need to read the input. The input is given as a single line with four integers. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as four integers. But in the sample input, there are three lines? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nWait, but that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Because the problem says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\".\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. That's probably a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input is multiple test cases. However, the code should read a single line of input.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. So the code should read a single line with four integers. However, in the sample input, the user shows multiple lines. But perhaps that's a formatting mistake. For example, the sample input may be three separate test cases. But the code is supposed to read one line and output one line.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is given as four integers. So the code should read a single line, split into four integers.\n\nSo, the code will read the input as:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the steps as discussed.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        steps = 0\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r <n? Then left_needed is false, right_needed is true. So steps is |pos - r| + 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's test another case where l=1, r=3, n=5. pos is 5. So steps is |5-3| +1 = 2 +1 =3 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut let me think of another case where the target is [1, 3], and pos is 3. Then steps is |3-3| +1 = 1 step. Which is correct: close right.\n\nBut what if the target is [1, 3], and pos is 3. Then, closing right (tabs 4,5). So steps is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the target is [1, 3], and pos is 4. Then steps is |4 -3| +1 =1 +1=2 steps. Which is correct: move to 3 (1 step), close right (1 step).\n\nBut what if the target is [1,3], and pos is 5. Then steps is |5-3| +1 = 2+1=3 steps. Which is correct: move from 5 to 3 (2 steps), close right (1 step).\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when l is 1 and r is less than n, but the current position is already to the right of r?\n\nYes, handled correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=1 and r= n-1. So, need to close right. Steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nNow, what if the current position is to the right of r? For example, n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=4. So steps is |5-4| +1 = 1 +1=2 steps. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the target is [l, r], and the current position is already in the target, and we need to close both left and right. For example, l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then steps is min(1, 1) + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 =5 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l, and need to close both left and right? For example, l=2, r=4, pos=2. Then steps is min(0, |2-4|=2) + (4-2) +2 → 0 + 2 + 2 =4 steps. Which is correct: move to l (already there), close left (1 step), move to r (2 steps), close right (1 step). Total 1 + 2 +1 =4 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=4, pos=4. Then steps is min( |4-2|=2, |4-4|=0) + 2 + 2 → 0 + 2 +2 =4 steps. Which is correct: move to r (already there), close right (1 step), then move to l (2 steps), close left (1 step). Total steps 1 + 2 + 1 =4 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, the code has to read input. Let's code it.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to read four integers. Let's see.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut what about the case when l=1 and r=n? For example, n=5, l=1, r=5. Then output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r is n, but the code checks if l == 1 and r == n? Yes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        steps = 0\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r is less than n, but the code is in the else clause. For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. Then left_needed is false, right_needed is true. So steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r is less than n, but the current pos is already at r. Then steps is 0 +1 =1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3, n=5, pos=3. Then steps is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3, n=5, pos=4. Then steps is |4-3| +1 = 1+1=2 steps. Correct.\n\nNow, what about when l=1 and r is less than n, but the current pos is to the right of r. For example, pos=5, r=3. steps is |5-3| +1 = 2+1=3 steps. Correct.\n\nNow, what if l is greater than 1 and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified range [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and closing operations to achieve this goal efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the target range [l, r] already includes all tabs (i.e., l = 1 and r = n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Needs**: Check if tabs need to be closed on the left side (l > 1) and/or on the right side (r < n).\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - **Both Sides**: If both left and right sides need closing, compute the minimum steps required by considering the shortest path to either end of the target range and then moving to the other end.\n   - **Only Left**: If only the left side needs closing, calculate the steps to move to the leftmost tab of the target range and close it.\n   - **Only Right**: If only the right side needs closing, calculate the steps to move to the rightmost tab of the target range and close it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = l > 1\n    right_needed = r < n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    elif left_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = 0\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: Directly checks if the target range covers all tabs, which means no operations are needed.\n- **Left and Right Needed**: When both sides need closing, the minimum steps are calculated by considering the shortest movement to either end of the target range, then moving to the other end and closing the respective tabs.\n- **Single Side Needed**: For closing only one side, the steps are calculated based on the distance from the current position to the respective end of the target range plus one second for the closing operation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps by leveraging the shortest path calculations and considering the necessary movements and operations in an optimal sequence.",
