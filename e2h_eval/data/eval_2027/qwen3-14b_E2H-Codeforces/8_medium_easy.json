Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to assign directions to each edge in an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The key points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, it's a conservation of flow.\n2. The source has no incoming edges. All edges connected to the source must be directed away from it.\n3. The directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that the directed graph is acyclic? Oh right, because the flow is a maximum flow, and perhaps the direction assignments can be done in a way that forms a DAG. Maybe by building a DAG where edges are directed from higher to lower in some order?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles, maybe we can assign directions based on a topological order. But how to find that order?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow is a maximum flow, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed according to the flow's residual network. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The problem gives us the flow values for each edge. We need to assign directions so that the flow is valid. Let's think about the flow conservation. For each node except 1 and n, the total incoming flow must equal the outgoing flow. So, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of the flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's consider that for each edge, once directed, it contributes to the in-degree or out-degree of its endpoints.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem of assigning directions to edges such that for each node (except 1 and n), the net flow (sum of outflow minus inflow) is zero. Wait, but the net flow would be zero since inflow equals outflow. So, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges leaving v minus the sum of flows on edges entering v equals zero. Which implies that the total sum of flows on edges incident to v is even? No, wait. Because each edge contributes to either inflow or outflow. For example, if an edge is directed from u to v, then for u, it's an outflow, and for v, it's an inflow. So for node v, the sum of all flows on edges directed into v minus the sum of flows on edges directed out of v must be zero. Which implies that the sum of all flows on edges incident to v must be even? Not necessarily. Because for each edge, it's contributing either +ci or -ci to the net flow. For example, for node v, the sum over all edges incident to it of (direction * ci) must be zero. Wait, no. Because for each edge, if it's directed into v, then it contributes +ci to the inflow. If it's directed out of v, it contributes +ci to the outflow. Then, the inflow equals outflow implies that sum_in = sum_out. Therefore, sum_in - sum_out = 0. But sum_in + sum_out is the total of all flows on edges incident to v. Let me see: sum_in = sum_out → sum_in - sum_out = 0. But sum_in + sum_out = total_flow. So sum_in = total_flow / 2. Therefore, for each node v (not 1 or n), the total_flow must be even. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, so perhaps that's handled.\n\nBut how do we assign directions to edges to satisfy this?\n\nAnother thought: For the entire graph, the sum of flows on edges incident to the source (node 1) must be equal to the maximum flow. Similarly for the sink. But since the problem states that the flow is already maximum, perhaps we don't need to worry about that. Our task is just to assign directions to edges such that the flow conditions are met.\n\nLet me think of this as a directed graph where the flow is valid. How can I model the direction assignment?\n\nAn alternative approach: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order, and direct edges from earlier nodes to later ones. But how to choose this order?\n\nWait, the problem says that the resulting directed graph must not have cycles. So, perhaps the direction assignments can be done in a way that the underlying graph is a DAG. One way to do that is to arrange the nodes in a topological order where all edges go from earlier to later nodes. So, if we can find a topological order of the nodes such that all edges are directed accordingly, then there are no cycles.\n\nBut how to find such an order?\n\nWait, but the original graph is undirected. So perhaps we can build a DAG by choosing a direction for each edge such that the DAG's topological order exists. How?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed acyclic graph where the flow is valid. Since the flow is a maximum flow, perhaps the residual graph has certain properties. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the following idea: Assign directions to edges such that the directed graph is a DAG with the source (node 1) as the only node with in-degree zero, and the sink (node n) as the only node with out-degree zero. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Since the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles, we can model it as a DAG. So, perhaps we can perform a DFS traversal and assign directions based on the traversal order. For example, during a DFS, when we visit a node, we can direct the edges from the parent to the child. But this might not work for all cases, but perhaps if we process the nodes in a certain way.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the fact that the flow must be acyclic. Let's imagine that we arrange the nodes in a certain order where each edge is directed from a node with a lower index to a higher index. However, this may not work directly, but if we can find such an order that satisfies the flow conservation conditions.\n\nWait, but how to find that order?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. Let's denote for each node v, the total flow of edges incident to it as T_v. Then, the sum of flows directed into v plus the sum directed out of v is T_v. And since inflow equals outflow, each is T_v / 2. So for each node v (other than source and sink), T_v must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so that's guaranteed.\n\nBut how to compute the direction for each edge?\n\nAnother idea: Let's model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal in-flow and out-flow. This resembles the concept of an Eulerian trail, but in this case, it's for the entire graph. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as constructing a directed graph where the flow is valid and acyclic. To ensure that the graph is acyclic, perhaps we can construct a DAG where the source is the root, and all edges are directed away from the source towards the sink. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to build a DAG where the edges are directed in a way that allows for the flow conservation. For example, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order and assign directions based on that order. Let's suppose that we have a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and all other nodes are in between. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the node that appears earlier in the order to the one that appears later. However, this would make the graph a DAG, but how to ensure that the flow conservation conditions are met?\n\nBut how do we determine the topological order? It seems like a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the direction of each edge depends on the flow. For example, for each edge, if we can determine which direction it should be in based on the flow's properties. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Since the problem allows any valid direction assignment, perhaps we can use a BFS or DFS approach, building the directions as we go. Let's consider that the source node (1) has all edges directed away from it. Then, for each node, we can process its edges and assign directions such that the flow conservation is maintained.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a flow network. The given flow values are already fixed. So, the problem is to assign directions to edges such that the flow is valid. So, for each node except source and sink, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a system of equations. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows directed out of v. Let me denote for each edge, whether it's directed from a to b (0) or from b to a (1). Then, for each node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of (direction * ci) would be zero? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose an edge between u and v with flow ci. If it's directed from u to v, then for node u, it contributes +ci to outflow, and for node v, +ci to inflow. For the conservation condition, for node u, the sum of outflow minus inflow must be zero (if u is not source or sink). But for the conservation condition, the sum of inflow equals sum of outflow. So, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of all flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nWhich means that for each node v, the total flow of edges incident to v is twice the inflow (since inflow equals outflow). Therefore, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of all ci for edges incident to v must be even. But since the problem says that the input is always valid, we don't have to check that.\n\nBut how to assign the directions?\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each node (except 1 and n) has a balance of zero. The problem is similar to finding an orientation of the edges so that the in-degree (in terms of flow) balances out.\n\nThis sounds like an Eulerian trail problem. In an undirected graph, if every node has even degree, then an Eulerian circuit exists. But here, the flow values are not degrees. However, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows of edges incident to it must be even. Which is required for the existence of a solution.\n\nBut how to assign directions?\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each node v (excluding source and sink), the sum of flows of edges incident to it is even. Let's imagine that we can create a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal in-flow and out-flow. This can be achieved by finding an Eulerian trail for each component. However, the graph may not be connected, but the problem states that the input graph is connected.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a flow problem where we need to assign directions to edges so that the flow is valid. Since the flow is already determined (the ci's are given), perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is valid, and then ensure that it's acyclic.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nWait, here's another idea inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. We can assign directions based on a topological order. For example, arrange the nodes in a topological order where all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes. This would ensure that the graph is acyclic.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Find a topological order of the nodes such that the source is first, the sink is last, and all edges are directed from earlier to later nodes. However, since the graph is undirected, how to find such an order?\n\nBut the topological order is for a directed graph. So perhaps we need to find an order where, after directing the edges according to the order, the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to find such an order?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG with a specific structure. For example, arrange the nodes in a way that the source is at the beginning and the sink at the end. Then, for each edge, direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. This way, the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to choose the order such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nHmm. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where each edge is directed from a node with lower \"potential\" to higher \"potential\". The potential could be assigned in a way that ensures flow conservation. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes as being arranged in a tree structure. For example, build a spanning tree of the graph, and assign directions according to the tree's parent-child relationships. Then, for non-tree edges, assign directions in a way that maintains acyclicity.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, there exists a topological order. Let's choose any topological order and assign directions accordingly. But how to find such an order?\n\nWait, but the graph is undirected. So, perhaps we can construct a directed graph by choosing directions in such a way that the resulting graph is a DAG. For example, we can perform a DFS traversal and assign directions based on the discovery order. For instance, during the traversal, when visiting a node u and moving to a neighbor v, we can direct the edge from u to v. If v has already been visited, we can direct it from v to u (but that would create a cycle if not careful). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perform a BFS starting from the source node. Assign directions from parent to children. For edges not in the BFS tree, direct them from the node with lower BFS level to higher. This would ensure that the graph is acyclic. But again, how does this ensure flow conservation?\n\nBut the problem requires that the flow conservation is satisfied, which depends on the directions of the edges. So this approach might not directly address that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the flow conservation can be handled by ensuring that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into the node equals the sum of flows directed out of the node. How can that be achieved?\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nFor each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows of edges incident to v is even. Let's denote this sum as S_v. Then, for each node, the sum of flows directed into v must be S_v / 2. So, the problem becomes assigning directions to edges such that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v is exactly S_v / 2.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an orientation for each edge such that the in-flow for each node meets a certain requirement.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding an Eulerian orientation. In an Eulerian orientation, each node has equal in-degree and out-degree. But in our case, the in-flow (sum of flows) must be S_v / 2.\n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps we can model it as a flow problem again. For example, imagine that each node (except source and sink) has a demand of S_v / 2. Then, we need to find an orientation of edges that satisfies these demands. However, since the edges are undirected, each edge can contribute to the in-flow of one of its endpoints.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAnother idea: For each node v (not source or sink), we need to select a subset of edges incident to it such that the sum of their flows is exactly S_v / 2. Then, those edges are directed into v, and the others are directed out of v.\n\nBut how to select this subset for all nodes simultaneously?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a feasible solution to a system of constraints. However, solving this directly would be computationally intensive for large graphs.\n\nLet me think of a way to model this as a graph where we can perform a traversal. For example, using a BFS or DFS approach where we track the required in-flow for each node and assign directions accordingly.\n\nLet me try to think of the following approach:\n\nStart with the source node (1). All edges incident to the source must be directed away from it. So, for each edge between 1 and another node u, we direct it from 1 to u. This ensures that the source has no incoming edges.\n\nNow, for each node u that is connected to the source, we can compute the amount of flow that has been directed out of u. Then, we need to balance the flow for u. For example, if u is not the sink, then the sum of flows directed into u must equal the sum of flows directed out of u.\n\nWait, but initially, for u, the only flow directed out is the flow from the source to u. Then, we need to balance this by directing other edges into u or out of u.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nThis feels like a problem where we can model it as a directed graph and perform some kind of flow balancing. For example, for each node u, we can calculate the current imbalance between inflow and outflow, and then adjust the directions of edges to balance it.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Assign all edges connected to the source to be directed away from it. This ensures that the source has no incoming edges.\n\n2. For each other node, compute the difference between the sum of flows directed into it and out of it. Initially, this difference will be negative for nodes connected to the source (since they have outgoing flow from the source).\n\n3. Then, for each node, we can process its edges to balance this difference.\n\nBut this is vague. Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe nodes are 1 (source), 2, 3 (sink).\n\nEdges:\n\nEdge 1: between 3 and 2 with flow 10.\n\nEdge 2: between 1 and 2 with flow 10.\n\nEdge 3: between 3 and 1 with flow 5.\n\nInitially, we direct the edges connected to the source (node 1):\n\nEdge 2 is directed from 1 to 2 (so direction 0).\n\nEdge 3 is directed from 1 to 3 (but since the original edge is between 3 and 1, direction 0 would mean ai → bi, which is 1→3. So the original input for edge 3 is 3 1 5, so direction 0 would be 3→1? No, wait the input is ai, bi, ci. The output di is 0 if the direction is ai→bi, else 1 (bi→ai). So for the edge between 3 and 1, if we want to direct it from 1 to 3, then since ai=3 and bi=1, direction 1 would be bi→ai, i.e., 1→3.\n\nSo for edge 3 (ai=3, bi=1), direction 1 would be from bi (1) to ai (3). So yes, that's the correct direction for edge 3.\n\nSo after step 1, edges 2 and 3 are directed away from the source. Now, what about node 2?\n\nNode 2 has an edge directed into it (from 1) with flow 10. What about the other edges?\n\nEdge 1 is between 3 and 2. Currently, no direction is assigned yet. For node 2, the inflow is 10, and outflow is zero. The total flow for node 2 is 10 (from edge 2) plus 10 (from edge 1) = 20. So S_2 is 20. Thus, the required inflow is 10. But currently, the inflow is 10, and outflow is zero. So the inflow equals outflow only if outflow is 10. So we need to direct edge 1 in such a way that node 2's outflow increases by 10. That would happen if edge 1 is directed from 2 to 3. Then, node 2's outflow is 10 (from edge 2's direction and edge 1's direction). So for node 2, inflow is 10 (from edge 2) and outflow is 10 (edge 1 and edge 2?), wait no.\n\nWait, node 2 has two edges: edge 2 (directed from 1 to 2, so inflow for node 2 is 10), and edge 1 (between 3 and 2). If we direct edge 1 from 2 to 3, then node 2's outflow increases by 10. So the total outflow for node 2 is 10, which equals the inflow (10). So that works. So edge 1 is directed from 2 to 3 (original edge is 3-2, so direction 1 (bi to ai) would be 2 to 3? Wait, the original edge is ai=3, bi=2, ci=10. So direction 0 is ai→bi (3→2), direction 1 is bi→ai (2→3). So yes, direction 1 would be 2→3. So for edge 1, output is 1.\n\nThen, for node 3 (sink), the inflow is 5 (from edge 3) and 10 (from edge 1). Total inflow is 15. Since it's the sink, there's no requirement for flow conservation. So that's okay.\n\nBut how to generalize this approach?\n\nThe idea seems to be that for each node (except source and sink), we can process its edges and adjust their directions to balance the inflow and outflow.\n\nThis suggests that we can model this as a graph where we perform a traversal, keeping track of the required flow for each node.\n\nLet's think of it as follows:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where we assign directions to edges, and for each node (except source and sink), maintain a balance between inflow and outflow. Initially, the source has all edges directed away, and for other nodes, we process their edges to adjust the balance.\n\nFor example, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source. For each node we visit, we look at its adjacent edges. For each edge, if it hasn't been processed yet, we decide its direction based on the balance of the nodes involved.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nInitialize a variable for each node, called 'balance'. For the source, balance is 0 (since it has no incoming edges). For the sink, balance is not considered. For other nodes, balance is initialized to 0.\n\nFor each edge connected to the source, direct it away from the source. For example, if the edge connects source to u, then direction is from source to u. This adds the flow ci to the outflow of the source (which is allowed), and adds ci to the inflow of u. So for node u, the balance is increased by ci (since inflow is ci, and outflow is zero initially).\n\nThen, for each node u (other than source and sink) that has a non-zero balance, we need to process its edges to balance it. For example, if the balance is positive, it means that the node has more inflow than outflow, and needs to send some flow out through other edges. Conversely, if the balance is negative, the node has more outflow than inflow and needs to receive more flow.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. We can perform a BFS traversal, starting from the source. For each node u in the queue, we look at its adjacent edges. For each such edge, if it's not yet processed, we decide its direction based on the balance of the current node u and the other node v.\n\nFor example, suppose we're processing node u. We have an edge between u and v. If v hasn't been visited yet, we direct the edge from u to v. This would add ci to the outflow of u and inflow of v. Then, we update the balance of u and v accordingly. Then, we add v to the queue.\n\nIf v has already been visited, then we check the balance of u and v. If the balance of u is positive (needs to send out flow), we direct the edge from u to v, reducing the balance of u by ci and increasing the balance of v by ci. Otherwise, we direct the edge from v to u, adjusting the balances accordingly.\n\nWait, but this might not work for all cases. Let me think through an example.\n\nTake the first sample input again. After processing the source (node 1), we have edges to node 2 and node 3. For node 2, balance is +10 (inflow from source). For node 3, balance is +5 (inflow from source).\n\nNow, we process node 2. Its adjacent edges are the edge to 1 (already processed) and the edge to 3 (unprocessed). We direct the edge from 2 to 3 (since node 2 has a positive balance and needs to send out flow). This reduces node 2's balance by 10 (to 0) and increases node 3's balance by 10 (from +5 to +15). Now, node 3's balance is +15. But since it's the sink, we don't need to process it further. However, the edge between 3 and 2 is now directed from 2 to 3.\n\nIn this case, the balance for node 2 becomes zero, which is good. For node 3, the balance is +15. But since it's the sink, we don't care. So the algorithm would proceed.\n\nBut what about other scenarios where the balance is not zero?\n\nThis approach seems promising. The key idea is to process nodes in a BFS-like manner, directing edges to balance the current node's inflow and outflow.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Build an adjacency list for the graph. Each entry contains the connected node and the flow value ci.\n\n2. Initialize a balance array. For each node, balance[v] = 0. For the source node (1), balance remains 0. For other nodes, balance is computed based on the edges processed so far.\n\n3. Use a queue to process nodes. Start with the source node.\n\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\n   a. Dequeue a node u.\n\n   b. For each adjacent edge (u, v, ci) that hasn't been processed yet:\n\n      i. If v is not processed yet (i.e., not in the queue or processed), then direct the edge from u to v. Add ci to balance[v], subtract ci from balance[u]. Enqueue v.\n\n      ii. Else, check the balance of u. If balance[u] > 0, direct the edge from u to v. Subtract ci from balance[u], add ci to balance[v]. Else, direct the edge from v to u. Add ci to balance[u], subtract ci from balance[v].\n\nWait, but how do we know which direction to choose when both nodes are already processed?\n\nActually, this seems like a way to propagate the balance through the graph. For example, if the current node u has a positive balance, we want to send flow out through edges to other nodes, which would help reduce its balance. By directing edges from u to v, we decrease the balance of u and increase that of v. If v has a negative balance, then this might help balance it.\n\nBut how to ensure that eventually, all nodes (except sink) have zero balance?\n\nThis approach seems similar to the way in which we handle flow in a graph with potentials. For example, in a BFS traversal, we can assign directions based on the current balance.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this will always work. However, since the problem states that a solution exists, this approach might work.\n\nLet's test this approach on the first sample input:\n\nInitial state: balance[1] = 0, balance[2] = 0, balance[3] = 0.\n\nProcess node 1. Its edges are (1,2,10) and (1,3,5).\n\nFor the first edge (1-2):\n\nv is 2, not processed. Direct from 1 to 2. balance[1] -= 10 (but since it's the source, we don't care?), but according to the algorithm, balance[u] is adjusted. Wait, according to the algorithm, for the edge from u (1) to v (2), balance[u] decreases by ci (10) and balance[v] increases by ci (10). But since u is the source, which is allowed to have outflow. However, the source's balance is not considered. So perhaps the algorithm should treat the source specially.\n\nWait, the balance for the source is not considered. For other nodes, the balance must be zero.\n\nSo, in the algorithm, when processing the source's edges, we direct them away from the source. This adds ci to the balance of the adjacent node. For example, for edge 1-2, after processing, balance[2] is 10.\n\nSimilarly, for edge 1-3, balance[3] is 5.\n\nThen, the queue has node 2 and node 3. Let's say we process node 2 first.\n\nNode 2's balance is 10. We look at its edges. The edge to 1 is already processed. The other edge is to 3. v is 3, which hasn't been processed yet (assuming the queue has node 2 and node 3, but maybe node 3 is processed next. Wait, depends on the order.)\n\nAssuming node 2 is dequeued first. Its adjacent edge to 3 is unprocessed. So, we direct the edge from 2 to 3. This subtracts 10 from balance[2], making it 0, and adds 10 to balance[3], making it 5 + 10 = 15. Then, enqueue node 3.\n\nNow, node 3 is dequeued. Its balance is 15. It has edges to 1 (processed), and to 2 (processed). Are there any other edges? No. Since node 3 is the sink, we don't need to process it further. So the algorithm ends.\n\nThus, the directions are:\n\nEdge 1 (3-2): directed from 2 to 3 (direction 1, since original ai=3, bi=2. So direction is 1 (bi→ai) which is 2→3).\n\nEdge 2 (1-2): directed from 1→2 (direction 0).\n\nEdge 3 (3-1): directed from 1→3 (original ai=3, bi=1. So direction is 1 (bi→ai) which is 1→3. So output is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for the first sample.\n\nAnother example: Let's take the second sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 5\n\n1 2 10\n\n1 3 10\n\n2 3 5\n\n4 2 15\n\n3 4 5\n\nSample Output: 0 0 1 1 0.\n\nLet's walk through the algorithm.\n\nNodes: 1 (source), 2, 3, 4 (sink).\n\nAdjacency list:\n\n1: connected to 2 (10), 3 (10).\n\n2: connected to 1 (10), 3 (5), 4 (15).\n\n3: connected to 1 (10), 2 (5), 4 (5).\n\n4: connected to 2 (15), 3 (5).\n\nInitialize balance array: [0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nQueue starts with node 1.\n\nProcess node 1:\n\nEdges to 2 and 3.\n\nFor edge 1-2: direct from 1 to 2. balance[2] += 10. Enqueue 2.\n\nFor edge 1-3: direct from 1 to 3. balance[3] += 10. Enqueue 3.\n\nNow, queue has 2 and 3.\n\nProcess node 2 first.\n\nbalance[2] is 10. Adjacent edges are:\n\n- 1 (processed).\n\n- 3 (unprocessed).\n\n- 4 (unprocessed).\n\nFirst, process edge 2-3 (unprocessed). Since node 3 is already in the queue (but not processed yet?), depends on the implementation. Assuming that node 3 is in the queue.\n\nIf the edge is between 2 and 3, which hasn't been processed yet. So we direct from 2 to 3. Subtract 5 from balance[2] (now 5), add 5 to balance[3] (now 10+5=15). Enqueue 3 (but it's already in the queue? Maybe not, but the algorithm proceeds regardless).\n\nNow, node 2's balance is 5. Next, process edge 2-4 (unprocessed). Direct from 2 to 4. Subtract 15 from balance[2] (5 -15 = -10?), but wait, balance[2] was 5, subtracting 15 would make it -10? That's possible. But balance is supposed to be zero for non-source/sink nodes. However, the algorithm continues processing.\n\nAdd 15 to balance[4] (which is 0 + 15 = 15). Enqueue node 4.\n\nNow, node 2's balance is -10. But why? Because we directed the edge from 2 to 4, which adds to the outflow of node 2. The balance for node 2 is inflow minus outflow. Initially, it had inflow of 10 (from source). Then, outflow of 5 (to node 3) and 15 (to node 4). So total outflow is 20. Inflow is 10. So balance is 10 - 20 = -10.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, the balance is tracked as follows:\n\nWhen we direct an edge from u to v, we subtract ci from balance[u] (because the outflow increases by ci, which reduces the balance (inflow - outflow)). And add ci to balance[v] (because the inflow increases by ci).\n\nSo, for node 2, balance was 10. After directing edge to 3 (5), balance becomes 10 - 5 = 5. Then, directing edge to 4 (15), balance becomes 5 - 15 = -10.\n\nNow, node 2 is processed, and we move to the next node in the queue, which is node 3.\n\nProcessing node 3: balance is 15.\n\nAdjacent edges are:\n\n- 1 (processed).\n\n- 2 (processed).\n\n- 4 (unprocessed).\n\nProcess edge 3-4. Since node 4 is not processed yet. Direct from 3 to 4. Subtract 5 from balance[3] (15-5=10), add 5 to balance[4] (15+5=20). Enqueue node 4.\n\nNow, node 3's balance is 10. Are there any other edges? No. So node 3 is done.\n\nNext, process node 4 (enqueued twice? Once from node 2, once from node 3). But the queue may have node 4 once. Anyway, process it.\n\nNode 4 is the sink, so no processing needed. But according to the algorithm, we check its balance. But since it's the sink, we ignore it.\n\nNow, the queue may have other nodes. But what about node 2's balance of -10 and node 3's balance of 10?\n\nWait, this seems problematic. How will the algorithm handle this?\n\nAt this point, the balance for node 2 is -10, and for node 3 is 10. These balances are not zero. But the sink is node 4. How to resolve this?\n\nAh, this suggests that the algorithm as described may not work correctly. So what's wrong here?\n\nLet me think about the actual flow in this scenario.\n\nThe sample output for the second case is:\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\nWhich corresponds to the following directions:\n\nEdge 1 (1-2): direction 0 (1→2)\n\nEdge 2 (1-3): direction 0 (1→3)\n\nEdge 3 (2-3): direction 1 (3→2) [original edge is 2-3, so direction 1 is bi→ai, which is 3→2]\n\nEdge 4 (4-2): direction 1 (2→4? No. Original edge is 4-2. So direction 0 is 4→2, direction 1 is 2→4. The sample output for edge 4 is 1, which is direction 1 → 2→4. So that's correct.\n\nEdge 5 (3-4): direction 0 (3→4).\n\nSo let's see what the balances would be for each node:\n\nFor node 2:\n\nEdges directed from 1→2 (10), from 3→2 (edge 3 is directed 3→2, so for node 2, this is inflow of",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conditions and is acyclic. The key requirements are ensuring flow conservation at each vertex (except the source and sink), no incoming edges at the source, and the absence of cycles in the directed graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n2. **Balance Tracking**: Maintain a balance array to track the difference between inflow and outflow for each node.\n3. **BFS Traversal**: Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the source node. This traversal helps in directing edges away from the source and balancing the flows at each node.\n4. **Edge Direction Assignment**: During BFS traversal, direct edges from the current node to its neighbors if the neighbor hasn't been processed yet. Adjust the balance accordingly. If both nodes have been processed, adjust the direction based on their current balance to ensure flow conservation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        adj[a].append((b, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, i))\n\n    balance = [0] * (n + 1)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    direction = [0] * m  # 0 means original direction, 1 means reversed\n\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(1)\n    visited[1] = True\n\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        for (v, e_idx) in adj[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                # Direct edge from u to v\n                direction[e_idx] = 0 if (edges[e_idx][0] == u and edges[e_idx][1] == v) else 1\n                # Update balance\n                balance[u] -= edges[e_idx][2]\n                balance[v] += edges[e_idx][2]\n                visited[v] = True\n                q.append(v)\n            else:\n                # Check if the edge has been processed already\n                # We need to check if this edge was processed before\n                # To avoid processing twice, we need to track which edges are processed\n                # However, since each edge is stored twice in the adjacency list, we need to avoid processing it twice\n                # So we need to track which edges have been processed\n                pass\n\n    # Now, we need to process edges again, but this time considering the balance\n    # Wait, the above approach misses some edges.
