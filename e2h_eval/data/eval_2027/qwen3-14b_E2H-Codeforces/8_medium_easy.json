Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to assign directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the flow is a valid maximum flow. The conditions are that for all vertices except source (1) and sink (n), the incoming flow equals outgoing flow. Also, the source has no incoming edges, the directed graph must be acyclic, and the flow values are given for each edge.\n\nHmm. So the problem is about directing edges correctly. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the maximum flow is already determined by the given ci values. But we need to assign directions so that the flow conservation holds and the graph is acyclic. Oh right, and the source has no incoming edges, which implies that all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it.\n\nWait, but how do I ensure that the flow conservation holds? For each vertex except 1 and n, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So for each vertex v (not 1 or n), the net flow (outgoing - incoming) must be zero. But since the flow is directed, each edge contributes to either outgoing or incoming.\n\nBut how do I model this? Maybe think of it as a flow network where the flow is already fixed, and we need to assign directions. So the direction determines whether the flow is from ai to bi or bi to ai.\n\nLet me think of this as building a directed graph where the flow is conserved. But how?\n\nAn alternative approach: since the graph is connected and we need to assign directions such that the directed graph is acyclic, perhaps we can find a topological order. Then, assign directions based on that order. For example, if the topological order is such that all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes, then there are no cycles.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order that also satisfies the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is conserved, and then find a DAG structure. But how?\n\nAnother thought: the flow conservation for each node (except source and sink) requires that the sum of flows going out equals the sum of flows coming in. Which implies that for each node, the total flow through its edges is even? No, not necessarily. Wait, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even? Because the sum of incoming equals the sum of outgoing, so the total sum is twice the incoming (or outgoing). So for each node v, the sum of ci of all edges incident to it must be even? Wait no. Because for each edge, the flow is either incoming or outgoing. So the sum of all flows (incoming + outgoing) for a node is equal to the sum of all ci of edges incident to it. But since incoming equals outgoing, their sum is twice the incoming. Therefore, the sum of all ci for edges incident to v must be even. But the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists. So that's guaranteed.\n\nBut how does that help me?\n\nMaybe I need to model this as a directed graph where for each node, the sum of the flows leaving it minus the sum entering it is zero, except for source and sink. But the source has all edges directed away, and the sink has all edges directed towards it.\n\nWait, but the source (node 1) has no incoming edges. So for node 1, the sum of outgoing flows is the total flow. Similarly for the sink (node n), the sum of incoming flows is the total flow.\n\nSo the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges so that the flow conservation holds and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nHow to approach this?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a directed graph with certain constraints. The key is to find a way to assign directions so that the flow is valid and the graph is acyclic.\n\nAn idea: construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the flow is conserved. Since the graph is acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the node that comes earlier in the topological order to the one that comes later. However, how to ensure that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal incoming and outgoing flow. Let's consider the flow as a directed graph. The problem is similar to finding a valid orientation of the edges such that the flow is conserved.\n\nAnother approach: think of this as a flow problem where the flow is already given, and we need to assign directions. So for each edge, we can choose direction. The sum of flows for each node (except source and sink) must be zero.\n\nBut how to model that. Let me think of the flow as a directed graph. For each node v, the net outflow (sum of outgoing flows minus incoming flows) must be:\n\n- For source (v=1): net outflow is total flow (since no incoming)\n- For sink (v=n): net inflow is total flow (so net outflow is -total)\n- For others: net outflow is zero.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can model this as a system of equations. However, solving such a system for large n and m is not feasible directly.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider the flow as a directed graph. For each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum of flows directed towards it equals the required net outflow. For example, for node 1, this is the total flow (which is the sum of all flows on edges connected to node 1, since they are directed away). Wait, but how do I know the total flow?\n\nActually, the total flow from source to sink is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. But since the problem states that the given ci's form a maximum flow, the total flow is fixed. However, I don't need to compute that, because the problem says that the given ci's are correct for a maximum flow.\n\nBut how to assign directions?\n\nAnother thought: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. This ensures acyclicity. Now, the problem becomes: find a topological order such that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges going out of it equals the sum of flows on edges going into it.\n\nBut how to find such an order?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree structure. For example, building a DAG where the edges are directed from parents to children in a tree. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the fact that the graph is connected and we can build a DAG. Let's construct a directed graph where all edges are directed away from the source and towards the sink, and in such a way that the flow conservation holds. How?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance between incoming and outgoing flows. Let me think of this as a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from the node equals the sum of flows on edges directed towards it (for non-source/sink nodes). \n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph where the in-degree (weighted by flow) equals the out-degree (weighted by flow) for each node except source and sink. \n\nBut how to model this? It's similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but for general graphs. Wait, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards it. So for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even (since sum_out = sum_in => sum_out + sum_in = 2*sum_out, which is even). But since the problem says that a solution exists, we don't need to check that.\n\nBut how to assign directions?\n\nAn idea: For each node, we can compute the \"excess\" of flow that needs to leave or enter. For example, for the source node (1), the excess is the total flow (since all edges are directed away from it). For the sink node (n), the excess is negative of the total flow. For other nodes, the excess is zero.\n\nWait, but how do we compute that? Let's think of it as follows: for each node, the net outflow (sum of flows on outgoing edges minus sum of flows on incoming edges) must be:\n\n- For node 1: total_flow (since no incoming edges)\n- For node n: -total_flow (since all edges are incoming)\n- For others: 0\n\nBut how do I determine the total_flow? Well, the total_flow is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. Since the problem says that the given ci's form a maximum flow, the total_flow would be the sum of flows on edges connected to the source, but directed away from it. However, since the edges are undirected, the actual direction hasn't been determined yet. So this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, the total_flow is the same as the sum of flows on edges connected to the source, but since the direction is not known, perhaps we can compute it as the sum of flows on edges incident to the source, but adjusted for the direction. Wait, but that's not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to model this as a directed graph where for each node, the net outflow is known. For example, for node 1, the net outflow is equal to the total flow. For node n, it's -total_flow. For others, it's zero. But how to find such directions?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph with given net outflows for each node. But how?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that the net outflow for each node is a certain value. In this case, the net outflow for node 1 is the total flow, for node n is -total_flow, and for others zero. However, how to compute this?\n\nBut what's the total flow? The total flow is the value of the maximum flow, which is the sum of flows from the source to the sink. However, since the problem gives us the ci's, which are the flows on each edge, and the edges are part of the maximum flow, the total flow can be computed as the sum of flows on edges leaving the source (once directions are assigned). But again, this is circular.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the given ci's are the flow volumes for each edge. So the total flow is the sum of the flows on edges that are leaving the source. But since the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. So the total flow is the sum of the ci's of edges connected to the source. But that's only true if those edges are directed away from the source. However, the problem says that the given ci's are part of a maximum flow. So the sum of the flows on edges leaving the source must be equal to the sum of flows on edges entering the sink. But how to find that sum?\n\nAlternatively, the total flow is the same as the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. But since the edges are undirected, the direction is not known yet. So perhaps the sum of flows on edges incident to the source is equal to the total flow. Because the edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. So the total flow is sum of ci for edges connected to the source. But then again, the problem says that the input is valid, so that sum must be equal to the sum of flows on edges connected to the sink (directed towards it).\n\nBut I'm stuck on figuring out the total flow. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a flow network where the edges have capacities equal to their ci's, and the flow is already determined. But the problem is to assign directions to the edges such that the flow is valid. But since the flow is already given, the direction assignment is just about choosing the direction of the flow.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For each edge, the flow is directed from one end to the other. So for each edge between u and v, the flow contributes to the outflow of u or v. To satisfy the flow conservation for each node, the sum of flows leaving the node must equal the sum of flows entering the node (except for source and sink).\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph where for each node, the net outflow is known. Let's denote for each node v:\n\nnet_outflow[v] = (sum of flows on edges directed away from v) - (sum of flows on edges directed towards v)\n\nFor the source (v=1), net_outflow is equal to the total flow. For the sink (v=n), it's -total_flow. For others, it's zero.\n\nBut how to find such directions?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that the net outflow for each node is known. However, how to compute this?\n\nThe net outflow for each node can be calculated as follows. Let's denote that for the entire graph, the sum of net outflows across all nodes must be zero. Because each edge contributes +ci to one node and -ci to the other. So overall sum is zero. Which is satisfied by the source and sink.\n\nBut how to model the net outflow for each node?\n\nLet me think of it as a system of equations. For each node v, the net outflow is:\n\nsum_{edges directed away} ci - sum_{edges directed towards} ci = desired_net_outflow[v]\n\nBut since the sum of all desired_net_outflows must be zero, which it is (source's is +F, sink's is -F, others are zero).\n\nBut solving this system is not straightforward. However, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph and use some kind of flow algorithm.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the problem is similar to finding an Eulerian orientation. In an Eulerian orientation, each node has equal in-degree and out-degree. But here, the requirement is different. However, for non-source and sink nodes, the sum of flows directed away must equal the sum directed towards. Which implies that for these nodes, the net outflow is zero. So for them, the sum of flows directed away equals the sum directed towards. Which is similar to an Eulerian orientation, but with weighted edges.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation?\n\nAn approach could be to model this as a directed graph where for each node, the net outflow is as required. For example, for each node v, the net outflow is:\n\nif v is source: F (the total flow)\nif v is sink: -F\nelse: 0\n\nBut how to compute F?\n\nWell, F is the total flow. But since the flow is a maximum flow, the total flow is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. However, since we don't know the direction of the edges yet, this is circular.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is connected, the total flow F can be determined by the sum of flows on edges connected to the source. Wait, but if the edges connected to the source are directed away from the source, then F is sum of those edges. However, if some edges are directed towards the source, then that would violate the condition that the source has no incoming edges. So all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Hence, F is the sum of ci for edges connected to the source.\n\nYes! Because the source cannot have any incoming edges, so all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. So for each edge connected to the source (say, between source and u), the direction is source → u. Therefore, the total flow F is the sum of ci for all edges connected to the source. Similarly, for the sink, all edges connected to it must be directed towards it, so the sum of their ci's would be F.\n\nWait, but how can I be sure that the sum of edges connected to the source equals the sum of edges connected to the sink? Because the problem says that the input is valid, and that a solution exists. So that must be the case.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Compute F as the sum of ci for all edges connected to the source (vertex 1). Because all those edges must be directed away from the source.\n\nBut wait, what if the source is connected to multiple edges. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nSo the edges connected to the source (vertex 1) are the second edge (1-2, 10) and the third edge (3-1, 5). So the sum is 10+5=15. But according to the sample output, the flow is 10 through 1-2 and 5 through 3-1. Wait, but the direction of the third edge is 1←3 (output is 1 for that edge, meaning direction is bi→ai, which is 3→1. Wait, no. Wait the output for the third edge is 1, meaning that the direction is bi → ai. The original edge was ai=3, bi=1. So direction is 3→1. Which is towards the source. But that would make the source have an incoming edge, which violates the condition. Oh wait, no. Wait in the first sample input, the output is [1, 0, 1]. Let's look at each edge:\n\nEdge 1: 3 2 10 → direction is 1, which is bi→ai → 2→3.\n\nEdge 2: 1 2 10 → direction is 0 → ai→bi → 1→2.\n\nEdge 3: 3 1 5 → direction is 1 → bi→ai → 1→3? Wait no. Original edge is ai=3, bi=1. If direction is 1, then it's bi→ai, which is 1→3. So the edge is directed from 1 to 3. That's away from the source (vertex 1). Wait no, the source is vertex 1. So 1→3 is directed away from the source. So that edge is directed away from the source. So the sum of the edges connected to the source (vertex 1) is 10 (from edge 2) and 5 (from edge 3). So F is 15. Which is the total flow. The sink is vertex 3. The edges connected to the sink (vertex 3) are edge 1 (3-2, directed 2→3) and edge 3 (directed 1→3). So the sum of flows directed towards the sink is 10 +5 =15. Which matches F. So yes, that works.\n\nSo this suggests that the total flow F is indeed the sum of the ci of edges connected to the source, since all those edges are directed away from the source.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For all edges connected to the source (vertex 1), direct them away from the source. So for each such edge, if the original ai is 1, direction is 0 (ai→bi). If the original bi is 1, then direction is 1 (bi→ai, which is 1→ai, but ai is the other end, so direction is from 1 to ai).\n\nOnce those edges are directed, we can compute for each node (other than source and sink) the required net outflow. For example, for each node v (not 1 or n), the net outflow must be zero. But how?\n\nLet me think. For each node v, after directing the edges connected to the source, we need to direct the remaining edges in such a way that the net outflow is zero (except for source and sink). How?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph where the net outflow for each node is zero, except for the source and sink. But how?\n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding a flow in a graph, but with the flows already fixed. Wait, but the flows are given. So perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where for each node, the sum of flows on outgoing edges minus sum of flows on incoming edges is zero (for non-source/sink nodes), and we need to assign directions accordingly.\n\nBut how to find such directions?\n\nLet me think of this as a problem of building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal in-flow and out-flow. This is similar to the concept of an Eulerian circuit, but for general graphs. But again, how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: For each node, compute the difference between the sum of flows on edges connected to it and the flows already directed away from the source. For example, for a node v, suppose that after directing edges connected to the source, the current net outflow is some value. Then, we need to direct other edges to adjust this net outflow to zero.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of this as a flow problem. For each node v (not source or sink), the net outflow must be zero. Let me think of the edges not connected to the source as being in a graph where I can choose their direction. The goal is to assign directions to these edges such that the net outflow for each node is adjusted to zero.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the net outflow for each node (except source and sink) is zero. For this, the sum of flows on edges directed away from the node must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards the node.\n\nThis can be modeled as a directed graph where for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Let's denote for each node v, the initial outflow (from edges connected to the source) as initial_outflow[v]. For example, if a node is connected to the source and the edge is directed away, then initial_outflow[v] increases by the ci of that edge. Then, for the rest of the edges, we need to direct them such that the net outflow for each node is adjusted to zero.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAnother idea: Treat the graph as a directed graph where the edges connected to the source are directed away. Then, for the rest of the edges, we can perform a DFS or BFS traversal, directing edges in a way that balances the flow.\n\nFor example, during a traversal, for each node, if there is a surplus of flow (i.e., the current net outflow is not zero), we can direct edges to transfer that surplus to other nodes.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of it as a flow problem. For each node, after considering the edges connected to the source, we can calculate the \"excess\" flow that needs to be sent out or in. For example, for a node v, the excess is (current_outflow - current_inflow). For nodes other than source and sink, this excess must be zero.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me try to model this as follows:\n\nWe can represent for each node v, the \"balance\" which is the amount of flow that needs to be sent out (positive) or received (negative). Initially, for the source, the balance is F (the total flow). For the sink, it's -F. For other nodes, the balance is zero. But then, the edges connected to the source contribute to this balance.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the balance as follows. For each node v, the balance is the amount of flow that needs to be sent out from v. For example, for the source, balance is F. For the sink, balance is -F. For others, balance is zero. But when we direct an edge from u to v, this contributes ci to the balance of u (since it's sending out ci) and subtracts ci from the balance of v (since it's receiving ci).\n\nSo the problem becomes: assign directions to edges such that for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards v equals the balance of v.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph where the balance for each node is as required. And the edges are undirected, so for each edge between u and v, we can choose to direct it from u to v or v to u. This choice affects the balance of u and v.\n\nBut how to find such directions?\n\nThis is similar to finding an Eulerian orientation, but with specific balances. For example, in an Eulerian orientation, the balance for each node is zero. Here, the balance for the source is F, the sink is -F, and others are zero.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation?\n\nAn approach is to model this as a directed graph and use a greedy algorithm. For example, perform a BFS or DFS, and for each edge, direct it in a way that helps balance the nodes.\n\nHere's an idea inspired by the standard approach for finding Eulerian trails:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where we have to assign directions to edges. For each node, we track the current balance. Initially, the balance is set as described. For each edge, we can direct it from u to v if u has a positive balance and v has a negative balance. This would reduce the balance of u and increase the balance of v.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute F as the sum of ci for all edges connected to the source (vertex 1). Direct all those edges away from the source. For example, for each edge between 1 and u, direct it from 1 to u. This contributes to the balance of 1 (reducing its balance by ci, since it's sending out the flow) and to the balance of u (increasing by ci).\n\nWait, no. The balance for a node is the amount of flow that needs to be sent out. Initially, the source has balance F. When we direct an edge from source to u, this sends out ci from the source, so the source's balance decreases by ci. The node u receives ci, so its balance increases by ci (since it now has an inflow of ci, which means it needs to send out that much more to balance).\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nLet me think again. The balance for a node is the amount of flow that needs to be sent out. So for the source, initially, the balance is F. For each edge directed away from the source, the balance of the source decreases by ci (because it's sending out that flow). The balance of the destination node increases by ci (because it's receiving that flow, which needs to be sent out again).\n\nSo, for each node, we can track the current balance. Initially:\n\n- balance[1] = F (source needs to send out F)\n- balance[n] = -F (sink needs to receive F)\n- balance[v] = 0 for other nodes.\n\nThen, for each edge not connected to the source, we can process them and direct them in a way that helps reduce the balance of nodes.\n\nFor example, if we have a node u with balance > 0 (needs to send out more flow), and a node v with balance < 0 (needs to receive more flow), we can direct the edge from u to v. This will decrease the balance of u by ci (since it sends out ci) and increase the balance of v by ci (since it receives ci). This brings both balances closer to zero.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n- For all edges connected to the source, direct them away from the source. Update the balance of the source and the other end accordingly.\n- For the remaining edges, process them by finding a pair of nodes (u, v) where u has positive balance and v has negative balance. Direct the edge from u to v. This reduces the balance of u by ci and increases the balance of v by ci.\n- Repeat until all edges are processed.\n\nBut how to find such pairs efficiently?\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a BFS or DFS approach. For example, we can maintain a queue of nodes with non-zero balances. For each edge, we can direct it from the node with positive balance to the node with negative balance.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, we can perform a BFS starting from the source. For each node, we can process its adjacent edges and direct them in a way that balances the flow.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where we want to direct edges such that the balance of each node becomes zero. For each edge between u and v, if we have a direction from u to v, then u's balance is decreased by ci, and v's balance is increased by ci.\n\nSo, the idea is to build a directed graph where for each node, the balance is adjusted as we process edges.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nInitialize the balance array as described.\n\nFor each edge not connected to the source:\n\n   if u is the source or v is the source: already handled.\n\n   else:\n\n      we need to decide the direction of the edge between u and v.\n\nSo, for each such edge, we can check the balance of u and v. Suppose that balance[u] > 0 and balance[v] < 0. Then we direct the edge from u to v. This reduces balance[u] by ci and increases balance[v] by ci. If balance[u] is zero, or balance[v] is zero, then we need to find another way.\n\nBut how to handle cases where both nodes have positive or negative balances?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, since the problem guarantees that a solution exists, there must be a way to direct the edges such that the balances are adjusted properly.\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed graph and perform a BFS or DFS traversal, directing edges in the direction that helps reduce the balance.\n\nFor example, during traversal, whenever we visit a node, we check if it has a positive balance. If so, we look for an adjacent node with a negative balance and direct the edge from this node to that adjacent node.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a priority queue or something similar.\n\nBut for large n and m, this needs to be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: Treat this as a directed graph where the balance for each node is the amount of flow that needs to be sent out. For each node u with balance > 0, we can find any adjacent node v (not processed yet) and direct the edge from u to v. This will reduce the balance of u by ci and increase the balance of v by ci. Then, we can continue processing v, which may now have a positive or negative balance.\n\nThis is similar to a BFS approach. Let me think of this as follows:\n\nWe can build a directed graph incrementally. We start with the source, which has a positive balance. Then, for each node in the queue, we process its adjacent edges. For each edge between u and v that hasn't been directed yet:\n\n   if u is the current node and balance[u] > 0:\n\n       direct the edge from u to v.\n\n       subtract ci from balance[u], add ci to balance[v].\n\n       add v to the queue if balance[v] is not zero.\n\n   else if v is the current node and balance[v] > 0:\n\n       direct the edge from v to u.\n\n       subtract ci from balance[v], add ci to balance[u].\n\n       add u to the queue if balance[u] is not zero.\n\nBut how to manage this for all edges?\n\nThis seems like a possible approach. Let's think about the steps:\n\n- Initialize the balance array.\n\n- Create a queue (like a BFS queue) with the source node (balance[F]).\n\n- For each node in the queue:\n\n   for each adjacent edge that hasn't been directed yet:\n\n       if the edge connects to another node w:\n\n           if balance of current node is positive:\n\n               direct the edge from current node to w.\n\n               update balance of current node -= ci.\n\n               update balance of w += ci.\n\n               if balance of w is not zero, add it to the queue.\n\n           else:\n\n               direct the edge from w to current node.\n\n               update balance of w -= ci.\n\n               update balance of current node += ci.\n\n               if balance of current node is not zero, add it to the queue.\n\nBut how to track which edges have been processed?\n\nThis approach would require for each edge, to track whether it has been directed. However, since the edges are undirected, and we process them once, this is manageable.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think about data structures.\n\nWe can represent the graph as an adjacency list. For each node u, we have a list of edges (each represented as a tuple of (v, ci, index)), along with a flag indicating whether the edge has been processed.\n\nBut for the purposes of this algorithm, once an edge is processed, we can mark it as such and not process it again.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\nInitialize balance array:\n\nbalance = [0] * (n+1)\n\nF = sum of ci for edges connected to source (vertex 1)\n\nbalance[1] = F\n\nbalance[n] = -F\n\nThen, for all edges connected to the source:\n\n   for each such edge (u, v, ci):\n\n       if u is 1, direction is 0 (u to v)\n\n       else, direction is 1 (v to u, which is 1 to u)\n\n       then, subtract ci from balance[1], add ci to balance[v] (or u, depending on direction)\n\n       mark this edge as processed.\n\nThen, create a queue with the source node (1).\n\nThen, for each node in the queue:\n\n   for each adjacent edge not yet processed:\n\n       let's say the edge is between current node u and another node v.\n\n       if balance[u] > 0:\n\n           direct the edge from u to v.\n\n           balance[u] -= ci\n\n           balance[v] += ci\n\n           add v to the queue if balance[v] != 0\n\n       else:\n\n           direct the edge from v to u.\n\n           balance[v] -= ci\n\n           balance[u] += ci\n\n           add u to the queue if balance[u] != 0\n\n       mark the edge as processed.\n\nBut wait, this approach might not work for all cases. For example, what if the balance of u is zero, but the edge is between u and v, and v has a positive balance. How to handle that?\n\nBut according to the algorithm, when we process the edge, we look at the current node (u) in the queue. If balance[u] is zero, then we would direct the edge from v to u. But since u is in the queue, how do we know to process it?\n\nThis seems like a possible issue. However, since the problem states that a solution exists, the algorithm should eventually balance all nodes.\n\nBut perhaps the algorithm needs to check both ends of the edge. For example, when processing an edge between u and v, if u is the current node and balance[u] is positive, direct from u to v. Else, if balance[v] is positive, direct from v to u. Otherwise, perhaps there's a way to direct it based on the balances.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nAlternatively, during traversal, whenever you process a node u, you look for edges that are not yet processed. For each such edge between u and v, you check if u has a positive balance. If yes, direct the edge from u to v. Otherwise, if v has a positive balance, direct it from v to u. But this may not always be possible.\n\nBut given that the problem guarantees a solution exists, this approach should work.\n\nLet me test this logic on the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nEdges:\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nInitially, F is sum of edges connected to source (vertex 1). The edges connected to source are:\n\nEdge 2: 1-2 (ci=10)\n\nEdge 3: 3-1 (ci=5). So F = 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nbalance[1] = 15, balance[3] = -15, others are zero.\n\nProcess edges connected to source:\n\nFor edge 2 (1-2, 10): direction is 0 (ai=1 to bi=2). So balance[1] -= 10 → becomes 5. balance[2] += 10 → becomes 10.\n\nFor edge 3 (3-1, 5): direction is 1 (bi=1 to ai=3). So direction is 1→3. balance[1] -=5 → 5-5=0. balance[3] +=5 → -15 +5 = -10.\n\nNow, the queue starts with node 1 (balance 0). But balance[1] is zero, so we may not add it to the queue. Or perhaps we add it anyway. Let's see.\n\nThe queue starts with node 1. Now, we look at its adjacent edges. Edge 2 and 3 are already processed. What about other edges? There are no other edges connected to node 1. So we move on.\n\nNow, what about node 2? Its balance is 10, which is positive. How does it get added to the queue?\n\nAh, perhaps the initial queue should include all nodes with non-zero balance. Wait, after processing the edges connected to the source, the balance of node 2 is 10, node 3 is -10. So the queue should contain node 2 (balance 10) and node 3 (balance -10). But how?\n\nWait, the initial queue after processing edges connected to the source is:\n\nbalance[1] is 0, balance[2] is 10, balance[3] is -10.\n\nSo the queue should be initialized with nodes that have non-zero balance. So node 2 and node 3.\n\nBut how to track this? Perhaps after processing the edges connected to the source, we add all nodes with non-zero balance to the queue.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nIn code:\n\nAfter initializing the balance array, we can iterate through all nodes and add those with non",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies the conditions of a valid maximum flow. Specifically, the flow must be conserved at each vertex (except the source and sink), the source must have no incoming edges, and the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Total Flow from Source**: Calculate the total flow (F) from the source by summing the flow values of all edges connected to the source vertex (vertex 1).\n2. **Initialize Balance Array**: Use a balance array to track the net flow that each vertex needs to send out or receive. The source has a positive balance equal to F, the sink has a negative balance equal to -F, and all other vertices start with zero balance.\n3. **Direct Edges Connected to Source**: Direct all edges connected to the source away from the source and update their respective balances.\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal**: Use BFS to process the remaining edges.
