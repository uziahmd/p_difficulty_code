After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where their mark is the maximum for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters, each representing the marks. Oh right, each line is a string of digits, like '223' for a student's marks in three subjects.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (column), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark in that subject equals the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how do I process the data? Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, let's parse the input. Let's read n and m. Then read the next n lines as a list of strings. Each string can be converted into a list of integers, perhaps. For example, the first example input is 3 students and 3 subjects. The first student's marks are [2,2,3], second [2,3,2], third [1,1,2].\n\nThen, for each subject (columns 0, 1, 2), find the maximum value. For subject 0, the values are 2, 2, 1. Max is 2. For subject 1: 2,3,1 → max is 3. For subject 2: 3,2,2 → max is 3.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max of that subject. For example, student 1 has marks 2,2,3. For subject 0, his mark is 2 which is equal to the max (so he is best here). For subject 2, his mark is 3 which is the max. So he is successful. Student 2 has 2,3,2. For subject 1, his mark is 3 which is the max. So he is successful. Student 3 has 1,1,2. None of these are equal to the max in their respective subjects. So he isn't. Hence total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read the input into a 2D array (list of lists of integers).\n- For each column (subject), compute the maximum value.\n- For each row (student), check if any of their entries in the columns is equal to the max of that column. If any, count them.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string. Then convert each string into a list of integers. So for example, for the first input line after n and m, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have the data as a list of lists, then for each column, find the max. Let's think about how to get the columns. For example, for the data:\n\nstudents = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nsubjects are columns 0, 1, 2. For each column j, collect all students[i][j] and find max.\n\nSo, for each j in 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_marks = [max(students[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nWait, but how to compute that. Let's think. For each column j, iterate through all rows i and collect the values. Then take the max.\n\nOnce we have the max_marks array, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max for that subject.\n\nSo for each student in students:\n\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            mark this student as successful and break\n\nSo the count is the number of students who have at least one such occurrence.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead the input into a 2D list.\n\nCompute max_marks for each subject.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max_marks for that subject.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to do that?\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines. For each line, convert it into a list of integers.\n\nFor example:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nThen compute max_marks for each column.\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_marks = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for each j, we can compute the max.\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max for that subject.\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nYes. Because once a student has at least one subject where they are the best, we count them once.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 3 3, then 223, 232, 112.\n\ngrades would be [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max 3\n\nso max_marks is [2,3,3]\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]. Check each j:\n\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]. j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]. j=0: 1 < 2. j=1: 1 <3. j=2: 2 <3. So no. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input: 3 5, then 91728, 11828, 11111.\n\ngrades:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → max 8\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nmax_marks is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow for each student:\n\nstudent 0: has 9 in column 0 (max is 9) → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 1: check each column. column 2 has 8 (max is 8). So yes. Counted.\n\nstudent 2: check columns. column 1 has 1 (max is 1). So yes. Counted.\n\nSo total 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: All students have same marks. Like n=2, m=1. All have 5. Then each student is best in the subject. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is best, count is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 9], student 2 has [9, 9]. Then for each subject, max is 9. Both students are best in both subjects. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 8], student 2 has [9, 9]. For subject 0, max is 9. Both students have 9. So both are considered best. For subject 1, max is 9. Only student 2. So each student is successful. So count is 2.\n\nSo the code would count each student if they have at least one max in any subject.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, note that the input may be given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the sample input shows two inputs, but the actual problem says that the input is given as per the first input line. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. But in the sample input, the first example is given as a list of inputs. Wait, perhaps the user is supposed to read from stdin, but in the sample input, perhaps the first input is for the first test case, and the second is for the second test case. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as follows: the first line contains n and m, then n lines of m characters each.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as two different test cases. But perhaps the problem is that the user is to process a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as per the first line. The sample shows two examples, but the actual code is supposed to read from standard input. So, the code should read a single test case. So the sample input shows two different test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case. So the code will read n and m, then n lines of m digits.\n\nSo the code should be written as:\n\nRead n and m from input, then read n lines, each line being a string of m digits.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines. Then process as explained.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read n lines.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading from stdin, there might be trailing spaces or newlines. But the code can be written as:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nThen compute max_marks for each column.\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > current_max:\n            current_max = grades[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(current_max)\n\nThen count the successful students.\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting this with the first sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nProcessing:\n\ngrades is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for columns 0, 1, 2 are 2, 3, 3.\n\ncount is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngrades:\n\n[9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncol0: 9,1,1 → 9\n\ncol1: 1,1,1 →1\n\ncol2:7,8,1 →8\n\ncol3:2,2,1 →2\n\ncol4:8,8,1 →8\n\nso max_marks is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nEach student:\n\nstudent 0 has 9 in col0 → yes.\n\nstudent 1 has 8 in col2 → yes.\n\nstudent 2 has 1 in col1 → yes.\n\nSo count is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 and a line with 5. Then the code returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1, then 5 and 5. Then max_marks is 5. Both students have 5, so both are counted. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the code is as written. Now, the code must be written to read from stdin and output to stdout. So the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the marks of each student for each subject.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, calculate the maximum mark obtained by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark is equal to the maximum mark for that subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > current_max:\n            current_max = grades[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(current_max)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as integers for the number of students and subjects. Each subsequent line is converted into a list of integers representing the marks of each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This helps in determining the best student for each subject.\n3. **Counting Successful Students**: For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum marks per subject and checking each student against these values. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of students and subjects, making it efficient for the given constraints.",
