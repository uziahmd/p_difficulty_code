He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n where this count equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that satisfy the condition. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Because each of their factorials has exactly 1 trailing zero. Wait, no. Wait 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1 zero), etc. So why does that happen? Because when you go from 5 to 6, the count of 5s increases by 1 (since 5 is included once). But wait, 5 is included once in 5! and then again in 10! So between 5 and 9, the count of trailing zeros is 1. So for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nBut how do I find all such n for a given m?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimum n that gives exactly m zeros. Then check if there are other numbers that also give m zeros. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, in the sample, there are 5 numbers. Why?\n\nBecause when you have a number that is not a multiple of 5, adding 1 to it doesn't increase the count of trailing zeros. For example, 5 has one 5, 6 has one 5, etc. Until you hit 10, which adds another 5. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So the numbers 5-9 (inclusive) are five numbers. But when m is such that there's a number that's a multiple of 5, maybe there's a different scenario.\n\nWait, but for some m, there may be no solution. Like if m is 5, then maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Wait, let's think. Let's compute for n=24: floor(24/5) =4, floor(24/25)=0. Total 4. For n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 25 and 24, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the problem is that for some m, there's no n that gives exactly m zeros. So how do I find for a given m whether there are any n's, and how many?\n\nSo the idea is to find the minimal n where the count is m, and then check if there are consecutive numbers that also have the same count. But how?\n\nFirst, I need a function that, given n, returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nLet me write that function. Let's call it count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way.\n\nNow, the problem is to find all n such that count_zeros(n) == m.\n\nBut how to find these n's efficiently?\n\nLet me think about binary search. For a given m, we can find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m. But how to find the exact numbers?\n\nWait, for example, if m is 1, then the minimal n is 5. Then, the next numbers (6,7,8,9) also have the same count. But when you reach 10, the count increases to 2. So the numbers between 5 and 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers.\n\nSo for a given m, the possible n's are in a range. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think: suppose we find the lower bound of n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nBut how to find if there exists an n with count_zeros(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or perhaps more?\n\nWait, let's take m=2. The numbers would be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Because 10! has two zeros (from 5 and 10), and 14! has two zeros. Then 15! has 3 zeros. So that's 5 numbers again. So why 5 numbers?\n\nBecause when you reach a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1. But for numbers that are not multiples of 5, adding 1 doesn't change the count. So between the first occurrence of a certain count and the next multiple of 5, there are 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the count is achieved by a number that is a multiple of higher powers of 5?\n\nFor example, let's take m=3. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(14) is 2 (from 5, 10), 15: 3 (5, 10, 15). So 15 has 3 zeros. Then 16, 17, 18, 19 would also have 3 zeros. Then 20! would have 4 (from 5, 10, 15, 20). So for m=3, the numbers are 15,16,17,18,19. Again 5 numbers.\n\nSo perhaps, for each m, the numbers that satisfy the condition are either 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, but when m is such that there is no n with exactly m zeros, then it's zero.\n\nBut how can there be 1 number?\n\nWait, let's think about m=6. Let's see:\n\nFor n=25, count_zeros(25) is 6 (5+1). Then for 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. Wait, 30's count is 7 (floor(30/5)=6, floor(30/25)=1, total 7). So for n=25, count is 6. Then 26, 27, 28, 29: count is 6. So that's 5 numbers (25-29). Wait, but 25 is a multiple of 5^2, but the count is 6. So the numbers 25,26,27,28,29: 5 numbers. So again 5 numbers.\n\nWait, but maybe when m is the count for a number that is a multiple of 5, but not part of a sequence. Wait, maybe not. So perhaps for every m that exists, there are exactly 5 numbers except for some cases?\n\nWait, no. Let's think of m=0. Well, the problem says m starts from 1. So perhaps the answer is that for each m, there are either 0 or 5 numbers. But in the sample input, m=1 gives 5 numbers. However, what about when m is the count of a number that is a multiple of 5, but the next number increases the count by 2?\n\nWait, for example, let's take m=5. Let's see what happens. Let's find n where count_zeros(n) =5.\n\nLooking for n such that count_zeros(n) =5.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nn=24: count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4.\n\nn=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1. Total 6. So 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there is no n with count 5. Therefore, for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo here, the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. As before, there are 5 numbers (25-29).\n\nSo the key is that for some m, there's no solution, and for others, there are 5 solutions.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, find the lower and upper bounds for n where count_zeros(n) equals m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\nThen, check if there exists a number where count_zeros(n) = m. If not, return 0.\n\nBut how to find if such numbers exist?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Then check if count_zeros(n+1) is equal to m. If yes, then there are multiple numbers. But how?\n\nBut perhaps the better approach is to find the lower and upper bounds for n where count_zeros(n) equals m.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think: For a given m, the possible n's are in the range [a, b], where a is the smallest n with count_zeros(n) =m, and b is the largest n with count_zeros(n) =m.\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nAlternatively, think that for a given m, the numbers that have exactly m trailing zeros are those n where:\n\ncount_zeros(n) = m, and count_zeros(n+1) = m+1?\n\nNo, not necessarily. For example, when n=5, count_zeros(5)=1. count_zeros(6)=1. So for n=5, the next number's count is same. So the upper bound for the range is the number where count_zeros(n) = m, but count_zeros(n+1) = m+1. So the upper bound is the first number where the count increases.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's are between the first occurrence of m and the first occurrence of m+1 minus 1.\n\nSo, for example, for m=1, the first occurrence is 5. The first occurrence of m+1 (2) is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is to find the lower bound (the first n where count_zeros(n) = m) and the upper bound (the first n where count_zeros(n) = m+1) minus 1.\n\nBut how to find the lower bound and upper bound?\n\nSo, for the lower bound, we can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m. But how to know if such n exists?\n\nAlternatively, for the upper bound, find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. Then the upper bound is n-1. Then, the numbers between the lower bound and upper bound (inclusive) would be the possible candidates.\n\nBut how to find the lower bound?\n\nWait, perhaps the lower bound is the first n where count_zeros(n) = m. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, we can find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >=m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this x. Then check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal y where count_zeros(y) >= m+1. Then the numbers from x to y-1 will have exactly m zeros. So the count is y -x.\n\nBut how to find x and y?\n\nThis seems manageable with binary search.\n\nSo, for example, for m=1:\n\nFind x such that count_zeros(x) >=1. The minimal x is 5. Then check if count_zeros(5) is 1. Yes. Then find y such that count_zeros(y) >=2. The minimal y is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. So the count is 9-5+1 = 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nSimilarly, for m=5, find x where count_zeros(x) >=5. Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25)=6. So x is 25. Check count_zeros(25) is 6, which is greater than m=5. So there is no solution. Hence, output is 0.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For the given m, find the minimal x where count_zeros(x) >=m.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(x) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal y where count_zeros(y) >=m+1.\n\n- The numbers from x to y-1 are all the numbers with exactly m zeros.\n\n- The count is (y-1 -x +1) = y -x.\n\nBut then, how to compute x and y?\n\nWe can use binary search for this.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, implement count_zeros(n) as before.\n\nThen, for a given m, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Find x = the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\n2. Check if count_zeros(x) ==m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Else, find y = the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m+1.\n\n4. The numbers from x to y-1 are the valid numbers. The count is y -x.\n\nBut then, how to compute x and y using binary search?\n\nLet me think about the binary search for x. For example, to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nThe possible range for n is from 1 to something. What's the upper bound for binary search?\n\nWell, since count_zeros(n) increases as n increases, the maximum possible value for n for a given m is 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. For example, for m=1, 5*1=5. For m=2, 5*2=10. For m=5, 5*5=25, count_zeros(25) is 6. So maybe the upper bound can be 5*m. But perhaps even higher. Wait, but for the binary search, we need an upper bound that is definitely larger than the required n. So for example, for m, the upper bound can be 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m (since each 5 contributes 1, but there are m multiples of 5 in 5*m. However, higher multiples (like 25, 125, etc.) contribute more. So the count_zeros(5*m) is definitely >=m. So using 5*m as upper bound is safe.\n\nAlternatively, since for m up to 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable for binary search.\n\nSo the binary search for x (minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m) can be done between low=0 and high=5*m.\n\nWait, but what if m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo for the binary search, the function to find x is as follows:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for example, for target m=1, this would find 5. For target m=2, returns 10.\n\nOnce x is found, check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nElse, find y as find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers from x to y-1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo for example, for m=1, x=5, y= find_min_n(2) =10. So numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the count is y -x. For example, 10-5=5. Which is the correct count.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. So y-x is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code for the problem would be:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, handle specially. But according to the input constraints, m is >=1.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n   the numbers are x, x+1, ..., y-1.\n\n   the count is y -x.\n\n   output the count followed by the numbers.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, for m=1, the output is 5 numbers. Which is y -x = 10-5=5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nfind_min_n(6) would be 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) is 25? No, let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(26) is 6. count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7. So find_min_n(7) is 30. So y=30. So numbers from 25 to 29. 29-25+1=5 numbers. Which is 30-25=5. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut how to handle cases where m is such that there are no solutions?\n\nLike m=5. find_min_n(5) is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output 0.\n\nThus, the code would work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, the helper functions.\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, the find_min_n function. But in code, perhaps we can implement it with binary search.\n\nBut for the code, the function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut the input is given as a list, perhaps? Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nIn the example, the input is ['1', '5'] and the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, perhaps the input is a list of multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says that the input is an integer m. But the example shows that the input is given as a list, perhaps because the user is testing with multiple cases. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. The sample input shows that for m=1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers. For m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the example given seems to be a list of inputs. However, the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code should read a single m from stdin.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code must read a single integer m from stdin. However, in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which may be a mistake in formatting. Probably, the sample input is two separate test cases. But the code is supposed to process a single m.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code should read from stdin. So the code should read m as an integer from the input.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute the numbers as per the steps above.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut in Python, for large m, the binary search will be efficient.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nImplement the binary search function.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nBut for very large m, say 1e5, 5*m is 5e5. For binary search, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nOnce x is found, check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute y = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nThen the numbers are x, x+1, ..., y-1.\n\nSo the count is y - x.\n\nBut then, how to generate the list of numbers?\n\nFor example, if the count is 5, then the list is [x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4].\n\nSo the code would generate these numbers.\n\nBut what if y -x is zero? That can't happen, because if x is such that count_zeros(x) = m, then y is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m+1. So y must be >=x+1. Because count_zeros(x) is m, and count_zeros(y) is >=m+1. So the difference between y and x is at least 1. So the count is y -x.\n\nBut for example, if x is 5, y is 10. Then y -x is 5. Which is the correct count.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n   k = y -x\n\n   print(k)\n\n   print the numbers x, x+1,..., y-1.\n\nBut how to handle the case when m is such that there's no solution?\n\nSo, the code.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, the code needs to read m from input. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n        k = y - x\n\n        print(k)\n\n        if k >0:\n\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\n        else:\n\n            print()\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, when m=1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers 5 6 7 8 9. The code for that case would generate range(x, y) which is range(5, 10), which is [5,6,7,8,9]. So the code would print them as space-separated.\n\nBut when k is 5, the code would print '5' followed by the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, the line:\n\nprint(k)\n\nthen print the numbers.\n\nBut in the sample, the first output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code for that case would generate:\n\nprint(k) → prints 5 followed by a newline. Then print the numbers, which would be printed as \"5 6 7 8 9\" followed by a newline.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the print(k) would output 5 followed by a new line, and then the next print would output the numbers, which would be another line. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the line:\n\nprint(' '.join(...)) would output the numbers on the same line. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if k is zero? Well, in that case, the code would have already printed 0, and the else clause is not entered.\n\nBut in the code, the 'if k>0' is redundant. Because when we reach the else clause, x is such that count_zeros(x) = m, and y is find_min_n(m+1). Since count_zeros(x) = m, and count_zeros(y) >=m+1. So y must be >=x+1. Because if y were x, then count_zeros(y) would be m, which is less than m+1. So y must be >=x+1. So y -x is >=1. Thus, k is always >=1 in the else clause.\n\nThus, the code can safely print the range(x, y) as the numbers.\n\nBut in Python, range(x, y) is [x, x+1, ..., y-1], which is correct.\n\nTesting the code for m=1:\n\nx is 5, y is 10. range(5,10) → 5,6,7,8,9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5. x is find_min_n(5). Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(5) would search for the minimal n with count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So during binary search, the code would find 25 as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nx is find_min_n(6) → 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed. y is find_min_n(7). Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(7) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(29) is 6 (29//5=5, 29//25=1. 5+1=6). 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So y is 30. So the numbers are 25 to 29. So 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about m=0? According to the problem statement, m is >=1, so no need to handle.\n\nAnother edge case: m=100000. Let's see. The code will compute x as find_min_n(1e5). But for that, the binary search is O(log (5*1e5)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut what about when m is very large? For example, m=1e5. Let's think about the code's performance. For each binary search, the count_zeros function is O(log n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the case where k is zero, but the code is in the else clause, but that's not possible.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = y - x\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output for m=5 is 0. So for m=5, the code would print 0.\n\nBut in the sample input, the second input is 5, and the output is 0.\n\nBut in the code, for m=5, x is find_min_n(5) → which returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So the code outputs 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code would output 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nBut what if m=2?\n\nx = find_min_n(2) → 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then y is find_min_n(3). Let's compute count_zeros(14) is 2 + 0 = 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So find_min_n(3) returns 15. So the numbers are 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what if the m is such that there are multiple numbers, but the code returns them correctly?\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when m=24?\n\nLet me compute for m=24.\n\nfind_min_n(24) → what is the minimal n with count_zeros(n) >=24.\n\nLet me think. Let's compute count_zeros(100) = 20 + 4 = 24? Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(100) = 100//5 = 20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0. Total 24. So yes. So x is 100. Then check count_zeros(100) is 24. So yes.\n\nThen find_min_n(25). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) is 24. ... count_zeros(104) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. 21+4=25. So find_min_n(25) returns 105. So the numbers are from 100 to 104. So 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother edge case: m=25. Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(25) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=25. For n=105, count_zeros(105) is 25. So x=105. Then check count_zeros(105) is 25. Then find_min_n(26). Let's compute count_zeros(109) is 25. count_zeros(110) is 26 (110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0. 22+4=26). So y is 110. So numbers from 105 to 109: 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, considering the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: m=1 → output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5 → output is 0.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut in the code, when the code prints the numbers, for the first case, the code prints '5' followed by the numbers. But the sample output shows that the first line is the count, and the second line is the numbers.\n\nIn the code, for example, for m=1, the code would print:\n\nprint(k) → 5 followed by a new line.\n\nprint(' '.join(...)) → the numbers on the next line.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the sample output, the first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code outputs two lines: first line is 5, second line is the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut the problem says that the output should first print k, then print the k integers in increasing order.\n\nYes, the code does that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in the code, for the case when k is zero, the code prints 0. For example, for m=5, the code outputs 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code is ready.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list these integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To efficiently find the range of numbers `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps in quickly narrowing down the minimum value of `n` where the count of trailing zeros meets or exceeds `m`.\n3. **Check Validity of Range**: Once we find the minimum value `x` such that `count_zeros(x) == m`, we then find the minimum value `y` such that `count_zeros(y) == m+1`. The valid range of `n` values will be from `x` to `y-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = y - x\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least the given target value. This helps in efficiently determining the lower bound of our valid range.\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - Reads the input value `m`.\n   - Uses `find_min_n` to determine the smallest `x` where the count of trailing zeros is exactly `m`.\n   - If no such `x` exists, it prints `0`.\n   - Otherwise, it finds the smallest `y` where the count of trailing zeros is `m+1`, and prints the range of numbers from `x` to `y-1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the valid range of numbers using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
