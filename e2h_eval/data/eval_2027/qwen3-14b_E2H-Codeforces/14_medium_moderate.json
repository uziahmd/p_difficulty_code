    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo, given m, we need to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5! it's 120 (one zero). 6! is 720, same count. Up to 9! which is 362880. So all those numbers have exactly one trailing zero. But why? Because when you go from 5 to 9, the count of 5s increases only once (for 5, 10 would add another). Wait, but 5,6,7,8,9: each of their factorials have exactly one 5 in their factors. Because 5 contributes one, 6-9 don't add any more 5s. But when you get to 10, then 10/5 is 2, plus 10/25 is 0, so total two zeros. So for m=1, the possible n's are from 5 to 9, which is five numbers.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the trailing zero count is exactly m. Now, the challenge is to find those n's efficiently.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that result in exactly m zeros. However, for some m, there may be no such n. Like in the sample input where m=5, the output is 0. Wait, why? Let me think. Let's see for m=5. What numbers have exactly 5 trailing zeros?\n\nLet me compute the trailing zeros for some numbers:\n\nFor example, 25! has floor(25/5) + floor(25/25) = 5 + 1 = 6 zeros. So that's 6. So maybe for m=5, there is no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Because between numbers like 24 and 25:\n\nLet's calculate for 24: 24/5 = 4.8 → floor is 4. 24/25 is 0. So total 4. Then 25 adds 5+1=6. So there's a jump from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the problem is that sometimes, the count of trailing zeros jumps by more than 1. So for those m's that are in between such jumps, there's no solution.\n\nSo the approach is to find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nThe first step is to find the minimal n such that the trailing zero count is >=m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find all the numbers in a certain range.\n\nWait, but how to find the possible n's?\n\nAnother thought: For each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or some other number?) that satisfy the condition. Wait, in the sample case m=1, there are 5 numbers. How does that happen?\n\nBecause when you have a number n where the trailing zero count is exactly m, and then the next numbers (n+1, n+2, etc.) until the next multiple of 5 will also have the same count. Because adding numbers that are not multiples of 5 won't add any new 5s. So for example, 5! has one zero. 6! is 6*5! so it's 6*120 = 720. So trailing zeros still 1. Similarly for 7,8,9. But when you reach 10, which is 2*5, so adding another 5. So the count increases by 1.\n\nSo the possible n's that give exactly m zeros are consecutive numbers. So for example, if there exists an n where count is m, then there might be a range of numbers (like 5-9) that all have the same count.\n\nBut how to find the range?\n\nSo the idea is to find the lower and upper bounds of n where the trailing zero count is exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where the count is >=m. Then check if the count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the maximum n where the count is exactly m. Then all numbers between min_n and max_n would be valid.\n\nWait, but how to find the min and max n for which the count is exactly m.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the numbers n that have exactly m trailing zeros must lie between some lower and upper bounds. For example, the minimal n that gives m zeros is the first occurrence, and the maximal n is the last occurrence before the count increases again.\n\nBut how to find these numbers?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing. Because as n increases, the count can stay the same or increase.\n\nSo for example, when n increases by 1, f(n) can either stay the same or increase by 1 or more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then it adds at least 1. But if it's a multiple of 25, it adds 2, etc.\n\nSo for a given m, the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros are those n where f(n) = m. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, the set of such n's is a contiguous range. So if there exists such n's, they form a continuous interval.\n\nBut how to find that interval?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Then find the largest n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers from the smallest to the largest inclusive are the answers. But how to find these two numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, there's a range of n's where f(n) = m. So the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that f(n) = m.\n\n2. Find the largest n such that f(n) = m.\n\nIf there is no such n (i.e., there's no n with f(n) = m), then output 0.\n\nBut how to find these values?\n\nBut how to find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is that value. Then, find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Which would be the minimal n where f(n) = m+1 minus 1.\n\nWait, that's an interesting idea. Let's think:\n\nSuppose that for some m, there exists n such that f(n) = m. Then, the minimal n where f(n) = m is the first occurrence. The maximal n is the first occurrence of m+1 minus 1. Because once you reach the first occurrence of m+1, all numbers after that will have f(n) >= m+1. So the numbers between the first occurrence of m and the first occurrence of m+1 minus 1 will have exactly m.\n\nSo for example, in the sample case m=1. The first occurrence of m=1 is 5. The first occurrence of m=2 is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (10-1=9) are the ones with exactly 1 zero.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor a given m, find the first occurrence of m (call it low), and the first occurrence of m+1 (call it high). Then the numbers between low and high-1 are the valid n's. But if there is no occurrence of m (i.e., the first occurrence of m is not found, or the first occurrence of m+1 is not found?), then there's no solution.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of m?\n\nWell, since f(n) is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then, check if f(n) equals m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is that value.\n\nSimilarly, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Then, the maximum n for m is that value minus 1.\n\nSo the number of solutions is (max_n - min_n + 1) if max_n >= min_n, else 0.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem would be:\n\nGiven m:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_low where f(n_low) >= m.\n\n   Check if f(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n2. Find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the maximum n for m is n_high - 1.\n\n3. The valid numbers are from n_low to n_high -1, inclusive.\n\n   So the count is (n_high -1 - n_low +1) = n_high - n_low.\n\n   If n_high -1 < n_low, then no solution (but that would imply that there's no n with f(n) = m, which should have been checked in step 1).\n\nBut how to compute f(n) efficiently?\n\nThe function f(n) is the sum of floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the term is zero.\n\nSo for a given n, this can be computed quickly.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement the binary search for finding the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nBut what is the possible range for binary search?\n\nWell, the minimal n for which f(n) >= m is somewhere between 0 and 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count of trailing zeros is at least m (since 5*m /5 is m, and higher terms contribute more). But maybe even lower. For example, m=1, 5*1=5, which is exactly the minimal n. But for m=5, the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25? Let's see:\n\nFor 25, the count is 5+1=6. So for m=5, the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25? Or is there a smaller n?\n\nLet's see:\n\nCheck 24: 24/5 is 4, 24/25 is 0. Total is 4. So less than 5. 25 gives 6. So the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25. But since f(25) is 6, which is larger than m=5, then there's no solution for m=5. Hence, output is zero.\n\nSo the binary search needs to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that value is exactly m.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nSo how to perform this binary search?\n\nThe lower bound can be 0, upper bound can be 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count is at least m. For example, 5*m divided by 5 is m, and higher terms contribute more.\n\nBut maybe 5*m is too big. For example, m=1, 5*1=5, which is correct. For m=5, 5*5=25, which is correct. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we find that n_low, check if f(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\nElse, find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) >= m+1. Then the maximum n for m is n_high -1.\n\nThen, the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the valid numbers.\n\nSo the count is (n_high -1 - n_low +1) = n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement a helper function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nImplement a function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nSo, for example, the binary search function.\n\nLet me think about the binary search function.\n\nThe binary search for the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*target (or some upper limit).\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n      high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid + 1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut what if the target is larger than the maximum possible count_zeros(n)? Well, for the problem constraints, m can be up to 1e5. So for example, for m=1e5, the upper limit would be 5*1e5 = 5e5. But for that, the count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5/5 + 5e5/25 + ... which is definitely more than 1e5. So the upper bound is safe.\n\nSo, once we have this function, let's proceed.\n\nSo for the given m, first find the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >= m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, then output 0.\n\nElse, find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1.\n\nThen the valid numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's no n_high? For example, when m is very large, but the code would handle that because the binary search will find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1. Even if m is very large, the code will find it.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nFind n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >=1.\n\nThe minimal n_low is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So yes.\n\nThen find n_high for m+1=2.\n\nFind minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >=2.\n\nWhich is 10. Because count_zeros(10) is 2. So the valid numbers are from 5 to 10-1=9. So numbers 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: m=5.\n\nFind n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n_low is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 which is not equal to 5. So output 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. What's the answer?\n\nLet's see. For m=6, the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >=6 is 25 (count is 6). Then find n_high for m+1=7. What's the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >=7?\n\nLet's compute for 25: count is 6. 26: same. 27: same. 28: same. 29: same. 30: 30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7. So n_high is 30. So the valid numbers are from 25 to 30-1=29. So numbers 25,26,27,28,29. That's 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the binary search function.\n\nBut how to implement it. Let's write a helper function called find_min_n(target) that returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut for the code, the code can be written as:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for some targets, 5*target might not be sufficient. For example, if target is 1, 5*target is 5, which is correct. For target=2, 5*2=10. Which is correct. But what if the target is 1e5? Let's see. The maximum possible n for m=1e5 is 5*1e5=5e5. But count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + 8e2 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = which is way more than 1e5. So the upper bound is safe.\n\nSo the function find_min_n is okay.\n\nOnce we have that, then:\n\nFor the given m, compute:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n    output 0\n\nelse:\n\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    the numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\n    the count is n_high - n_low.\n\n    output the count and the numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if n_high is not found? Well, since m can be up to 1e5, and the function find_min_n(m+1) will find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So even if m+1 is very large, the code will find it.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut the input is a list, for example, the first sample input is ['1', '5']? Wait, the user says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nBut in the example input, it's given as ['1', '5'] and output ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which seems to be two test cases. But the original problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the example is showing two separate test cases, perhaps for the same problem. Maybe the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are handled. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. However, the sample input shows two lines. Wait, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample is showing two separate test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the original problem is expecting to process multiple test cases. But the problem description says that the input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows two lines. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe example says:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the example is for two different inputs. For example, the first input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is m=5, output is 0. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. That's conflicting. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nBut looking back, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read one integer m from input. But the sample input shows two lines. That suggests that perhaps the sample is for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the original problem is part of a programming contest where multiple test cases are provided, but the problem description is not clear.\n\nBut the sample input and output suggest that the code needs to process multiple test cases. For example, the first input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. Second input is 5, output is 0. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a separate m. However, the problem statement says \"the only line of input contains an integer m\".\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking back at the original problem statement:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as ['1', '5'], and the output as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. This suggests that the input is a list of test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But given that the sample input is given as a list, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m.\n\nBut perhaps the user is using a format to represent multiple test cases. For example, in the problem, the input may be multiple lines, each with a value of m. For example, the first input line is 1, the second is 5, and the code should process them. But the problem says \"the only line of input\" which implies that there is only one m.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows two lines, perhaps the actual problem is to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement is unclear. But given that the sample input shows two cases, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple m's from input. But how?\n\nBut the problem's original note says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample is not correctly formatted. However, looking at the sample input and output, the first input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended that the code should process multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is one integer. This is conflicting. But given that the sample shows two test cases, perhaps the code should read multiple m's from input, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem statement says: \"the only line of input contains an integer m\". Therefore, perhaps the sample is incorrect, but the actual code should process a single m.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which could be two separate test cases. However, the problem statement says that the code should read a single m. Therefore, perhaps the sample is incorrect. But given that the user provided the sample input as ['1', '5'], and the output as two lines, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is ambiguous. However, the original problem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m. Therefore, the sample input is probably a mistake, but for the purpose of writing the code, we'll assume that the input is a single integer m.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. However, the problem's sample input and output may have been presented in a way that is not aligned with the problem statement. For example, perhaps the first input is m=1 and the second is m=5, and the outputs are as shown. But the code should process a single m. Therefore, the code should read one integer m from input, and output the answer for that m.\n\nThus, in the code, the input is read as a single integer m.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided a list of inputs, which may be a mistake. So the code should read a single integer m.\n\nTherefore, proceeding under that assumption.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nThe count is n_high - n_low.\n\nIf the count is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, output the count and the numbers in order.\n\nBut wait, for example, when m=1, n_low is 5, n_high is 10. So numbers from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nBut how to generate the list of numbers? For example, if the count is k, then the list is [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1].\n\nSo for the code, once we have n_low and n_high, the numbers are range(n_low, n_high).\n\nBut in Python, range is exclusive of the end. So range(n_low, n_high) gives numbers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nSo the code can generate the list as list(range(n_low, n_high)).\n\nBut for large ranges, generating the list may be time-consuming. However, given that m can be up to 1e5, and the maximum possible n_high - n_low is 5 (as in the sample case), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut what if the range is larger? For example, for m=2, the numbers from 10 to 14? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2, count_zeros(14) is 2 (since 14//5 = 2, 14//25=0. So sum is 2). count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3 + 15//25=0). So for m=2, the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. So 5 numbers again. So the range is 5 numbers. So for any m, the number of possible n's is either 0 or 5? Or is there a case where the range is longer?\n\nWait, let's think. For example, when m is 24. Let's say that the first occurrence of m=24 is at n=100. Then the first occurrence of m+1=25 is at n=105. So the numbers from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. But what if the first occurrence of m is at 100, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at 101? Then the numbers from 100 to 100 (only 1 number). How can that happen?\n\nIt depends on how the count_zeros increases. For example, if there's a number n where count_zeros(n) increases by more than 1.\n\nFor example, let's take m=4. Let's find the first occurrence of m=4.\n\nn=20: count_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). Then, for n=21, same count. Up to n=24. Then for n=25, count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=4, the first occurrence is 20, and the first occurrence of m+1=5 is 25. So the numbers are 20-24. That's 5 numbers.\n\nBut if there's a case where the count_zeros jumps by more than 1, then for m between the previous count and the new count, there's no solution. For example, m=5 in the earlier case.\n\nBut for a case where the count_zeros increases by 2, say, m=5 is skipped. So for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nBut for m=6, which is the count_zeros(25) = 6, the first occurrence is 25. The first occurrence of m+1=7 is 30. So numbers 25-29, 5 numbers.\n\nSo it seems that whenever there's a solution, the number of solutions is 5. But why?\n\nBecause when the count_zeros increases by 1, the numbers between the first occurrence of m and first occurrence of m+1-1 is 5 numbers. But why?\n\nWait, for example, when the first occurrence of m is at n_low, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_high. Then, the difference between n_high and n_low is 5? Because for example, n_low is 5, n_high is 10. Difference is 5. So the numbers from 5 to 9 is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if n_high is n_low + 5? Then the numbers are 5 numbers.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause the first occurrence of m+1 is when you hit a new multiple of 5. For example, when m is the count_zeros for n_low, then the next count_zeros is m+1 when you reach the next multiple of 5. But that's not always the case. For example, when n_low is 25 (count_zeros is 6). The next count_zeros is 7 when you reach 30 (count_zeros(30) = 30//5 + 30//25 = 6+1=7). So n_high is 30. So the difference between 30 and 25 is 5, leading to 5 numbers (25-29).\n\nBut what if there's a case where the next count_zeros is m+1 at n_low + 1?\n\nFor example, suppose m=0. But the problem says m starts at 1. So perhaps not relevant.\n\nBut what if m=24, and the first occurrence of m is at 100, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at 101? How would that happen?\n\nLet's imagine that for n=100, count_zeros is 24. Then for n=101, count_zeros is 24. For n=102, same. For n=103, same. For n=104, same. For n=105, count_zeros(105) is 105//5 + 105//25 + 105//125 = 21 + 4 + 0 = 25. So the first occurrence of m+1=25 is at 105. So the numbers are from 100 to 104, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo regardless of how the count_zeros increases, the difference between n_high and n_low is 5. So the number of solutions is 5. But why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros increases by 1 when you hit the next multiple of 5. So for example, the first occurrence of m is at some n_low, and the next occurrence of m+1 is at n_low + 5. So the numbers between n_low and n_low+4 (inclusive) are 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the count_zeros increases by more than 1?\n\nFor example, consider n=24. count_zeros(24) is 4. n=25: count_zeros is 6. So for m=5, there is no solution. But for m=4, the first occurrence is 20, and the first occurrence of m+1=5 is 25. So the numbers are 20-24, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the number of solutions is always 5 when there is a solution. But why? Because between the first occurrence of m and the first occurrence of m+1, there are exactly 5 numbers. But how?\n\nBecause the first occurrence of m+1 is at the next multiple of 5. So for example, if the first occurrence of m is at n_low, then the next multiple of 5 is n_low + (5 - (n_low %5))? No, not sure.\n\nBut regardless, the code is correct, and the number of solutions can be 0 or 5? Or maybe not always 5?\n\nLet me think of a case where the number of solutions is not 5.\n\nSuppose m=24, and n_low is 100 (count_zeros(100) is 24). Then, the first occurrence of m+1=25 is 105. So numbers from 100 to 104: 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=6, n_low=25, n_high=30. So 25-29: 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=2, n_low=10, n_high=15. 10-14: 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_low + 4?\n\nLet's think of a scenario where the first occurrence of m is at n_low, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_low +4.\n\nFor example, let's say that for n_low=5, count_zeros is 1. Then, for n_low+4=9, count_zeros is still 1. Then, for n=10, count_zeros is 2. So the first occurrence of m+1=2 is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (5 numbers).\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nSo in all cases, the number of solutions is 5 when there is a solution.\n\nBut wait, what if the first occurrence of m is at n_low, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_low + 1?\n\nFor example, suppose m=24. Let's imagine that for n=100, count_zeros is 24. For n=101, count_zeros is 25. Then, the first occurrence of m+1=25 is 101. So the numbers are from 100 to 100 (only 1 number). So why would this happen?\n\nHow can count_zeros increase by 1 when n increases by 1?\n\nOnly if the n is a multiple of 5, but not of 25, 125, etc.\n\nFor example, n=5: count_zeros is 1. n=6: same. But when n=10, count_zeros increases by 1. But for n=10, the count_zeros increases by 2? No:\n\ncount_zeros(9) is 1. count_zeros(10) is 2. So increases by 1. So for m=1, the first occurrence of m+1=2 is 10. So numbers from 5 to 9 (5 numbers).\n\nBut what if there's a case where for some n, count_zeros increases by more than 1?\n\nLike when n is 25. count_zeros(24) is 4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So increases by 2. So for m=5, there is no solution. But for m=4, the first occurrence is 20, and first occurrence of m+1=5 is 25. So numbers from 20-24: 5 numbers.\n\nSo in that case, the count_zeros increases by 2, but the numbers between the first occurrence of m and first occurrence of m+1 is 5 numbers.\n\nSo in all cases where there is a solution, the number of solutions is 5. But why?\n\nBecause the first occurrence of m is at n_low, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_high. The difference between n_high and n_low is 5. So the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 is 5 numbers.\n\nBut why is the difference between n_high and n_low always 5?\n\nNot necessarily. For example, let's imagine a case where m=2, and the first occurrence of m is at 10, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at 15. Then the numbers are 10-14, which is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the first occurrence of m+1 is at 11?\n\nHow can that happen?\n\nOnly if for n=10, count_zeros is 2. For n=11, count_zeros is 3. Which would mean that the count_zeros increased by 1 when n increases by 1. Which would",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are determined and efficiently finding the valid range of `n` values using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: We use binary search to find the smallest number `n` such that the count of trailing zeros is at least `m`. This helps in determining the lower bound of valid `n` values.\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: Once the lower bound is found, we check if it indeed results in exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, there are no valid `n` values. Otherwise, we find the upper bound by checking the next possible count of trailing zeros (`m+1`) and determine the range of valid `n` values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target  # Upper bound for binary search\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    \n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = n_high - n_low\n        if k == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            print(k)\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by summing up the integer divisions of `n` by increasing powers of 5.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least the target value. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the possible range of `n`.\n3. **Main Function**: Reads the input value `m`, determines the valid range of `n` values using the helper functions, and prints the results. If no valid `n` values are found, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the count followed by the valid `n` values in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of `n` values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
