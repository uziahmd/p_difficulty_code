Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. Let me think about the requirements.\n\nThe problem says that the paper forms an X if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, different from the diagonals.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if all the elements on both diagonals are the same. But wait, the two diagonals might have different letters? No, the first condition says that both diagonals have the same letters. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is also all 'x', that's okay. But if one is 'x' and the other is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nWait, no. The first condition says that on both diagonals all letters are the same. So each diagonal must have all same letters, but the two diagonals can have same or different letters? Wait no, the problem says that the letters on the diagonals are same. Wait the problem says:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nWait, so the first part says that each diagonal has all same letters. But the two diagonals could be same or different? Or do they have to be the same as each other?\n\nWait the wording is ambiguous. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter X if: on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nAh, so the first condition is that both diagonals have all letters same. But the two diagonals can have different letters? Or does the first condition imply that both diagonals have the same letter?\n\nNo, the wording says that on both diagonals, all letters are same. So each diagonal must have all same letters. However, the two diagonals can have different letters. But then the second condition says that all other squares have the same letter, different from the letters on the diagonals. Wait, but if the two diagonals have different letters, then what's the 'letters on the diagonals'? Because the other squares must be different from the letters on the diagonals. But if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be different from both? That's impossible unless the two diagonals have the same letter.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that both diagonals have the same letter. Because otherwise, the second condition says that the other squares must be different from the letters on the diagonals. But if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. But then, how can that be possible? For example, suppose the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b'. Then the other squares must be a letter that is not 'a' and not 'b'. But that's possible. However, the problem's example may clarify.\n\nBut looking at the sample input. Let's check the first example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nThe output is NO. Let's think why. Let's check the diagonals. For a 5x5 matrix, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The anti-diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nLooking at the first input:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → main diagonal (0,0) is x. Anti-diagonal (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x. (1,3) is x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x. (2,2) is also part of anti-diagonal. So for the main diagonal, all positions are x? Let's check:\n\nRow 0: (0,0) is x. Row 1: (1,1) is x. Row 2: (2,2) is x. Row 3: (3,3) is x. Row 4: (4,4) is x. So main diagonal is all x. The anti-diagonal: (0,4) is x, (1,3) is x, (2,2) is x, (3,1) is x, (4,0) is x. So both diagonals are all x. Then the other squares must be same and different from x. But in the sample input, the third row is 's o x o o'. So (2,0) is s. Which is not x. But then, the other squares must all be same. So in this case, the other squares have different letters. So the answer is NO. So the first condition is that the diagonals are same (which they are here), but the other squares are not same. Hence, the output is NO.\n\nSo the first step is to check that both diagonals are all same letters. But the two diagonals can have same or different letters? Let's think about the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2:\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\nRow 1: s w s\nRow 2: w s w\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w → all same. Anti-diagonal: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w. So both diagonals are all w. Then the other squares are the ones not on the diagonals. Let's see:\n\nFor 3x3 matrix, the non-diagonal elements are:\n\nRow 0: (0,1) → s.\n\nRow 1: (1,0) and (1,2) → s and s.\n\nRow 2: (2,1) → s.\n\nSo all non-diagonal elements are s. Which is same and different from the diagonals (w). So output is YES.\n\nSo in this case, the diagonals are same (all w) and the other squares are same (s). So the answer is YES.\n\nNow, what if the two diagonals have different letters? For example, suppose that the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b'. Then, the other squares must be same and different from both a and b. But that's possible. For example, if all other squares are 'c'.\n\nBut according to the problem's description, the first condition is that both diagonals have all same letters. So the two diagonals can be different. But then, the other squares must be same and different from the letters on the diagonals. But that would require that the other squares are different from both letters. However, the problem's second condition says that the other squares are same and different from the letters on the diagonals. But if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. So, for example, if the diagonals are 'a' and 'b', then the other squares must be a letter that is not a or b. But in that case, the code needs to check that all non-diagonal elements are same and not equal to either of the two diagonal letters.\n\nBut how do we handle that? Because the problem's description says that the other squares must be same and different from the letters on the diagonals. So, if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares must be same and different from both. However, that's possible.\n\nBut then, how to check that? For example, the code would need to collect all the letters on the diagonals. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nAh! So the letters on the diagonals can be same or different. But the other squares must be same and different from the letters on the diagonals. So, if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares must be a letter different from both. But that's possible. However, in that case, the other squares must be same as each other and different from both diagonal letters.\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem's intention is that the diagonals have the same letter. Because otherwise, the other squares must be different from both letters, which may be possible. However, in the problem's sample input 2, the two diagonals are same. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says that the letters on the diagonals are same. Wait, no. The problem says that the letters on both diagonals are same. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\".\n\nSo, each diagonal must have all same letters. But the two diagonals can have different letters. For example, main diagonal is all 'a' and anti-diagonal is all 'b'.\n\nBut then, the other squares must be same and different from the letters on the diagonals. But that would mean that the other squares must be different from both 'a' and 'b'.\n\nSo, for example, if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares must be same and not equal to either of the two letters.\n\nSo, the code must check:\n\n1. All elements on the main diagonal are same. Let's call this value d1.\n\n2. All elements on the anti-diagonal are same. Let's call this value d2.\n\n3. All elements not on either diagonal are same. Let's call this value o.\n\n4. o must be different from d1 and d2.\n\nBut in that case, how do we check that?\n\nBut then, what if d1 and d2 are same? For example, if d1 = d2 = 'a', then o must be different from 'a'.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCheck that all elements on the main diagonal are same.\n\nCheck that all elements on the anti-diagonal are same.\n\nCheck that all elements not on any diagonal are same.\n\nCheck that the non-diagonal elements are different from both d1 and d2.\n\nBut how to collect d1 and d2?\n\nWait, but for the first two steps, the main diagonal must be all same, and the anti-diagonal must be all same. However, d1 and d2 can be same or different.\n\nSo, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'a', then the non-diagonal elements must be same and not equal to 'a'.\n\nIf the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b', then the non-diagonal elements must be same and not equal to 'a' or 'b'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFirst, collect all the positions on the main diagonal and check they are all same. Let's collect the main diagonal's character (d1).\n\nThen collect all positions on the anti-diagonal and check they are all same. Let's collect the anti-diagonal's character (d2).\n\nThen, collect all the other positions and check they are all same (call this o), and that o is not equal to d1 and not equal to d2.\n\nBut how to collect these positions?\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nIt is on the main diagonal if i == j.\n\nIt is on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n-1.\n\nSo, for each cell, check if it is on either of the diagonals. If not, then it's part of the other squares.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nCheck for all cells on main diagonal: same character.\n\nCheck for all cells on anti-diagonal: same character.\n\nCheck for all other cells: same character, and different from d1 and d2.\n\nBut how to collect d1 and d2?\n\nFirst, check the main diagonal. Let's get the first element of the main diagonal, then check that all others are same.\n\nSimilarly for the anti-diagonal.\n\nBut what if the main diagonal is not all same? Then return NO.\n\nSame for anti-diagonal.\n\nOnce we have d1 and d2, then check the other cells.\n\nBut for the other cells, they must all be same and different from both d1 and d2.\n\nSo, for example, if d1 is 'a' and d2 is 'b', then the other cells must be same and not equal to 'a' or 'b'.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead the grid.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0], then invalid.\n\nSimilarly for anti-diagonal:\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if grid[i][n-1 -i] != grid[0][n-1 -0], then invalid.\n\nOnce that is done, collect the other cells. Let's collect all the characters not on the diagonals.\n\nCheck that all those characters are same, and that this character is not equal to d1 and not equal to d2.\n\nBut how to collect the other cells?\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1 → part of diagonals. Else, part of others.\n\nSo, for the others:\n\ncollect all their characters. Check that all are same. Then check that this character is not equal to d1 and not equal to d2.\n\nBut what if d1 and d2 are same? For example, d1 = d2 = 'a'. Then the other cells must be same and not equal to 'a'.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line as a string. So, grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)].\n\nThen, check main diagonal.\n\nd1_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n   if grid[i][i] != d1_char:\n\n       invalid → print NO.\n\nSimilarly for anti-diagonal:\n\nd2_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n   if grid[i][n-1 -i] != d2_char:\n\n       invalid → print NO.\n\nOnce that is done, collect all the other characters.\n\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   for j in range(n):\n\n       if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n           continue\n\n       else:\n\n           other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check that all elements in other_chars are same. Also, check that this character is different from d1_char and d2_char.\n\nBut how to check all elements in other_chars are same. If other_chars is empty, then that's okay? Well, when n is 3, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but overlapping at the center. So for n=3, the number of elements on the diagonals is 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. The total elements is 9. So other elements is 4. For n=5, the diagonals have 5 + 5 -1 = 9 elements. Total elements is 25. Other elements is 16.\n\nBut for n=1, but n is at least 3. So, other_chars will have elements.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3, and for n=3, other_chars is 4 elements. So no.\n\nSo, for other_chars, check that all are same. Let's take the first element (if there are any) and check that all others are same.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? Well, that's impossible because n is odd and >=3. For example, n=3, the diagonals have 3+3-1=5 elements, and the rest is 4. So other_chars is not empty.\n\nSo, if other_chars is empty, then it's impossible, but the code can handle it. But for the problem constraints, n is >=3 and odd, so other_chars is not empty.\n\nSo, for the other_chars:\n\nif len(other_chars) == 0 → but that's impossible.\n\nElse:\n\no_char = other_chars[0]\n\nfor c in other_chars[1:]:\n\n   if c != o_char → invalid.\n\nThen check that o_char != d1_char and o_char != d2_char.\n\nIf all that is true, then output YES. Else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what if d1_char and d2_char are same? For example, both are 'a'. Then the other chars must be different from 'a'.\n\nSo, the code needs to check that o_char is not equal to d1_char and also not equal to d2_char. But if d1_char and d2_char are same, then checking that o_char is not equal to d1_char is sufficient.\n\nSo, the code can proceed with that.\n\nSo, putting all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck main diagonal.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal.\n\nCollect other chars.\n\nCheck other chars are same.\n\nCheck o_char is not equal to d1 and not equal to d2.\n\nIf all steps pass, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5, grid:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\npositions (0,0) is x, (1,1) is x, (2,2) is x, (3,3) is x, (4,4) is x → all same. So d1_char is x.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal: positions (0,4) is x, (1,3) is x, (2,2) is x, (3,1) is x, (4,0) is x → all same. d2_char is x.\n\nNow, other_chars: all cells not on diagonals. Let's look at row 2, column 0: 's' (since row 2 is 'soxoo'). So (2,0) is 's', which is not on the diagonals. So other_chars includes 's', which is not same as x. So when checking other_chars, the code will find that not all are same. Thus, output is NO. Which matches the first sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) = 'w', (1,1) = 'w', (2,2) = 'w' → d1_char = 'w'.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2) = 'w', (1,1) = 'w', (2,0) = 'w' → d2_char = 'w'.\n\nOther_chars are the positions not on diagonals. For 3x3:\n\ncells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Their values are 's', 's', 's', 's'. So all same. o_char is 's', which is different from d1 and d2 (both 'w'). So output is YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\n(0,0) = x, (1,1) = x, (2,2) = e → not same. So during the check for main diagonal, the code will find that (2,2) is e != x. So the code returns NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, a → not same. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case where diagonals are different.\n\nn=3:\n\naab\n\nbaa\n\naaa\n\nMain diagonal: a (0,0), a (1,1), a (2,2) → d1_char is a.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2) is b, (1,1) is a, (2,0) is a. So anti-diagonal has elements b, a, a. So during the check, the code will compare (1,1) (a) with d2_char (b). So during the check for anti-diagonal, the code will find that (1,1) is a != b. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: suppose diagonals are different, but other cells are same and different from both.\n\nn=3:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naab\n\nMain diagonal: a (0,0), a (1,1), b (2,2). So main diagonal is not same. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: main diagonal is all 'a', anti-diagonal is all 'b', other cells are all 'c'.\n\nn=3:\n\na c a\n\nc b c\n\na c a\n\nWait, for n=3, the main diagonal is (0,0) = a, (1,1) = b, (2,2) = a. So main diagonal is not same. So invalid. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where main and anti-diagonal are same, but other cells are same as them.\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nMain diagonal is all a. Anti-diagonal is all a. Other cells are a. Then o_char is a. Which is same as d1 and d2. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the code checks that o_char is different from both d1 and d2.\n\nAnother case where d1 and d2 are different, and o is same and different from both.\n\nn=3:\n\naab\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\nMain diagonal: a (0,0), b (1,1), a (2,2). So main diagonal is not same. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother example where main diagonal is all 'a', anti-diagonal all 'b', and other cells are all 'c'.\n\nLet's construct such a grid.\n\nn=3:\n\na c a\n\nc b c\n\na c a\n\nWait, for the main diagonal: positions (0,0) = a, (1,1) = b, (2,2) = a. So main diagonal is not same. So code returns NO. Not valid.\n\nTo have main diagonal all same, and anti-diagonal all same.\n\nLet me think of a 3x3 grid where main diagonal is all 'a', anti-diagonal all 'b', and other cells are 'c'.\n\nBut for that, the center cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. So for the main diagonal, it must be 'a', and for the anti-diagonal, it must be 'b'. Which is impossible. So the center cell must be same for both diagonals. Therefore, the two diagonals must have same character in the center. Therefore, the two diagonals must have same character. Because the center cell is part of both.\n\nAh! Oh right! Because in a square with odd n, the two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So, for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal to have all same letters, the center cell must be same for both. Therefore, d1_char and d2_char must be same. Because the center cell is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is (1,1). It is part of both diagonals. So, for the main diagonal to be all same, the center cell must be same as the other elements of the main diagonal. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. Therefore, the center cell must be same for both. So d1_char and d2_char must be same. Therefore, in the code, after checking that the main diagonal is all same and the anti-diagonal is all same, d1_char and d2_char must be same. Because the center cell is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo, for example, in the code, during the check for main diagonal and anti-diagonal, the center cell is checked for both. So, in the main diagonal check, the center cell is same as d1_char. In the anti-diagonal check, the center cell is same as d2_char. So, d1_char must equal d2_char.\n\nTherefore, in the code, after checking that both diagonals are same, d1_char and d2_char must be same. Therefore, the code can check that d1_char == d2_char. But wait, how?\n\nBecause for the center cell, it's part of both diagonals. So during the main diagonal check, the code ensures that all elements of the main diagonal are same. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. Therefore, the center cell is same as the main diagonal's character (d1_char) and same as the anti-diagonal's character (d2_char). So d1_char must equal d2_char.\n\nSo, in code, after checking that the main and anti-diagonals are all same, d1_char and d2_char must be same. Therefore, the code can proceed to check that the other cells are same and different from d1_char (since d1_char equals d2_char).\n\nThis is an important point. Because if the code allows d1 and d2 to be different, but in reality they can't be, then the code can be simplified.\n\nSo, for example, during the code's processing, after checking that the main and anti-diagonals are all same, the d1_char and d2_char must be same. Because the center cell is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo, in code, after checking the main and anti-diagonal, d1_char and d2_char must be same. Therefore, the code can proceed to check that the other cells are same and different from d1_char (since d1_char == d2_char).\n\nSo, in the code, after checking the main and anti-diagonal, we can check if d1_char == d2_char. But since the center cell is part of both, this must be true.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose that the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b'. But the center cell is part of both. So, the main diagonal's center cell is 'a', and the anti-diagonal's center cell is 'b'. Which would imply that 'a' == 'b', which is impossible. Therefore, the code's checks for the main and anti-diagonal will ensure that d1_char and d2_char are same.\n\nSo, during the code's processing, once the code has passed the main and anti-diagonal checks, then d1_char and d2_char must be same.\n\nThus, in code, after checking the main and anti-diagonal, we can proceed to check that the other cells are same and different from d1_char (since d1_char == d2_char).\n\nSo, in code, after checking the main and anti-diagonal, we can just check that the other cells are same and not equal to d1_char.\n\nThis is a crucial point. Because if the code proceeds to check that the other cells are different from both d1 and d2, but in reality d1 and d2 are same, then checking that the other cells are different from d1 is sufficient.\n\nSo, this simplifies the code.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nCheck that main diagonal is all same (d1_char).\n\nCheck that anti-diagonal is all same (d2_char).\n\nCheck that d1_char == d2_char. Because the center cell is part of both.\n\nWait, but the code doesn't need to check that. Because during the check for the main and anti-diagonal, the center cell is already checked. For example, during the main diagonal check, the code checks that the center cell is same as d1_char. During the anti-diagonal check, the code checks that the center cell is same as d2_char. Therefore, d1_char must equal d2_char.\n\nSo, in code, after passing the checks for the diagonals, d1_char and d2_char are same.\n\nSo, the code can proceed to check that the other cells are same and different from d1_char.\n\nThus, the code can be modified as:\n\nOnce the main and anti-diagonal checks are passed, then the other cells must be same and not equal to d1_char (since d1_char == d2_char).\n\nSo, the code can proceed to collect the other cells, check that they are all same, and that they are not equal to d1_char.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce the main and anti-diagonal checks are passed, then:\n\nd1_char is the main diagonal's character.\n\nCheck that all other cells are same and not equal to d1_char.\n\nSo, this simplifies the code.\n\nSo, in the code, after checking the diagonals, the code can proceed to collect other cells, check that they are all same and not equal to d1_char.\n\nThis is a key insight that can simplify the code.\n\nLet me test this with the previous examples.\n\nIn sample input 2, the d1_char is 'w', and the other cells are 's' which is different. So code returns yes.\n\nAnother example where the main diagonal is 'a', anti-diagonal is 'a', and other cells are 'b' → yes.\n\nAnother example where main diagonal is 'a', anti-diagonal is 'a', and other cells are 'a' → no, since they are same as the diagonals.\n\nSo, in code, after checking the diagonals, the code can proceed to check the other cells.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nd1_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n   if grid[i][i] != d1_char → invalid.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal:\n\nd2_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n   if grid[i][n-1 -i] != d2_char → invalid.\n\nNow, since the center cell is part of both diagonals, d1_char must equal d2_char. So, after passing the above checks, d1_char and d2_char are same. So, we can proceed.\n\nNow, collect other cells.\n\nCheck that all other cells are same and not equal to d1_char.\n\nSo, code:\n\nother_chars = list()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   for j in range(n):\n\n       if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n           continue\n\n       else:\n\n           other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(other_chars) == 0:\n\n   # impossible for n >=3\n\nelse:\n\n   o_char = other_chars[0]\n\n   for c in other_chars[1:]:\n\n       if c != o_char:\n\n           print(\"NO\")\n\n           exit()\n\n   if o_char == d1_char:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n   else:\n\n       print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the other_chars is empty? For n=3, the number of other cells is 4. So, no.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's think of a case where the diagonals are same, but other cells are not same. Like the first sample input. Which is handled correctly.\n\nAnother case where the other cells are same as the diagonals. For example, n=3, all cells are 'a'. Then, the code would check that other cells are 'a' which is same as d1_char. So returns NO.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as a list of strings, but in the sample input, the first line is the n, then n lines follow.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n small letters.\n\nSo, the code should read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably for the example. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut that's probably the input for multiple test cases. However, in the actual programming problem, the code must read from stdin. So, the code must read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases, but in practice, the code must process one test case per run.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo, the code must read n, then read n lines. The output is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases, but in the problem statement, it's likely that the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows that the code is given multiple test cases. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases in the input. However, the actual problem says that the code should read from stdin. So, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, the input is one test case. The sample input shows three test cases, but that's probably for the purpose of the example. So, the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input and output are given as lists, but in reality, the code should process one test case.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that the code is given multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo, the code must process one test case. The sample input shows multiple test cases, but that's probably for the purpose of the example. For example, the first sample input is a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three answers. However, in practice, the code must read one test case per run.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input and output are given in a way that suggests that the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n, followed by n lines. So, the code must process one test case.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user is to provide multiple test cases, but in reality, the code must process a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of three test cases. However, in practice, the code is supposed to process a single test case. So, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user is to input multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one.\n\nBut that's unclear. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is a list of three test cases. However, in the actual programming competition problem, the input is given as one test case. For example, the first test case is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich outputs NO.\n\nThe second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nWhich outputs YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nOutput is NO.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. So, the code should read n, then read n lines.\n\nThus, the code must process one test case.\n\nSo, the code is supposed to read n from stdin, then read n lines, each line being a string of n letters.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as discussed.\n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen check main diagonal.\n\nd1_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n   if grid[i][i] != d1_char:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n       exit()\n\nCheck anti-diagonal:\n\nd2_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n   if grid[i][n-1 -i] != d2_char:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n       exit()\n\nNow, collect other cells.\n\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   for j in range(n):\n\n       if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n           continue\n\n       other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not other_chars:\n\n   print(\"NO\")\n\n   exit()\n\no_char = other_chars[0]\n\nfor c in other_chars[1:]:\n\n   if c != o_char:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n       exit()\n\nif o_char == d1_char:\n\n   print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n   print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, in the code, after checking the main and anti-diagonal, the code assumes that d1_char == d2_char. But what if the code passes the main and anti-diagonal checks, but d",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions.

Any inconsistency results in an immediate \"NO\".\n4. **Non-Diagonal Elements Check**: After verifying the diagonals, all non-diagonal elements are collected. These elements must be the same and different from the diagonal elements. If they are not consistent or match the diagonal elements, the answer is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all conditions for forming the letter \"X\" are checked efficiently and correctly.",
