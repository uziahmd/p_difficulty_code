Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for the diagonals. The main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. The other diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, the non-diagonal elements must all be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'n'.\n3. Ensure that 'd' != 'n'.\n\nBut how to check the diagonals?\n\nFor a grid of size n x n, where n is odd. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1. Because indices start at 0, right? Like for n=5, the positions (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0) are on the second diagonal.\n\nSo for each cell in the grid, check if it is on either of the two diagonals. Collect all the characters on the diagonals and check they are all the same. Then collect all the other characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal.\n   - If yes, add to diagonal_chars set.\n   - Else, add to other_chars set.\n- Then check:\n   - len(diagonal_chars) == 1 (all same)\n   - len(other_chars) == 1 (all same)\n   - and the two sets are different.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the other_chars is empty? Well, since n is at least 3, and odd. For example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but overlapping at the center. So total diagonal elements are 2n-1. For n=3, 5 elements. The total cells is 9, so other cells are 4. So for n=3, other_chars will have 4 elements. So in general, for n >=3, the other_chars will have (n^2 - (2n-1)) elements. Which for n=3 is 9-5=4, which is correct. So for the other_chars, we can check if they are all same.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal characters and other characters.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n. Let's store them as a grid, maybe a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nother_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(other_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != other_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal elements. For example, n=3, the center is part of both diagonals. But the other cells are around.\n\nWait, for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 elements (since the center is counted once). So the other elements are 9-5=4. So other_chars will have those 4 elements.\n\nSo the code above would work.\n\nBut let's test some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nCheck the diagonals. For each cell (i,j):\n\nMain diagonal (i==j):\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(1,1) x\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,3) x\n\n(4,4) x\n\nOther diagonal (i + j = 4):\n\n(0,4) x\n\n(1,3) x\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,1) x\n\n(4,0) x\n\nSo all diagonal elements are x. So diagonal_chars is {'x'}.\n\nNow the other elements. For example, cell (0,1) is o. Cell (0,2) is o. Cell (0,3) is o. Then row 1, cell (0,1) is o, etc. But looking at row 2, cell (0,2) is s? Wait, row 2 is 'soxoo' — so row 2 is s o x o o. So cell (2,0) is s. Which is not on any diagonal. Because for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2, which is not equal to 4 (n-1 is 5-1=4). So cell (2,0) is not on any diagonal. So that's part of other_chars. So in this case, other_chars includes s, o, etc. So the other_chars would have multiple values. So the first sample input would output NO, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) w; (1,1) w; (2,2) w. Other diagonal: (0,2) w; (1,1) w; (2,0) w. So all diagonals are w. The other elements are:\n\nLooking at (0,1): s. (1,0): s. (1,2): s. (2,1): s. So other_chars is {'s'}, which is different from 'w'. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) x; (1,1) x; (2,2) e. So diagonal_chars is {x, e} — so len is 2. So condition fails. So output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about if the other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to read the input?\n\nThe input is given as first line n, then n lines of strings.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is presented as a list of inputs. For example, the first input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nWait, but in actual input, each test case is given as separate input. However, the problem says that the input is read from stdin. But in the example, the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, no. Wait, the problem's sample input shows that the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo each test case is a single n followed by n lines. So the sample input given in the problem is perhaps multiple test cases. But in the sample input, the first entry is ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'] — but that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. But in reality, the program needs to read from stdin. So how does the input work?\n\nWait, the problem's sample input and output are given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut in reality, the input is given as multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases. But the way it's written here is that the input is a list of strings, each representing a separate test case. However, in practice, when the code is run, the input is read from standard input, which for programming competition problems is typically one test case per run. But the sample shows that the code should process multiple test cases. Wait, no, the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n ... Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo the program is supposed to read one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. However, the sample output shows three outputs. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. Wait, but in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. Which implies that the code should process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. That's confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again. The sample input is given as a list of inputs, but perhaps that's a mistake. Let me check the original problem statement.\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nOutput:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut perhaps that's a way to show that there are three test cases. However, the problem's input format says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is multiple test cases. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, but the problem's input description doesn't mention that. However, the sample input shows that the first line is not the number of test cases. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '5', then the next 5 lines are the grid. Then comes '3', then 3 lines, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each starting with n followed by n lines.\n\nBut how to know? The problem says that the input is for Valera's paper. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple. However, looking at the sample output, which has three entries, that suggests that the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is conflicting. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. That's confusing. But perhaps the sample input is written as a list of input strings, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case. But then why does the sample output have three entries?\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of input strings, but in reality, each input is a separate test case. So the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut the problem's input description does not mention that there are multiple test cases. This is a contradiction. However, looking at the sample input and output, it's clear that the code must process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has three test cases, and the output has three answers.\n\nBut how is this possible? How can the code read multiple test cases?\n\nThis is a critical point. If the code is supposed to process a single test case, then the sample input would be incorrect. However, given that the sample shows multiple test cases, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention this. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is multiple test cases. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, but the problem statement does not mention that. However, the sample input does not have such a line. For example, the sample input is:\n\nThe first input is 5, then 5 lines, then 3, then 3 lines, then 3, then 3 lines. So the code must process multiple test cases, each starting with n followed by n lines.\n\nBut how to know when to stop reading? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, and the code must read until EOF.\n\nBut how can we know? Let's look at the sample input and output again. The sample input is given as a list of three inputs, each being a separate test case. The output is a list of three outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention this. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original statement, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains integer n ... Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo this suggests that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of input strings, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample input is written as a list for illustration. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, but the code should read one test case. However, that would not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is wrong. However, given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, and the output has multiple answers, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into test cases. For example, each test case starts with an n, then n lines. So the code can process until there's no more input.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nIn programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, and the code must read until EOF. For example, for each test case, read n, then read n lines. Repeat until there's no more input.\n\nBut the problem's input description does not mention this. However, given the sample input and output, that's the only way to explain it.\n\nSo, the code needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of n followed by n lines.\n\nBut then, the code must read all test cases. For example, the sample input is three test cases.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, and process each test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nIn Python, the standard way is to read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process accordingly. However, for this problem, the code can read lines until there's no more input.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, in the code, we can read lines until EOF.\n\nBut for each test case, the first line is n, then n lines follow.\n\nSo, the code can read all lines first, then process them.\n\nBut perhaps the code can read input as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. Then process them as follows: while there are lines left, take the first line as n, then take next n lines as the grid, then process, and repeat.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the lines would be:\n\nLine 1: 5\n\nLine 2: xooox\n\nLine 3: oxoxo\n\nLine 4: soxoo\n\nLine 5: oxoxo\n\nLine 6: xooox\n\nLine 7: 3\n\nLine 8: wsw\n\nLine 9: sws\n\nLine 10: wsw\n\nLine 11: 3\n\nLine 12: xpx\n\nLine 13: pxp\n\nLine 14: xpe\n\nSo the code would process first n=5, then 5 lines, then n=3, then 3 lines, then n=3, then 3 lines.\n\nThus, the code needs to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description didn't mention this. However, given the sample input and output, this must be the case.\n\nSo, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all input lines.\n\nProcess them as per test cases.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, process the lines as per test cases.\n\nBut how to process them? Let's have a pointer i starting at 0.\n\nWhile i < len(lines):\n\n   Read n = int(lines[i])\n\n   i += 1\n\n   grid = []\n\n   for _ in range(n):\n\n       grid.append(lines[i])\n\n       i += 1\n\n   process grid and output YES/NO.\n\nSo, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original description may have been ambiguous, but given the sample input and output, this is the way to proceed.\n\nSo now, the code structure is clear.\n\nNow, the code for checking the grid.\n\nFor each grid, check:\n\nCollect all characters on diagonals and others.\n\nBut in code, for each cell (i,j), check if it is on the diagonal.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef is_x(grid, n):\n\n    diagonal_chars = set()\n\n    other_chars = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n                diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n            else:\n\n                other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n    # Check conditions\n\n    if len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(other_chars) == 1:\n\n        d = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n        o = other_chars.pop()\n\n        if d != o:\n\n            return \"YES\"\n\n    return \"NO\"\n\nWait, but what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, it's not possible. For example, n=3, the diagonals have 5 elements (since 3*2-1=5?), no. For n=3, the number of elements on the diagonals is 2n -1? For n=3, 2*3-1=5. Which is correct. The total cells is 9, so other cells is 9-5=4. So other_chars will have 4 elements. So for n >=3, other_chars is not empty.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nBut what if the grid has all elements on diagonals same, and other elements same but same as diagonals? Then the code returns NO.\n\nSo the code checks that the two sets are different.\n\nSo, the code for each test case would be:\n\nRead grid as list of strings.\n\nThen perform the check.\n\nBut in code, the grid is a list of strings, each of length n.\n\nSo, for example, grid[i][j] is the character at row i, column j.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut need to process multiple test cases.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSample code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n\n            ptr += 1\n\n        # process grid\n\n        diag = set()\n\n        other = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n                    diag.add(grid[i][j])\n\n                else:\n\n                    other.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        if len(diag) == 1 and len(other) == 1:\n\n            d = diag.pop()\n\n            o = other.pop()\n\n            if d != o:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n            else:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the diag is empty? No, since n >=3, and for each grid, the diagonals have elements.\n\nBut for n=3, the diagonals have 5 elements. So the diag set will have at least one element.\n\nSo, this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=5, grid:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nProcessing:\n\ndiag is all the elements on diagonals. For example, in row 0, columns 0 and 4 are x. Row 1, columns 1 and 3 are x. Row 2, column 2 is x. So all are x. So diag is {'x'}, other includes the 's' in (2,0), etc. So other has multiple elements. So len(diag) is 1, len(other) is 1? No, because other has multiple elements. For example, in row 0, the elements are x o o o x. The non-diagonal elements are o, o, o. Then row 1: o x o x o → non-diagonal elements are o, o. Row 2: s o x o o → non-diagonal elements are s, o, o. Row 3: o x o x o → non-diagonal elements are o, o. Row 4: x o o o x → non-diagonal elements are o, o, o. So other_chars would include o, s. So len(other) is 2. So the code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w.\n\n(1,1) w.\n\n(2,0) w, (2,2) w.\n\nSo all diagonals are w. The other elements are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So other is {'s'}, which is different from w. So output YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) x, (0,2) x. (1,1) x. (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the diag set is {x, e}, len is 2. So code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: All elements are same. For example, n=3, all 'a's. Then diagonals are 'a's, others are 'a's. So the code returns NO because the other set is same as diag.\n\nCase 2: n=3, diagonals are 'a's, others are 'b's. Then returns YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a's, others are 'a's and 'b's. So other set has len>1. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=5, diagonals have all 'a's, others have all 'b's. So returns YES.\n\nWhat about if the diagonals have two different letters? Like, for n=3, the main diagonal has 'a's and the other diagonal has 'b's. Then diag set is {a, b} → len 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo the code handles all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the code reads the lines. However, when reading from stdin, sometimes there are leading/trailing spaces. But the problem says that each line contains n letters. So the code uses line.strip() to remove any leading/trailing whitespace. However, in the problem statement, it says that each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the input lines should have exactly n letters. So using strip() is safe.\n\nBut what if a line has leading or trailing spaces? Probably, the problem says that the input is correct, so the code can assume that each line is exactly n letters. However, using strip() may cause problems if the input has leading or trailing spaces. But according to the problem statement, each line contains n letters. So perhaps the code should read the line as is, but in practice, the code can use line.strip().\n\nBut perhaps the code should read each line as exactly as given, but in programming competition problems, the input is usually given with exactly the required characters, and no leading/trailing spaces. So the code can use line.strip().\n\nBut in the code above, the lines are read as [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]. Wait, the code is written as:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nBut this would filter out any empty lines. However, in the input, after reading n, the next n lines are the grid. So for example, if there are empty lines in between, but the problem says that the input is correct. So the code should read the lines properly.\n\nBut perhaps the code should read all lines, stripping whitespace, but including empty lines. However, the code uses 'if line.strip()' which would exclude empty lines. That could be a problem if the input has empty lines. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so the code can assume that each line after the first is non-empty.\n\nBut perhaps the code should read all lines, stripping whitespace, but not filtering out empty lines. For example, if a line is empty, but the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n letters. So the code can safely process the lines.\n\nBut in the code, the lines list is built with line.strip() for each line in sys.stdin. However, if a line is empty (e.g., a blank line between test cases), the line.strip() would be an empty string, and the 'if line.strip()' would filter it out. But this could cause issues if the input has blank lines. However, in programming competition problems, such cases are not present. So the code is safe.\n\nBut perhaps the code should not filter out empty lines. Let me think.\n\nThe code is:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThis creates a list of stripped lines, but only including those lines that are non-empty after stripping. So, for example, if there are empty lines in the input, they are skipped. However, in the problem's input, there are no empty lines. So the code should be okay.\n\nBut for example, if a test case's grid has a line that is empty (which is not possible according to the problem statement), but the code would process it as an empty string, leading to errors. But the problem says that each line has exactly n letters, so this should not happen.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nThe code is written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n\n            ptr += 1\n\n        diag = set()\n\n        other = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n                    diag.add(grid[i][j])\n\n                else:\n\n                    other.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        if len(diag) == 1 and len(other) == 1:\n\n            d = diag.pop()\n\n            o = other.pop()\n\n            if d != o:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n            else:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut in Python, the code must be written with proper indentation and syntax.\n\nNow, testing this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nAssuming that the input is given as:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe code would read lines as:\n\nlines = ['5', 'xooox', 'oxoxo', 'soxoo', 'oxoxo', 'xooox', '3', 'wsw', 'sws', 'wsw', '3', 'xpx', 'pxp', 'xpe']\n\nProcessing first test case:\n\nn=5, grid is the next 5 lines. Then process, returns NO.\n\nThen ptr is at 6. Next line is '3', process that, returns YES. Then ptr is at 10, next line is '3', process returns NO.\n\nSo the output is NO, YES, NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code must be written with proper syntax.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut in Python, the main function must be called. So the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n\n            ptr += 1\n\n        diag = set()\n\n        other = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n                    diag.add(grid[i][j])\n\n                else:\n\n                    other.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        if len(diag) == 1 and len(other) == 1:\n\n            d = diag.pop()\n\n            o = other.pop()\n\n            if d != o:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n            else:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut this code may have an error when there are multiple test cases. For example, when the input is read correctly.\n\nBut I think this should work.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', others are 'b' → YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a's and others are 'a's → output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals have 'a' and 'a' and 'b' (so diag set has two elements) → output NO.\n\nSo the code handles these.\n\nNow, what about if other is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: For each grid, identify characters on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Identify characters that are not on either of the diagonals.\n4. **Validation**: Ensure that all characters on the diagonals are the same, all non-diagonal characters are the same, and the characters on the diagonals are different from the non-diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n            ptr += 1\n        diag = set()\n        other = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    diag.add(grid[i][j])\n                else:\n                    other.add(grid[i][j])\n        if len(diag) == 1 and len(other) == 1:\n            d = diag.pop()\n            o = other.pop()\n            if d != o:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of strings, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This helps in handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n- **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Check**: For each cell in the grid, we check if it lies on either of the two diagonals. Characters on the diagonals are collected into one set, while others are collected into another set.\n- **Validation**: The sets of diagonal and non-diagonal characters are checked for uniformity. If both sets have exactly one unique character and these characters are different, the grid forms an \"X\", otherwise it does not.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions using set operations, which allows us to determine the uniqueness of characters in constant time. The overall complexity is O(n^2) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.",
