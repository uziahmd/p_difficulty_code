After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, first, I need to read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters, each representing the marks. Oh right, each line is a string of digits, like '223' for a student's marks in three subjects.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns in the gradebook), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if in any of the subjects they have the maximum mark for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how to process the data? Let's think about the structure. Let's say we have a 2D array where rows are students and columns are subjects. For each column, find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in a column equals the maximum for that column.\n\nSo first, I need to process the input into a 2D list. For example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe data would be:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nFor each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 0 and 1 have 2)\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 1)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 0)\n\nThen, for each student:\n\nStudent 0 has 2 in subject 0 (which is max), 2 in subject 1 (not max), 3 in subject 2 (max). So he is successful because of subject 0 or 2.\n\nStudent 1 has 2 in subject 0 (max), 3 in subject 1 (max), 2 in subject 2. So he is successful.\n\nStudent 2 has 1 in all subjects, which are not max. So not successful. Hence total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines as a list of strings.\n- Convert each string into a list of integers, so that we have a 2D list.\n- For each column (subject), compute the maximum value.\n- Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in a column equals the max for that column. If yes, count them.\n\nSo, how to compute the max for each column?\n\nLet's think: For each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( [students[i][j] for i in 0..n-1] )\n\nOnce we have that, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any column equals the max for that column.\n\nSo, for each student in the list, iterate through their marks. For each mark in position j, check if it's equal to max_marks[j]. If any of them is, then the student is successful.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string. Then, for each line, convert into a list of integers.\n\nThen, for each column j, compute the max.\n\nOnce we have the max_marks array, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any column equals the max for that column.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, reading input. Let's see. The input can be read via stdin. But the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Wait, the example shows two inputs and outputs. But the actual problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as follows: first line is n and m, then n lines of m characters each.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples, but in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as the first line with n and m, then n lines. So the code needs to read from stdin. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps in the actual programming competition problem, the code is supposed to process a single test case. Wait, the user provided an example with two inputs and outputs, but the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, maybe the user is showing two different test cases. For example, the first input is 3 3 followed by three lines, and the output is 2. The second input is 3 5 followed by three lines, output is 3. So the code should process one test case at a time.\n\nBut in the problem description, the input is for a single test case. So the code needs to read from stdin once. But when writing code for programming competitions, the code must read from stdin once. So in the code, we need to read the input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo for the code, the steps are:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of m digits.\n\nThen process as per the steps above.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read n lines, each line as a string. Then convert each string into a list of integers.\n\nThen compute for each column the maximum value.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nNow, how to compute the max for each column.\n\nLet's think. For example, for the data:\n\nstudents = [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\ncolumns are 0, 1, 2.\n\nmax_marks = [2,3,3]\n\nSo for column 0, max is 2, column 1 max is 3, column 2 max is 3.\n\nSo for each column j, we can compute the max by looking at all the students' j-th element.\n\nIn code:\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        val = students[i][j]\n        if val > max_val:\n            max_val = val\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\nOnce that is done, for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max_marks for that column.\n\nSo for each student in students:\n\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            mark as successful and break.\n\nSo, the count is the number of students who have at least one such occurrence.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly.\n\nIn Python, the first line is read as n and m. Then, the next n lines are read as strings. Each string is converted into a list of integers.\n\nFor example, for the first sample input:\n\nn=3, m=3\n\nThen the lines are '223', '232', '112'.\n\nSo students = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead first line: n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, students = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_marks as discussed.\n\nOnce that is done, loop through each student and check.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if all students have the same marks in all subjects? For example, n=2, m=1, and both students have 5. Then, max_marks is [5]. Both students have 5, so both are successful. So the answer is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=5. All marks are 5. So the student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 9], student 2 has [9, 9]. Then for each subject, max is 9. Both students are successful.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string, then convert into list of integers.\n\nCompute max_marks for each column.\n\nThen count the number of students who have at least one mark equal to the max in their column.\n\nNow, code:\n\nLet me write this step by step.\n\nSample code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = [0]*m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's the code. Let's test against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nstudents is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for columns:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3.\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max 3.\n\nso max_marks is [2,3,3].\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: checks each column.\n\ncolumn 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count increases by 1. Break.\n\nstudent 1: column 0 is 2 == 2 → yes. count increases by 1.\n\nstudent 2: check column 0: 1 < 2. column 1: 1 <3. column 2: 2 <3. no. So not counted. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nstudents:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nso max_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow for each student:\n\nstudent 0:\n\ncheck columns:\n\ncolumn 0: 9 == 9 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 1:\n\ncheck column 2: 8 == 8 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: check columns. column 1: 1 == 1 → yes. count +=1.\n\nso total 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo code works for these samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 and line is 5. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1. Input lines are 5 and 5. Output is 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2. Input lines are 99 and 99. Then max_marks is [9,9]. Both students have 9 in both columns. So each student is successful. So output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about if a student has multiple max marks in different columns? Like, in the first sample, student 0 has max in column 0 and 2. But the code counts him once, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Data Conversion**: Convert the gradebook data into a 2D list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is read to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The subsequent lines are read as strings and converted into lists of integers representing the marks of each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column in the 2D list), we determine the highest mark achieved by any student. This helps in identifying the best students for each subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, we check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful. This is done by iterating through each student's marks and comparing them against the previously determined maximum marks for each subject.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject, leading to an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
