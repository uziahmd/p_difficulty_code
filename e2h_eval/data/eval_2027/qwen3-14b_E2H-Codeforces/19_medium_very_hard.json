The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair of districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm, the key here is that the sum of 2^i is maximized. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute much more. So ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. But we have to ensure that the remaining districts are connected.\n\nSo the strategy would be to keep the largest possible districts (highest numbers) while ensuring they form a connected subtree. But how do we do that?\n\nWait, the problem is similar to selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes, such that the sum of 2^i is maximum. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible nodes, but they must be connected.\n\nBut how to select which nodes to remove? Let's think about it.\n\nThe optimal solution would be to keep the largest (n - k) districts, but only if they form a connected subtree. If they don't, we need to find the largest possible subset of districts that is connected and has size (n - k).\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Because if the highest districts are not connected, we need to include some lower ones to connect them.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to select a subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes, and maximize the sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes kept, which are the ones not removed.\n\nBut how do we find such a subtree?\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to think of this as a problem where we need to choose which nodes to keep. Since the sum depends on the nodes kept, and higher-numbered nodes contribute more, we want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo maybe we can start by considering all nodes from n down to 1. We want to include them if possible, but ensuring that the selected nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but how do we check connectivity? Maybe we can model this as a priority-based selection. Let me think: For each node, we can decide whether to include it or not, but ensuring that the included nodes form a connected component.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a tree where we want to keep the largest possible nodes. So, perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we start with the largest node, and then add the next largest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nBut how do we manage that efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: The problem is equivalent to choosing a subtree of size s = n -k. The sum of 2^i for the nodes in the subtree is maximized. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the optimal subtree would consist of the s largest nodes, provided that they form a connected subtree. If not, we need to include some smaller nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how do we determine which nodes to include?\n\nLet's think of the following approach:\n\nWe can try to select the nodes with the highest numbers, but we need to make sure that they form a connected subtree. To do this, perhaps we can use a priority queue approach, starting with the largest node, and then adding nodes in order of their value, ensuring that they are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: we need to remove k nodes, so the remaining nodes must form a connected subtree. To maximize the sum, we want to keep the nodes with the highest possible values. Therefore, we should try to keep the nodes with the highest numbers, but we need to make sure that they are connected.\n\nBut how to ensure that? For example, if the highest node is n, and the next highest is n-1, but they are not connected directly, then we need to include some nodes that connect them. However, those connecting nodes might have lower values than n-1, which would decrease the total sum. So perhaps the optimal way is to select the largest possible nodes, and then include the necessary ones to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as trying to select a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So, perhaps we can model this as a minimum spanning tree problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where we need to select a connected subset of nodes with size s = n -k. The sum is maximized when the subset contains the s largest nodes possible. However, if these nodes are not connected, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nStart with the set S of the s largest nodes. Then, check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, then that's our answer. If not, we need to find which nodes to include (from the remaining nodes) to connect them, but this seems complicated.\n\nBut how can we check if the s largest nodes are connected?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to keep the nodes with the highest values, and for each node, we need to ensure that it is connected to the rest. But how?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since the tree is connected, the s largest nodes will form a subtree that is connected if they are all connected through some path. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, imagine that node 6 is connected to node 5, which is connected to node 4, etc., but node 6 is not connected to node 3. If s is 3 and the nodes are 6,5,3, then the subtree is not connected. So in that case, we need to include node 4 or 5 to connect them.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal number of nodes to add to connect the s largest nodes?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, given the time constraints, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nLet me think again. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the highest possible nodes, perhaps we can perform a process where we greedily include the nodes with the highest value, and for each step, we check if they can be connected to the current subtree. But how?\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by Krusky's algorithm:\n\nWe can think of the problem as trying to build a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. We can process the nodes in decreasing order of their value. For each node, we check if it's connected to the existing subtree. If it is, we can include it. If not, we need to include it and possibly some other nodes to connect it. But this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a variation of the maximum spanning tree. Since we want to maximize the sum of 2^i, which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of node values. So the problem is similar to finding a subtree with exactly s nodes (s = n -k) that has maximum sum of node values. How can we find such a subtree?\n\nIn a tree, any subtree with s nodes can be considered. But how to find the one with maximum sum.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming, but for n up to 1e6, that's impossible.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the node values are 2^i, which are exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree must contain the s largest nodes. However, if those nodes are not connected, then we have to replace some of them with lower nodes that can connect them. But how to find which ones?\n\nBut perhaps the following approach works:\n\nWe start with the s largest nodes. Then, we need to check if they are connected. If not, we need to find the minimal number of nodes to add (from the lower nodes) to connect them. However, since we can't add more than (s - (original count)) nodes, but since we need to have exactly s nodes, this approach may not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the optimal subtree is the one that includes the largest possible nodes, and for any node that is not in the s largest, it's better to remove it. But the problem is that the s largest nodes may not form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to find the minimal number of nodes to remove from the s largest to make them connected. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the set of nodes that must be kept. Since we want to maximize the sum, the best is to keep the s largest nodes, but if they are not connected, we need to adjust.\n\nBut how to adjust?\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can think of the problem as trying to keep the nodes with the highest possible values, and for that, we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the highest node, and include as many high nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to ensure that we get exactly s nodes?\n\nLet me think of this as a priority-based selection. We want to keep the nodes with the highest values, and include them in the subtree. To do that, perhaps we can use a priority queue (max-heap) approach where we start with the highest node, then add its neighbors, but in a way that ensures that we can collect as many high nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but how to manage that. For example, suppose we start with node n. Then we can add all its neighbors. But among those neighbors, which ones are the highest? We can prioritize adding the highest ones first. But this seems like a way to build a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut how do we ensure that the subtree has exactly s nodes? Because we need to select exactly s nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as follows: the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest possible nodes, and to do that, we can perform a greedy approach where we select the nodes in decreasing order and add them to the subtree if they are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nInitialize a set of kept nodes as empty. We process nodes in decreasing order (from n down to 1). For each node, we check if it's connected to the current kept nodes. If yes, we add it. If not, we skip it (but this might not be the right approach because maybe adding this node later could allow us to include more higher nodes).\n\nWait, no. Because if we process in order from highest to lowest, we want to include the node if possible. For example, if the current node is not connected to the kept nodes, but including it would allow us to connect to other higher nodes. But since we are processing in order, higher nodes have already been processed. So if the current node is not connected to the kept nodes, then perhaps we can't include it unless we add some lower nodes to connect it. But that's not allowed because we're trying to include higher nodes first.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3, s=3.\n\nThe districts are numbered 1-6. The s=3 largest are 6,5,4,3,2,1. Wait, no. s is 6-3=3. So the largest 3 nodes are 6,5,4. Now, are they connected?\n\nThe tree structure is:\n\nFrom the input:\n\nEdges are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. District 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the nodes 6,5,4: node 6 is connected to 5, but node 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6. So 6 is connected to 4 via 2. So the nodes 6,5,4 are connected through 6-2-4. So the subtree {4,5,6} is connected. Then, the sum is 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16 + 32 + 64 = 112. But according to the sample output, the answer is removing 1,3,4, which leaves 2,5,6. Their sum is 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. Wait, why isn't the sample taking the 4,5,6?\n\nAh! Oh, because the sample output says that the maximum sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4+32+64=100. But according to my previous calculation, the 4,5,6 would give 112. Why isn't that the case?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFirst input is:\n\n6 3\n\nThen the edges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the tree structure:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n\nDistrict 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo, the nodes 4, 5, 6 are connected? 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So yes, they are connected. So why isn't the sample taking those three nodes?\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the maximum sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100. That would suggest that the kept nodes are 2,5,6. Which sum to 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. But the nodes 4,5,6 would be 16 + 32 + 64 = 112, which is higher. So why isn't that the case?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample input. Let me check the sample again.\n\nThe sample input says that the output is 1 3 4. So the removed districts are 1,3,4. The kept districts are 2,5,6. But why not keep 4,5,6?\n\nAh! Because the problem says that the districts of the removed contestants will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. So the remaining districts must form a connected component. But if we remove districts 1,3,4, then the remaining districts are 2,5,6. Are they connected?\n\nYes. 2 is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So yes.\n\nBut if we remove 1, 3, and 5, keeping 2,4,6. Are they connected? Yes. 2 is connected to 4 and 6. So sum is 2^2 + 2^4 + 2^6 = 4 + 16 + 64 = 84, which is less than 100. So why isn't the optimal solution to keep 4,5,6?\n\nWait, but according to the sample explanation, the maximum sum is 100. So why isn't 4,5,6 giving a higher sum?\n\nWait 4 is 16, 5 is 32, 6 is 64. Sum is 112. That's way higher than 100. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh wait, maybe the sample explanation is wrong? Or maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The president wants to remove k contestants. The remaining districts must be connected. The sample input says that the output is 1 3 4. Which removes three districts, leaving 2,5,6. But why not remove 1, 3, 5 (leaving 2,4,6) which is connected, but sum is 4 + 16 + 64 = 84. Or remove 1, 2, 3 (leaving 4,5,6) which is connected. Sum is 16 + 32 + 64 = 112. Which is better than 100. So why is the sample output different?\n\nWait this suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nProblem statement: The districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another.\n\nAh! So the remaining districts must form a connected subtree. But if you remove districts 1,3,5, then the remaining districts are 2,4,6. Are those connected? Let's see. District 2 is connected to 4, and to 6. So yes, 2,4,6 are connected. So why isn't that a valid solution?\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the maximum is 100, which implies that the kept districts are 2,5,6. But why isn't the sample considering the option of keeping 2,4,6 (sum 4+16+64=84) or keeping 4,5,6 (sum 16+32+64=112) ?\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a mistake in the sample explanation. But that's unlikely. So where is my error?\n\nLet me re-examine the sample input. The first sample input's edges are:\n\nThe first line after n and k is 2 1, then 2 6, then 4 2, 5 6, 2 3. So the tree structure:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n\nDistrict 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo, the districts 4,5,6: district 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So yes, the districts 4,5,6 are connected through 2, 6, 5. But wait, if we remove 1,3, and 2, then the remaining districts are 4,5,6. But district 2 is removed, so the path between 4 and 6 is blocked. Because district 2 is removed. So the districts 4,5,6 would not be connected. Because 4 is connected to 2 (which is removed), and 6 is connected to 2 (removed) and to 5. So without 2, the districts 4 and 6 are not connected. Hence, the districts 4,5,6 are not connected. Therefore, that's not allowed.\n\nAh! Oh right! Because the removed districts' districts are not allowed to be crossed. So, if a district is removed, you can't go through it. So the remaining districts must form a connected subtree. So, if we remove districts 1, 3, and 2, then the remaining districts are 4,5,6. But the original tree's connections are:\n\nDistrict 4 is connected to 2 (removed), so no connection. District 6 is connected to 2 (removed) and 5. So the remaining districts are 4,5,6. But 4 is not connected to 5 or 6. So the subtree is not connected. Hence, that's invalid.\n\nAh! So the problem is that the kept districts must form a connected subtree. So even if you have the nodes 4,5,6, they are not connected if the path between them goes through removed districts.\n\nSo the key point is that the kept districts must form a connected subtree. So the way to think about it is: the kept districts must form a connected subtree in the original tree, with none of the removed districts being part of the subtree.\n\nTherefore, the selection of the kept districts must be such that they form a connected subtree in the original tree.\n\nSo the initial idea of selecting the s largest nodes is not sufficient, because even though they are high in value, they may not form a connected subtree. Hence, we need to find a connected subtree of size s with maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nNow, the problem becomes: find a connected subtree of size s (s = n -k) with maximum sum of node values. How to do that efficiently?\n\nSince the node values are 2^i, which are exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree must include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But how to ensure connectivity.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem where we need to select a subtree with s nodes, and the sum is maximized. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and higher nodes contribute more, the optimal subtree would include the highest possible nodes, and possibly some lower ones to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include.\n\nHere's an idea inspired by Kruskal's algorithm: we can think of the nodes as having weights 2^i. We want to select a subtree with s nodes, and the sum of the weights is maximum. This sounds like the problem of finding a maximum weight subtree with exactly s nodes.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently for large trees (up to 1e6 nodes)?\n\nDynamic programming approaches are not feasible for such sizes.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weights are 2^i, which are unique and ordered, we can think of the problem as follows: the optimal subtree will include the highest possible nodes. So we can start by selecting the highest node, and then greedily add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of a way to build the subtree:\n\nStart with the highest node (say, node n). Then, we need to select s-1 more nodes. We can add the highest possible nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to manage that? It sounds like a priority queue approach where we always select the next highest node that is adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nWait, but this is similar to Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, but instead of minimizing, we are maximizing. So here's an idea:\n\nWe can use a priority queue (max-heap) to select the next node to add to the subtree. Initially, we have the highest node (n) in the subtree. Then, we look at all its adjacent nodes, and add them to a priority queue based on their value. Then, we extract the highest node from the queue, add it to the subtree, and then add its adjacent nodes (that are not already in the subtree) to the priority queue. Repeat until the subtree has s nodes.\n\nBut this approach ensures that we always add the highest possible node that is connected to the current subtree. This way, the subtree is built in a way that maximizes the sum.\n\nBut does this approach work? Let's test it with the sample input.\n\nSample input: n=6, k=3, s=3.\n\nThe highest node is 6. Start with 6. The priority queue contains adjacent nodes to 6, which are 2 and 5. The values are 2^2=4 and 2^5=32. So the priority queue has 5 (value 32) and 2 (value 4). Extract 5, add to subtree. Now subtree has 6,5. Need one more node. Now, look at the adjacent nodes of 5 (only 6, which is already in the subtree) and adjacent nodes of 6 (2, which is not yet added). Also, the adjacent nodes of 5 are already considered. So the priority queue now has 2 (value 4). Extract 2 and add to subtree. Now the subtree has 6,5,2. The sum is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2 = 64 +32 +4 = 100. Which matches the sample's explanation. But earlier, I thought that 4,5,6 could be a valid subtree. But why isn't that considered?\n\nBecause in this approach, the algorithm adds 5 first, then 2. So the subtree is 6-5 and 6-2. But the node 4 is not added. However, the subtree {6,5,2} is connected, and the sum is 100. But what about the subtree {6,2,4}? The sum is 64 + 4 + 16 = 84. Which is less than 100. So the algorithm's approach gives the correct answer.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for the sample. Let's see another example.\n\nSuppose we have nodes 4,5,6. Let's say the tree is 4 connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. The algorithm starts with 6. Adjacent nodes are 2 and 5. Add 5 (value 32) to the subtree. Then, the next step adds 2 (value 4). So the subtree is 6,5,2. But if we had added 2 first, then perhaps we could add 4. But since 4 has a higher value than 2, but in this case, the algorithm would have added 5 first. So the algorithm is not considering 4. But in that case, the subtree {6,2,4} has sum 64+4+16=84, which is less than 100.\n\nSo the algorithm's approach seems to work. But how to implement this?\n\nThe idea is to use a priority queue (max heap) to always add the next node with the highest value that is adjacent to the current subtree. This way, we greedily select the highest possible nodes.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- Initialize the subtree with the node with the highest value (n).\n- Use a max-heap to store candidate nodes that can be added to the subtree. These are nodes adjacent to the current subtree, but not yet in it.\n- While the size of the subtree is less than s:\n   - Extract the node with the highest value from the heap.\n   - Add it to the subtree.\n   - Add its adjacent nodes (not yet in the subtree) to the heap.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always add the highest possible node that can be connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to track which nodes are already in the subtree and which are not?\n\nWe can have a visited array, which marks whether a node is in the subtree or not.\n\nNow, the problem is that for n up to 1e6, this approach needs to be efficient.\n\nBut for each node, we process it once. Each edge is considered twice (once for each direction). However, the heap operations are O(log n) per insertion and extraction. For s steps, the total time complexity is O(s log n), which for s up to 1e6 is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have the subtree, the nodes in the subtree are the ones we want to keep. The others are to be removed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the tree structure and build an adjacency list.\n\n2. Compute s = n -k.\n\n3. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to select the nodes to include in the subtree.\n\n4. Start with node n (the highest), mark it as visited, add to the subtree.\n\n5. Push all its adjacent nodes into the priority queue, with their values.\n\n6. While the subtree size is less than s:\n\n   a. Pop the node with the highest value from the heap.\n\n   b. If it's already in the subtree, skip.\n\n   c. Add it to the subtree, mark as visited.\n\n   d. Push all its adjacent nodes into the heap if they are not already in the subtree.\n\n7. Once the subtree is built, collect all nodes not in the subtree, sort them, and output them.\n\nBut wait, the priority queue may have multiple entries for the same node. For example, a node may be pushed into the heap multiple times. However, once a node is marked as visited (i.e., added to the subtree), any further entries in the heap for that node can be ignored.\n\nThis approach is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, where we use a priority queue and ignore nodes that have already been processed.\n\nBut in this case, the priority queue may have multiple entries for the same node. However, when we process a node, we check if it's already in the subtree. If yes, we skip it. Otherwise, we add it.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting this approach on the sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=6, k=3 → s=3.\n\nStart with node 6. Mark as visited. Push its neighbors (2,5) into the heap. The heap contains 5 (value 32) and 2 (value 4).\n\nExtract 5. Add to subtree. Now size is 2. Push its neighbors (6 is already in the subtree, so nothing else). Now heap has 2 (value 4).\n\nExtract 2. Add to subtree. Size is 3. Done.\n\nSo the subtree is {6,5,2}. The nodes removed are 1,3,4. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: suppose we have a tree where node 4 is connected to 2, and node 2 is connected to 6. Suppose s=3. The algorithm would start with 6, then add 2 (value 4), then add 4 (value 16). So the subtree is {6,2,4} with sum 64+4+16=84. Which is better than {6,5,2} if 5 is not present. But in this case, it depends on the tree.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nImplement a priority queue (max-heap) based approach, starting with the highest node, and greedily adding the highest possible nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this in Python efficiently.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, we need to handle large data. In Python, using a priority queue (heapq) which is a min-heap, but we can store negative values to simulate a max-heap.\n\nBut for n=1e6, the algorithm's time complexity is O(s log n), which should be acceptable.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the next n-1 lines, building an adjacency list. Each node's adjacency list is stored as a list of integers.\n\nCompute s = n -k.\n\nInitialize a visited array of size n+1 (since nodes are numbered from 1 to n).\n\nInitialize a priority queue. Since Python's heapq is a min-heap, we can push tuples of (-value, node) to simulate a max-heap.\n\nStart with node n. Mark it as visited. Push all its neighbors into the priority queue.\n\nThen, while the size of the subtree is less than s:\n\n   Pop the node with the highest value (using the min-heap with negative values).\n\n   If the node is already visited, skip.\n\n   Else, mark it as visited, add to the subtree.\n\n   Push all its neighbors into the priority queue (if not visited).\n\nOnce done, collect all the nodes not in visited, sort them, and output.\n\nWait, but the priority queue may have multiple entries for the same node. For example, if a node is pushed multiple times into the heap, but once it is marked as visited, the other entries in the heap are ignored.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, the adjacency list needs to be built efficiently.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    adj[a].append(b)\n\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\ns = n -k\n\nvisited = [False]*(n+1)\n\nimport heapq\n\nheap = []\n\n# start with node n\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nfor neighbor in adj[n]:\n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, (-2**neighbor, neighbor)) # since we want max-heap, store as negative\n\nsubtree_size = 1\n\nwhile subtree_size < s:\n\n    current = heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    value_neg, node = current\n\n    if visited[node]:\n\n        continue\n\n    visited[node] = True\n\n    subtree_size += 1\n\n    for neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (-2**neighbor, neighbor))\n\nOnce this is done, the visited array marks which nodes are kept. The nodes not visited are to be removed.\n\nBut wait, the code pushes the nodes into the heap with their value as 2^neighbor. However, in the code above, when pushing into the heap, we use the value 2^neighbor. But the actual value of the node is 2^node. Wait, no. The value of the node is 2^node. But the priority queue is based on the value of the node, not the neighbor's value. Wait, no. When we process a node, we want to prioritize adding nodes with higher values. So when we add a neighbor to the heap, we should push the value of that neighbor (i.e., 2^neighbor), so that the heap compares based on that.\n\nWait, in the code above, when we process the node 'n', which is the starting node, we push its neighbors into the heap. For each neighbor, we push (-2^neighbor, neighbor). So the priority is based on the value of the neighbor. Which is correct.\n\nYes. Because when we consider adding a node to the subtree, we want to pick the one with the highest value. So the heap is ordered based on the value of the node.\n\nBut wait, the code uses 2^neighbor as the value. But the node's value is 2^node. So for example, if the neighbor is node 5, then the value is 2^5. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut in the code, when pushing into the heap, the value is 2^neighbor. But the node's value is 2^node. So that's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for the code, we can't compute 2^node for large nodes, since 2^1e6 is way too big. However, since we're only comparing the values, we don't need to compute the actual value. Because for the purpose of the heap, the relative values are what matter. So for two nodes a and b, we can compare their node numbers, since 2^a > 2^b iff a > b. Therefore, the actual value of 2^node is not needed, as we can compare the node numbers directly.\n\nWait, this is a crucial observation! Since 2^a is larger than 2^b if and only if a > b. So the priority queue can be based on the node numbers, not the actual values. So for the heap, we can just push the node numbers, and compare them. This saves us from dealing with huge numbers, which would cause integer overflows (though in Python that's not a problem, but computationally expensive).\n\nSo the code can be optimized by using the node numbers directly. For example, instead of storing -2^neighbor, we can store -neighbor. Because when we compare, the node with higher number has higher priority.\n\nSo this simplifies the code.\n\nFor example, in the initial code:\n\nwhen we push a neighbor into the heap, we can push (-neighbor, neighbor). Because the higher the neighbor's number, the higher priority.\n\nThis is a huge optimization. Because for large n (like 1e6), calculating 2^neighbor would be computationally expensive and unnecessary.\n\nSo the code can be rewritten as follows:\n\nStart with node n. Push all its neighbors into the heap with priority -neighbor (so that the heap is a max-heap based on the node numbers).\n\nThen, when popping from the heap, we check if the node is visited. If not, add it to the subtree and push its neighbors.\n\nThis approach avoids dealing with large exponents and is much more efficient.\n\nSo the revised code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nBuild adjacency list.\n\ns = n -k.\n\nInitialize visited array.\n\nheap is a priority queue (max-heap simulated with negative node numbers).\n\nStart with node n.\n\nPush all its neighbors into the heap with priority -neighbor.\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nThis is correct, because the node with higher number has higher priority.\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=6, s=3.\n\nStart with node 6. Push its neighbors (2,5, etc.) into the heap. The heap entries are (-2, 2), (-5,5), etc. Wait, no. For node 6's neighbors, say node 2 and 5. So when pushing into the heap, we push (-2, 2) and (-5,5). But since heapq is a min-heap, the smallest (most negative) is popped first. So -5 is smaller than -2. So the first popped is (-5,5), which is node 5. Then, node 5 is added. Then, its neighbors are 6 (already visited) and others. Then, the next entry is (-2,2). So node 2 is added. Then, its neighbors are processed.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes. So the code can be optimized this way.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nimport heapq\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    adj[a].append(b)\n\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\ns = n -k\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\nheap = []\n\n# Start with node n\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nfor neighbor in adj[n]:\n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))  # max heap based on node number\n\nsubtree_size = 1\n\nwhile subtree_size < s:\n\n    current = heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    node = current[1]\n\n    if visited[node]:\n\n        continue\n\n    visited[node] = True\n\n    subtree_size += 1\n\n    for neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n        if not visited[",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove from the Number Games such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Selection with Priority Queue**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to greedily select the highest-numbered districts that can be connected to the current subtree.
