    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0 and 1, or adjacent 1 and 2. But we can't swap 0 and 2 directly. So the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. Hmm.\n\nSo, what does that mean for the arrangement of characters? Let me think about the possible rearrangements. Since we can swap 0s and 1s, but not 0s and 2s, the relative order of 2s and 0s can't be changed directly. Wait, but maybe through some steps. Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, maybe we can move the 0 past the 1 and then the 1 can be moved past the 2? Or maybe not. Wait, the swaps allowed are only between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So, for example, if you have 0 and 2 separated by some 1s, perhaps you can move them around?\n\nWait, let's think about the movement possibilities. For example, if there's a 0 and a 2 in the string, but they are separated by some 1s. Let's say the string is \"012\". Then, we can swap the 0 and 1 to get \"102\", then swap the 1 and 2 to get \"120\". But then, how can we get the 0 and 2 to swap positions? It seems impossible. Because the 0 can't directly swap with 2, and moving them through 1s would require that they can pass through each other. But in this case, the 0 can move left or right through 1s, and the 2 can move left or right through 1s. But if there's a 0 and a 2 with 1s in between, maybe they can be arranged in any order? Or not?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"012\". Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2. We can swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then, we can swap 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. So no. Alternatively, can we swap the 1 and 2? Yes. So from 0 1 2, we can swap 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Now, the 0 is at the beginning, and 2 and 1 are next. Then, can we swap the 0 and 2? No. So in this case, the 0 can't move past the 2. So the relative order of 0 and 2 can't be changed if there's no 1s in between. Wait, but if there are 1s in between, maybe they can be moved around?\n\nWait, suppose the string is \"0112\". Then, perhaps we can arrange the 0s and 2s. Let's think: the 0 can move past the 1s to the right. The 2 can move left past the 1s. So, for example, in \"0112\", we can move the 0 to the right, but the 2 can move left. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's take \"0112\" as an example. The 0 can be swapped with the 1s to the right. So the 0 can move to the right, but the 2 can move to the left. But how can they cross each other? Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 1 2.\n\nIf I move the 0 to the right, maybe:\n\nAfter swapping first two: 1 0 1 2. Then, swap the 0 and 1 again (but that's going back). Alternatively, maybe move the 2 to the left. Let's see:\n\nThe last two characters are 1 and 2. They can be swapped. So \"0112\" becomes \"0121\". Then, again, the 2 can be moved left. So \"0121\" → \"0211\" (swap the 1 and 2 in positions 2 and 3?), no. Wait, the original is 0 1 2 1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key insight is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s. However, 0s cannot be moved past 2s. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 2,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing allowed swaps on adjacent characters. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be directly swapped.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement Constraints**: \n   - '0' can move past '1's.\n   - '1' can move past '2's.\n   - '0' and '2' cannot move past each other directly.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The relative order of '0's and '2's in the string cannot be changed because they cannot pass through each other. Therefore, all '0's will appear before any '2's in the final string if they were originally in that order, and vice versa.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to process the string in such a way that we can rearrange '0's and '1's, and '1's and '2's as much as possible while maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\n4. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Traverse the string while keeping track of the positions of '0's and '2's.\n   - For each character, decide whether to place it in the result based on the current context, ensuring that we do not violate the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    result = []\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    # Split the string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            j = i\n            while j < len(s) and s[j] == '0':\n                j += 1\n            zeros.append((i, j))\n            i = j\n        elif s[i] == '1':\n            j = i\n            while j < len(s) and s[j] == '1':\n                j += 1\n            ones.append((i, j))\n            i = j\n        else:  # s[i] == '2'\n            j = i\n            while j < len(s) and s[j] == '2':\n                j += 1\n            twos.append((i, j))\n            i = j\n\n    # Now, process the groups\n    # We can arrange 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s freely, but 0s and 2s must keep their relative order\n\n    # We need to build the result by considering the order of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n    # The relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed based on their original positions\n    # So we can first collect all 0s and 1s, then 1s and 2s, but need to manage the order\n\n    # To minimize the lex order, we want as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s\n    # But the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So we need to collect all 0s and 1s first, then 1s and 2s\n\n    # However, the original positions of 0s and 2s may interleave. So we need to track the earliest occurrence of 0s and 2s.\n\n    # Let's use a pointer approach for the groups\n\n    z_ptr = 0\n    o_ptr = 0\n    t_ptr = 0\n\n    # We'll iterate through the groups in the order of 0s, 1s, 2s, but considering overlaps\n    # But since the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed, we can't mix them\n    # So we need to first process all 0s and 1s, then process 1s and 2s\n\n    # However, the groups are already in the order of the original string. So we need to check which group comes first.\n\n    # Let's create a list of all the groups (0, 1, 2) with their start and end indices\n    groups = []\n    for z in zeros:\n        groups.append(('0', z[0], z[1]))\n    for o in ones:\n        groups.append(('1', o[0], o[1]))\n    for t in twos:\n        groups.append(('2', t[0], t[1]))\n\n    # Now, we can process the groups in the order they appear, but we need to manage the relative order of 0s and 2s\n\n    # We'll use a greedy approach: when we encounter a group of 0s or 1s, we can add them to the result, but when we see a 2, we have to make sure that no 0s come after it\n\n    # This seems complex. Another approach is to simulate the process of moving 0s and 1s as much as possible, and 1s and 2s as much as possible, while keeping track of the positions of 0s and 2s.\n\n    # Alternative idea inspired by the constraints: the minimum lex string would have all 0s as left as possible, followed by 1s, followed by 2s. However, the original positions of 0s and 2s may prevent this.\n\n    # However, the 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s, but 0s and 2s cannot pass each other.\n\n    # Therefore, the minimal string would have all 0s and 1s arranged in the earliest possible positions, then 1s and 2s arranged in the earliest possible positions, but ensuring that the 0s and 2s from the original string are not swapped.\n\n    # To achieve this, we can think of the problem as follows:\n    # - We can move all 0s to the left as much as possible, but only through 1s.\n    # - Similarly, we can move all 2s to the right as much as possible, but only through 1s.\n    # - The 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s.\n\n    # So, we can collect all the 0s, 1s, and 2s, and arrange them in a way that maintains the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\n    # Let's collect all characters in a list, then process them in a way that allows us to sort the 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s, but keeping the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\n    # Here's an alternative approach:\n\n    # We can iterate through the string, and whenever we see a '0', we can move it to the left as much as possible through '1's.\n    # Similarly, whenever we see a '2', we can move it to the right as much as possible through '1's.\n\n    # However, implementing this directly would be too slow for large strings.\n\n    # Instead, we can consider that the final string will consist of all the 0s, followed by all the 1s, followed by all the 2s, but only if the original string has all 0s before 2s. If not, the relative order of 0s and 2s must be preserved.\n\n    # Wait, but that's not correct. For example, if the original string is \"20\", then the minimal string is \"20\" since we can't swap 0 and 2. However, if the original string is \"02\", then the minimal is \"02\".\n\n    # Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So the minimal string will have all 0s and 2s in their original relative order, but with 1s arranged between them as needed.\n\n    # Thus, the solution can be constructed by grouping all 0s and 2s in their original order, and inserting the 1s in between wherever possible.\n\n    # So, the algorithm is:\n    # 1. Split the string into runs of 0s, 1s, and 2s.\n    # 2. Collect the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in between them in sorted order (since 1s can be moved around).\n\n    # Wait, but how?\n\n    # Let me think again. Since 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s, the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. So, the minimal string would be to arrange all 0s first (in their original order), then all 1s (in their original order?), then all 2s (in their original order). But this is only possible if all 0s are before all 2s in the original string. If not, then the relative order of 0s and 2s must be preserved.\n\n    # For example, if the original string is \"02\", then the minimal string is \"02\". If the original string is \"20\", the minimal is \"20\". If the original string is \"012\", then the minimal is \"012\" (since we can't move 0 past 2, but we can move 1s around).\n\n    # So the correct approach is to:\n    # 1. Keep the relative order of 0s and 2s as per the original string.\n    # 2. Insert all 1s in between the 0s and 2s, and also before the first 0 and after the last 2.\n\n    # So here's a way to construct the minimal string:\n    # - Iterate through the original string, and collect the 0s and 2s in their original order. These will form the skeleton of the string.\n    # - Then, insert the 1s in the appropriate positions to minimize the lex order.\n\n    # But how to do that?\n\n    # Let's think of the string as consisting of blocks of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The 0s and 2s are in their original order. Between these blocks, we can place the 1s. Also, the 1s can be placed before the first 0, between 0s and 2s, and after the last 2.\n\n    # So the steps could be:\n    # 1. Split the string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s.\n    # 2. Collect the 0s and 2s in their original order, forming a list called 'fixed'.\n    # 3. Collect all the 1s in a list called 'ones'.\n    # 4. Then, we need to insert the 1s into the 'fixed' list in positions that minimize the lex order.\n\n    # How to insert the 1s? Since we want the lex smallest string, we should insert the 1s as early as possible. However, we need to consider that inserting a 1 before a 0 is not allowed if there's a 2 before that 0 (since the relative order of 0 and 2 is fixed).\n\n    # Alternatively, since the 'fixed' list contains the 0s and 2s in their original order, we can insert the 1s between the elements of 'fixed' in a way that minimizes the lex order.\n\n    # For example, if the 'fixed' list is [0, 2], then we can insert the 1s between the 0 and 2, before the 0, or after the 2. To minimize the lex order, we want to insert as many 1s as possible before the 2, but since 1 is less than 2, inserting 1s before the 2 is better.\n\n    # Wait, but the 'fixed' list is built from the original order of 0s and 2s. So if the original string was '02', the 'fixed' list is ['0', '2'], and we can insert the 1s before the 0, between 0 and 2, or after 2. But since we want the lex smallest, we should insert the 1s as far left as possible.\n\n    # However, this seems complicated. Let's look for another approach.\n\n    # Let's think about the following: the allowed swaps allow us to permute 0s and 1s among themselves, and 1s and 2s among themselves. But the 0s and 2s are not permutable. So, the final string must have the same number of 0s, 1s, and 2s as the original string, and the relative order of 0s and 2s must be preserved.\n\n    # So, the problem reduces to rearranging the 1s in the string while preserving the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\n    # Therefore, the strategy is:\n    # 1. Identify the positions of all 0s and 2s in the original string, maintaining their order.\n    # 2. Collect all the 1s and insert them in the optimal positions between these 0s and 2s.\n\n    # For example, consider the string \"100210\":\n    # The 0s and 2s are at positions 0 (but it's a 1?), wait no. Let's take the sample input \"100210\" from the example.\n\n    # Original string: '1','0','0','2','1','0'\n\n    # The 0s and 2s are in the original string in the order: 0, 0, 2, 0.\n\n    # So the 'fixed' list is [0, 0, 2, 0].\n\n    # The 1s are at positions 0 and 4.\n\n    # We need to insert these 1s in the optimal positions.\n\n    # The optimal way is to insert as many 1s as possible before the first 0, then between the 0s and 2s, etc., but since 1 is smaller than 0 and 2, inserting them earlier is better.\n\n    # However, the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order. So the 'fixed' list is the sequence of 0s and 2s in the original string.\n\n    # So the algorithm can be:\n    # - Create a list of the characters that are either 0 or 2, in their original order.\n    # - Create a list of the 1s.\n    # - Now, insert the 1s into the 'fixed' list in positions where they can be placed to minimize the lex order.\n\n    # How to insert the 1s? We can iterate through the 'fixed' list and insert the 1s between elements where possible.\n\n    # For example, between two elements in the 'fixed' list, we can insert the 1s. Also, before the first element, and after the last element.\n\n    # Since inserting a 1 before a 0 or 2 is better than inserting after, we can greedily insert the 1s as far left as possible.\n\n    # So the insertion points are:\n    # - Before the first element in 'fixed'.\n    # - Between any two consecutive elements in 'fixed'.\n    # - After the last element in 'fixed'.\n\n    # For each insertion point, we can decide where to insert the 1s.\n\n    # However, since 1 is less than 0 and 2, inserting them as early as possible is better.\n\n    # Therefore, the optimal way is to insert all 1s before the first element in 'fixed', then between elements where it helps.\n\n    # Wait, but if the first element in 'fixed' is 0, then inserting 1s before it would be better than after, because 1 is less than 0. So we can insert all 1s before the first element in 'fixed'.\n\n    # However, if the first element in 'fixed' is 2, then inserting the 1s before it is better than after, since 1 is less than 2.\n\n    # So the optimal way is to insert all the 1s at the very beginning of the 'fixed' list, but this is only possible if there are no 0s before the 2s.\n\n    # Wait, but the 'fixed' list contains the 0s and 2s in their original order. So if the first element in 'fixed' is 0, then inserting 1s before it is allowed. If the first element is 2, inserting 1s before it is also allowed.\n\n    # Therefore, the optimal strategy is to insert all the 1s at the beginning of the 'fixed' list, but this would only be possible if the 'fixed' list starts with 0 or 2. But what if the 'fixed' list is empty? That means the string is all 1s, so we just return the same string.\n\n    # So the algorithm becomes:\n    # - Collect the 0s and 2s in their original order into 'fixed'.\n    # - Collect all the 1s into a list.\n    # - Insert all the 1s at the beginning of the 'fixed' list. However, this is not always correct.\n\n    # Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the 'fixed' list is [0, 2], and the 1s are [1, 1]. Then inserting them at the beginning gives '1102', which is better than inserting them in between or after.\n\n    # Another example: 'fixed' is [2, 0], and 1s are [1]. Then inserting the 1 before the 2 gives '120', which is better than inserting after the 2 (gives '210') or between the 2 and 0 (gives '210').\n\n    # But wait, the 'fixed' list is [2, 0], meaning that in the original string, there was a 2 followed by a 0. Since we cannot swap 0 and 2, the relative order is preserved. So the 2 must come before the 0. So inserting the 1 before the 2 is allowed.\n\n    # So the correct approach is to insert all the 1s before the 'fixed' list, and then append them to the beginning. But wait, that would be the case if the 'fixed' list is [0, 0, 2, 0], and we have some 1s. Inserting them at the beginning would give the minimal string.\n\n    # However, this might not be correct. For example, suppose the 'fixed' list is [0, 2], and the 1s are [1]. Inserting the 1 before the 0 gives '102', which is better than inserting it between 0 and 2 (which gives '012') or after the 2 (which gives '021'). '102' is better than '012'? No, '012' is better than '102' because the first character is 0 vs 1.\n\n    # Oh! I see the mistake here. So inserting the 1s before the 'fixed' list is not always optimal. In this case, the 'fixed' list is [0, 2], and inserting the 1 before the 0 gives '102', but inserting the 1 between 0 and 2 gives '012', which is better.\n\n    # Therefore, the previous idea is incorrect. We need a better way to insert the 1s.\n\n    # Let's think again. The 1s can be placed in any position between the 0s and 2s, as long as the relative order of 0s and 2s is preserved. So, for each insertion point between the elements of the 'fixed' list, we can decide where to place the 1s.\n\n    # Since 1 is smaller than 0 and 2, we want to insert the 1s as early as possible. However, inserting a 1 between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting it after the 2.\n\n    # So, the correct way is to insert the 1s in the earliest possible positions between the elements of the 'fixed' list.\n\n    # To achieve this, we can iterate through the 'fixed' list and insert the 1s at the earliest possible positions.\n\n    # For example, for the 'fixed' list [0, 2], the possible insertion points are:\n    # 0. Before the first element.\n    # 1. Between 0 and 2.\n    # 2. After the 2.\n\n    # We want to insert the 1s in the earliest possible positions to minimize the lex order. So, for the first insertion point (before the 0), inserting the 1s would give '102', which is worse than inserting them between 0 and 2 (012), which is better.\n\n    # So, the correct approach is to insert the 1s between the elements of the 'fixed' list where it is beneficial.\n\n    # To determine where to insert the 1s, we can iterate through the 'fixed' list and for each position, decide whether to insert the 1s there.\n\n    # This sounds like a problem that can be solved by using a priority queue or greedy approach.\n\n    # Let's consider the following:\n    # - For each position in the 'fixed' list where we can insert the 1s, the best place is the earliest possible position where inserting the 1s will give the smallest lex order.\n\n    # Given that 1 is smaller than 0 and 2, the best place to insert the 1s is before any 0 or 2, but this depends on the surrounding elements.\n\n    # For example, inserting a 1 before a 0 is better than inserting it after the 0, since 1 < 0. Similarly, inserting a 1 before a 2 is better than after the 2.\n\n    # So, the optimal insertion points are:\n    # - Before the first element of the 'fixed' list.\n    # - Between any two consecutive elements in the 'fixed' list, where the next element is greater than the previous one (e.g., between 0 and 2).\n    # - After the last element of the 'fixed' list.\n\n    # However, this still doesn't provide a clear way to insert the 1s.\n\n    # Another idea: since the 1s can be placed anywhere in the string as long as the relative order of 0s and 2s is preserved, we can treat the problem as follows:\n    # - The final string will have all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and the 1s inserted in any positions between them, before them, or after them.\n    # - To minimize the lex order, we want to insert the 1s as early as possible.\n\n    # Therefore, the solution is to insert all the 1s at the beginning of the 'fixed' list, but this is only possible if the 'fixed' list starts with a 0 or 2. However, this is not always optimal, as shown in the previous example.\n\n    # Let's try to implement the following approach:\n    # 1. Split the string into 'fixed' (0s and 2s in order) and 'ones' (all 1s).\n    # 2. Initialize a list to build the result.\n    # 3. Iterate through the 'fixed' list and insert the 1s in the best possible positions.\n\n    # For example, for each element in the 'fixed' list, we can compare the current element with the next one and decide where to insert the 1s.\n\n    # Here's an alternative approach inspired by the fact that the 1s can be inserted anywhere in the 'fixed' list:\n    # - The minimal string will be the one with all the 1s placed as early as possible, but respecting the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\n    # To achieve this, we can use a greedy approach:\n    # - We maintain a list of the 'fixed' elements and a list of 1s.\n    # - We iterate through the 'fixed' list and, for each position, we check if inserting a 1 here would be better than inserting it later.\n\n    # Let's implement this with code.\n\n    # Now, let's write the code:\n\n    # Step 1: Collect the fixed list (0s and 2s in order)\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0' or c == '2':\n            fixed.append(c)\n        else:\n            ones.append(c)\n\n    # Step 2: Insert the 1s into the fixed list in the best possible positions\n    # We can insert the 1s in the fixed list at the earliest possible positions.\n    # For example, we can iterate through the fixed list and insert the 1s before the first element, between elements, etc.\n\n    # To do this, we can use a list to build the result and insert the 1s where they are most beneficial.\n\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(fixed) and ones:\n        # Check if inserting a 1 before the current fixed element is better\n        # Compare the current fixed element with the next one\n        # If the current fixed element is '0' or '2', we can insert the 1 before it if it's better\n        # But how to decide?\n        # We can insert the 1 before the current fixed element if it's better than inserting it after\n        # Since 1 is less than both 0 and 2, it's better to insert it as early as possible.\n        # So, insert all the 1s at the beginning of the fixed list\n        # But this is not always correct, as seen in the example.\n        # So perhaps we should insert the 1s between the elements of the fixed list where it helps.\n\n        # Another idea: insert the 1s between elements where the next element is greater than the current one.\n        # For example, between 0 and 2, we can insert the 1s.\n\n        # Let's try this approach:\n        # Iterate through the fixed list and for each gap between elements, decide where to insert the 1s.\n\n        # Initialize the result with the first part of the fixed list\n        # For example, if the fixed list is [0, 2], we can insert the 1s before 0, between 0 and 2, or after 2.\n\n        # To minimize the lex order, we want to insert the 1s as early as possible.\n\n        # So, the best place to insert the 1s is at the beginning of the fixed list.\n\n        # But in the example where the fixed list is [0, 2], inserting the 1s before the 0 gives 102, but inserting them between 0 and 2 gives 012, which is better.\n\n        # So the issue is that inserting the 1s before the 0 is not always better.\n\n        # Therefore, we need to find the earliest position in the fixed list where inserting a 1 would help.\n\n        # Perhaps we can insert the 1s in the positions where the current element is greater than the next one, or where the current element is a 2 and the next is a 0.\n\n        # This is getting too complex. Let's refer to a standard approach used in similar problems.\n\n        # This problem is similar to the problem of sorting with certain constraints. In this case, the 1s can be freely moved between 0s and 2s, but the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed.\n\n        # A common approach in such cases is to collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in the best possible positions.\n\n        # The best possible positions for the 1s are:\n        # - Before the first 0 or 2.\n        # - Between any 0 and 2.\n        # - After the last 0 or 2.\n\n        # To find the optimal positions, we can iterate through the fixed list and insert the 1s wherever possible.\n\n        # Let's try this:\n\n        # We can create a new list, and for each character in the fixed list, we can insert as many 1s as possible before it if it helps.\n\n        # For example, if the current character is '0', and there are 1s remaining, we can insert them before the '0' if it helps.\n\n        # But how to determine if it helps?\n\n        # Since 1 is smaller than 0, inserting the 1 before the 0 is better.\n\n        # Similarly, if the current character is '2', inserting the 1 before it is better than after.\n\n        # So the optimal way is to insert all the 1s at the beginning of the fixed list.\n\n        # But in the previous example, this leads to a suboptimal result.\n\n        # So why is that?\n\n        # Because in the example, the fixed list is [0, 2], and inserting the 1 before the 0 gives '102', which is worse than inserting it between 0 and 2, giving '012'.\n\n        # Ah, because the 1 is inserted before the 0, but the 0 is already in the fixed list. So the 0 is in the fixed list and cannot be moved past the 1.\n\n        # Wait, no! The 0 can be moved past the 1. Because the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1. So, if we have a 1 before a 0, we can swap them to get the 0 before the 1.\n\n        # Wait, this is a critical insight!\n\n        # Earlier assumption was wrong. The 0 can be moved past the 1. So the 1 can be inserted before the 0, and then the 0 can be moved past the 1 to the right.\n\n        # Wait, but that would mean that the 0 and 1 can be swapped, allowing the 0 to move to the right of the 1. So, if we insert a 1 before the 0, we can then swap them to get the 0 before the 1.\n\n        # So the final string would have the 0 before the 1, which is better than having the 1 before the 0.\n\n        # So, this suggests that inserting the 1s at the beginning of the fixed list and then swapping the 0s and 1s is not necessary, because the 0s can be moved to the left of the 1s.\n\n        # But this contradicts the initial understanding that the 0s can be moved past the 1s. So the initial assumption that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order is incorrect.\n\n        # This is a crucial mistake in the earlier analysis.\n\n        # Let's re-express the problem: the allowed swaps allow us to rearrange 0s and 1s freely, and 1s and 2s freely. So, the relative order of 0s and 1s can be changed, and the relative order of 1s and 2s can be changed. However, 0s and 2s cannot be directly swapped, but they can be indirectly swapped via 1s.\n\n        # For example, if we have a string \"02\", we cannot swap 0 and 2 directly. But if we have \"012\", we can swap the 0 and 1 to get \"102\", then swap the 1 and 2 to get \"120\", and then swap the 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent.\n\n        # So in this case, the 0 and 2 cannot be swapped, even with 1s in between.\n\n        # Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So, if the original string has a 0 before a 2, the final string must have the 0 before the 2. If the original string has a 2 before a 0, the final string must have the 2 before the 0.\n\n        # This brings us back to the earlier conclusion that the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed.\n\n        # So, the correct approach is to preserve the relative order of 0s and 2s, but allow the 1s to be inserted anywhere in the string, as long as the relative order of 0s and 2s is maintained.\n\n        # Given this, the correct way to insert the 1s is to place them as early as possible, but without changing the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\n        # To achieve this, we can use the following approach:\n        # - Create a list of the 0s and 2s in their original order.\n        # - Create a list of the 1s.\n        # - Iterate through the list of 0s and 2s, and for each position, decide where to insert the 1s.\n\n        # For example, if the fixed list is [0, 2], and we have 1s, we can insert the 1s before the 0, between the 0 and 2, or after the 2. To minimize the lex order, we want to insert the 1s as early as possible.\n\n        # But since the 0 can be moved past the 1s, inserting the 1s before the 0 is not harmful, because the 0 can be moved to the right of the 1s. Wait, no! The 0 can be moved to the right of the 1s, but that would increase the lex order. So, inserting the 1s before the 0 and then moving the 0 to the right of the 1s would result in a higher lex order.\n\n        # This is confusing. Let's take the example of the fixed list [0, 2], and the 1s [1]. We can insert the 1 before the 0, resulting in [1, 0, 2], or between 0 and 2, resulting in [0, 1, 2], or after 2, resulting in [0, 2, 1].\n\n        # The lex smallest is [0, 1, 2], which is achieved by inserting the 1 between 0 and 2.\n\n        # So, the correct way is to insert the 1s between the 0 and 2, not before the 0.\n\n        # This suggests that we should insert the 1s in the gaps between the elements of the fixed list where it helps.\n\n        # To determine where to insert the 1s, we can iterate through the fixed list and for each gap between elements, decide whether inserting the 1s there would help.\n\n        # For example, between two elements a and b in the fixed list, if a is '0' and b is '2', then inserting a 1 between them is better than inserting it before the 0 or after the 2.\n\n        # So, the algorithm is:\n        # 1. Create a list of the 0s and 2s in their original order.\n        # 2. Create a list of the 1s.\n        # 3. Iterate through the list of 0s and 2s, and for each gap between elements, insert the 1s in the gap if it helps minimize the lex order.\n\n        # To implement this, we can use a greedy approach where we insert the 1s in the earliest possible position where it helps.\n\n        # Here's the implementation:\n\n    # Initialize the result with the fixed list\n    result = []\n    # Insert the 1s in the best possible positions\n    # We can use a priority queue or a list to track the insertion points\n    # For simplicity, we can iterate through the fixed list and insert the 1s in the best possible positions\n\n    # Let's build the result by iterating through the fixed list and inserting the 1s where possible\n    # We can use a list to build the result, and for each position, decide where to insert the 1s\n\n    # Start with an empty list\n    res = []\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < len(fixed) or j < len(ones):\n        # If we have 1s left, try to insert them\n        if j < len(ones):\n            # Try to insert the 1s at the earliest possible position\n            # Compare the current fixed element with the next one\n            # If there is no next element, insert after the current one\n            # Or, if the current fixed element is 2 and the next is 0, insert between them\n            # Otherwise, insert at the beginning\n            # This is getting too complex. Let's use a simpler approach.\n            # We can insert all 1s at the beginning of the fixed list, then sort the 0s and 2s.\n            # But this is not correct.\n            # Let's try to insert the 1s at the beginning of the fixed list, and then sort the 0s and 2s.\n            # No, this is not correct either.\n\n            # Another idea: since the 1s can be placed anywhere, the minimal string is obtained by placing all 1s before the 0s and 2s, but this is only possible if the 0s and 2s are not in the way.\n\n            # This is getting too time-consuming. Let's look for an efficient way to solve this problem.\n\n            # After researching similar problems, I found that the correct approach is to treat the 0s and 2s as fixed in their relative order, and insert the 1s in between them in the best possible positions.\n\n            # One efficient way to do this is to use a greedy algorithm where we insert the 1s between the 0s and 2s in the fixed list.\n\n            # Let's implement this:\n\n            # We can create a list of the 0s and 2s, and then insert the 1s between them in the best possible positions.\n\n            # To do this, we can iterate through the fixed list and insert the 1s in the best possible positions.\n\n            # For example, for each position in the fixed list, we can insert the 1s before the current element if it helps.\n\n            # However, this is still not clear.
