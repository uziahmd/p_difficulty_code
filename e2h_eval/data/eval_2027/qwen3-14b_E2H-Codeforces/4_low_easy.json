The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly isn't feasible. So we need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The key here is to find patterns that repeat so that we can calculate the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of full cycles, then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nFirst, let's understand the sequences. Nikephoros's sequence A has length m, and Polycarpus's sequence B has length k. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k]. \n\nSo for each round, we need to determine who wins. But with n up to 2e9, checking each round one by one would take O(n) time, which is impossible. Therefore, we need to find the number of rounds where each player loses, considering the cycles of their sequences.\n\nBut how can we find the number of losses efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the total number of rounds. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will start repeating their moves again. So the pattern of moves between the two players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. \n\nSo the idea is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n2. For each round in the first cycle_length rounds, determine who wins (if any), and count the number of losses for each player in this cycle.\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % cycle_length.\n5. Multiply the counts from one cycle by total_cycles, then add the counts from the first rem rounds of the next cycle.\n\nThis way, we can compute the total losses in O(cycle_length) time, which is acceptable since m and k are up to 1000, so cycle_length could be up to 1e6 (since LCM(1000, 1000) is 1e6). Wait, 1000 * 1000 is 1e6. But for m and k up to 1000, the LCM could be as high as 1e6, which is manageable. Because 1e6 is manageable for a loop.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the number of losses in one full cycle (of length cycle_length). Then multiply by the number of full cycles. Then process the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how do I calculate the number of losses in a single cycle?\n\nFor each round in 0 to cycle_length - 1:\n\nNikephoros's move is A[i % m], Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nCompare them and see who wins. For each such round, increment the count for the loser.\n\nSo for each of the cycle_length rounds, we check once.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, then total for full cycles is (count_per_cycle * total_cycles). Then for the remaining rem rounds, we process them similarly.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n- Compute LCM of m and k.\n\nBut how to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So we need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here.\n\nSo for m and k, compute GCD, then LCM is m*k // GCD.\n\nOnce we have that, proceed.\n\nNow, for each of the cycle_length rounds, we can compute the number of times each player loses in that cycle.\n\nThen, the total is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\ntotal_a_loss = full_cycles * a_loss_in_cycle + a_loss_in_rem\n\nSimilarly for b_loss.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute for the first cycle_length rounds, the number of a and b losses. Then compute for the first rem rounds, the same.\n\nBut how to compute the a_loss_in_cycle and a_loss_in_rem?\n\nLet me code this step.\n\nSo, for the first part, for each i in 0 to cycle_length - 1:\n\nget a_move = A[i % m]\n\nget b_move = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine who wins. If a wins, then b gets a loss. If b wins, a gets a loss. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, where each player follows a cyclic strategy. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use a more efficient approach based on cycles and least common multiples (LCM).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cycles**: Each player uses a sequence of moves that repeats cyclically. The combined cycle of both players' sequences will repeat every LCM of the lengths of their individual sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the length of the combined cycle.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within one full cycle, determine the winner and count the losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate the number of full cycles within the total number of rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef get_result(n, A, B):\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full cycle\n    a_loss_cycle = 0\n    b_loss_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # A wins, B loses\n            b_loss_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            # B wins, A loses\n            a_loss_cycle += 1\n    \n    # Number of full cycles and remainder\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    \n    # Compute losses from full cycles\n    total_a = full_cycles * a_loss_cycle\n    total_b = full_cycles * b_loss_cycle\n    \n    # Compute losses from the remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # A wins, B loses\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            # B wins, A loses\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    return total_a, total_b\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    a, b = get_result(n, A, B)\n    print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the length of the combined cycle after which the move patterns repeat.\n2. **Cycle Simulation**: By simulating each round within one LCM cycle, we count how many times each player loses in that cycle.\n3. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Using the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds, we efficiently compute the total losses by multiplying the cycle results by the number of full cycles and adding the results from the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle up to 2 billion rounds efficiently by leveraging cycle properties, reducing the complexity from O(n) to O(LCM(m, k)), which is feasible given the constraints.",
