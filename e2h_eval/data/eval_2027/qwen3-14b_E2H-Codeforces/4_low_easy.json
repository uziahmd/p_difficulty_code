The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about simulating a game of rock-paper-scissors between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to calculate the number of times each player loses over n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, we can't simulate each round directly. That would take way too long. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. Similarly, Polycarpus uses sequence B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find out what move each player makes, determine who wins, and count the losses.\n\nBut for large n, like 2e9, we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can compute the total without checking each round individually.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The key is that both sequences repeat periodically. So the combination of their moves will also repeat after some period. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of A and B. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, and their moves will repeat the same pattern as before. So, if we can compute the number of losses in one full cycle (of length LCM(m, k)), then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the remaining rounds, that would be efficient.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call this L.\n2. For each of the first L rounds, compute how many times Nikephoros loses (countA) and Polycarpus loses (countB).\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is n // L, and the remainder is r = n % L.\n4. The total losses would be (full_cycles * countA) + (losses in first r rounds of the cycle for Nikephoros), and similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how do I compute the moves for each round?\n\nFor each round i (starting from 0?), the move for Nikephoros is A[i % m], and for Polycarpus it's B[i % k]. So for each i from 0 to L-1, we can compute the moves, check who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut since L can be up to m*k, and m and k are up to 1000, then L could be up to 1e6. Which is manageable because even 1e6 operations are acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute LCM(m, k) as L.\n- Precompute for all positions from 0 to L-1, the number of times each player loses in that position.\n- Then, total full_cycles = n // L, and remainder = n % L.\n- Total for each player is full_cycles * (their count in one cycle) plus the count in the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need to compute GCD first. Python has math.gcd, but that returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here.\n\nSo first, compute the GCD of m and k. Then compute LCM.\n\nNow, for each round in the cycle (from 0 to L-1), we need to get the moves of A and B.\n\nBut for each i in 0 to L-1:\n\nA's move is A[i % m], B's move is B[i % k].\n\nOnce we have those two moves, we can determine the outcome.\n\nThe rules are:\n\n- Rock beats scissors (R beats S)\n- Scissors beat paper (S beats P)\n- Paper beats rock (P beats R)\n- Same: draw.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), determine who wins.\n\nSo for each pair, we can check:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a beats b) then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss (so add 1 to Nikephoros's count? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so his count increases by 1. Conversely, if Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check if a beats b. If yes, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. If b beats a, then Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), determine if a beats b, or b beats a.\n\nHow to code that? Well, perhaps create a helper function that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) on both Nikephoros and Polycarpus after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of each round is infeasible for large values of n, so we use an optimized approach based on cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Cycle Detection**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. The combined cycle length of their strategies is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Precompute Outcomes**: For each round within one full cycle (determined by the LCM), precompute the number of losses for each player.\n3. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds (n) and handle the remaining rounds separately. This allows us to efficiently compute the total number of losses using precomputed values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    b_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    lcm = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full cycle (lcm rounds)\n    count_a = 0  # number of times Nikephoros loses in one cycle\n    count_b = 0  # number of times Polycarpus loses in one cycle\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            count_b += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            count_a += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    # Now calculate the losses in the remainder rounds\n    extra_a = 0\n    extra_b = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            extra_b += 1\n        else:\n            extra_a += 1\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a + extra_a\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b + extra_b\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Cycle Detection**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the period after which both sequences repeat their moves simultaneously.\n2. **Precompute Outcomes**: By iterating through each round in one full cycle (up to LCM length), we determine the number of losses for each player during this cycle.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Using the precomputed values, we calculate the total losses by multiplying the number of full cycles by the precomputed losses and then adding the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of n without simulating each round individually, leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies.",
