    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm. So what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nLet me think about the allowed swaps. Since I can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, but not 0 and 2. So, maybe the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Wait, no. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, maybe I can move the 0 past the 1 and then the 2? Wait, no. Because you can't swap 0 and 2 directly. Let me think: For example, suppose I have \"02\". I can't swap them. But if there's a 1 in between, like \"012\", then maybe I can swap the 0 and 1 first, making it \"102\", then swap the 1 and 2? No, because the 1 and 2 can be swapped. Wait, but the 1 and 2 are adjacent here. So in \"102\", the 0 and 2 are not adjacent. So maybe the 0 can't get past the 2. So perhaps the relative positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Because you can't swap them directly, and you can't move them past each other via 1s. Because for example, if you have a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. But if there's a 1 between them, maybe you can move the 0 to the right of the 1, and the 2 to the left of the 1? Let's see.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the string is \"012\". How can I rearrange this?\n\nOriginal is 0,1,2. I can swap 0 and 1 to get 1,0,2. Then, can I swap the 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. But the 0 and 2 are separated by the 1. So maybe the 0 can't move past the 2. Alternatively, can I swap the 1 and 2 first? So original is 0,1,2. Swap 1 and 2 to get 0,2,1. Then, can I swap the 0 and 2? No. So the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So in this case, the 0 and 2 can't be moved past each other. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is fixed. Because you can't swap them directly, and you can't move them past each other via 1s. Wait, but maybe there's a way. Let me think again. Suppose I have a string like 0,2. Can't swap. If there's a 1 between them, like 0,1,2. Then, can I move the 0 to the right of the 1, and the 2 to the left of the 1? Well, the 0 can be moved to the right of the 1 (by swapping with the 1), but the 2 can be moved to the left of the 1 by swapping with the 1. So in this case, the 0 can be moved to the right of the 1, and the 2 can be moved to the left of the 1. So the 0 and 2 would end up next to each other, but their order is 0 followed by 2, which is the same as the original. Wait, but if I have 0,1,2. Let me try to swap the 1 and 2 first. That gives me 0,2,1. Then, can I swap the 0 and 2? No. So the order of 0 and 2 is preserved. So in this case, the 0 comes before the 2. So even after moving the 1 around, the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string must be maintained. Because you can't swap them directly, and you can't move them past each other via 1s. Because any movement of 0s and 2s would require passing through each other, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo that's a key insight. The positions of 0s and 2s relative to each other cannot be changed. So for example, if there's a 0 before a 2 in the original string, then in the final string, that 0 will still be before that 2. Similarly for any 2 before a 0. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. However, the 1s can be moved around, but only between 0s and 2s. Wait, but 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s. So 1s can be moved around, but the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: arrange the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, and arrange the 1s in between them as much as possible to make the string lex smallest.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nLet me think of the string as consisting of groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But since the 0s and 2s can't be reordered, perhaps the idea is to collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in between them in the optimal way.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved around. For example, if there's a 1 between two 0s, then the 1 can be moved to the left or right of the 0s. But since 0s can be swapped with 1s, and 1s can be swapped with 2s, but not 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. Let me think. Suppose we have a sequence of 0s and 2s, and the 1s can be inserted between them. For example, the original string is 0, 2. Then, the 1s can't be moved between them. Wait, but if there's a 1 in the original string, say between 0 and 2. Then, the 1 can be moved to the left or right of the 0 or 2? Let me take an example. Suppose the string is \"012\". Then, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0? No, because the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So for example, in \"012\", the 0 and 1 can be swapped to make \"102\". Then, the 1 and 2 can be swapped to make \"120\". Then, the 1 and 0 can be swapped again. Wait, but the 1 and 0 can be swapped again. So perhaps the 1s can be moved around between the 0s and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other.\n\nSo, the key is that the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order, and the 1s can be arranged in between them. But how?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the final string will consist of the same number of 0s, 1s, and 2s as the original string. The 0s and 2s are in their original order. The 1s can be placed in any positions between the 0s and 2s, but how to arrange them optimally.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s. For example, suppose there are some 0s and 2s. Between them, the 1s can be arranged in any order. But since the 1s can be moved past each other (since swapping adjacent 1s is allowed?), but wait, the problem statement allows swapping adjacent 0 and 1, or adjacent 1 and 2. So, swapping two adjacent 1s is not allowed. But in reality, since the problem allows swapping 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. But two 1s can't be swapped. However, since the 1s can be moved around via other characters. Wait, no. For example, if you have two 1s next to each other, you can't swap them. But if you have a 1 and a 0 next to each other, you can swap them. But that's not helpful for moving 1s around. Wait, but if you have a 1 and a 0, you can swap them. So, for example, if you have 1s and 0s, you can move the 1s to the right of the 0s. But how?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where there are multiple 1s. Let's say the original string is \"11\". Since the problem allows swapping adjacent 0 and 1, but not two 1s. So, in this case, the two 1s can't be swapped. But since they are the same, the order doesn't matter. So, the original arrangement is already the minimal. But if there are other characters, like 0s and 2s, then the 1s can be moved around.\n\nBut in any case, the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s. For example, if there's a group of 1s between two 0s, those 1s can be moved to the left or right of the 0s. But how?\n\nWait, the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So, suppose the original string has a 0 followed by a 2. Then, the 0 will always be before the 2. But between them, we can arrange the 1s. So, the problem becomes: arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, and arrange all the 1s in between them in such a way that the entire string is lexicographically minimal.\n\nSo, how to arrange the 1s. Since 1 is larger than 0 but smaller than 2. So, for lex min, we want as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So, the idea is to arrange the 1s in the positions between the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but how to model this. Let's think of the original string as a sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So, the final string will consist of the 0s and 2s in their original order, and the 1s can be placed in between them. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the original string is '02'. Then, the 0 must come before the 2, and there are no 1s. So the string remains '02'.\n\nIf the original string is '012', then the 0 must come before the 2. The 1 can be moved to the left of the 0, but that's not possible. Because the 1 can be swapped with the 0. For example, the original is '012'. We can swap the 0 and 1 to get '102', then swap the 1 and 2 to get '120'. Then, swap the 1 and 0 again to get '021'? Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1 can be placed between the 0 and the 2. So, the original is 0,1,2. The 1 can be moved to the left of the 0? No, because to move the 1 left of the 0, you'd need to swap the 1 with the 0. Which is allowed. So for example, in the original string '012', the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0? Let me see:\n\nOriginal is '0' '1' '2'. Swap 0 and 1: becomes '1' '0' '2'. Then, the 0 can be moved to the left of the 1? No, because the 1 is now before the 0. Wait, but the 0 can be swapped with the 1 again. So, the 1 and 0 can be swapped again. So, in this case, the 1 can be moved left and right as needed. So, the 1 can be placed anywhere between the 0 and the 2. But how?\n\nBut the 0 and 2 are fixed in their relative order. So, in the example of '012', the 0 comes before the 2. The 1 can be placed either before the 0, between them, or after the 2. Wait, but how can the 1 be placed before the 0? Because the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. Like, in the original '012', the 1 is after the 0. But by swapping with the 0, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. So the string becomes '102'. Then, the 1 can be moved further left? No, because there's nothing to the left of the 1. So in this case, the 1 can be placed before the 0. But that would make the string '102', which is lexicographically larger than the original. But the problem is to find the minimal string. So, perhaps the best way is to arrange the 1s as much as possible to the left of the 2s, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to arrange the 1s between the 0s and 2s. For example, the 0s can be grouped together, then the 1s, then the 2s. But given that the 0s and 2s are in their original order.\n\nWait, but the original order of the 0s and 2s may not be all 0s followed by all 2s. For example, the original string could be '0202', which would have the 0s and 2s in the order 0, 2, 0, 2. So, in this case, the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So the final string must have the same order of 0s and 2s, but between them, we can arrange the 1s.\n\nSo, the idea is to collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert all the 1s in between them in such a way that the string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of the process as follows: the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So, for example, if the original string is '012', the 0 and 2 are fixed in order. The 1 can be placed anywhere between them. To make the lex smallest string, the 1s should be placed as far to the left as possible. But wait, placing the 1s before the 0s would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So perhaps the optimal way is to place the 1s in between the 0s and 2s, but in such a way that they are placed as early as possible.\n\nWait, but how to model this. Let me think of the 0s and 2s as a sequence. For example, suppose the original string has the following 0s and 2s: [0, 2, 0, 2]. Then, the 1s can be placed in between these elements. For example, between the first 0 and the 2, between the 2 and the 0, and between the 0 and the 2. Also before the first 0, and after the last 2.\n\nBut to minimize the lex order, we want as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then the 1s, then the 2s. But the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So, the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s, but how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the entire string as being composed of the 0s and 2s in their original order, and the 1s can be arranged in between them. So, for example, between any two consecutive elements in the 0/2 sequence, we can insert some 1s. Also, before the first element, and after the last element.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s optimally. Since 1 is greater than 0, but less than 2. So, inserting 1s between 0s and 2s may be better than leaving them in the original positions.\n\nBut how to decide where to put the 1s. Let's consider that inserting 1s between a 0 and a 2 is better than having them in between a 2 and a 0. Wait, but the original order of 0s and 2s is fixed. For example, if there is a 0 followed by a 2, then between them, inserting 1s would be better than leaving them elsewhere. Because the 1 is less than 2, so putting 1s before the 2 would help.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and place them between the 0s and 2s in such a way that they are as far left as possible. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following example. Suppose the 0s and 2s are arranged as [0, 2]. Then, the 1s can be placed either before the 0, between 0 and 2, or after the 2. To minimize the lex order, placing the 1s before the 0 would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than 0s. So the best is to place them between the 0 and 2. But between 0 and 2, the 1 is better than the 2. So the string would be 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s. So, the optimal placement is to insert all 1s between the 0 and 2. So the resulting string is 0 followed by all 1s followed by 2.\n\nAnother example: suppose the 0s and 2s are arranged as [0, 0, 2, 2]. Then, the 1s can be placed between the 0s and the 2s. So, the optimal is to have all 1s between the 0s and the 2s. So the string would be 00...11...22.\n\nBut what if the 0s and 2s are arranged as [2, 0]? Then, the 2 comes before the 0. But according to our earlier analysis, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So if the original string had a 2 followed by a 0, then the final string must have the 2 before the 0. But in that case, inserting 1s between them would be better than having the 2 and 0 next to each other. But since 2 is larger than 1, and 0 is smaller than 1, inserting the 1s between them would give us 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. But that's worse than 2 followed by 0. Because 2 is larger than 0, but the 1s are between them. Wait, but the 2 is before the 0. So the string would be 2, then 1s, then 0. Which is worse than 2 followed by 0, because the first character is 2 in both cases. But the second character is 1 in the first case, which is worse than 0. So in this case, inserting the 1s between 2 and 0 would be worse. So perhaps in this case, the optimal is to not insert any 1s between them. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the placement of 1s depends on the positions between which they are inserted. For example, between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s is good. Between a 2 and a 0, inserting 1s is bad. So, how do we decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nAh! So, the key is that between any two consecutive elements in the 0/2 sequence, we can insert some 1s. But whether inserting 1s there is beneficial depends on the pair of elements.\n\nFor example, if between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s is beneficial, because 0 < 1 < 2. So inserting the 1s between them would allow the 1s to be in between 0 and 2, which is better than having them elsewhere.\n\nBut if between a 2 and a 0, inserting 1s would create a 2 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than just having the 2 and 0. Because 2 is larger than 1, and the 0 is smaller than 1. So the 2 followed by 1 is worse than 2 followed by 0. But since the 2 and 0's order is fixed, we can't change that. So, inserting 1s between a 2 and a 0 would make the string worse. Therefore, in such cases, we should not insert any 1s between them.\n\nSo, the strategy is: collect all the 1s, and distribute them into the gaps between the 0/2 elements, but only in those gaps where inserting 1s would improve the lex order.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Extract all the 0s and 2s from the original string, preserving their order. Let's call this list 'fixed'.\n\n2. Collect all the 1s in a separate list, say 'ones'.\n\n3. Now, we need to insert the 'ones' into the gaps between the elements of 'fixed', and also before the first element and after the last element. However, the insertion must be done in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to choose which gaps to insert the 1s into.\n\nEach gap between elements in 'fixed' is a position where we can insert some 1s. For example, if 'fixed' is [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], then there are n+1 gaps: before a_1, between a_1 and a_2, ..., between a_{n-1} and a_n, and after a_n.\n\nWe need to decide how to distribute the 'ones' into these gaps.\n\nThe key is that inserting 1s into certain gaps is better than others. For example, inserting into a gap between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting into a gap between a 2 and a 0. Also, inserting into a gap before a 0 is better than inserting into a gap after a 2. Because inserting before a 0 would allow the 1s to be before the 0s, which is worse than having the 0s first. Wait, no. Inserting before a 0 would make the 1s come before the 0s. But since 1 is larger than 0, that would make the string worse. So, inserting 1s before the first element (if it's a 0) would be worse than not inserting them there.\n\nSo, the idea is that we should insert the 1s into the gaps where they can be placed in a way that makes the overall string lex smaller. How to determine which gaps are better.\n\nFor each gap between two elements (or before the first or after the last), we can evaluate whether inserting 1s there would be beneficial. However, since all the 1s are the same, perhaps the optimal way is to insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them is beneficial.\n\nBut how to determine which gaps are beneficial. For example, inserting 1s into a gap between two elements a and b. Let's say that a is the previous element and b is the next. If inserting 1s here would allow the 1s to be placed between a and b. The effect on the lex order depends on the values of a and b.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 2: inserting 1s here is good because 0 < 1 < 2. So inserting 1s between them would be better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\n- If a is 2 and b is 0: inserting 1s between them would result in 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than 2 followed by 0. So inserting here is bad.\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 0: inserting 1s between them would result in 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than 0 followed by 0. But since the 1s can be moved around, perhaps inserting here is not optimal.\n\nWait, but the 0s are fixed in their order. So between two 0s, inserting 1s would be worse than not inserting them. Because the 1 is larger than 0. So, inserting 1s between two 0s would make the string have 0, then 1, then 0. Which is worse than having 0, 0. So, in such cases, it's better not to insert 1s between them.\n\nSimilarly, inserting 1s between two 2s would be worse than not inserting them. So, the optimal is to insert the 1s into the gaps where the insertion would not cause them to be between higher and lower elements, but rather in places where they can be placed in between lower and higher elements.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each gap between elements (or before the first, after the last), determine whether inserting 1s into that gap is beneficial. Then, insert as many as possible into the earliest possible such gaps.\n\nBut how to determine which gaps are beneficial.\n\nLet me think of the following criteria: for a gap between a and b (could be before the first element, which is considered as a being None, or after the last, which is considered as b being None), inserting 1s into this gap is beneficial if:\n\n- When inserting 1s here, it's better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nBut how to compare. Maybe for each gap, we can determine whether inserting 1s into this gap would contribute to the lex order.\n\nFor example, inserting 1s into a gap between a and b is better than inserting them into another gap if the insertion into this gap allows for more 1s to be placed in a position where they are as left as possible, but without causing the string to be worse.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: for the gaps, we can prioritize inserting 1s into the gaps where inserting them would allow the earliest occurrence of a 1 to be as small as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to find for each gap, the earliest position where inserting 1s would be better than not inserting them.\n\nAnother approach: the 1s can be placed in the gaps between the fixed elements. The optimal placement is to have all the 1s placed in the earliest possible gaps where inserting them is beneficial.\n\nSo, for each gap, we can check whether inserting 1s into it is beneficial. For example, inserting into a gap between a and b is beneficial if:\n\n- a is 0 and b is 2 (so inserting 1s between them is good).\n\n- Or, inserting into the gap before the first element (if the first element is 0, then inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So not beneficial).\n\n- Or inserting into the gap after the last element (if the last element is 2, inserting 1s here would make the string end with 1s, which is better than ending with 2s. Wait, but 1 is smaller than 2, so adding 1s after the 2s would make the string better. Because for example, the string '22' would be worse than '221' (but wait, '22' is shorter, but in the problem, the length is fixed. So, the original string has the same number of 1s, 0s, and 2s. So, the total number of characters is the same. So inserting 1s after the last element would be better than not inserting them there. Because 1 is smaller than 2. So, for example, if the last element is 2, inserting 1s after it would replace the 2 with 2 followed by 1s, which is better than leaving the 2. Because 2 is larger than 1. So, inserting 1s after the last element (if the last element is 2) is beneficial.\n\nSimilarly, inserting 1s before the first element (if the first element is 2) would be beneficial. Because inserting 1s before the 2 would make the string start with 1s, which is better than starting with 2.\n\nSo, how to evaluate each gap.\n\nFor each gap (before, between, after), we can determine the priority of inserting 1s into that gap. The priority is based on the following:\n\n- For a gap between a and b, the priority is determined by the value of a and b. We want to insert 1s into gaps where inserting them would make the string lex smaller.\n\nLet me think of the following: when inserting 1s into a gap between a and b, the effect is that the 1s are placed between a and b. So, the first occurrence of a 1 in the string is as early as possible. So, for example, inserting 1s into a gap that is earlier in the string is better than inserting into a later gap.\n\nBut the question is, for a particular gap, whether inserting 1s into it is better than not inserting them.\n\nSo, perhaps the gaps can be ranked in terms of how beneficial it is to insert 1s into them. For example:\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be between 0 and 2 are the most beneficial. Because inserting 1s there allows the 1s to be between 0 and 2, which is optimal.\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be before a 0 are not beneficial, as 1 is larger than 0.\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be after a 2 are beneficial, as 1 is smaller than 2.\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be between 2 and 0 are not beneficial, as explained earlier.\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be between 0 and 0 are not beneficial, as inserting 1s would make the string have 0, 1, 0, which is worse than 0, 0.\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be between 2 and 2 are not beneficial, similar to above.\n\nSo, the idea is to prioritize inserting 1s into the gaps where inserting them would be beneficial, and among those, insert them into the earliest possible gaps.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Split the original string into the 'fixed' elements (0s and 2s) and collect the 1s.\n\n2. Generate all the possible gaps where inserting 1s is beneficial. For example, the gaps between 0 and 2, gaps before a 2 (if that's the first element), and gaps after a 2.\n\nWait, perhaps we can generate a list of all possible gaps and for each, determine whether inserting 1s into it would be beneficial. Then, we can sort these gaps in the order of priority (earlier gaps first) and insert as many 1s as possible into them.\n\nBut how to determine which gaps are beneficial.\n\nLet me think of the following for each gap:\n\n- For a gap between a and b (a is previous element, b is next element):\n\n   - If a is None (gap before the first element), then inserting 1s here would mean placing them before the first element. Whether this is beneficial depends on the first element. For example, if the first element is 0, inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So not beneficial. If the first element is 2, inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1s, which is better than starting with 2. So beneficial.\n\n- Similarly, for a gap after the last element (b is None), inserting 1s here is beneficial if the last element is 2 (since inserting 1s after 2 is better than not doing so). If the last element is 0, inserting 1s after it would be worse than not inserting them (since 1 is larger than 0).\n\n- For a gap between a and b (both not None), inserting 1s is beneficial if a is 0 and b is 2 (since inserting 1s between them is optimal). Also, inserting 1s between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nBut what about inserting between a 0 and a 0? Not beneficial. Between a 2 and a 2? Not beneficial. Between a 0 and a 2? Beneficial. Between a 2 and a 0? Not beneficial. Between a 0 and a 1? No, because the 1s are not part of the fixed elements. Wait, no, the fixed elements are only 0s and 2s. So the gaps between the fixed elements are between 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, for the gaps between a and b (both in fixed elements), the only beneficial ones are those where a is 0 and b is 2.\n\nOther gaps are not beneficial.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate a list of gaps where inserting 1s is beneficial. These are:\n\n   - All gaps between 0 and 2.\n\n   - The gap before the first element if the first element is 2.\n\n   - The gap after the last element if the last element is 2.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there are other beneficial gaps. For example, inserting 1s before a 2 (the first element) is beneficial. Inserting 1s after a 2 (the last element) is beneficial.\n\nBut inserting 1s between a 0 and 2 is the most beneficial.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nCollect all the gaps where inserting 1s is beneficial. Then, sort these gaps in the order of their positions (i.e., earliest first), and insert as many 1s as possible into each of them.\n\nBut how to determine the order of the gaps. For example, the gap before the first element (if beneficial) comes first. Then, the gaps between 0 and 2 in order. Then, the gap after the last element (if beneficial).\n\nOnce we have the list of beneficial gaps sorted in the order of their positions, we can distribute the 1s into them.\n\nNow, the question is: how to distribute the 1s into these gaps. Since we want to minimize the lex order, we should insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible gaps.\n\nFor example, if there are multiple beneficial gaps, we fill them in order, inserting all possible 1s into the earliest gaps first.\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nExample 1: Input is '100210' â†’ output is '001120'.\n\nOriginal string is '100210'. Let's extract the fixed elements (0s and 2s). The original string is 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0. So the fixed elements are [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 1s are [1, 1].\n\nNow, the gaps are:\n\nBefore the first 0 â†’ gap 0.\n\nBetween 0 and 0 â†’ gap 1.\n\nBetween 0 and 2 â†’ gap 2.\n\nBetween 2 and 0 â†’ gap 3.\n\nAfter 0 â†’ gap 4.\n\nNow, the beneficial gaps are:\n\n- Gap 0: before first element (which is 0). Inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So not beneficial.\n\n- Gap 1: between 0 and 0. Not beneficial.\n\n- Gap 2: between 0 and 2. Beneficial.\n\n- Gap 3: between 2 and 0. Not beneficial.\n\n- Gap 4: after 0. The last element is 0. Inserting 1s here would be after 0, which is worse than not inserting them. Because 1 is larger than 0. So not beneficial.\n\nSo, the only beneficial gap is gap 2 (between 0 and 2). So we insert both 1s into this gap.\n\nThe resulting string is 0, 0, followed by 1, 1, followed by 2, 0. So the string is '001120', which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: input '20'. Output is '20'. Fixed elements are [2, 0]. The 1s are empty. So nothing to insert. The string remains '20'.\n\nAnother example",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a ternary string consisting of characters '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be directly swapped.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Fixed Elements**: Extract the positions of '0's and '2's from the input string, as their relative order must remain unchanged.\n2. **Collect 1s**: Gather all '1's from the input string separately.\n3. **Determine Beneficial Gaps**: Identify gaps where inserting '1's will help in minimizing the lexicographical order.
