They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the GCD and LCM values given for each road between them. The input gives me n lawns and m roads, each with two numbers (the GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on the connected lawns). My task is to find any possible assignment of mushroom counts or determine that it's impossible.\n\nFirst, I should think about the constraints. For each edge between two nodes u and v, the GCD and LCM must satisfy certain properties. For example, the GCD must divide the LCM. Because the LCM of two numbers is a multiple of their GCD. So if the given GCD and LCM don't satisfy that, like if GCD is 3 and LCM is 2, then it's impossible. Wait, but the problem says that the original numbers on the roads were valid. But since the input could be invalid, I need to check that first.\n\nWait, the input for each road gives GCD and LCM. So for each such pair, we must check that GCD divides LCM. Otherwise, it's impossible. Because for any two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) divides LCM(a,b). So if the input has a GCD and LCM where GCD doesn't divide LCM, then the answer is immediately NO.\n\nSo first step: for each of the m edges, check if GCD divides LCM. If any of them doesn't, output NO.\n\nBut even if that's true, there's more to check.\n\nNow, for each edge (u, v), the numbers a (on u) and b (on v) must satisfy:\n\ngcd(a, b) = g (given), and lcm(a, b) = l (given).\n\nWe know that a * b = g * l. Also, since a and b are multiples of g, let's write a = g * x, b = g * y. Then, gcd(x, y) must be 1, and the lcm of a and b would be g * x * y. So the given LCM l must equal g * x * y. Therefore, l must be divisible by g. Which again brings us back to the same check as before. So l/g must be an integer. Which is equivalent to checking that g divides l. So that's the first check.\n\nSo for each edge, we can compute l / g. Let's call that value k. Then, x and y must be coprime, and x*y = k. So for each edge, the product of x and y is k, and they are coprime. Which means that x and y are factors of k, and their product is k. So x and y must be a pair of coprime factors of k. But since x and y are coprime, the only way their product is k is that x and y are divisors of k and their product is k. Which implies that x and y are coprime pairs such that x*y=k. So for example, if k is 6, possible pairs are (1,6) and (2,3) and (3,2) and (6,1). But since x and y are coprime, those are the only possibilities.\n\nBut how does this help in solving the problem?\n\nThe problem is that each edge imposes a constraint between two nodes. So, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined by some variables, and edges impose constraints between variables.\n\nLet me think. Let's say that for each node, we assign a value. For each edge between u and v, the values of u and v must be such that their GCD is g and LCM is l. As discussed, this implies that the values are g*x and g*y, with x and y coprime, and x*y = l/g.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning variables to each node such that for every edge, the variables of the two nodes are of the form (g*x, g*y) where x and y are coprime and x*y = l/g.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems like a system of constraints that may require building equations between variables.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node has a value that is a multiple of some base value. However, since the edges have different GCDs and LCMs, this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using a union-find data structure, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to model this as a graph where each node's value is determined in terms of some variables, and we need to assign these variables in a way that satisfies all constraints.\n\nLet me think about the variables. For each edge, the two nodes u and v must have their values related by the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on given GCD and LCM values for roads connecting the lawns. The solution involves checking constraints and using a graph traversal approach to assign valid mushroom counts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Validity of Input**: For each road, ensure that the given GCD divides the LCM. If not, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Graph Construction**: Represent the lawns and roads as a graph where each node (lawn) is connected by edges with specific GCD and LCM values.\n3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS to traverse the graph and assign mushroom counts. For each edge, derive possible values for the nodes such that their GCD and LCM match the given values.\n4. **Validation During Traversal**: During DFS, validate that the derived values meet the constraints of GCD and LCM for each edge. If any inconsistency is found, return \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        v = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        g = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        l = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        if l % g != 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n        k = l // g\n        edges.append((u, v, g, l, k))\n        graph[u].append((v, g, l, k))\n        graph[v].append((u, g, l, k))\n\n    result = [None] * n\n\n    def dfs(node, val):\n        if result[node] is not None:\n            return result[node] == val\n        result[node] = val\n        for neighbor, g, l, k in graph[node]:\n            if result[neighbor] is None:\n                x = val // g\n                y = k // x\n                if math.gcd(x, y) != 1 or x * y != k:\n                    return False\n                new_val = g * y\n                if not dfs(neighbor, new_val):\n                    return False\n            else:\n                other_val = result[neighbor]\n                if math.gcd(val, other_val) != g or (val * other_val) // math.gcd(val, other_val) != l:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if result[i] is None:\n            if i == 0:\n                # Try possible starting value\n                # We can choose any value that satisfies the first edge\n                # But since the first node has no constraints, we can choose any value.\n                # However, we need to find a consistent assignment.\n                # Let's try with 1 as the initial value, but we might need to adjust.\n                # Wait, but how?\n                # Actually, the first node's value can be set to g * x, where x is a factor of k for its edges.\n                # But without knowing the edges, it's hard to choose.
