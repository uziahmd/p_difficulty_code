Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the number of queries and the length of the string can be up to 1e5. Directly replacing the digits each time might be too slow if done naively because each replacement could take O(n) time for each query, leading to O(n^2) time overall which would be bad for large inputs.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to model the substitutions. Since each query replaces a digit with another string, and substitutions are applied in order, we need to track for each digit what it's currently replaced with. But the problem is that when a substitution is done, all occurrences of that digit in the current string are replaced. However, if we have multiple substitutions, like first replacing '2' with '00', then later replacing '0' with something else, the earlier substitution's result (the '0's) would be affected by the later substitution.\n\nWait, but the queries are processed in order. So each substitution affects the current state of the string. But if we process the substitutions directly on the string, for each query, replacing all instances of di with ti, then for n=1e5 and each query replacing a lot of characters, this could be O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let me think about how to represent the transformations.\n\nAn alternative idea: instead of tracking the actual string, track for each digit what it maps to. However, since substitutions can be chained, we need to track for each digit, the expansion of it through all the substitutions. For example, if we have a substitution sequence where 2→00, then 0→7, then when we process 2, it would expand to 00, which then expands to 77. So the mapping for 2 would be \"77\".\n\nBut how do we handle this? Because each substitution replaces a digit with a string, and when a substitution is applied, any existing mappings for that digit are overwritten. Wait, no. Each substitution is applied to the current string. So, for example, suppose we have a query that replaces '2' with '00', then a query that replaces '0' with '1'. Then, the original '2's in the initial string would become '00', which then become '11'.\n\nBut if we have another query that replaces '2' again, say with '3', then that would overwrite the previous substitution for '2' (but only if the query is processed after the previous ones). So the key is that each substitution is applied in the order given, and each substitution affects the current string.\n\nSo the problem is that if we process substitutions naively, replacing each occurrence in the string, it's going to be too slow for large n and large string sizes.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to model the substitutions in a way that allows us to compute the final value without actually expanding the entire string step by step.\n\nLet me think about using dynamic programming or some kind of memoization. For example, for each digit, we can track what it's currently expanded to. But when a substitution happens, we need to update that mapping.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each digit d, maintain a value that represents the expansion of d. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a substitution is made (d → t), we update the mapping for d to be t. But since t can contain digits that have their own mappings, we need to ensure that whenever we look up the expansion of a digit, we recursively expand all the substitutions that have been made so far.\n\nWait, but that might not work because when you substitute, say, d → t, and t contains digits that have their own substitutions, those substitutions may have been applied before or after this substitution. For example, suppose we first substitute 2→00, then substitute 0→1. Then, the expansion of 2 is 00, which would expand to 11. But if we first substitute 0→1, then 2→00, then the expansion of 2 is 00, which is 11 again. However, if we have substitutions that are applied in different orders, the expansion would be different.\n\nSo, the way to model this is that for each substitution, when we process it, we need to replace the current mapping of the digit d with the string t, but we need to make sure that any digits in t are already expanded according to the current mappings. Wait, no. Because the substitution is applied to the current string. So, when a substitution is applied, the current string is modified by replacing all instances of d with t.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The challenge is to manage these substitutions in a way that avoids the inefficiency of repeatedly modifying the entire string directly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Digits to Expansions**: Instead of modifying the string directly for each query, we maintain a mapping of each digit to its current expansion. This allows us to dynamically update how each digit is transformed based on subsequent queries.\n2. **Recursive Expansion**: When a substitution query is processed, we recursively expand the target string to ensure it reflects all previous substitutions. This ensures that any digit in the target string of a substitution is already expanded according to the latest mappings.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo $10^9 + 7$ during all operations to keep numbers manageable and prevent overflow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize the mapping: each digit maps to itself\n    # We'll store for each digit, the expansion as a string\n    # But for efficiency, we'll track the value mod MOD and the length\n    # However, since the expansion can be very long, we need to represent it as a string\n    # Wait, but calculating the number mod MOD directly is better.\n    # So, let's think differently: for each digit, we can track:\n    # - the value of the expansion as a number mod MOD\n    # - the length of the expansion (to handle leading zeros properly)\n    \n    # Wait, but leading zeros are not removed. However, the final number is considered as a decimal number with leading zeros ignored.\n    # But when you have a string like \"000\", it represents zero. So, the actual numeric value is 0.\n    # Therefore, perhaps we should track for each digit d, the numeric value of its expansion mod MOD, and also the length of the expansion (to handle leading zeros correctly).\n    # However, this seems complex. Another approach is to process the original string and for each character, expand it using the current mappings, then compute the number mod MOD as we go.\n    \n    # Let's think again: Each time we process a substitution, we need to update the mapping for that digit. For example, if we have '2' -> '00', then later '0' -> '1', then '2' should expand to '11'.\n    # Therefore, we need to represent for each digit, the expansion string, but with the substitutions applied recursively.\n    # However, storing the entire string for each digit may be memory-intensive for large expansions. But given the constraints (sum of ti lengths is 1e5), it's manageable.\n    \n    # So, we can have a dictionary called 'mappings', where each key is a digit (char), and the value is the string it expands to.\n    # Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n    mappings = {}\n    for d in '0123456789':\n        mappings[d] = d\n    \n    # Process each query\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        idx += 1\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        # Parse the query: di->ti\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n        # Update the mapping for d. However, we need to expand ti using current mappings.\n        # Because ti may contain digits that have been mapped already.\n        # So we need to replace any occurrence of digits in ti with their current mappings.\n        # Wait, no. Because when the query is processed, the substitution is applied to the current string.\n        # So when we replace 'd' with ti, the ti is as per the current state of the mappings. So, ti is a literal string, not expanded.\n        # Wait, no. The query says \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". So ti is the exact string to substitute. For example, if ti is \"00\", then it's substituted as is. But if later, 0 is replaced by something else, that will affect the current string.\n        # However, our approach is to track for each digit what it maps to. So when we process a query \"d->t\", we set mappings[d] = t. However, when we later expand a digit, we need to expand it recursively through the mappings.\n        # For example, if mappings['2'] is '00', and mappings['0'] is '1', then expanding '2' would give '11'.\n        # Therefore, when we want to get the expansion of a digit, we need to recursively expand it through the current mappings.\n        # Thus, the correct way to handle the substitution is to set mappings[d] = ti, but when we expand, we recursively expand the ti string using the current mappings.\n        # However, this could lead to infinite recursion if there's a cycle. But the problem states that the queries are applied in order, and each query replaces a digit with some string. There's no restriction on the queries, so cycles could exist. However, since the replacement is done in order, the mappings are updated step by step, and the expansion is done recursively, which may loop infinitely if there is a cycle.\n        # To avoid that, we need to memoize the expansion of each digit at the time of substitution.\n        # Alternatively, when processing a query, we can pre-process the ti string by expanding it using the current mappings. That way, the mappings[d] will be the fully expanded string at the time of the substitution. But this may not be correct because future substitutions could affect the ti string.\n        # For example, if we first substitute 2->00, then 0->1. Then, the expansion of 2 would be 00, which becomes 11. But if we had stored 00 in mappings[2], then when we later substitute 0, we would have to re-expand mappings[2] again.\n        # Therefore, the correct approach is to have for each digit, a function that returns the current expansion, which may involve recursively expanding other digits.\n        # However, this recursive expansion can be expensive if done naively.\n        \n        # To optimize, we can memoize the expansion of each digit. But since substitutions can change the mappings, the memoization needs to be reset when a mapping changes.\n        # However, for the purposes of this problem, we can proceed by building the expansion of the ti string at the time of the substitution, but not considering future substitutions. That is, when we set mappings[d] = ti, we do not expand ti at that time. Instead, when we need to expand a digit, we recursively expand its current mapping.\n        # This might lead to multiple expansions, but it's the correct way to model the substitutions as they are applied.\n        # So, for example, mappings['2'] = '00', and mappings['0'] = '1'. When we expand '2', we get '00', which expands to '11'.\n        # Therefore, during the final expansion of the original string, we need to recursively expand each digit using the current mappings.\n        \n        # So, for the purpose of the problem, we can proceed with maintaining the mappings as strings, and when expanding the original string, we recursively expand each character using the mappings.\n        # However, for large strings, this could be slow. So, we need an efficient way to compute the final value.\n        \n        # Let's think about how to compute the final value mod MOD.\n        # The idea is to process the original string character by character, expanding each character into its current mapping, and compute the number mod MOD.\n        # However, expanding each character recursively may be expensive if done naively. So, we need to find a way to compute the contribution of each expansion efficiently.\n        \n        # Let's think about dynamic programming. For each digit d, we can precompute two things:\n        # 1. The value of its expansion mod MOD.\n        # 2. The length of the expansion (number of digits), which is needed for computing the contribution of the expansion when added to the left or right of another number.\n        \n        # For example, if we have a number A with length L, and we append a number B with value V and length M, then the new value is (A * 10^M + B) mod MOD.\n        \n        # So, for each digit, we can store:\n        # - val: the value mod MOD of its expansion\n        # - len: the length of the expansion\n        \n        # When a substitution is made for digit d, we need to compute the val and len of the new expansion (ti) by expanding each character in ti using the current mappings.\n        \n        # So, here's the plan:\n        # - Maintain for each digit d, val[d] and len[d].\n        # - When processing a substitution query d -> ti, we compute the new val and len for d by expanding ti using the current val and len of each character in ti.\n        # - This way, even if ti contains other digits, their current val and len are used.\n        \n        # This approach allows us to compute the final value efficiently by processing the original string and using the val and len of each digit.\n        \n        # Let's implement this approach.\n        \n        # Initialize val and len for each digit\n        val = {}\n        length = {}\n        for d in '0123456789':\n            val[d] = int(d)\n            length[d] = 1\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for _ in range(n):\n            line = input[idx].strip()\n            idx += 1\n            if not line:\n                continue\n            parts = line.split('->')\n            d = parts[0]\n            ti = parts[1]\n            \n            # Compute the new value and length for d based on ti\n            new_val = 0\n            new_len = 0\n            for c in ti:\n                new_val = (new_val * 10 + val[c]) % MOD\n                new_len += length[c]\n            val[d] = new_val\n            length[d] = new_len\n        \n        # Now, compute the final value by expanding the original string s\n        result = 0\n        for c in s:\n            result = (result * pow(10, length[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n        \n        print(result)\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Each digit initially maps to itself, with its value and length set accordingly.\n2. **Query Processing**: For each substitution query, the new value and length of the target digit are computed by expanding the target string using the current mappings.\n3. **Final Calculation**: The original string is processed character by character, using the precomputed values and lengths to efficiently compute the final result modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is handled in linear time relative to the length of the target string, making the solution efficient even for large inputs.",

The length of the expansion (number of digits), which is needed for computing the contribution of the expansion when added to the left or right of another number.\n        \n        # For example, if we have a number A with length L, and we append a number B with value V and length M, then the new value is (A * 10^M + B) mod MOD.\n        \n        # So, for each digit, we can store:\n        # - val: the value mod MOD of its expansion\n        # - len: the length of the expansion\n        \n        # When a substitution is made for digit d, we need to compute the val and len of the new expansion (ti) by expanding each character in ti using the current mappings.\n        \n        # So, here's the plan:\n        # - Maintain for each digit d, val[d] and len[d].\n        # - When processing a substitution query d -> ti, we compute the new val and len for d by expanding ti using the current val and len of each character in ti.\n        # - This way, even if ti contains other digits, their current val and len are used.\n        \n        # This approach allows us to compute the final value efficiently by processing the original string and using the val and len of each digit.\n        \n        # Let's implement this approach.\n        \n        # Initialize val and len for each digit\n        val = {}\n        length = {}\n        for d in '0123456789':\n            val[d] = int(d)\n            length[d] = 1\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for _ in range(n):\n            line = input[idx].strip()\n            idx += 1\n            if not line:\n                continue\n            parts = line.split('->')\n            d = parts[0]\n            ti = parts[1]\n            \n            # Compute the new value and length for d based on ti\n            new_val = 0\n            new_len = 0\n            for c in ti:\n                new_val = (new_val * 10 + val[c]) % MOD\n                new_len += length[c]\n            val[d] = new_val\n            length[d] = new_len\n        \n        # Now, compute the final value by expanding the original string s\n        result = 0\n        for c in s:\n            result = (result * pow(10, length[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n        \n        print(result)\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
