    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain conditions based on the given A, B, C, D. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem states that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So the sides are ordered such that x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but since B ≤ y and y ≤ C, and B ≤ C), and z is between C and D. Also, the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition here is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides sorted in non-decreasing order, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.\n\nSo the main idea is to iterate over all possible x, y, z in their ranges, ensuring that x ≤ B, y ≥ B, z ≥ C, etc., and count those triplets where x + y > z. However, directly iterating through all possibilities would be too slow because the ranges can be up to 5e5. For example, if each range is 5e5 elements, then the total number of triplets would be O( (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1) ), which could be way too big for even 5e5^3 operations. So we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me break down the constraints again. The variables x, y, z must satisfy:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\nC ≤ z ≤ D\nand x ≤ y ≤ z (since x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z, so x ≤ y and y ≤ z automatically). Wait, no. Wait, x can be up to B, and y starts from B. So x can be ≤ B and y ≥ B. So x can be ≤ y. For example, x could be B and y is B. So x ≤ y. Similarly, since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, y ≤ z. Therefore, x ≤ y ≤ z always holds. So the triangle inequality is x + y > z.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all triplets (x, y, z) with x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D], and x + y > z.\n\nNow, how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the approach. For each possible x and y, find the number of z's that are in [C, D] and less than x + y. Because z must be ≥ C and ≤ D, but also z < x + y. So for each (x, y), the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. But since z must be ≥ C, the lower bound is C. So the count for z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how to compute this for all x and y?\n\nBut considering that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. So the total number of x and y pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). For each pair, we can compute the count of z's. However, if B and C are up to 5e5, then the number of pairs could be (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11, which is way too big. So this approach is not feasible for large inputs.\n\nWe need a smarter way. Let me think about how to precompute or find ranges for x and y that allow us to compute the count of z's quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can fix z and find the number of (x,y) pairs such that x + y > z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C], and y ≥ B, x ≤ B, etc. But again, for each z, how to compute the number of (x,y) pairs?\n\nBut z is in [C, D]. Let's consider that for a given z, the condition is x + y > z. Since x can be up to B, and y can be up to C. But since z is at least C, and y is at least B, which is ≤ C. Hmm.\n\nWait, for each z, the minimal value of x + y is when x is minimal and y is minimal. Since x ≥ A, y ≥ B. So x + y ≥ A + B. But z can be as low as C. So if A + B > C, then for z = C, all possible (x, y) pairs would satisfy x + y > z. But if A + B ≤ C, then for some z's, there may be no (x,y) pairs that satisfy the condition.\n\nBut how to proceed? Let's think again.\n\nLet me consider the variables. Since x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. For each possible (x, y), the required z's are those in [C, D] that are less than x + y. So the count for that (x,y) is the number of z's in [C, D] where z < x + y. Which is equivalent to z_max = min(D, x + y - 1). If z_max >= C, then the count is z_max - C + 1. Else zero.\n\nBut again, for large B and C, iterating all (x,y) pairs is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For fixed x and y, compute the number of z's. But how to aggregate this across all x and y?\n\nAlternatively, we can find for each possible sum s = x + y, the number of (x,y) pairs that produce this sum, and then for each s, compute how many z's are in [C, D] such that z < s. Then multiply the count of (x,y) pairs for that s by the count of z's for that s, and sum over all possible s.\n\nThis seems promising. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor all possible x and y (with x ∈ [A,B], y ∈ [B,C]), compute s = x + y. For each s, compute the number of (x,y) pairs that sum to s. Let's call this count as cnt[s].\n\nThen, for each s, the number of z's is max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, s-1) >= C. Otherwise zero. Let's call this value z_count(s).\n\nThen the total number of valid triangles is sum over all s (cnt[s] * z_count(s)).\n\nBut how to compute cnt[s] efficiently?\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (x, y) where x is between A and B, y is between B and C, and x + y = s. Then, for each s, we can calculate how many such pairs exist.\n\nBut how to compute this cnt[s] for all possible s?\n\nThe possible values of s range from (A + B) to (B + C). Because x can be as low as A and as high as B, and y can be as low as B and as high as C.\n\nSo the minimal s is A + B, and the maximum is B + C.\n\nFor each s in [A+B, B+C], we need to find the number of pairs (x, y) with x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], and x + y = s.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of x and y as variables. For a given s, the number of pairs (x, y) such that x + y = s is equal to the number of x in [A, B] such that y = s - x is in [B, C].\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], check if s - x is in [B, C]. The count for this x is 1 if yes, else 0. Summing over x gives the total cnt[s].\n\nBut again, doing this for each s would take O((B - A + 1) * (B + C - A - B + 1)) time, which is O(B * (C - A + 1))? Not sure. But again, if B and C are up to 5e5, then the range of s is up to 1e6, and for each s, checking all x's is O(B) per s, leading to O(1e6 * 5e5) operations, which is 5e11 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWe need a better approach. Let's think of how to compute the number of pairs (x, y) for a given s.\n\nLet me rephrase the constraints:\n\nx ∈ [A, B]\n\ny ∈ [B, C]\n\nx + y = s → y = s - x\n\nSo for y to be in [B, C], we must have B ≤ s - x ≤ C → s - C ≤ x ≤ s - B.\n\nAdditionally, x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo combining these two, x must be in the intersection of [A, B] and [s - C, s - B].\n\nSo the valid x's are those in the interval [max(A, s - C), min(B, s - B)].\n\nBut wait, let me re-express:\n\nThe lower bound for x is max(A, s - C). Because y must be ≥ B → s - x ≥ B → x ≤ s - B. Also, y must be ≤ C → s - x ≤ C → x ≥ s - C.\n\nSo x must be ≥ s - C and ≤ s - B. Also, x must be between A and B.\n\nSo the valid x's are in the interval [L, R], where L = max(A, s - C), R = min(B, s - B).\n\nIf L > R, then there are no solutions for this s. Otherwise, the number of x's is R - L + 1.\n\nSo for each s, the count is max(0, R - L + 1) where R = min(B, s - B), L = max(A, s - C).\n\nSo this gives us a formula for cnt[s], which can be computed in O(1) per s.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Determine the range of s: from s_min = A + B to s_max = B + C.\n\n2. For each s in s_min to s_max:\n\n   a. Compute L = max(A, s - C)\n\n   b. Compute R = min(B, s - B)\n\n   c. if L > R: cnt[s] = 0\n\n   d. else: cnt[s] = R - L + 1\n\nOnce we have cnt[s] for all s, then for each s, compute the number of z's that are ≤ s-1 and ≥ C, and ≤ D.\n\nSo the z_count(s) is:\n\nif s - 1 < C → 0\n\nelse:\n\nupper_z = min(D, s - 1)\n\nlower_z = C\n\nif upper_z < lower_z → 0\n\nelse → upper_z - lower_z + 1\n\nSo for each s, the contribution to the total is cnt[s] * z_count(s).\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this sum over all s in s_min to s_max.\n\nThe question is, how efficient is this approach?\n\nThe range of s is from A + B to B + C. The maximum possible value of s_max is B + C. Since B and C are up to 5e5, the maximum s_max is 1e6. So the number of s's is up to around 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo for each s in that range, compute cnt[s], then compute z_count(s), multiply them, and accumulate the total. This should be feasible.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4.\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ns ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+3=5. So s can be 3,4,5.\n\nFor each s:\n\ns=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 3) = max(1,0) = 1.\n\nR = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) = 1.\n\nso L=1, R=1 → count is 1. So cnt[3] = 1.\n\nz_count(s=3) is the number of z in [3,4] where z < 3 → z must be <3. But since z starts at 3, there are zero. So contribution is 1 * 0 = 0.\n\ns=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4 - 3) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\nR = min(2, 4 - 2) = min(2, 2) = 2.\n\nso x ranges from 1 to 2. So cnt[s] = 2.\n\nz_count(s=4) is z must be <4. So z can be 3 (since 3 is in [3,4], and 3 <4. Also 4 is not less than 4. So upper_z = min(4, 4-1)=3. So z ranges from 3 to 3 → count is 1. So contribution is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\ns=5:\n\nL = max(1, 5 -3) = max(1, 2) = 2.\n\nR = min(2, 5 -2) = min(2, 3) = 2.\n\nso cnt[s] = 1.\n\nz_count(s=5): z must be <5. So upper_z = min(4, 5-1) = 4. So z ranges from 3 to 4 → count is 2. Contribution is 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nTotal sum is 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Which matches the first sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: '1 2 2 5' → Output is 3.\n\nLet me check.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ns ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+2=4. So s=3,4.\n\nFor s=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 2) = max(1,1) = 1.\n\nR = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) = 1. cnt=1.\n\nz_count(s=3) is z in [2,5] and <3. So z can be 2. So upper_z = min(5, 3-1)=2. lower_z=2. So count is 1. Contribution 1*1=1.\n\ns=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4-2)=2. R = min(2, 4-2)=2. cnt=1.\n\nz_count(s=4) is z <4. So upper_z = min(5, 3) =3. lower_z=2. So 3-2+1=2. Contribution 1*2=2. Total sum is 1+2=3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nA=B=C=D=500000.\n\ns ranges from 500000 + 500000 = 1,000,000 to 500000 + 500000 = 1,000,000. So only s=1e6.\n\nCompute for s=1e6:\n\nL = max(500000, 1e6 - 500000) → 1e6 - 5e5 = 5e5. So L is 5e5.\n\nR = min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → 1e6 - 5e5 = 5e5. So R is 5e5. So cnt[s] = 1.\n\nz_count(s=1e6) is z must be <1e6. Since z is in [5e5, 5e5], which is 5e5. So z must be <1e6. 5e5 is less than 1e6. So upper_z is min(5e5, 1e6-1) = 5e5. lower_z is 5e5. So count is 1. Contribution is 1 * 1 = 1. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nImplement the steps:\n\nLoop through s from s_min to s_max, compute for each s the cnt[s], then compute the z_count(s), multiply and add to total.\n\nBut how to compute s_min and s_max?\n\ns_min = A + B.\n\ns_max = B + C.\n\nBut what if A + B is larger than B + C? No, since A ≤ B ≤ C. So A + B ≤ B + B ≤ B + C. So s_min is A + B, s_max is B + C.\n\nSo the loop runs from s_min to s_max, inclusive.\n\nNow, for each s in this range:\n\nCalculate L = max(A, s - C)\n\nR = min(B, s - B)\n\nif L > R → cnt is 0.\n\nElse cnt is R - L + 1.\n\nThen compute for z_count:\n\nthe z must be in [C, D], and z < s → z can be from C to min(D, s-1).\n\nif min(D, s-1) < C → 0.\n\nElse, the count is (min(D, s-1) - C + 1).\n\nSo for each s, we can compute this.\n\nNow, the code needs to loop through all s in s_min to s_max. Let's see what the maximum possible s_max can be. Since B and C can be up to 5e5, s_max can be up to 1e6. So looping from 1e6 is manageable.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B.\n\ns_max = B + C.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n    # compute L and R for x in [A, B]\n\n    L = max(A, s - C)\n\n    R = min(B, s - B)\n\n    if L > R:\n\n        continue\n\n    cnt_s = R - L + 1\n\n    # compute z_count\n\n    upper_z = min(D, s - 1)\n\n    lower_z = C\n\n    if upper_z < lower_z:\n\n        z_cnt = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        z_cnt = upper_z - lower_z + 1\n\n    total += cnt_s * z_cnt\n\nreturn total\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, for s=3, upper_z is min(4, 3-1) = min(4, 2) = 2. lower_z is 3. So upper_z < lower_z → z_cnt is 0. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when s is very small, such that s - 1 < C? For example, if s is 3, and C is 3, then upper_z is 2, which is less than C=3 → z_cnt is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when s - B is larger than B? For example, s - B could be larger than B, but R is min(B, ...). So that's handled.\n\nNow, testing this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ns ranges from 3 to 5.\n\ns=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 3) = 1. R = min(2, 3-2) = 1. cnt_s = 1. upper_z = min(4, 2) = 2. lower_z = 3 → 2 < 3 → 0. So contribution 0.\n\ns=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4 -3) = 1. R = min(2, 4-2=2). cnt_s = 2. upper_z is min(4, 3) = 3. lower_z is 3. 3-3+1=1. 2*1=2.\n\ns=5: L = max(1, 5-3=2). R = min(2, 5-2=3) → 2. cnt_s=1. upper_z is min(4, 4) → 4. lower_z=3. 4-3+1=2. 1*2=2. Total is 0+2+2=4. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input 1 2 2 5. So A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ns ranges from 3 (1+2) to 4 (2+2).\n\ns=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3-2=1). R = min(2, 3-2=1). cnt_s=1. upper_z = min(5, 3-1=2). lower_z=2. So upper_z is 2, which equals lower_z. So z_cnt=1. Contribution 1*1=1.\n\ns=4: L = max(1, 4-2=2). R = min(2, 4-2=2). cnt_s=1. upper_z = min(5, 4-1=3). lower_z=2. 3-2+1=2. 1*2=2. Total is 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample: A=B=C=D=500000. s_min = 1e6, s_max = 1e6. So s=1e6.\n\nL = max(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → max(5e5, 5e5) = 5e5.\n\nR = min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → min(5e5, 5e5) → 5e5. cnt_s = 1.\n\nupper_z = min(5e5, 1e6 -1) = 5e5. lower_z is 5e5. So z_cnt is 1. total is 1*1=1. Correct.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nBut what about edge cases?\n\nCase where C is larger than s - B?\n\nFor example, say A=1, B=2, C=5, D=10. Suppose s is 3. Then s-B is 1. So R is min(2, 1) = 1. L is max(1, 3 - 5 = -2) → 1. So cnt is 1. So x can be 1, y is 3 -1 = 2. Which is in [B, C] (since B=2, C=5). So yes.\n\nAnother case: when s - C is larger than B. For example, A=1, B=2, C=5, D=... Let's say s is 10. Then s - C = 10 -5=5. L = max(1,5) =5. But B is 2. So L=5 > R= min(2, 10 - 2=8) → R=2. So L > R → cnt is 0. So no pairs for this s.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nNow, the code's time complexity is O(s_max - s_min + 1). What's the maximum value of s_max - s_min + 1?\n\ns_max is B + C, s_min is A + B. So difference is (B + C) - (A + B) = C - A. Since A can be as low as 1 and C up to 5e5, the maximum is 5e5. So the loop runs O(5e5) times, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is efficient enough for the constraints.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for the case where s_min is larger than s_max? No, since A ≤ B ≤ C. So A + B ≤ B + C. So s_min ≤ s_max.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input. The input is multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is four integers A, B, C, D. The sample input shows multiple lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The first line contains four integers... So it's one test case. But the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the actual input is multiple lines, each line being a test case. For example, the first line of input is four integers, then another line, etc. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nWait, but the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem's input description says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is presented as multiple test cases, but the actual input is one line per test case. So the code should read all lines from input, process each as a separate test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as four integers. So maybe the code should read one line, but in the sample input, there are three lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nSo the code needs to read all lines from stdin, split each into four integers, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the user provides three lines, each with four numbers, and the code outputs three lines with the answers.\n\nSo the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case.\n\nIn Python, that would be done by reading all lines from stdin, then for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute answer and print\n\nBut need to handle possible leading/trailing spaces, etc.\n\nNow, the code for each test case is as discussed.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B.\n\ns_max = B + C.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n    L = max(A, s - C)\n\n    R = min(B, s - B)\n\n    if L > R:\n\n        continue\n\n    cnt_s = R - L + 1\n\n    upper_z = min(D, s - 1)\n\n    lower_z = C\n\n    if upper_z < lower_z:\n\n        z_cnt = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        z_cnt = upper_z - lower_z + 1\n\n    total += cnt_s * z_cnt\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, what if C is larger than s-1? For example, if s is small. For example, if s is 3, and C is 5. Then upper_z is min(D, 2), which is 2. lower_z is 5. So upper_z < lower_z → z_cnt is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing this code.\n\nAnother test case: A=2, B=2, C=2, D=2. Then s_min = 4, s_max = 4.\n\ns=4:\n\nL = max(2, 4 - 2) = max(2, 2) = 2.\n\nR = min(2, 4 - 2) = 2. cnt_s = 1.\n\nupper_z = min(2, 3) = 2. lower_z is 2. So z_cnt is 1. total is 1 → which is correct (triangle 2,2,2).\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1. Then s_min = 2, s_max = 2. s=2.\n\nL = max(1, 2-1=1) → 1.\n\nR = min(1, 2 - 1=1) → 1. cnt_s = 1.\n\nupper_z = min(1, 1) → 1. lower_z = 1. z_cnt is 1. total is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=3. s ranges from 2 (1+1) to 1 + 2 = 3.\n\ns=2:\n\nL = max(1, 2 - 2 = 0) → 1. R = min(1, 2 - 1 = 1). So cnt_s = 1. upper_z is min(3, 1) → 1. lower_z is 2. 1 < 2 → 0. So contribution 0.\n\ns=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 2 = 1). R = min(1, 3 - 1 = 2) → 1. cnt_s = 1. upper_z = min(3, 3-1=2). lower_z is 2. So upper_z is 2. 2-2+1=1. contribution 1*1=1. total is 1.\n\nSo the answer is 1. Which corresponds to (x=1, y=1, z=2). Check if 1 + 1 > 2 → 2>2? No. Wait, that's not valid. Wait, this is a problem!\n\nWait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the code counts for s = x + y. For the triangle inequality, x + y > z. But in this case, s is x + y = 3, and z is 2. So 3 > 2 → yes. So the triangle (1, 1, 2) would be considered. But that's a degenerate triangle. Wait, no. Wait, the triangle is non-degenerate if x + y > z. For (1,1,2), 1+1 = 2, which is not greater than 2. So this is a degenerate triangle. But according to our code, for s=3, z can be up to 2 (since s-1 is 2). So the code counts this as valid. But this is wrong.\n\nWait, this is a problem! What's happening here?\n\nAh, here's a mistake in the logic. The code is counting z < s (i.e., z <= s-1). But the triangle inequality requires x + y > z. Since x + y is s, then z must be < s. So z can be up to s-1. So for z in [C, D], the code checks if z is less than s. So in the example above, z is 2, which is less than s=3. So the code counts it. But for x=1, y=1, z=2, the sum x + y is 2, which equals z. So this is a degenerate triangle. So why is the code counting it?\n\nBecause the code is using the condition x + y > z. But in this case, x + y is s, and z is less than s. So z is strictly less than s. So x + y = s > z. So the code is correct. Wait, but in the example, s is 3, and z is 2. So 3 > 2 → yes. So the triangle (1, 1, 2) would be counted. But in reality, this is a degenerate triangle. Wait no, the problem says that the triangle is non-degenerate if and only if the vertices are not collinear. Which is equivalent to x + y > z, given that x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nWait, in this example, x=1, y=1, z=2. Since x ≤ y ≤ z, the triangle inequality is x + y > z. Here, 1+1 = 2 is not greater than z=2. So this is a degenerate triangle. But according to the code's logic, z is 2 and s is 3. So 3 > 2 → yes. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh no! There's a mistake here. The code is using s = x + y. And the condition is z < s. But for z to satisfy x + y > z, z must be less than x + y. So the code is correct. But in this case, x + y is 2, not 3. Wait, what's s here?\n\nWait, in the example, x is 1, y is 1. So x + y is 2. So s is 2, not 3. But earlier analysis said that s is 3. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the example. Let me recheck.\n\nIn this example, A=1, B=1, C=2, D=3.\n\ns_min = A + B = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ns_max = B + C = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo for s in 2 and 3.\n\nLet me check for s=2:\n\nL = max(A, s - C) = max(1, 2 - 2 = 0) → 1.\n\nR = min(B, s - B) → min(1, 2 - 1 = 1) → 1. So cnt_s is 1. So x=1, y= s - x = 2 - 1 = 1. Which is in [B, C] (B=1, C=2). So yes. So for this s=2, the code computes upper_z = min(3, 2-1=1) → 1. lower_z is 2. So upper_z is 1 < 2 → z_cnt=0. So contribution is 0.\n\nFor s=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 2 = 1). R = min(1, 3 - 1 = 2) → 1. cnt_s is 1. x=1, y=3 -1 = 2. Which is in [B=1, C=2]. So yes. Now, upper_z is min(3, 3-1=2) → 2. lower_z is 2. So z_cnt is 2-2+1=1. So contribution is 1*1=1. So total is 1.\n\nSo the code counts this case. What is the triangle here? x=1, y=2, z=2. So the sides are 1, 2, 2. Which satisfies 1+2>2 (3>2). So it's a valid non-degenerate triangle. Oh right! So my previous example was wrong. I had thought that x=1, y=1, z=2, but in reality, when s=3, x=1, y=2. So the triangle is (1,2,2). Which is valid. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the previous confusion was due to a miscalculation. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: x=1, y=1, z=2. How would that be counted? Well, in that case, x + y = 2. So s=2. For s=2, upper_z is min(D, s-1) = min(3, 1) =1. lower_z is 2. So no contribution. So that case is not counted. Which is correct, as it's a degenerate triangle.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=2, B=2, C=3, D=3. So possible triangles:\n\nx=2, y can be 2 or 3. z can be 3.\n\nCheck for x=2, y=2, z=3: 2+2>3 → 4>3 → yes. Valid.\n\nx=2, y=3, z=3: 2+3>3 → yes.\n\nSo total of 2 triangles.\n\nLet's see what the code computes.\n\ns_min = 2+2=4. s_max = 2",
