Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover half of that gap, right? Because the worst case is that the gap is between two lanterns, and the middle point of that gap would require the radius to reach halfway.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at position 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street. So the steps might be:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d must be at least that distance.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). Again, d must be at least that.\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum of these distances divided by 2 is the required d for those gaps. Because the middle of the gap would be the farthest point from either lantern, so each lantern would need to cover half of that gap.\n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum between the first segment (from 0 to first lantern), the last segment (from last lantern to l), and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Then, the maximum between the first and last segments would be the required d. Because the lantern's coverage has to reach both ends.\n\nLet me think through an example. Take the second sample input: 2 5 with lanterns at 2 and 5. The first lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 to 2 is 2. The last lantern is at 5, which is the end of the street. So the last segment is 0. The gaps between consecutive lanterns is 5-2=3. Divided by two is 1.5. But the answer is 2.0. Oh wait, why?\n\nAh, because in that case, the first lantern's coverage needs to reach from 0 to 2. So the radius must be at least 2. The second lantern covers from 5-2=3 to 5. But the gap between the two lanterns is 3 units. The middle of that gap is at 2 + 3/2 = 3.5. The distance from the first lantern is 1.5, and from the second lantern is 1.5. So the required radius would be 1.5. But according to the sample input, the answer is 2.0. Wait, that contradicts. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample input says that for input 2 5, the lanterns are at 2 and 5. The output is 2.0. Let me check the note. The note says that with d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4], and the second covers [3,5]. So the whole street is covered. But according to the previous calculation, the maximum gap between the two lanterns is 5-2=3. So half of that is 1.5. So why is the answer 2?\n\nOh! Because the first lantern is at 2. The distance from the first lantern to the start is 2. So the required d is max(2, (gap between lanterns)/2, (distance from last lantern to end)). In this case, the gap between the two lanterns is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. The distance from the first lantern to start is 2, and the last lantern is at 5, which is the end of the street. So the max is 2. Hence the answer is 2.0. So my initial approach was correct. So the steps are:\n\nSort the lanterns, then check the first and last positions. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. The maximum of (first lantern's position - 0, l - last lantern's position, max_gap_between_consecutive / 2) is the answer.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance from 0 to the first lantern (a[0]).\n- Compute the distance from the last lantern to l (l - a[-1]).\n- Then, iterate through the sorted array and compute the differences between consecutive elements. Find the maximum difference. Then",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the minimum light radius required for all points on a street to be illuminated by lanterns, we can follow a systematic approach based on the positions of the lanterns and the length of the street.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach Overview**\n\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: The lanterns may be given in any order, so we first sort them to analyze the gaps between consecutive ones efficiently.\n2. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The distance from the start (0) to the first lantern.\n   - The distance from the last lantern to the end (l).\n3. **Middle Gaps**:\n   - For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them.\n   - The worst-case scenario for these middle gaps is that the farthest point lies at the midpoint of the two lanterns. Thus, the required radius is half the gap.\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The required radius `d` is the **maximum** among:\n     - Distance from start to first lantern.\n     - Distance from last lantern to end.\n     - Half of the largest gap between any two consecutive lanterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, l = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        a = list(map(int, data[data.index(line)+1].strip().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        \n        max_gap = 0\n        if n > 1:\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n                if gap > max_gap:\n                    max_gap = gap\n        \n        # Compute distances from ends\n        first = a[0]\n        last = a[-1]\n        d_start = first\n        d_end = l - last\n        \n        if n == 1:\n            d = max(d_start, d_end)\n        else:\n            d = max(d_start, d_end, max_gap / 2)\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Key Points**\n\n- **Sorting** ensures that we can easily find the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Handling Edge Cases** ensures that the start and end of the street are properly covered.\n- **Max Gap Handling** accounts for the worst-case lighting requirement between two lanterns.\n- **Precision** is handled using Python's formatting to ensure 10 decimal places, satisfying the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis solution is efficient, with a time complexity dominated by sorting the lanterns, which is $O(n \\log n)$, and is suitable for the given constraints.",
