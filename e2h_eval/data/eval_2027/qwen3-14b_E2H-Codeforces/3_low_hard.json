Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum radius d that the lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment around it with radius d. We need to find the minimal d such that all points on the street are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. First, the key idea is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Because the largest gap between two adjacent lanterns would determine the required radius. But wait, because each lantern's coverage is a circle of radius d. So for two adjacent lanterns, the maximum distance between them would be covered by the two lanterns. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose two lanterns are at positions a and b, with a < b. The distance between them is (b - a). The middle point between them is at (a + b)/2. The maximum distance from either lantern to this middle point is (b - a)/2. So if we have this as the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, then the required d would be half of that gap. Because each lantern's coverage must reach at least to that middle point. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d for that pair is (gap)/2. The maximum of all these values would be the minimal d needed.\n\nBut wait, there's also the case of the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at position 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would need to be covered by that lantern's radius. Similarly for the end of the street. So the initial step is to sort the lantern positions. Then, check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to the end (l). Also, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. That's a candidate for max_d (the required d).\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to l. Another candidate.\n4. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The required d for that gap is (gap)/2. So compare that with the current max_d.\n5. The overall maximum among all these candidates is the minimal required d.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for the first part, the first lantern's coverage must reach from 0 to its position. So the distance is a1 - 0. Similarly for the last lantern, l - an. For the middle gaps, the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns would require that the d is half of that gap. Because the middle point between them would be the farthest point from both lanterns, so each lantern's coverage needs to reach that point. Hence, the required d for that gap is (gap)/2.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nSort the array of ai.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as the maximum between (a[0] - 0) and (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through the sorted array, for each consecutive pair, compute the difference, divide by 2, and compare with the current max_d.\n\nThe final max_d is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, if n=1 and l is some value. Then the lantern is at a certain position. Then the max distance is max(a[0], l - a[0]). Because the lantern's coverage has to reach from 0 to l. So the required d is the maximum between a[0] (distance from 0 to lantern) and l - a[0] (distance from lantern to end). Which is exactly what the code would compute.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, they become [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nCheck the first part: 0 - 0 is 0. The last part is 15 -15 =0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2.5. Which is the answer. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 5",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that there are `n` lanterns placed at various positions along the street. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`). These distances are initial candidates for the required radius.\n3. **Check Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum required radius for these gaps is half the size of the largest gap, as the farthest point in the gap from either lantern is at the midpoint of the gap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first part\n    first = a[0]\n    max_d = max(max_d, first - 0)\n    \n    # Check the last part\n    last = a[-1]\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - last)\n    \n    # Check between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to sequentially check the gaps between each pair of consecutive lanterns.\n- **Endpoint Checks**: The first and last lanterns might not be at the ends of the street, so we need to ensure their coverage extends to the start and end of the street, respectively.\n- **Gap Analysis**: The largest gap between consecutive lanterns determines the required radius because the midpoint of the largest gap will be the farthest point from either lantern, necessitating a radius of half the gap's size to cover it.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal radius required by considering all critical points where coverage might be insufficient, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting.",
