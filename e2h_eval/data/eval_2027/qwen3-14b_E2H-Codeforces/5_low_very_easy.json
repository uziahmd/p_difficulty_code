Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to pair left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The colors can be letters or question marks, which are wildcards. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs and output them.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to think about how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the approach.\n\nThe key here is that each left boot can be paired with a right boot if their colors are compatible. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and the right is 'a', or if one is '?', then they can be paired.\n\nBut since each boot can be used only once, we need to find a way to maximize the pairs. How?\n\nLet me think of this as a bipartite graph matching problem. But with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like maximum bipartite matching (like using DFS or BFS) would be too slow. So we need a greedy approach here.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to count the maximum possible pairs by considering the counts of each color and the wildcards.\n\nLet me think: for each color c (excluding '?'), the number of left boots with color c can be matched with the number of right boots with color c. Then, the remaining wildcards (left and right) can be matched with each other. But also, the wildcards can be used to match with specific colors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first pair all the non-wildcard colors. For example, for each color c, take min(number of left c's, number of right c's) and add that to the total. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired because their color didn't match), we can use the wildcards to pair them. However, since wildcards can match anything, the maximum possible would be the sum of the remaining left and right wildcards, but not exceeding the total number of available boots.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the wildcards can be used to pair with any other boots. So maybe the optimal approach is:\n\nFirst, process all the non-wildcard colors. For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, collect the leftover left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired). Then, pair the wildcards from left and right with the leftovers. Also, the wildcards can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Count the number of left and right boots for each color (excluding '?').\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z', the number of left boots with color c is l_count[c], and similarly for r_count[c].\n\nThen, for each color c, the number of pairs we can make is min(l_count[c], r_count[c]). We add this to the total. Then, subtract those from l_count and r_count. So after this step, l_count[c] and r_count[c] will be zero for some colors, but for others, they might have leftovers.\n\nBut wait, no. Let's think again. Suppose for color 'a', there are 3 left boots and 2 right boots. Then we can pair 2 left and 2 right. The remaining left 'a' is 1, and the right 'a' is 0. So after processing all colors, the leftover left boots are those that couldn't be paired with their corresponding right ones.\n\nThen, the next step is to handle the wildcards. The wildcards can be used to pair with any of the leftover boots.\n\nSo, for the left boots that are '?', they can be paired with any of the right boots that are not yet paired (either because they are specific colors or they are '?'). Similarly for right boots that are '?'.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the leftover left and right boots.\n\nAfter the first step, we have:\n\nFor each color c (non-?), l_left[c] = number of left boots with color c that couldn't be paired with right boots of same color. Similarly for r_left[c].\n\nAdditionally, there are left_wildcards = number of left '?' boots, and right_wildcards = number of right '?' boots.\n\nNow, the wildcards can be used to pair with the leftover specific colors. For example, a left wildcard can be paired with a right boot of color 'a' (if that right boot hasn't been paired yet). Similarly, a right wildcard can be paired with a left boot of color 'a'.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here?\n\nThe idea is to pair as many as possible between the wildcards and the leftovers. Let's think of it as:\n\nThe total number of available left boots that can be matched with wildcards is the sum of l_left[c] for all c, plus the left_wildcards. Similarly",
