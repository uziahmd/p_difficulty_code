Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The colors can be specific letters or question marks, which are wildcards. \n\nFirst, I need to think about how to maximize the pairs. Let me think about the approach.\n\nThe key idea here is to match the boots in such a way that we use as many specific color matches as possible, and then use the question marks to fill in the remaining spots. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me break it down. For each left boot and right boot, there are certain compatibility conditions. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and the right is 'a', they can be paired. If left is 'a' and right is '?', they can be paired. Similarly, if left is '?', and right is 'a', same thing. Also, two question marks can be paired.\n\nBut since each boot can only be used once, we need to find an optimal way to pair them.\n\nHmm. One approach could be:\n\n1. First, match all left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color. For example, for each color c, count the number of left boots with c and right boots with c. The minimum of these counts would be the number of possible direct matches. Then subtract those from the counts of left and right boots for that color.\n\nWait, but maybe we should process this in a way that we pair as many as possible. However, after that, we have left some left boots and right boots with question marks or other colors. Then, we need to pair the remaining ones using the question marks.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n- For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots with that color and the number of right boots with that color. For each color, the number of pairs we can make is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). These are direct matches. We can add these to our total.\n\nBut then, after that, we have left boots and right boots that are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched (because there were more lefts than rights or vice versa). Then, we need to pair the remaining boots using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to handle the remaining ones? For example, suppose we have some left boots with '?', and some right boots with '?', and also some left boots with specific colors that couldn't be matched (like if there were more lefts than rights for that color). Similarly for rights.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots where at least one of them is a '?'. But how to maximize this?\n\nWait, the '?' can be matched with any other boot. So, perhaps we can collect all the left boots that are not yet matched and have color '?', and all the right boots that are not yet matched and have color '?', and pair them. But also, we can pair left '?' with right non-'?', and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do this optimally? For example, if there are left '?' and right non-'?', pairing them would be better than leaving them unpaired. But since the '?' can be used to match with any, perhaps the best way is to first pair as many as possible between left '?' and right non-'?', then between right '?' and left non-'?', and finally pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already paired?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nOnce we've done the initial matching of same-color pairs (excluding '?'), we have some left and right boots left. Let me think of the remaining left boots as:\n\nLeft_remaining: list of left boots that are not yet matched. Similarly for right_remaining.\n\nThese can be of two types: specific colors or '?'.\n\nNow, for the remaining boots, we can pair them in the following way:\n\nFor each left boot that is not a '?', we can check if there's a right boot that is a '?'. If so, pair them. Similarly for right boots that are not '?', pair with left '?'.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAnother approach is to collect all the left '?'s and right '?'s. Then, for the non-'?' left and right boots, we can pair them with the opposite side's '?'s.\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal way is to pair all the left non-'?' boots with right '?'s, and all the right non-'?' boots with left '?'s. Then, pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the steps again.\n\nStep 1: Pair all same-color non-'?' boots. For example, for each color c (not '?'), take the min of left count and right count, and pair those. Then, subtract those from the counts.\n\nBut how to track",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color represented by a question mark ('?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that their colors are compatible, with the constraint that each boot can only be used once in a pair.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Direct Matches**: First, we match left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color. This ensures that we use as many direct matches as possible.\n2. **Indefinite Matches**: After handling direct matches, we handle the remaining boots using question marks. We pair left boots with question marks to right boots with specific colors and vice versa. Finally, we pair the remaining question marks between left and right boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # For each color, track the indices of left and right boots\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    left_color = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        c = l[i]\n        if c != '?':\n            left_color[c].append(i)\n        else:\n            left_color['?'].append(i)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        c = r[i]\n        if c != '?':\n            right_color[c].append(i)\n        else:\n            right_color['?'].append(i)\n\n    # Step 1: Match same color (excluding '?')\n    pairs = []\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n\n    for c in left_color:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        if c not in right_color:\n            continue\n        left_list = left_color[c]\n        right_list = right_color[c]\n        min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(min_len):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n            used_left.add(left_idx)\n            used_right.add(right_idx)\n\n    # Now collect remaining left and right boots\n    remaining_left = []\n    remaining_right = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i not in used_left:\n            remaining_left.append(l[i])\n        else:\n            pass\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i not in used_right:\n            remaining_right.append(r[i])\n        else:\n            pass\n\n    # Now, we need to collect the indices of the remaining boots\n    # So better approach is to track which indices are used\n\n    # Create new lists for remaining left and right boots\n    # For left, collect all indices not in used_left\n    remaining_left_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i not in used_left:\n            remaining_left_indices.append((i, l[i]))\n    # Similarly for right\n    remaining_right_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i not in used_right:\n            remaining_right_indices.append((i, r[i]))\n\n    # Now, process remaining_left_indices and remaining_right_indices\n\n    # Create two separate lists:\n    # Left_question: list of left indices with '?'\n    # Left_other: list of left indices with non-?\n    left_question = []\n    left_other = []\n    for idx, c in remaining_left_indices:\n        if c == '?':\n            left_question.append(idx)\n        else:\n            left_other.append(idx)\n\n    # Similarly for right\n    right_question = []\n    right_other = []\n    for idx, c in remaining_right_indices:\n        if c == '?':\n            right_question.append(idx)\n        else:\n            right_other.append(idx)\n\n    # Now, match left_other with right_question\n    for l_idx in left_other:\n        if right_question:\n            r_idx = right_question.pop(0)\n            pairs.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n            used_left.add(l_idx)\n            used_right.add(r_idx)\n\n    # Then match right_other with left_question\n    for r_idx in right_other:\n        if left_question:\n            l_idx = left_question.pop(0)\n            pairs.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n            used_left.add(l_idx)\n            used_right.add(r_idx)\n\n    # Finally, match remaining left_question and right_question\n    # Take min of the two\n    min_len = min(len(left_question), len(right_question))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        l_idx = left_question[i]\n        r_idx = right_question[i]\n        pairs.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective colors.\n2. **Color Tracking**: We use dictionaries to track the indices of left and right boots based on their colors.\n3. **Direct Matches**: We first match boots with the same specific color, excluding question marks.\n4. **Remaining Boots Handling**: After direct matches, we handle remaining boots by pairing non-question mark boots with question marks and finally pairing remaining question marks between left and right boots.\n5. **Output**: The results are printed, ensuring each boot is used at most once in a pair.",
