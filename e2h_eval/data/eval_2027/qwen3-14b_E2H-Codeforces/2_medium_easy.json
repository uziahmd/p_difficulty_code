Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grid is n x n, where n is odd. The diagonals are the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all elements not on these diagonals must be the same, but different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut wait, how do I check the non-diagonal elements? For each cell (i,j), if it's not on either diagonal, then it must be equal to the non-diagonal character.\n\nSo, first, I need to collect all the characters on the diagonals and check they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to check if a cell is on either diagonal?\n\nFor a cell (i, j) in 0-based index:\n\n- It's on the main diagonal if i == j.\n- It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo for each cell, if either of those conditions is true, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. If yes, check that it's equal to the diagonal character (which is the first one encountered, maybe? Or maybe all of them must be same as each other).\n- For non-diagonal cells, check they are all same and different from the diagonal character.\n\nBut how to handle the first part? For example, collect all the diagonal characters and check they are all same. Similarly for non-diagonal.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\n- Collect all characters from the diagonals into a set. If the size of the set is not 1, then return NO.\n- Collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If the size is not 1, return NO.\n- Then check that the two sets are different (the diagonal's character is different from the non-diagonal's).\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Well, since n is at least 3, for example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but overlapping in the center. So the non-diagonal elements would be 3*3 - 3 -3 +1 = 9-5=4 elements. So for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal elements.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Check that all diagonal elements are the same. Let's call this d_char.\n2. Check that all non-diagonal elements are the same. Let's call this nd_char.\n3. Check that d_char != nd_char.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n, then n lines of n characters each.\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nCheck if it is on a diagonal. For that, check if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nSo for each cell in the grid:\n\nif (i == j) or (i + j == n-1): it's part of the diagonals.\n\nElse: part of non-diagonals.\n\nSo, collect all the diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut for the diagonals, we need to check that all are same. Similarly for non-diagonals.\n\nSo:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for j in 0..n-1:\n\n      if (i == j) or (i +j == n-1):\n\n          diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n      else:\n\n          non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, there are 3*3 - (number of diagonal elements). For n=3, the number of diagonal elements is 3 + 3 -1 = 5 (since the center cell is counted in both diagonals). So non-diagonal elements are 9-5=4. So for n >=3, non-diagonal elements exist. So the non_diagonal_chars will not be empty.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nBut how to get the grid?\n\nIn Python, read n, then read n lines. Each line is a string of length n.\n\nSo, for example, for input:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the grid is:\n\nrow 0: x o o o x\n\nrow 1: o x o x o\n\nrow 2: s o x o o\n\nrow 3: o x o x o\n\nrow 4: x o o o x\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == 4 (since n is 5, n-1 is 4).\n\nFor example, cell (0,0) is on main diagonal. Cell (0,4) is on anti-diagonal. Cell (2,2) is on both.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the diagonal has multiple characters? Like, some are different. Then len(diagonal_chars) is more than 1. So that's invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\nLooking at each cell (i,j):\n\nFor i=0, j=0: x (diagonal)\n\nj=4: x (diagonal)\n\ni=1, j=1: x (diagonal)\n\nj=3: x (diagonal)\n\ni=2, j=2: x (diagonal)\n\ni=3, j=3: x (diagonal)\n\ni=4, j=4: x (diagonal)\n\nWait, but for i=2, j=2 is on both diagonals. But in the third row (i=2), the string is 'soxoo'. So grid[2][2] is 'x'? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input line for sample 1 is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\nSo the third line is 'soxoo', which is row 2 (assuming 0-based). So j=0: 's', j=1: 'o', j=2: 'x', j=3: 'o', j=4: 'o'.\n\nSo for i=2, j=2 is 'x', which is part of the diagonal. So the diagonals in this case are all x's? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first row (i=0): x o o o x → the first and last are x.\n\nSecond row (i=1): o x o x o → positions j=1 and j=3 are x.\n\nThird row (i=2): s o x o o → j=2 is x.\n\nFourth row (i=3): o x o x o → j=1 and j=3 are x.\n\nFifth row (i=4): x o o o x → j=0 and j=4 are x.\n\nSo all the diagonal elements are x. So diagonal_chars is {'x'}.\n\nWhat about non-diagonal elements?\n\nLooking at the first row, positions j=1,2,3: o, o, o. So in the first row, non-diagonal elements are o's.\n\nSecond row, positions j=0,2,4: o, o, o. So o's.\n\nThird row: positions j=0,1,3,4: s, o, o, o. So s, o, o, o. So non-diagonal elements here include s and o. So the non_diagonal_chars would include s and o. Therefore, the set would have size 2, so the answer is NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO for the first case.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0: w (main diagonal)\n\ni=0, j=2: w (anti-diagonal)\n\ni=1, j=1: w (both diagonals)\n\ni=2, j=0: w (anti-diagonal?)\n\nWait, for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2. n is 3, n-1 is 2. So yes, it's on the anti-diagonal.\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is i=2, j=2: i==j. So yes. So the diagonals are:\n\nAll the cells (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). What are their characters?\n\nRow 0: w s w → (0,0) is w, (0,2) is w.\n\nRow 1: s w s → (1,1) is w.\n\nRow 2: w s w → (2,0) is w, (2,2) is w.\n\nSo all diagonals are w. So diagonal_chars is {w}.\n\nNon-diagonal elements are:\n\ncells (0,1): s; (1,0): s; (1,2): s; (2,1): s.\n\nSo non_diagonal_chars is {s}. So the two sets are different. So output YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input is 3:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x; (2,2) e.\n\nSo the diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So the diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2. So condition fails. So output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nBut wait, in the third sample, the diagonals are not all same. So the code would catch that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal elements are same as diagonal elements?\n\nLike, suppose all elements are same. Then, the diagonals are same, non-diagonals are same, but same as diagonals. So the code would check that the two sets are different. So in that case, the code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'b'. Then output YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'a' → output NO.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to read the input. However, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines of n characters.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, when the code is run, the input comes from stdin. So for example, the first input line is n, then n lines.\n\nSo in Python, the code should read n from input, then read n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, the first input is something like:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the code would read n as 5, then read 5 lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen process as above.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, the number of non-diagonal elements is 3*3 - (3 + 3 -1) = 9 -5=4. So non_diagonal_chars will have elements. So for n >=3, the non_diagonal_chars is not empty.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut in the code, for n=3, the code works.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: the first input is 5, and the grid as described. The code would collect diagonal_chars as {'x'}, non_diagonal_chars includes 's' and 'o' (from the third row's first element, which is 's'). So len(non_diagonal_chars) is 2, so output NO.\n\nSample 2: the grid is 3x3 with wsw, sws, wsw. The code collects diagonals as {'w'}, non-diagonal as {'s'}, so output YES.\n\nSample 3: 3x3 grid with xpx, pxp, xpe. The diagonals are (0,0)=x, (0,2)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,0)=x, (2,2)=e. So diagonal_chars is {x, e}, len is 2. So output NO.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the first sample, the non_diagonal_chars includes 's' and 'o'?\n\nYes. Let's think: in the third row (i=2), the first element (j=0) is 's'. That's part of the anti-diagonal (i + j = 2 + 0 = 2, which is n-1=5-1=4? Wait no, n=5, so n-1=4. Wait for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2, which is not equal to 4. So that cell is not on the anti-diagonal. Wait, what's the code doing here?\n\nWait, for n=5, the anti-diagonal is i + j = 4. So for cell (i,j) to be on anti-diagonal, i + j = 4.\n\nSo for i=2, j=0: 2+0=2 !=4. So that cell is not on any diagonal. So in the first sample, the third row (i=2) is 'soxoo'.\n\nSo for i=2, j=0: s. Not on any diagonal. So added to non_diagonal_chars. Similarly, j=1: o, not on diagonal. j=2: x (on diagonal). j=3: o, not on diagonal. j=4: o, not on diagonal. So in this row, the non-diagonal elements are s, o, o, o. So the non_diagonal_chars would include s, o. So the set has size 2. Hence, the code returns NO.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when all non-diagonal elements are same as diagonal. For example, n=3, all cells are 'a'. Then diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'a'. So the code checks if the two sets are different. Since they are same, returns NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are all 'a', non-diagonals are all 'b'. Then returns YES.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, this code should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all elements on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other elements (not on the diagonals) must be the same but different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Elements Collection**: Traverse each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it lies on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal or anti-diagonal). Collect characters from these diagonals into one set and characters from non-diagonal cells into another set.\n3. **Validation**: Check if both sets contain exactly one unique character each, and ensure that the characters from the diagonals and non-diagonals are different.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first input line is the integer `n`, which denotes the size of the grid. The subsequent `n` lines are read as strings representing the grid rows.\n2. **Traversing the Grid**: For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid, we determine if it lies on the main diagonal (`i == j`) or the anti-diagonal (`i + j == n - 1`). Characters on these diagonals are collected into `diagonal_chars`.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Elements**: Characters not on either diagonal are collected into `non_diagonal_chars`.\n4. **Validation Checks**: \n   - If `diagonal_chars` and `non_diagonal_chars` each contain exactly one unique character, and these characters are different, the grid forms an 'X', so we print \"YES\".\n   - Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring clarity and correctness with a time complexity of O(n²), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
