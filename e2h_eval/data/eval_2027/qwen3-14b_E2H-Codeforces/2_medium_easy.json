Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for a grid of size n x n where n is odd. The main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left.\n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. Because for a zero-based index, the sum of indices for the anti-diagonal would be n-1. For example, in a 3x3 grid, positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) sum to 2 (which is 3-1).\n\nSo, first, I need to collect all the characters on the two diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Also, check that all the non-diagonal cells are the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping cells? Like, the center cell (i = j = n//2) is part of both diagonals. So when collecting the diagonal characters, we need to make sure that we don't count duplicates. But for checking, all the diagonal cells (including the center) must have the same character. So for example, in the case of the center cell, it's part of both diagonals, but it's only one cell. So the code needs to check that all cells in the two diagonals are same.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n2. Check all the cells in the two diagonals. Collect all their characters. All of them must be the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n3. Then, check all the other cells (not on either diagonal). Collect all their characters. All of them must be the same, and different from 'd_char'.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell (i,j):\n\n- if it's on either diagonal, check if it's equal to d_char. But first, we need to determine what d_char is. Wait, but how do we get d_char? Well, the first diagonal cell (like (0,0)) must be the same as all others. So perhaps, we can take the first diagonal cell's value as the candidate, then check all other diagonal cells against it. But what if the first diagonal cell is not the same as others? Then the answer is NO.\n\nBut how to collect all the diagonal characters. Let's think:\n\nInitialize a set for the diagonal characters. For each cell in the diagonals, add their character to the set. Then, if the size of the set is not 1, then it's invalid. Similarly for the non-diagonal cells.\n\nWait, but the two diagonals may have overlapping cells. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, when collecting all the diagonal cells, we need to collect all cells that are in either of the two diagonals. However, when checking for the same character, the entire set of those cells must have the same character.\n\nSo, for the diagonals, collect all cells where i == j or i + j == n-1. Then check that all of these cells have the same character.\n\nThen, for the other cells (those not in the diagonals), collect their characters. All must be same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n. Let's store it as a grid, maybe a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\n- Check if all diagonal cells (i == j or i + j == n-1) have the same character. Let's collect all these characters into a set. If the length of the set is not 1, then return NO.\n\n- Then, collect all the non-diagonal cells. Check that all of them have the same character, and that this character is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells?\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if it is not on either diagonal, then check.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid:\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n    for j in 0..n-1:\n\n        if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n\n            part of diagonals\n\n        else:\n\n            part of non-diagonals\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's get the first diagonal character (say, grid[0][0]), and check that all other diagonal cells are same as it.\n\nBut maybe the first diagonal cell is not the same as others. So, perhaps, collect all the diagonal characters into a set. If the size is 1, then proceed.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid: grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if diagonal_chars.pop() != non_diagonal_chars.pop():\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the non_diagonal_chars could be empty. For example, when n=1? But n is at least 3. So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are the ones not on the diagonals. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells (since the center is counted twice). So the non-diagonal cells are 9-5=4 cells. So for n=3, the non_diagonal_chars will have 4 cells. So for the code, in that case, the len(non_diagonal_chars) must be 1, and the character must differ from the diagonal's.\n\nBut in the code above, for the case where the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So no, non_diagonal_chars can't be empty. So the code is okay.\n\nBut let's think about the case where all non-diagonal cells are same. So, for example, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are positions (0,0) = w, (0,2) = w; (1,1) = w. So the diagonals are all w. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So all non-diagonal are s. So diagonal is w, non-diagonal is s. So output YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is the first one:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) x; (0,4) x; (1,1) o; (1,3) o; (2,2) x; (3,1) o; (3,3) o; (4,0) x; (4,4) x. Wait, wait, for i=0, j=0 (i==j). For i=0, j=4: 0+4=4, which is n-1 (n=5). So yes. So the diagonals include all those positions. Let's check the characters in the diagonals. For example:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → positions (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → positions (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x. \n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) is x? Wait, i=3, j=1. i + j = 4 (n-1=5-1=4). So yes. So (3,1) is x? Let me check the input. The third line (row 2?) is \"soxoo\". Wait the input is:\n\nOriginal input is:\n\nFirst input is 5, then the lines:\n\nxooox → row 0: x o o o x\n\noxoxo → row 1: o x o x o\n\nsoxoo → row 2: s o x o o\n\noxoxo → row 3: o x o x o\n\nxooox → row 4: x o o o x\n\nSo for row 2 (i=2), j=2 is x. For i=2, j=2 is part of the main diagonal. Then, for the anti-diagonal, for i=2, j=2: i+j = 4, which is n-1 (5-1=4). So yes. So that cell is part of both diagonals. So the diagonals have:\n\nLooking at all cells in diagonals:\n\nRow 0: positions 0 and 4 → x and x.\n\nRow 1: positions 1 and 3 → x and x.\n\nRow 2: position 2 → x.\n\nRow 3: positions 1 and 3 → x and x.\n\nRow 4: positions 0 and 4 → x and x.\n\nSo all the diagonal cells are x. So the diagonal_chars set is {x}.\n\nNow the non-diagonal cells. For example, row 0, j=1,2,3: o, o, o. Row 1, j=0,2,4: o, o, o. Row 2, j=0,1,3,4: s, o, o, o. Row 3, j=0,2,4: o, o, o. Row 4, j=1,2,3: o, o, o.\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells include s (from row 2, column 0). So the non_diagonal_chars set includes 's' and 'o'. So the len(non_diagonal_chars) is 2. Hence, output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut in the code, for the first sample input, the non_diagonal_chars would include 'o' and 's' (from row 2, column 0). So the set has size 2, so the code returns NO.\n\nAnother sample input is the third one:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x, (2,2) e. Wait, for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2, which for n=3, n-1=2. So yes. So (2,0) is on the anti-diagonal. (2,2) is i=2, j=2: i + j = 4, which for n=3 is 3-1=2. No. So (2,2) is not on the anti-diagonal. Wait for n=3, the anti-diagonal is i + j = 2. So for (2,2), i + j = 4, which is not 2. So (2,2) is not on the anti-diagonal. So the diagonals are:\n\nMain diagonal (i == j): (0,0), (1,1), (2,2).\n\nAnti-diagonal (i + j = 2): (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nSo the cells in the diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x; (2,2) e. Wait, but (2,2) is part of the main diagonal. So the diagonals include (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So the diagonal_chars are {x, e}? Because (2,2) is e. So the set would have x and e. So the len(diagonal_chars) is 2, hence output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about the case where the non-diagonal cells are same as diagonal? For example, if all cells are same. Then, the code would check that the diagonal_chars is {a}, non_diagonal_chars is {a}, so the code would check if they are different. Since they are same, output NO.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string.\n\nThen collect diagonal_chars and non_diagonal_chars as sets.\n\nBut in Python, for each cell, check if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nBut for the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = set()\n\nnon_diagonal = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelif len(non_diagonal) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if diagonal.pop() != non_diagonal.pop():\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, when you pop from a set, it removes and returns an arbitrary element. So for the case where the set has only one element, it's okay. But for the code, the first check is that diagonal has exactly one element, and non_diagonal has exactly one element. So, in that case, the code checks whether the two elements are different.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n >=3, the non_diagonal can't be empty. For example, n=3: the grid has 9 cells. The diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells (since the center is counted twice). So non_diagonal has 4 cells. So for n=3, the non_diagonal set will have 4 elements. So len(non_diagonal) is 1 only if all of them are same.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, n is at least 3, so for n=3, the non-diagonal is 4 cells. So no, the code is okay.\n\nBut what about n=1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3. So no need to handle that.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code will collect the diagonal chars. For example, the cell (2,0) is 's' (row 2 is 'soxoo', so j=0 is 's'). Wait, for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2. For n=5, n-1=4. So 2 is not equal to 4. So (i=2, j=0) is not on the anti-diagonal. Wait, what's the anti-diagonal for n=5?\n\nFor i + j = 4.\n\nSo for i=2, j=2: 2+2=4. So that's on the anti-diagonal. So for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2, which is not 4. So that cell is not on any diagonal. So in the first sample input, the cell (2,0) is 's' which is non-diagonal. So the non_diagonal set includes 's' and 'o's. So len(non_diagonal) is 2. So code returns NO.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid is:\n\nRow 0: 'wsw' → positions (0,0) = 'w', (0,1) = 's', (0,2) = 'w'\n\nRow 1: 'sws' → (1,0) = 's', (1,1) = 'w', (1,2) = 's'\n\nRow 2: 'wsw' → (2,0) = 'w', (2,1) = 's', (2,2) = 'w'\n\nDiagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) → w, (0,2) → w, (1,1) → w, (2,0) → w, (2,2) → w. So diagonal set is {w}.\n\nnon_diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So non_diagonal set is {s}. So code returns YES.\n\nSample input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ngrid:\n\nrow 0: x p x → (0,0) x, (0,1) p, (0,2) x.\n\nrow 1: p x p → (1,0) p, (1,1) x, (1,2) p.\n\nrow 2: x p e → (2,0) x, (2,1) p, (2,2) e.\n\nDiagonals:\n\ncells (i==j) → (0,0) x, (1,1) x, (2,2) e.\n\ncells (i + j = 2) → (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x.\n\nSo all diagonal cells are x, x, e, x, x. So the diagonal set is {x, e} → len 2. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the code works for these samples.\n\nBut what about cases where the non-diagonal has all same letters but same as diagonal?\n\nLike:\n\nn=3\n\nall cells are 'a'.\n\nThen diagonal is all a, non-diagonal is all a. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen code returns NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal is all a.\n\nnon-diagonal cells are (0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. So non_diagonal set is {b, a} → len 2 → code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same but same as diagonal. So code returns NO.\n\nNow, what about when the non-diagonal is same but different from diagonal?\n\nLike:\n\nn=3\n\naxa\n\nxaa\n\naxa\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal set is {a}.\n\nnon-diagonal cells are (0,1) x, (1,0) x, (1,2) a, (2,1) x. So non_diagonal set is {x, a} → len 2. So code returns NO. Wait, but why?\n\nBecause (1,2) is part of the anti-diagonal? Let me check:\n\nFor cell (1,2) in n=3: i=1, j=2. i + j = 3. Which is n-1=2? No. 3 is not 2. So (1,2) is not on the anti-diagonal. So for i=1, j=2, it's not on either diagonal. So in this example, the non-diagonal cells would be (0,1) x, (1,0) x, (1,2) a, (2,1) x. So non_diagonal set is {x, a} → len 2 → code returns NO. So that's correct.\n\nBut suppose that all non-diagonal cells are same, but different from diagonal. For example:\n\nn=3\n\naxa\n\nxaa\n\naxa\n\nWait, in this case, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1) x, (1,0) x, (1,2) a, (2,1) x. So (1,2) is a. So the non_diagonal set is {x, a} → len 2. So code returns NO. But in this case, the non-diagonal cells are not all same. So code is correct.\n\nAnother example where non-diagonal cells are all same and different from diagonal.\n\nLet me think of a case where the diagonals are all 'a' and non-diagonal are all 'b'.\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nWait, no. For the grid:\n\nRow 0: aaa → (0,0) a (diagonal), (0,1) a (non-diagonal?), (0,2) a (diagonal).\n\nRow 1: aba → (1,0) a (non-diagonal?), (1,1) b (diagonal), (1,2) a (non-diagonal).\n\nRow 2: aaa → (2,0) a (diagonal), (2,1) a (non-diagonal), (2,2) a (diagonal).\n\nSo the diagonals are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Their values are a, a, b, a, a. So the diagonal set is {a, b} → len 2 → code returns NO. So that's not the case. So how to create a grid where diagonals are all same, and non-diagonals are all same and different.\n\nLet me think of:\n\nn=3.\n\nGrid:\n\naxa\n\nxaa\n\naxa\n\nWait, the diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) x, (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So the diagonal set is {a, x} → len 2. Not good.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3.\n\nGrid:\n\naxa\n\naxa\n\naxa\n\nSo diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) x, (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal set is {a, x} → len 2. Not good.\n\nHmm. How to make the diagonals all same?\n\nLet me think of:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa → diagonals are all a, non-diagonal are all a. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother example: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal is all a. Non-diagonal cells are (0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. So non-diagonal set is {b, a} → len 2. So code returns NO.\n\nWait, but (1,2) is not on any diagonal. So in this case, the non-diagonal cells include a and b. So code returns NO.\n\nSo to have a valid case, the non-diagonal cells must be all same and different from diagonal.\n\nLet me think of a valid example.\n\nn=3:\n\naxx\n\nxaa\n\nxax\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nRow 0: a x x → (0,0) a (diagonal), (0,1) x (non), (0,2) x (anti-diagonal? i + j = 0+2=2, which is n-1 (3-1=2). So yes. So (0,2) is on anti-diagonal. So the diagonals are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nRow 1: x a a → (1,0) x (non-diagonal?), (1,1) a (diagonal), (1,2) a (non-diagonal? i=1, j=2: 1+2=3 != 2. So yes, non-diagonal.\n\nRow 2: x a x → (2,0) x (anti-diagonal?), (2,1) a (non), (2,2) x (diagonal).\n\nSo diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) a, (0,2) x, (1,1) a, (2,0) x, (2,2) x. So the diagonal set is {a, x} → len 2 → invalid.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother example: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) b; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal set is {a, b} → invalid.\n\nHmm. Let's think of a case where all diagonals are same, and non-diagonals are same and different.\n\nLike:\n\nn=3:\n\naxa\n\nxaa\n\naxa\n\nWait, the diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) x, (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonals are a and x. So invalid.\n\nAnother idea: for n=3, the diagonals are all x, and non-diagonals are all y.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: x y x → (0,0) x, (0,2) x.\n\nRow 1: y x y → (1,1) x.\n\nRow 2: x y x → (2,0) x, (2,2) x.\n\nSo the diagonals are all x. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1) y, (1,0) y, (1,2) y, (2,1) y. So non_diagonal is {y}.\n\nThus, code would output YES.\n\nYes, this is a valid case. So in this case, the code would output YES.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the non-diagonal is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, non-diagonal has 4 cells. So no.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is correct. So the code is as follows.\n\nBut in Python, when reading the input, the code may read the input as per the first line being n, then n lines.\n\nBut the input in the sample is given as a list of strings. For example, the first sample input is given as:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut in reality, the code is supposed to read from stdin. So for example, the first input is:\n\nThe first line is 5, then 5 lines.\n\nBut when the code is run, the input is read via input(). So for multiple test cases, but in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the sample input, the user provided three test cases. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, no, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, but the output is three answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, but that's probably because the sample input is a list of test cases, and the outputs are their respective results.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Or is it?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Then n lines follow. So the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. However, the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual input is for one test case. But this is a confusion.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as a list of three test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen another input for 3, etc. But in practice, the code should read one test case. However, the sample shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases, but in reality, the code should process one test case.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the input is for a single test case. But the sample shows three test cases. For example, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three answers. So the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows: the first line contains n, then n lines. But in the sample input, it's given as a list of multiple test cases. However, this is likely because the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the code should read one test case. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the problem statement's input section:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So this suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. But the problem's sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual input for the code is one test case. Or perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWhich is a list of three test cases. The output is ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'].\n\nBut in reality, the code is supposed to read from standard input. So the actual input would be, for example, three separate test cases. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, then n lines. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each with their own n and grid.\n\nBut the problem's sample input is written in a way that suggests that the code is to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous. But looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n, then n lines. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement's sample input, the first line is 5, then 5 lines, then another test case with 3, then 3 lines, etc. So the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is written as if it's a single test case. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's output section:\n\nPrint string \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement's sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three answers. However, the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. So this suggests that the problem is written in a way that the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, this is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases for the purpose of showing the format, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut then, how to explain the sample input and output? For example, the first sample input is a list of three test cases. But the code is supposed to read from stdin. So, for example, if the code is run with the first test case, it outputs NO. With the second, YES, etc.\n\nBut the problem's sample input is not a single test case. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n, then n lines. This is very confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement, the input is described as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nThis implies that the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents three separate test cases, each of which is processed by the code, and the output is three lines. However, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to know? Well, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nOutput:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nThis suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description does not mention this. This is a problem. But perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases for illustration, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So if the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, then the code should read until EOF. But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the number of test cases, but that is not stated. But the problem statement does not mention that.\n\nThis is a critical point. If the code is supposed to process one test case, then the code is straightforward. But if it's supposed to process multiple test cases, then the code should read until all input is processed.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input, the first line is '5\\nxooox...' which is a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each of which is given as a block of n+1 lines (the first line is n, followed by n lines of the grid).\n\nBut how to read multiple test cases in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all input at once, split into lines, and process each test case. But for the purposes of the problem, the code must read from stdin.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read one test",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Identify Diagonals**: For each cell in the grid, check if it lies on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal where row index equals column index, or anti-diagonal where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`).\n3. **Check Characters**: Collect characters from the diagonals and non-diagonal cells separately. Ensure that all characters on the diagonals are the same and all non-diagonal characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n    if d_char != nd_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Identifying Diagonals**: We iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals, its character is added to the `diagonal_chars` set; otherwise, it is added to the `non_diagonal_chars` set.\n3. **Validation**: We check if all characters in `diagonal_chars` are the same (i.e., the set has exactly one element) and similarly for `non_diagonal_chars`. If both conditions are met, we ensure that the characters from the diagonals and non-diagonals are different. If all conditions are satisfied, we print \"YES\"; otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using sets to ensure uniformity in characters, ensuring the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
