The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Neko wants to open as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. The key point here is to find the maximum matching between chests and keys based on their parity. Because the sum being odd implies that one is even and the other is odd. So, for each chest, if it's even, it needs an odd key. If it's odd, it needs an even key. \n\nSo the plan is: count the number of even and odd chests, and the number of even and odd keys. Then, for each even chest, we can match with an odd key. For each odd chest, we can match with an even key. But since the number of keys and chests may not be equal, we need to take the minimum between the counts.\n\nWait, but how exactly? Let me break it down:\n\nLet's say:\n\n- Even chests (a_i even) need odd keys (b_j odd).\n- Odd chests (a_i odd) need even keys (b_j even).\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of two values:\n\nmin(number of even chests, number of odd keys) + min(number of odd chests, number of even keys).\n\nYes! Because each even chest can be matched with an odd key, but only up to the number of available odd keys. Similarly for the other case.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count how many even and odd numbers are in the chests array.\n2. Count how many even and odd numbers are in the keys array.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat makes sense. Let me test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parity:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (indices 2,3,4?), wait no: 14,6,2 are even. So 3 even chests. Odd chests are 2 (9 and 11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parity: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys is 1, even_keys is 3.\n\nSo min(3, 1) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the first example's output of 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0.\n\nKeys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0.\n\nSo min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1. Which matches the second example's output.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_chests 0. Keys: even_keys=4, odd_keys=0. So min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid. Now, how to implement this in Python?\n\nThe steps are straightforward. Read n and m, then read the list of a's and b's.\n\nThen count:\n\neven_chest = number of elements in a that are even.\n\nodd_chest = n - even_chest.\n\nSimilarly for keys: even_key = number of elements in b that are even.\n\nodd_key = m - even_key.\n\nThen the answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes. So the code would be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nRead b list.\n\ncount_even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\ncount_odd_a = n - count_even_a\n\ncount_even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\ncount_odd_b = m - count_even_b\n\nresult = min(count_even_a, count_odd_b) + min(count_odd_a, count_even_b)\n\nprint(result)\n\nThat's simple. Let me check edge cases.\n\nWhat if there are zero even chests? Like all odd. Then the first term is zero, and the second term depends on even keys.\n\nAnother case: if there are more even keys than needed. For example, even_chest is 2, odd_key is 3. Then min(2,3) is 2. So that's correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when n or m is zero? Well, according to the constraints, n and m are at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when some of the counts are zero. Like, all chests are even and all keys are even. Then the answer is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work. Now, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut wait, how to read the input? The input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input format says that the first line contains n and m, then second line the a_i, third line the b_j. But in the sample input, there are three examples given. Wait, the user provided three examples, but the actual input for the problem is per test case. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. Wait, the original problem's input is given as per one test case. The sample shows multiple examples, but each is a separate test case. So the code should process one test case per run. So the code should read the first line as n and m, then the next line as a list, then the next line as b list.\n\nSo the code should be written as:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers for a.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers for b.\n\nCompute the counts as discussed.\n\nPrint the result.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut for reading the input, sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but in Python, splitting by whitespace is okay.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n, m from input. Then read a's, then read b's.\n\nIn code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute counts.\n\ncount_even_a = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        count_even_a +=1\n\ncount_odd_a = n - count_even_a\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\ncount_even_b = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num %2 ==0:\n\n        count_even_b +=1\n\ncount_odd_b = m - count_even_b\n\nresult = min(count_even_a, count_odd_b) + min(count_odd_a, count_even_b)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\ncount_even_a: 3 (14,6,2)\n\ncount_odd_a: 2 (9,11)\n\ncount_even_b: 3 (8,4,20) and 7 is odd. So count_odd_b is 1.\n\nso min(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\ncount_even_a is 5, count_odd_a 0.\n\ncount_even_b is 0 (since 5 is odd), count_odd_b is 1.\n\nso min(5,1) is 1, min(0,0) is 0. Total 1.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\ncount_even_a is 1 (10), count_odd_a 0.\n\ncount_even_b is 4, count_odd_b 0.\n\nso min(1,0) is 0, min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: when there are more keys than needed.\n\nLike n=2, m=3.\n\na = [1,3] (both odd)\n\nb = [2,4,6] (all even)\n\nso count_odd_a is 2, count_even_b is 3. So min(2,3) is 2. So answer is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, since each odd chest can be matched with an even key.\n\nAnother case: a has 2 even and 3 odd. b has 1 even and 4 odd.\n\ncount_even_a = 2, count_odd_a =3.\n\ncount_even_b =1, count_odd_b=4.\n\nso min(2,4) is 2, min(3,1) is 1. Total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This means that an even chest requires an odd key and an odd chest requires an even key.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Parities**: Use the counts to determine the maximum number of matches:\n   - Even chests can be matched with odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be matched with even keys.\n3. **Calculate Result**: The result is the sum of the minimum values between the count of even chests and odd keys, and the count of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_even_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_even_a += 1\ncount_odd_a = n - count_even_a\n\ncount_even_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_even_b += 1\ncount_odd_b = m - count_even_b\n\nresult = min(count_even_a, count_odd_b) + min(count_odd_a, count_even_b)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests (n), number of keys (m), the list of chest numbers (a), and the list of key numbers (b).\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We iterate through the lists to count how many even and odd numbers are present in both the chests and keys.\n3. **Matching Chests and Keys**: Using the counts, we determine the maximum possible matches by taking the minimum of the available even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of the available odd chests and even keys. The sum of these two minima gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, ensuring it handles the constraints effectively.",
