He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B adds some 'b's to the end, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C adds 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. And the final string is what we're checking.\n\nSo first, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Because A and B made sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b', and then C adds 'c's. So if the string has no 'c's, it's invalid. Also, if there are no 'a's or 'b's, but that's already covered by the problem statement.\n\nWait, but the input is guaranteed to consist of only a, b, c. So the first thing is to check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of those are missing, return 'NO'.\n\nThen, the order of the characters must be correct. All 'a's must come before 'b's, which must come before 'c's. Because A's string is all a's, then B appends b's, then C appends c's. So the string should be a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. So for example, if there's a 'c' before a 'b', that's invalid. Or a 'b' after a 'c'? No, because the order is a's first, then b's, then c's. So the string must be in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo first, check that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. How to do that? Well, we can check that all a's are before any b's, and all b's are before any c's. For example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a', etc.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then we need to check the counts. Let me think: the count of c's must be equal to the count of a's or the count of b's. But wait, the count of c's is determined by the count of a's or b's in the string before adding the c's. Wait, when C appends the c's, the number of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string at that time. Let me clarify:\n\nThe original string before adding c's is the string from A and B. So that string has some a's and b's. Then, C appends c's equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in that string. So the count of c's in the final string must be equal to the count of a's (original) or the count of b's (original). Because the original a's and b's are the ones before adding the c's. So the final count of c's is equal to the original a's or original b's.\n\nBut the original a's and b's are the counts in the string before adding the c's. So in the final string, the count of a's is same as original, count of b's is same as original, and count of c's is equal to either original a's or original b's.\n\nSo, for the final string, the count of c's must be equal to the count of a's (original) or the count of b's (original). But in the final string, the count of a's is the same as original, and count of b's is same as original. So the count of c's must be equal to the count of a's (original) or the count of b's (original). Which is equivalent to: count_c = count_a_initial or count_c = count_b_initial.\n\nBut in the final string, count_a_initial is the count of a's in the entire string. Similarly for b's. Because the c's are added after. So in the final string, the count of a's is the same as the original count from A, and same for b's. So the count of c's must be equal to the count of a's (original) or the count of b's (original). Which is the same as the count of a's in the final string, or the count of b's in the final string.\n\nSo, for the final string, the count of c's must be equal to the count of a's or the count of b's in the final string. Because the count of a's and b's in the final string is same as the original",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The key constraints are that the string must be composed of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's, and the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Presence**: Ensure the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Check Order**: Verify that the string follows the order of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. This can be done by checking that all 'a's come before any 'b's and all 'b's come before any 'c's.\n3. **Check Counts**: Ensure the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check presence of at least one 'a', 'b', 'c'\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check the order: all a's first, then b's, then c's\n    # Find the first occurrence of 'b' and check if there are any 'a's after it\n    first_b = s.find('b')\n    if first_b != -1:\n        if 'a' in s[first_b:]:\n            return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence of 'c' and check if there are any 'b's after it\n    first_c = s.find('c')\n    if first_c != -1:\n        if 'b' in s[first_c:]:\n            return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Count the number of a, b, c\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(is_valid_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Presence Check**: The function first checks if the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, it returns \"NO\".\n2. **Order Check**: The function ensures that all 'a's appear before any 'b's and all 'b's appear before any 'c's. This is done by finding the first occurrence of 'b' and 'c' and checking for any preceding characters that violate the order.\n3. **Count Check**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are determined. The function checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If so, it returns \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions in linear time relative to the length of the string, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum input size.",
