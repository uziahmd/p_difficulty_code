    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that Valera has an array a of n integers and a function f(x) which is calculated by summing the elements of a where the i-th bit in x's binary representation is 1. We need to find the maximum value of f(x) for all x between 0 and m, inclusive. \n\nSo, the first thing I need to understand is how f(x) works. For example, if x is 11 (binary 1011 for n=4), then bits 0, 1, and 3 are set. So f(x) would be a0 + a1 + a3. \n\nThe challenge is to find the maximum possible sum of selected a's elements, given that the corresponding bits in x must form a number ≤ m. But how do we efficiently find this maximum?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. The array can be up to 1e5 elements, and m can be up to 2^1e5, which is way too big to iterate through all possible x values. So brute force is impossible here.\n\nHmm. So we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the bits of m. The maximum sum would be achieved by selecting the bits that have the highest a[i] values. However, we can't just take all the highest a[i]s because their combination might not be allowed (i.e., the binary number formed by those bits might exceed m).\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal x is the one that selects as many high-value a[i]s as possible, while ensuring that the binary representation of x is less than or equal to m. So perhaps we can model this as a greedy problem where we try to select bits with higher a[i] values first, but ensuring that the resulting x doesn't exceed m.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think about the bits of m. Let's consider each bit from the highest to the lowest. For each bit position, if we can set it to 1, then we should do so if it contributes positively to the sum. However, setting a bit may affect the possibility of setting lower bits. \n\nAlternatively, this seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum subset of bits (with certain constraints) that can be set without exceeding m. So perhaps we can use a bitmask approach with some kind of backtracking or dynamic programming, but again, with n up to 1e5, that's not feasible.\n\nWait, but the key insight here is that the maximum sum is achieved by choosing the bits where a[i] is positive. However, there's a catch: when you choose certain bits, you have to make sure that the overall number x is ≤ m. So, for example, if m's binary is 1010, then choosing bits that would form 1011 is invalid. \n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subset of bits (positions) such that the binary number formed by those bits is ≤ m, and the sum of a[i] for those bits is maximized.\n\nBut how to find this subset efficiently?\n\nAnother thought: since the maximum sum is the sum of all a[i] where the bit is set, but only if the corresponding x is allowed. So if m is all ones (like 2^n -1), then the maximum sum is the sum of all a[i]. But if m is not that, then we need to find the best combination.\n\nSo maybe we can sort the bits in order of their a[i] values. Then, we want to include as many as possible of the highest a[i]s, but ensuring that the bits chosen form a number ≤ m. However, even this approach might be tricky because including a higher bit may require that some lower bits are adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to construct the maximum possible sum by choosing bits. Let's think recursively. Let's process the bits from the highest to the lowest. For each bit, decide whether to include it or not, considering the constraints of m.\n\nFor example, suppose we are at position i (starting from the highest). If the current bit in m is 1, then we can choose to set this bit to 1 (if it's beneficial) and proceed, or leave it as 0. But if we set it to 1, then the remaining bits can be set to anything (as long as they don't cause the total to exceed m). Wait, no. Because once we set a bit to 1, the rest of the bits can be set to 1 if allowed. But if the current bit is set to 1, then the rest of the bits can be anything up to the corresponding bits in m. Hmm, but this seems like a standard problem in bitmask DP.\n\nBut how to model this with the given constraints? Let's think of the binary representation of m as a string. Let's say we process the bits from left (most significant) to right (least significant). At each step, we have two choices: either take the bit (if allowed) or not. But the choice depends on whether taking it will not make the number exceed m.\n\nThis sounds like a classic digit DP problem. However, since the number of bits can be up to 1e5, a standard DP approach with memoization is not feasible due to time and space constraints. But maybe there's a greedy approach here.\n\nWait, but what if we sort the bits in the order of their a[i] values. For example, we can sort all the positions (bits) in descending order of a[i]. Then, we want to include as many of these as possible, but ensuring that the resulting x is ≤ m. However, how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: the optimal x is the one that has the highest possible sum of a[i]s. To maximize the sum, we want to include all bits where a[i] is positive. However, the problem is that the binary representation of x must not exceed m. So if the binary representation of x formed by those bits is less than or equal to m, then that's the maximum. Otherwise, we need to find the next best option.\n\nBut how to check if the bits we want to include can be arranged in a way that x is ≤ m?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose m is 1010 (binary). The maximum possible sum would be the sum of the bits that are set in m plus any other bits that can be added without exceeding m. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For instance, if some a[i] is very high, even if m's bit is 0, but we can set that bit to 1 if we can adjust other bits to make the number less than m.\n\nWait, but if a certain bit is not set in m, then setting that bit would make the number larger than m. Unless there are lower bits that can be adjusted. For example, if m is 1000 (binary), then setting the third bit (from the right) to 1 would require that the number is 1000. But if we set that bit to 1 and others to 0, then it's exactly m. But if we set higher bits than m's highest bit, that's not allowed. So, the bits that can be set in x must be such that when compared to m's binary, the bits are not higher than m's.\n\nSo the problem is similar to finding the maximum subset of bits (with their a[i] values) that can be set in such a way that the binary number is ≤ m.\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate the maximum sum by greedily selecting bits. Here's an idea:\n\nWe can start by sorting the bits (indices) in descending order of a[i]. Then, for each bit in this sorted list, we check if setting it (along with previously set bits) would result in a number that's still ≤ m. If yes, we set it and add the a[i] to the sum. If not, we skip it.\n\nBut how to check if setting that bit is possible? Because setting a higher bit may affect the possibility of setting lower bits.\n\nWait, but this approach might not work. For example, imagine that m is 1010 (binary 10), and the a values for bits 0, 2, and 3 are 10, 5, and 100. The sorted order would be bit 3 (a=100), then bit 0 (a=10), then bit 2 (a=5). Now, if we try to set bit 3 (which is 8 in decimal). But m is 10 (binary 1010), which is 10 in decimal. So 8 is less than 10. So we can set bit 3. Then, we can also set bit 0 (adding 10) and bit 2 (adding 5). But 8 + 1 + 4 = 13, which is larger than 10. So setting bit 3 and 0 would require that the other bits are set in a way that the total is <= m.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we check if adding a certain bit is possible, given that other bits may have already been set?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is the one that has the same bits as m in the higher positions, and then allows for the maximum sum in the lower positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum sum is the sum of all a[i]s where the bit is set in m, plus any possible adjustments. However, if some a[i]s are negative, but that's not the case here. All a[i]s are non-negative (since 0 ≤ ai ≤ 1e4). So including more bits increases the sum. Therefore, the maximum sum is achieved by including as many bits as possible, but the binary representation of x must be ≤ m.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum subset of bits that can be set such that their binary representation is ≤ m. Since each bit contributes positively, the maximum sum is achieved by selecting the largest possible subset of bits, but constrained by m.\n\nWait, this is a key insight! Since all a[i] are non-negative, the optimal x is the one that has the maximum number of bits set (but not exceeding m). Wait, no. Because the a[i]s can vary. For example, if a0 is 100, a1 is 1, and m is 10 (binary 1010). Then, including bit 0 (which gives 100) is better than including bits 1 and 2 (which gives 1 + 2 = 3). But if m is 10 (binary 1010), then the maximum possible bits is 3 (bits 3, 1, 0?), but I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, but the sum depends on the a[i] values. So even though including more bits may be better, if some bits have higher a[i], it's better to include them even if it requires excluding other bits.\n\nSo the problem is not about the number of bits, but about selecting the subset of bits with the highest a[i] values, but ensuring that the binary number formed by them is ≤ m.\n\nSo how do we find that subset?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can use a greedy approach with backtracking, but again, for n up to 1e5, it's not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the function f(x) is the sum of a[i] for all bits set in x, and since all a[i] are non-negative, the maximum possible value of f(x) is the sum of all a[i]s where the bit can be set in x. However, the constraint is that x must be ≤ m. Therefore, the maximum sum is the sum of all a[i]s for which the bit can be set in some x ≤ m. But how to determine which bits can be set?\n\nWait, but the bits can be set independently as long as the overall x is ≤ m. For example, if m is 1010 (binary), then the bits can be set in any combination that does not exceed m. So the maximum sum would be the sum of all a[i]s for which the bit is set in m, plus any other bits that can be set in positions where m has 0, but in such a way that the x is still ≤ m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the binary representation of m. Let's say that m has k bits. For each bit in the binary representation of m, if the bit is 1, then we can include it in x. However, if we include a bit that is 0 in m, then we have to ensure that all higher bits are set in the same way as m, and that the lower bits can be set to 1. For example, if m is 1010 (binary), then if we want to set the second bit (value 2), which is 0 in m, we can do so only if we have not set any higher bits than m's. Because if we set a higher bit, then the lower bits can be set freely. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nIf m is 1010 (binary), then any x that is less than or equal to m can have bits set in positions where m has 1s, and in positions where m has 0s, but only if the higher bits are set in a way that doesn't exceed m.\n\nSo for example, if we want to set a bit that is 0 in m, say the second bit (position 1, assuming 0-based from the right), then we can only do that if the higher bits (like the third bit) are set to the same as m. Because if we set the second bit (which is 0 in m), then the number would be larger than m unless the higher bits are set to exactly match m's bits up to that point.\n\nThis seems complex. So perhaps the optimal approach is to generate all possible subsets of bits that are allowed by m, but again, with n up to 1e5, that's impossible.\n\nAnother Idea: The maximum sum is achieved by the subset of bits that are set in m, plus any additional bits that can be set in positions where m's bits are 1, but perhaps not all. Wait, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nWe can think of the problem as follows: for each bit position, decide whether to include it in x or not, based on whether including it can contribute to the sum and not violate the m constraint.\n\nBut how to model this decision-making process.\n\nLet's think recursively. Let's process the bits from the most significant to the least. At each step, we have a current prefix of the bits. We can choose to set a bit to 0 or 1, but we have to ensure that the overall number does not exceed m.\n\nAt each step, we can track whether the current prefix is already less than the corresponding prefix of m. If it is, then for the remaining bits, we can set them to 1 if it increases the sum. If the current prefix is equal to m's prefix up to that point, then we can only set the next bits to 0 or 1, depending on m's bits.\n\nThis is similar to the digit DP approach. However, for n up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think of the binary representation of m as a list of bits. Let's say we have the bits stored as a list, say, bits_m, where bits_m[0] is the most significant bit.\n\nWe can process the bits from left to right. At each step, we have a flag indicating whether the current bits chosen so far are equal to the prefix of m (tight) or already less than it (loose).\n\nIf we are in tight mode, then the next bit can be set to 0 or 1, but not exceeding the corresponding bit in m.\n\nIf we are in loose mode, we can set the next bit to 1 or 0, whichever gives a higher sum.\n\nBut how to track which bits are set, and what their contribution to the sum is. However, since the sum depends on the bits chosen, we need to track the maximum possible sum at each step.\n\nBut given that the a[i]s are known, perhaps we can pre-sort the bits in order of their contribution. Wait, but this seems conflicting with the digit DP approach.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP traversal, for each position and state (tight or not), we can track the maximum sum achievable from that point onward.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nWe can model the problem with a recursive function that processes each bit position, keeping track of whether we are tight (i.e., the previous bits exactly match m's bits up to this point) or not.\n\nAt each step, for the current bit, we can decide to set it to 0 or 1, provided that:\n\n- If tight, then the choice of 1 is allowed only if the corresponding bit in m is 1.\n\n- If not tight, then we can choose 0 or 1.\n\nFor each choice, we calculate the contribution to the sum (if we choose to set the bit, add a[i]) and proceed to the next bit.\n\nThe base case is when all bits are processed, return 0.\n\nThis approach would give us the maximum sum possible.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, the recursion depth would be O(n), but with memoization, it's manageable? Well, the state is (position, tight), which is O(n * 2) states. So for n=1e5, this would be O(2e5) states, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to handle the bits? Because the bits are in the order of the binary representation of m. Also, note that m can be up to 2^1e5, which is a very large number, but the binary representation is given as a string. So, the length of the binary string is up to 1e5 digits.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Parse the input:\n\n   - Read n.\n\n   - Read the array a as a list of integers.\n\n   - Read the binary string s of m. Then, m's binary is s, and the length of s is len_s = n? Or no. Wait, the input says that the third line is a sequence of digits (0 and 1) of length n. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n   The third line is a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn-1 — the binary representation of number m. So, the length of s is exactly n. So m is a binary number with n bits. For example, in the first sample input, n is 2, and the binary string is '10' (so m is 2). \n\nBut wait, the binary string s is of length n. So, the binary representation of m is exactly n bits long. So, the value of m is the sum over i=0 to n-1 of (s[i] == '1') * 2^{n-1 - i} ?\n\nWait, no. Because for a binary number, the first character is the most significant bit. For example, if s is '10', then the binary is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2. So for the binary string s, the first character is the highest bit (2^{n-1} place), and the last is the least significant (2^0).\n\nSo, the bits of m are stored in the string s as s[0] being the MSB (bit position n-1?), and s[n-1] is the LSB (bit position 0? Or the other way around?)\n\nWait, the problem says that for example, when n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011), then the bits are i=0, 1, 3. So for x=11 (binary 1011), the bits are:\n\nbit 0: 1 (LSB)\n\nbit 1: 1\n\nbit 2: 0\n\nbit 3: 1 (MSB)\n\nSo the binary is written as 1011, which is 4 bits, and the bits are numbered from 0 to 3, with bit 0 being the least significant. So the binary string s is given as s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}, which corresponds to the bits of m in the following way: the first character s_0 is the bit for position (n-1) (the MSB), and the last character s_{n-1} is the bit for position 0 (the LSB).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The example given in the problem says that for n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011), which is 8+2+1=11. So the bits are set at positions 0, 1, 3. So the binary is 1011, which is 4 bits. The positions are numbered from 0 (LSB) to 3 (MSB). So the first bit in the binary string (s_0) would correspond to the MSB (bit 3) in the example. So for the binary string of m, the i-th character in the string (s_i) corresponds to the bit (n-1 - i) in the actual number? Or is it the other way around?\n\nActually, the problem says that the binary representation of m is s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}. So for example, if s is '10', then m is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2, which is correct. So for the binary string, the first character is the highest bit (2^{n-1} place), and the last is the lowest (2^0 place). Therefore, the bit positions are numbered from 0 (LSB) to n-1 (MSB). Wait, no. For example, in the first sample input, n=2, the binary string is '10', which represents m=2. The bits are:\n\nbit 1 (value 2^1) is 1, and bit 0 (value 2^0) is 0. So for the binary string s, s[0] is the value of bit (n-1 - 0) ? No. Wait, the length of the string is n. So for the string s, the first character (index 0) is the most significant bit (bit position n-1), and the last character (index n-1) is the least significant bit (bit position 0).\n\nTherefore, for each position i in the array (from 0 to n-1), the corresponding bit in the binary string is s[i] for the bit position (n-1 - i)? Or is it the other way around?\n\nNo. Let me think of the example where n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011). The binary is 4 bits, and the bits are:\n\nbit 3 (value 8) is 1,\n\nbit 2 (value 4) is 0,\n\nbit 1 (value 2) is 1,\n\nbit 0 (value 1) is 1.\n\nSo the binary representation is 1011. The string s would be '1011', and the positions are s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3. So s_0 is '1', which is the bit for position 3 (the MSB), s_1 is '0' (bit position 2), s_2 is '1' (bit position 1), s_3 is '1' (bit position 0). So for the array a, which is of size n, a_0 corresponds to bit position 0 (LSB), a_1 to bit position 1, etc. So for each bit position i (0-based from 0 to n-1), the corresponding character in the string s is s[n-1 - i]. Wait, no. For example, in the case of the array a's element a_0, which corresponds to bit position 0 (the LSB), the corresponding character in the string s is s[3] (for n=4). So the index in s is (n-1 - i) where i is the bit position. So for bit position i, the s index is (n-1 - i). Therefore, the binary string s is stored in the order of the bits from MSB to LSB. So when processing the bits for the DP approach, we need to process them from MSB to LSB, which is the order of the string s.\n\nBut for the DP approach, we need to process the bits from the most significant to the least significant. So, for the binary string s, the first character (s[0]) is the most significant bit (bit position n-1), and the last character (s[n-1]) is the least significant bit (bit position 0). So the order of processing is s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1].\n\nNow, back to the DP approach. Let's model the problem with a DP function that returns the maximum sum achievable from the current position onwards, given whether the current prefix is tight (exactly matches m's bits up to now) or not.\n\nAt each step, we can decide to set the current bit to 0 or 1, depending on the tight condition.\n\nLet's define dp[pos][is_tight] as the maximum sum achievable from position pos onwards, given that up to pos-1, the bits chosen are exactly matching m's bits (if is_tight is True) or not (if is_tight is False).\n\nThe base case is when pos == n, return 0.\n\nFor each state (pos, is_tight), we can consider the possible choices for the current bit.\n\nIf is_tight is True:\n\n   The current bit can be set to 0 or 1, but only if it's <= the corresponding bit in m. So, for the current bit (s[pos]), which is the bit at position pos in the string s (which is the bit position (n-1 - pos) in the original numbering? No, wait, the string s is processed in order of MSB to LSB. So for the first position (pos=0), the bit is the MSB (bit position n-1), and for pos = n-1, it's the LSB (bit position 0). So, the current bit in the string s at position pos is the bit for the original bit position (n-1 - pos) ?\n\nNo, the original bit positions are 0 to n-1. For the string s, the first character (pos=0) is the MSB, which is the original bit position n-1. The next character (pos=1) is original bit position n-2, and so on. So the original bit position for the current pos in the string is (n-1 - pos).\n\nBut for the DP approach, we need to know for the current bit (in the string s at position pos) what the corresponding a[i] is. Because when we decide to set this bit to 1, we add a[i] to the sum, where i is the original bit position (n-1 - pos).\n\nSo, for each position in the string s (pos), the corresponding a[i] is a[original_bit_position], where original_bit_position = (n-1 - pos). Wait, no. Because for the original array a, a[0] corresponds to bit 0 (LSB), a[1] to bit 1, etc. So for the string s's pos-th character (which represents the original bit position (n-1 - pos)), the corresponding a value is a[original_bit_position] = a[n-1 - pos].\n\nSo, during the DP processing, for each pos in the string s, we can get the a value as a[n-1 - pos].\n\nNow, back to the DP transitions.\n\nCase 1: is_tight is True.\n\nThen, the current bit can be set to 0 or 1, but not exceeding the corresponding bit in m (s[pos]).\n\nIf we set it to 0:\n\n   The new is_tight is True only if the current bit is exactly the same as m's bit. But since we set it to 0, and m's bit is s[pos], which could be 0 or 1. If m's bit is 1, then setting it to 0 makes the prefix now less than m's prefix. Hence, the new is_tight becomes False. If m's bit is 0, then setting it to 0 keeps the tight condition as True.\n\nIf we set it to 1:\n\n   Only possible if m's bit is 1. Then, the new is_tight remains True. Otherwise, it's not allowed.\n\nCase 2: is_tight is False.\n\nThen, we can choose to set the current bit to 0 or 1, and the new is_tight remains False.\n\nFor each choice, we add the a value if the bit is set.\n\nThe maximum sum is the max of the options.\n\nSo, the DP recurrence would be:\n\ndef dp(pos, is_tight):\n\n    if pos == n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if memo[pos][is_tight] is not None:\n\n        return memo[pos][is_tight]\n\n    max_sum = 0\n\n    current_bit_in_m = int(s[pos])\n\n    if is_tight:\n\n        # can choose to set to 0 or 1, but not exceeding current_bit_in_m\n\n        # option 1: set to 0\n\n        new_is_tight = (current_bit_in_m == 0)  # because if current_bit_in_m is 0, and we set to 0, then tight remains True. else, if current_bit_in_m is 1, and we set to 0, tight becomes False.\n\n        # wait, no. If we are tight up to pos-1, and now set the current bit to 0, then:\n\n        # if current_bit_in_m is 1: the current choice (0) is less than m's bit (1), so the tight condition becomes False.\n\n        # if current_bit_in_m is 0: the current choice (0) equals m's bit, so tight remains True.\n\n        new_is_tight_0 = (current_bit_in_m == 0) and (0 == current_bit_in_m) ? Wait, no. If current_bit_in_m is 1, and we choose 0, then the prefix is now less than m's prefix, so new_is_tight is False. If current_bit_in_m is 0, and we choose 0, then the prefix is equal, so new_is_tight is True.\n\n        So, new_is_tight_0 = (current_bit_in_m == 0) and (choice is 0) ?\n\n        Actually, the new_is_tight is True only if the current choice is exactly equal to the current_bit_in_m. So:\n\n        if we choose to set to 0, then new_is_tight is (current_bit_in_m == 0) ?\n\n        Yes. Because, for example, if m's current bit is 1, and we set to 0, then the prefix is now less than m's prefix, hence new_is_tight is False.\n\n        So for option 0:\n\n        new_is_tight_0 = (current_bit_in_m == 0) ?\n\n        No. Because if the current choice is 0 and m's bit is 0, then the prefix remains tight. If the current choice is 0 and m's bit is 1, then the prefix is now less than m's, so tight is False.\n\n        So new_is_tight_0 = (current_bit_in_m == 0) and (we choose 0) ?\n\n        No. It's (current_bit_in_m == choice). So if choice is 0, new_is_tight_0 is (current_bit_in_m == 0) ?\n\n        Yes.\n\n        So for option 0, the new_is_tight is (current_bit_in_m == 0) ?\n\n        Wait, the current choice is 0. The current bit in m is current_bit_in_m. So if the current choice is 0, then the tightness after this choice depends on whether the choice equals the m's bit. Because up to this point, the prefix was tight. If the current choice equals the m's bit, then it remains tight. Otherwise, it becomes loose.\n\n        So for the option of setting to 0, new_is_tight is (current_bit_in_m == 0).\n\n        Similarly, for the option of setting to 1, it's allowed only if current_bit_in_m is 1. Then, new_is_tight is (current_bit_in_m == 1) (which is True).\n\n        So, in code:\n\n        if current_bit_in_m == 1:\n\n            # can choose 0 or 1\n\n            # option 0:\n\n            new_is_tight_0 = (current_bit_in_m == 0) ? No. current_bit_in_m is 1, and choice is 0. So new_is_tight is False.\n\n            # option 1:\n\n            new_is_tight_1 = True (since current_bit_in_m is 1 and choice is 1).\n\n        else:\n\n            # current_bit_in_m is 0. Can only choose 0.\n\n            new_is_tight_0 = True.\n\n        So, for the is_tight case, we can have:\n\n        if current_bit_in_m is 1:\n\n            # can choose 0 or 1\n\n            # for choice 0:\n\n            contribution_0 = 0\n\n            next_tight_0 = False\n\n            # for choice 1:\n\n            contribution_1 = a_value (if we set the bit)\n\n            next_tight_1 = True\n\n        else:\n\n            # current_bit_in_m is 0. can only choose 0.\n\n            contribution_0 = 0\n\n            next_tight_0 = True\n\n        So, for the is_tight case, we have to consider these possibilities.\n\n        Then, the max_sum is the max between choosing 0 or 1 (if allowed), and adding the contribution.\n\n    else:\n\n        # not tight. can choose 0 or 1.\n\n        # for choice 0: contribution is 0, next is_tight is False.\n\n        # for choice 1: contribution is a_value, next is_tight is False.\n\n        So, take the max between choosing 0 or 1.\n\n    So, for each possible choice, compute the contribution and add the result of dp(pos+1, new_is_tight).\n\n    The maximum of these options is the value for dp(pos, is_tight).\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nNow, considering that the a_value for the current position (pos) in the string is a[original_bit_position], which is a[n-1 - pos].\n\nSo, during the DP steps, for each pos, we can calculate the a_value.\n\nNow, implementing this DP with memoization.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, using memoization with recursion may lead to stack overflow. So better to implement it with memoization using an iterative approach or memoization with a table.\n\nBut Python's recursion stack is limited (default is around 1e4). So for n up to 1e5, recursion is not feasible. Therefore, we need to implement this with memoization via an iterative approach, or use memoization with a cache.\n\nBut even with memoization, for 1e5 positions and 2 states (tight or not), the total number of states is 2e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python? Using memoization with lru_cache may not be feasible for n=1e5, since the maximum recursion depth would be 1e5, which is way beyond Python's default limit.\n\nTherefore, we need to implement this with memoization using an iterative approach, like dynamic programming with a table.\n\nLet's think of the DP as follows:\n\nWe can create a table dp where dp[pos][is_tight] represents the maximum sum from position pos onwards with the tight state is_tight.\n\nWe can compute this in a bottom-up manner.\n\nInitialize dp[n][0] = 0, dp[n][1] = 0.\n\nThen, for pos from n-1 downto 0:\n\n    for is_tight in [0, 1]:\n\n        compute the value based on the transitions.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For each position pos (starting from the end), and for each possible is_tight state (0 or 1), we compute the maximum possible sum.\n\nSo, for each pos in reverse order (from n-1 downto 0):\n\n    for is_tight in 0, 1:\n\n        current_bit_in_m = int(s[pos])\n\n        a_value = a[original_bit_position] = a[n-1 - pos]\n\n        if is_tight is 1:\n\n            # current state is tight.\n\n            # possible choices:\n\n            # can choose to set to 0 or 1, depending on current_bit_in_m.\n\n            max_val = 0\n\n            # option 0:\n\n            if current_bit_in_m >= 0:\n\n                # always allowed to choose 0.\n\n                new_is_tight_0 = 1 if (current_bit_in_m == 0) else 0\n\n                val_0 = 0 + dp[pos+1][new_is_tight_0]\n\n                max_val = max(max_val, val_0)\n\n            # option 1:\n\n            if current_bit_in_m == 1:\n\n                new_is_tight_1 = 1\n\n                val_1 = a_value + dp[pos+1][new_is_tight_1]\n\n                max_val = max(max_val, val_1)\n\n            dp[pos][is_tight] = max_val\n\n        else:\n\n            # not tight. can choose 0 or 1.\n\n            # option 0:\n\n            val_0 = 0 + dp[pos+1][0]\n\n            # option 1:\n\n            val_1 = a_value + dp[pos+1][0]\n\n            dp[pos][is_tight] = max(val_0, val_1)\n\nBut wait, when is_tight is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum value of a function `f(x)` for all integers `x` between 0 and `m`, inclusive. The function `f(x)` is defined as the sum of elements in an array `a` where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set to 1. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function `f(x)` sums the elements of the array `a` based on the bits set in `x`. For example, if `x` has the binary representation `101`, then `f(x)` will sum the elements at indices 0 and 2 of the array `a`.\n\n2. **Constraints Handling**: Given that `n` can be up to 100,000 and `m` can be very large (up to 2^100000), a brute force approach is infeasible. Instead, we use dynamic programming (DP) with memoization to efficiently explore possible values of `x`.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use a DP table to track the maximum sum achievable from each bit position, considering whether the current prefix of bits matches the prefix of `m` (tight constraint) or not (loose constraint).\n\n4. **Binary String Processing**: The binary string representation of `m` is processed from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). At each step, we decide whether to set the current bit to 0 or 1 based on the constraints and the values in the array `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        print('')\n        return\n    n_line = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a_line = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    s_line = input[idx].strip()\n    \n    n = int(n_line)\n    a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n    s = s_line\n    \n    # Precompute the a_value for each position in the string s\n    # For pos in s (0-based), the original bit position is (n-1 - pos)\n    # So a_value = a[n-1 - pos]\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    # We'll use two variables for the previous and current states\n    # Since we process from the end to start, we can use two arrays for dp[pos][0] and dp[pos][1]\n    # But for space optimization, we can use two variables for the current and next state\n    \n    # We'll use a 2D array for dp[pos][is_tight], where pos ranges from 0 to n, and is_tight is 0 or 1\n    # However, for n up to 1e5, using a list of lists may be memory intensive.
