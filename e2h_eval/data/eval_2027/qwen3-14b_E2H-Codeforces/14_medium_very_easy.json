    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros. For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For n=5, the count is 1. For n=6, it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly up to 9. Then at 10, it's 2 (floor(10/5) + floor(10/25) = 2+0=2). So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Hence 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key is to find the range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. But how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that would give exactly m zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's call this lower_n.\n2. Then find the maximum n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Call it upper_n.\n3. If such numbers exist, then the count is upper_n - lower_n + 1. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nBut how to find these lower_n and upper_n?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the smallest n where the count is >= m, and check if the count is exactly m. But maybe there's no such n. Wait, but the problem says m is given, and we need to find the numbers n that have exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where the count is >= m. But then, if the count for that n is more than m, then there's no solution. But if it's exactly m, then there's a range of numbers.\n\nWait, but the count of trailing zeros increases as n increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then the count increases by 1. But if n is a multiple of 25, then the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So, for some n, the count jumps by more than 1. This implies that there are some m values for which there are no n's. For example, if m is 5, let's see:\n\nLet me calculate the trailing zeros for n=24: 24//5 =4, 24//25=0 → total 4. For n=25, it's 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So m=5 is not achievable. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nTherefore, the problem requires checking whether there exists any n such that the count is exactly m. If yes, then find the range of such n's.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- For a given m, find the smallest n where the count is >=m. Let's call this n_low.\n- Then check if the count for n_low is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions.\n- Otherwise, find the largest n where the count is exactly m. The numbers between n_low and that largest n are the possible answers.\n\nBut how to find the largest n with count exactly m?\n\nAlternatively, since the count increases as n increases, once the count exceeds m, there's no way to get back. So for a given m, there can be a range of n's where the count is exactly m. However, if the count jumps over m (like in the case of m=5), then there's no solution.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Use binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this n_min.\n2. Check if count_zeros(n_min) == m. If not, return 0.\n3. Then find the largest n where count_zeros(n) == m. Let's call it n_max.\n4. The answer is all numbers from n_min to n_max inclusive. The count is n_max - n_min + 1.\n\nBut how to find n_max? Well, since count_zeros(n) increases with n, once it reaches m, it will stay at m until the next multiple of 5. For example, in the sample where m=1, the count is 1 for n=5,6,7,8,9. Then for n=10, it's 2. So the n_max is 9. How can I find that?\n\nAlternatively, the n_max can be found by finding the first n where count_zeros(n) > m, then subtracting 1. Because once count_zeros(n) exceeds m, the previous n would be the last one with count m.\n\nSo for example, for m=1:\n\nFind the first n where count_zeros(n) > m. That's 10, which gives 2. Then n_max is 10-1=9.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Find the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call it n_min. If count_zeros(n_min) != m, then return 0.\n\n- Then find the first n where count_zeros(n) > m. Let's call it n_upper. Then the n_max is n_upper - 1.\n\nThus, the numbers from n_min to n_max are the valid ones.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor a given m, find n_min and n_upper.\n\nBut how to compute these?\n\nWe can use binary search for both steps.\n\nFirst, to find n_min (the first occurrence where count_zeros(n) >= m).\n\nThen find n_upper (the first occurrence where count_zeros(n) > m).\n\nThen check if count_zeros(n_min) == m. If yes, then the answer is the numbers from n_min to n_upper - 1.\n\nBut how to compute count_zeros(n)?\n\nThe function count_zeros(n) is straightforward: sum n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the term is zero.\n\nNow, the binary search part. Let's think about the possible range for n.\n\nThe minimum possible n for which count_zeros(n) >= m is somewhere between 0 and 5*m. Because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5. So for example, if m is 1, the minimal n is 5. For m=2, it's 10. But wait, for m=5, the count for 25 is 6, so maybe the upper bound for binary search needs to be higher. Alternatively, perhaps the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Because for m=5, 5*5=25. The count_zeros(25) is 6. Which is larger than m. So maybe the upper bound can be 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps even better to set the upper bound as 5*m. Because for any m, the number of trailing zeros for 5*m is at least m. Because for example, 5*m divided by 5 is m, and then higher terms contribute more. So for example, m=1, 5*1=5. count_zeros(5) is 1. For m=5, 5*5=25, count_zeros(25) is 6. Which is greater than m=5. So the upper bound can be 5*m.\n\nBut for cases where m is very large, like 1e5, 5*1e5 is 5e5, which is manageable for binary search.\n\nSo, the binary search for finding the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for the second part.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThen, for the given m, perform binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nBut what if there is no such n? Well, since m is given as up to 1e5, and for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. So there must be such n.\n\nOnce we find n_min, check if count_zeros(n_min) == m. If not, then there are no solutions. For example, when m=5, the n_min would be 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6. So in that case, there's no n with exactly 5 zeros. Hence, the answer is zero.\n\nOtherwise, find n_upper, which is the first n where count_zeros(n) > m. Then the numbers from n_min to n_upper -1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo how to find n_upper? It's the same as finding the first n where count_zeros(n) > m. Then the upper bound for this binary search can be 5*(m+1), or something similar.\n\nOnce we have n_upper, then the maximum n is n_upper -1.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, n is positive. So for m=0, the answer is 1 (n=1?), but the input constraints say m is at least 1. So the input m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nCompute n_min as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(n_min) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute n_upper as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m.\n\nThen the numbers are from n_min to n_upper -1.\n\nThe count is (n_upper -1 -n_min +1) = n_upper - n_min.\n\nSo the answer is [n_upper - n_min] numbers, from n_min to n_upper -1.\n\nSo now, the problem is to implement the binary search functions.\n\nLet me think about the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search for this can be done between low=0 and high=5*m.\n\nWait, but for m=1, the minimal n is 5. For m=5, the minimal n is 25 (but count_zeros(25) is 6, which is larger than m=5, so in that case, there's no solution).\n\nSo the binary search for the first occurrence of count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe standard approach for binary search for the first occurrence.\n\nSimilarly for the second part.\n\nSo, for example, for the first part:\n\nlow = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nInitialize answer as some value.\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   current = count_zeros(mid)\n\n   if current >= m:\n\n       possible answer is mid, and try to find a smaller one.\n\n       high = mid -1\n\n   else:\n\n       low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, low would be the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Wait, maybe not. Let me think about the binary search logic.\n\nActually, the standard way to find the first occurrence where the condition is met.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we are looking for the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nInitially, low = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nInitially, the answer is set to some value (maybe high).\n\nBut during the binary search, whenever the current mid meets the condition, we can try to find a smaller n. So, the code would be:\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5*m\n\n    ans = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt >= m:\n\n            ans = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return ans\n\nSo after the loop, ans is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Because whenever the condition is met, we try to find a smaller one.\n\nOnce we get that ans, we check if count_zeros(ans) == m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, we need to find the first n where count_zeros(n) > m. Let's call that n_upper.\n\nSimilarly, we can perform another binary search for that.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of count_zeros(n) > m.\n\nThe code for that would be:\n\ndef find_upper_n(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5*m\n\n    ans = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt > m:\n\n            ans = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return ans\n\nWait, but this code would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m. Because in the binary search, when cnt > m, we try to find a smaller n that satisfies the condition. So the ans would be the minimal n where the count is >m.\n\nBut then, the upper bound for the binary search may need to be adjusted. For example, when m is 1, the upper n is 10, because count_zeros(10) is 2>1. So the first occurrence is 10.\n\nBut for the case where m=1, the minimal n_upper is 10.\n\nOnce we have n_upper, the maximum n is n_upper -1. So the numbers from n_min to n_upper -1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nOnce n_min is found, check if count_zeros(n_min) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find n_upper as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m. Then the valid numbers are from n_min to n_upper-1.\n\nSo the count is (n_upper -1 - n_min +1) = n_upper - n_min.\n\nSo the list is [n_min, n_min+1, ..., n_upper-1].\n\nBut what if n_upper is not found? For example, if m is very large, but the code for find_upper_n returns something?\n\nWell, the high is set to 5*m. But for m=1, the upper n is 10. 5*m is 5*1=5. Wait, but that's not enough. Because 5*1 is 5, but the minimal n_upper for m=1 is 10. So in that case, the initial high of 5*m is not sufficient.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So the upper bound for the binary search is not correct. Because for the first part, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is up to 5*m. But for the second part, the minimal n_upper where count_zeros(n) >m could be higher than 5*m?\n\nWait, let's take m=1. The minimal n_upper is 10. 5*m is 5. So the high in the binary search for find_upper_n is 5. But the actual n_upper is 10, which is outside the high. So the code would not find it.\n\nThat's a problem. So the initial choice of high as 5*m is not sufficient for the second binary search.\n\nSo how to choose the upper bound for the binary search?\n\nHmm. Let me think again. What's the maximum possible value for n_upper?\n\nFor m, the minimal n_upper is the first n where count_zeros(n) > m.\n\nBut count_zeros(n) is approximately n/5 + n/25 + ... which is roughly n/4. So for count_zeros(n) > m, n must be larger than 4m. So perhaps the upper bound can be 5*(m+1), or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the upper bound, we can use 5*(m+1). Because for example, for m=1, 5*(m+1) is 10, which is exactly the n_upper. For m=5, the n_upper would be 25 (count_zeros(25)=6>5). So 5*(m+1) is 5*6=30. Which is higher than 25. So that works.\n\nSo to make sure that the upper bound is sufficient, perhaps setting high to 5*(m+1) for both binary searches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the upper bound as 5*m * 5, but that's arbitrary. Let me think of a better approach.\n\nAnother approach: For the first binary search (finding n_min), the upper bound can be 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. For example, 5*m divided by 5 is m. So count_zeros(5m) is m + floor(5m/25) + ... which is >= m. So for the first binary search, the upper bound is 5*m.\n\nBut for the second binary search (finding the first n where count_zeros(n) > m), the upper bound should be higher. For example, for m=1, the upper bound needs to be at least 10. So 5*m is 5, which is too small. So perhaps the upper bound can be 5*(m+1). Let's check:\n\nFor m=1, 5*(m+1) is 10. Which is correct. For m=5, 5*(5+1) =30. For n=30, count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7>5. So the upper bound is sufficient.\n\nSo for the second binary search, the upper bound can be 5*(m+1). Or even higher. So in code, for both binary searches, the upper bound can be set as 5*(m+1). But perhaps even better, for the second binary search, we can set the upper bound as 5*(m+1) or 5*m*2, whichever is easier.\n\nAlternatively, for both binary searches, set the upper bound as 5*(m+1). Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nFor the first binary search (find_min_n), high is 5*m.\n\nFor the second binary search (find_upper_n), high is 5*(m+1).\n\nBut perhaps in code, for the second binary search, the high can be 5*(m+1) or even 5*m*2. But for the purpose of code, perhaps we can set high as 5*m*5 or something like that. But to avoid errors, perhaps the code can use a higher upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the upper bound can be set as 5*m * 5. But regardless, for the binary search, the code would work as long as the upper bound is sufficiently large.\n\nSo let's adjust the code for the find_upper_n function. Let's set high to 5*(m+1). But what if m is zero? Well, since m is at least 1, per the input constraints.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef find_upper_n(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5*(m+1)\n\n    ans = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt > m:\n\n            ans = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return ans\n\nSo with this, for m=1, the high is 10. So the binary search would find 10 as the first n where count_zeros(n) > m.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1):\n\nbinary search between 0 and 5*1=5.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nInitially low=0, high=5, ans=-1.\n\nmid = (0+5)//2=2. count_zeros(2) is 0 <1 → low=3.\n\nmid=(3+5)/2=4 → count_zeros(4)=0 <1 → low=5.\n\nmid=(5+5)/2=5 → count_zeros(5)=1 >=1. So ans=5, high=4.\n\nNow low=5, high=4 → loop ends. return 5.\n\nCheck count_zeros(5) is 1 == m → yes.\n\nThen find_upper_n(1):\n\nhigh is 5*(1+1) =10.\n\nbinary search between 0 and 10.\n\nLooking for first n where count_zeros(n) >1.\n\nInitially low=0, high=10, ans=-1.\n\nmid=5 → count_zeros(5)=1 → not >1. So low=6.\n\nmid=(6+10)/2=8 → count_zeros(8)=1 → low=9.\n\nmid=(9+10)/2=9.5 → 9.5 is 9 in integer division. count_zeros(9) is 1 → low=10.\n\nmid=10 → count_zeros(10)=2>1. So ans=10, high=9. Loop ends. return 10.\n\nThus, n_upper is 10. So the valid numbers are from 5 to 10-1=9. So 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5): binary search between 0 and 5*5=25.\n\nWhat's the count_zeros(25) is 6. So the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25? Or earlier?\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor n=24, count_zeros(24) is 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 → 4. So less than 5. So the first n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. So find_min_n returns 25. Check count_zeros(25) is 6 which is not equal to m=5. Hence, output is zero.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(6) would be 25 (count_zeros(25)=6). So check that. Then find_upper_n(6) would be the first n where count_zeros(n) >6. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(26) is also 6. ... up to 29. At 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → total 7>6. So the first n_upper is 30. So the valid numbers are 25 to 29. So 5 numbers. So the answer is 5, and the numbers 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python.\n\nFirst, read m from input. But the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, the original problem's input is a single integer m. The example shows that the input is given as ['1', '5'] but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows that for the first case, input is ['1', '5']? Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Because the problem says that the input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows two cases, perhaps indicating that the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is a single integer. Maybe the sample is for multiple test cases, but the actual code should process a single m.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. The sample input may be showing two test cases. For example, the first input is 1, and output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So in the code, perhaps the input is read as a single integer.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nThis may be a formatting error. Perhaps the sample input is for two separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted. But the problem's note says that the first sample input is m=1, and output is 5 followed by the numbers, and the second sample input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the input is a single line containing m. So the code should read m from stdin.\n\nSo the code would read m as an integer.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_min via binary search.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(n_min) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute n_upper via binary search.\n\nThen the numbers are from n_min to n_upper-1.\n\nThe count is n_upper - n_min.\n\nSo the code would generate the list of numbers from n_min to n_upper-1.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, implement find_min_n(m):\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m\n\n    ans = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt >= m:\n\n            ans = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return ans\n\nSimilarly for find_upper_n(m):\n\ndef find_upper_n(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * (m +1)\n\n    ans = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt > m:\n\n            ans = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return ans\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead m from input. For example, m = int(input())\n\nThen:\n\nn_min = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_min) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n_upper = find_upper_n(m)\n\n    k = n_upper - n_min\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_min, n_upper))))\n\nWait, but the numbers are from n_min to n_upper-1 inclusive. So the range is [n_min, n_upper-1]. So in Python, range(n_min, n_upper) would generate numbers from n_min to n_upper-1.\n\nYes. So the code would generate that.\n\nTesting with the sample input m=1:\n\nn_min is 5, n_upper is 10. So range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=5. find_min_n(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. n_min is 25, count_zeros(25)=6. Then find_upper_n(6) is 30. So numbers from 25 to 29. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5, so no need to handle that.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the code would return 0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where m=0: but input constraints don't allow it.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1, which is handled.\n\nAnother case: m=2.\n\nLet's compute n_min and n_upper.\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. So for m=2, n_min is 10. Then find_upper_n(2) is the first n where count_zeros(n) >2. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. count_zeros(11) is 2. ... count_zeros(14) is 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So the first n_upper is 15. So numbers from 10 to 14. So 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nSo code would generate that.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when the upper bound is not sufficient? For example, m=1e5. Let's see, but the code uses high=5*(m+1) for the upper_n function. Which for m=1e5, it's 5*(1e5+1) = 500005. Which is manageable.\n\nBut what if the actual n_upper is higher than that?\n\nWell, for example, if m is such that the count_zeros(5*(m+1)) is still <=m. Then the binary search would not find the correct n_upper. But is that possible?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose m is some value where the count_zeros(5*(m+1)) is still <=m. How?\n\nFor example, let's take m=5. 5*(m+1) is 30. count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 +1 =7>5. So the code would find n_upper as 25?\n\nNo. For m=5, the find_upper_n function is looking for the first n where count_zeros(n) >5. The first such n is 25? No. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the first n_upper is 25. So for m=5, the code for find_upper_n would return 25. Because in the binary search for find_upper_n, the high is 5*(5+1)=30. So during the binary search, the code would find 25 as the first n where count_zeros(n) >5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6. The find_upper_n(6) is 30. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for the case where m is 0, but the code is not handling it. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m from input. Let's write the code.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code should read m from stdin, process it, and output the required answer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, no. The original problem says that the input is a single integer m. The sample input shows something different, perhaps due to formatting. But the code should read from stdin as a single integer.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= m:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return ans\n\ndef find_upper_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m +1)\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > m:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return ans\n\nm = int(input())\nn_min = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_min) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_upper = find_upper_n(m)\n    k = n_upper - n_min\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_min, n_upper))))\n\nWait, but for the case when k is zero? For example, when n_upper is equal to n_min. But in that case, the range would be empty. But that's impossible because count_zeros(n_min) is m, and n_upper is the first n where count_zeros(n) >m. So n_upper must be at least n_min +1.\n\nBut let's think. For example, if m is such that there's exactly one n (n_min) which has count_zeros(n) =m. Then n_upper is the first n where count_zeros(n) >m. So for example, if m=6, and n_upper is 30 (count_zeros(30)=7). Then the numbers are from 25 to 29. So the code would generate 5 numbers. But what if m is such that n_upper is n_min +1?\n\nLike for example, m=2. Suppose n_upper is 15. n_min is 10. So 15-10=5 numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what if m is such that the count_zeros(n) jumps from m to m+2? For example, m=5. Suppose there is no n with count_zeros(n) =5. Then the code would output zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nThe code would output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5.\n\nThe code would output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. Output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. Output is 5 numbers 10-14.\n\nAnother test case: m=0. But the code would read m=0, but according to the problem statement, m is >=1. So no need to handle.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nThe code may take O(log(5*m)) time for each binary search, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the code as per the problem's instructions.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So the code is written accordingly.\n\nBut the sample input in the problem seems to have multiple test cases, but according to the problem's input description, the input is a single integer. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, but the code is written for a single test case.\n\nThus, the code is as written above.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nThe code outputs 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5. Outputs 0.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nThe output is 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. Output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values of `n` that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Range**: Use binary search to efficiently find the smallest `n` (let's call it `n_min`) such that the count of trailing zeros is at least `m`. Then, find the smallest `n` (let's call it `n_upper`) such that the count of trailing zeros exceeds `m`.\n3. **Check Validity**: If the count of trailing zeros at `n_min` is exactly `m`, then the valid range of `n` values is from `n_min` to `n_upper - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= m:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return ans\n\ndef find_upper_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > m:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return ans\n\nm = int(input())\nn_min = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_min) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_upper = find_upper_n(m)\n    k = n_upper - n_min\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_min, n_upper))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `m`.\n3. **find_upper_n(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` exceeds `m`.\n4. **Main Logic**: After determining `n_min` and `n_upper`, we check if `n_min` indeed results in exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, we print `0`. Otherwise, we compute the range of valid `n` values and print the count followed by the values themselves.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `n` using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `m` up to 100,000.",
