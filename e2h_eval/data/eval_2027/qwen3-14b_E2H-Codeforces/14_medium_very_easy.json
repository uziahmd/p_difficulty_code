    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's think about how the count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, adding 1 to n would add one more 5. But if it's a multiple of 25, then adding 1 would add two 5s. Wait, no. The count for n=24 is floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 = 4. For n=25, it's 5 + 1 = 6. So when you cross a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1 (if it's a multiple of 5 but not 25), or more if it's a higher power. So the count can jump by more than 1. Which means that for some m, there may be no n's. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there are 5 numbers (like in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9). Wait, in the sample input, m was 1, and the output was 5 numbers. Wait, the first sample input is m=1, and the output is 5 numbers. Let me check that.\n\nWait in the example given, the input is '1' and the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's see:\n\n5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! 5040 (1), etc. So all those numbers have exactly 1 trailing zero. So why does that happen? Because when n increases from 4 to 5, the count increases by 1 (from 0 to 1). Then, for n=5,6,7,8,9, the count remains 1 until n=10, which adds another 5 (so count becomes 2). So between 5 and 9, there are 5 numbers. So that's why the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key idea is that for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe more? Wait, how?\n\nBut the problem is to find all n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. How to find them?\n\nFirst, we need to find the possible n's where the count is exactly m. Let's think of the count function as f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWe need to find all n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how do we find these n's?\n\nThe approach I remember is that for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose m is such that there exists some n where f(n) = m. Then, the numbers n that satisfy this are consecutive? Or not?\n\nWell, for example, if m is 5. Let's compute f(24) = 4 + 0 = 4. f(25) = 5 + 1 = 6. So there's no n where f(n) is 5. So for m=5, the answer is 0. But for m=6, there are numbers. So in that case, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the first step is to find if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If not, output 0. Otherwise, find all such n's.\n\nSo how to find the possible n's?\n\nThe idea is to find the lower and upper bounds of n for which f(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about binary search. For a given m, we can find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's must lie in a certain range. Let me think: For example, if there exists an n such that f(n) = m, then there must be a range of numbers where f(n) is m. However, since f(n) increases as n increases, but sometimes jumps by more than 1. So, for example, if there's a jump from m-1 to m+1, then there's no n with exactly m zeros.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers after that where f(n) is still m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find those bounds?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Then all numbers between min and max are valid. But how to find these?\n\nBut how to find if such n exists?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call this low. Then check if f(low) is equal to m. If not, then there is no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high. Then the numbers from low to high-1 will have f(n) = m. So the count is high - low.\n\nWait, but how does that work?\n\nLet me take the sample input. For m=1, the minimal n where f(n) >= 1 is 5. Then the minimal n where f(n) >= 2 is 10. So high is 10. Then the numbers between 5 and 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's find the minimal n where f(n) >=5. Let's compute:\n\nn=20: f(20) = 4 + 0 = 4? No. Wait, f(20) is 20//5 + 20//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. n=25: 25//5 + 25//25 =5 + 1 =6. So for m=5, the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25? No, because for n=24, f(24) is 24//5=4, 24//25=0. So total 4. So the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25, but f(25) is 6. So that's greater than m=5. Hence, there is no n with exactly 5 trailing zeros. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call it lower.\n\n- Check if f(lower) is equal to m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call it upper.\n\n- The count is upper - lower.\n\nSo the numbers from lower to upper-1 are all the numbers with exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how to find lower and upper?\n\nWe can use binary search for that. Because f(n) is a non-decreasing function. So for example, for a given target, we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given m, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Check if count_zeros(low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high.\n\n4. The answer is the numbers from low to high-1, inclusive. The count is high - low.\n\nSo the number of values is high - low.\n\nBut how to implement the binary search for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target?\n\nLet me think about the binary search.\n\nThe minimal n for which count_zeros(n) >= target can be found by binary search between 0 and 5*target (since for n=5*target, count_zeros(n) is at least target).\n\nWait, for example, for target m, the minimal n is somewhere between 0 and 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one, and there are m multiples of 5 in 5m). Well, perhaps even more precise. But for binary search, we can set the upper limit as 5*m, but perhaps even higher. But for m up to 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target would be:\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*target.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n      high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid + 1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nOnce we have that, proceed as before.\n\nSo for the problem, the steps are:\n\nGiven m, compute low = find_min_n(m), check if count_zeros(low) == m. If not, output 0. Else compute high = find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers from low to high-1 are the solutions.\n\nBut wait, what if m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample input m=1:\n\nfind_min_n(1) is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So yes.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10. So the numbers are 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=5. find_min_n(5) is 25? Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6. So that's not equal to m=5. So output 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. find_min_n(6) is 25, since count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) is 25? Let's see. Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6. So for target=7, the minimal n is 25? No, because count_zeros(25) is 6 <7. So the binary search would look for higher numbers. Let's compute for n=25, count is 6. For n=26, same as 25. For n=30, count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7. So the minimal n for target=7 is 25? No. Wait, 25 gives 6, 26 gives 6, ..., 29 gives 6, 30 gives 7. So the minimal n for target=7 is 30. So find_min_n(7) is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29 (since high is 30) would be 25,26,27,28,29. That's 5 numbers. So for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem requires to output all such n's in increasing order. So once we have the low and high, the numbers are from low to high-1. So the count is high - low. So if that is zero, then output 0, else output the numbers.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nSo, first, the count_zeros function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way to compute the number of trailing zeros.\n\nThen, the function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for some targets, 5*target might not be sufficient. Let me think. For example, if target is 1, 5*target is 5. Which is correct. For target=6, 5*6=30, which is correct. For target= m=1e5, 5*1e5 is 5e5. Let's see, the count_zeros(5e5) would be 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + ... which is more than 1e5. So yes, 5*target is sufficient as an upper bound.\n\nBut perhaps even higher. But for binary search, the upper bound can be 5*target. So this should work.\n\nOnce we have that, the code for the problem is:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(low) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from low to high-1, inclusive.\n\nSo the count is high - low. Then output the count and the numbers.\n\nBut what if high is not found? Well, for m+1, the find_min_n will return a value, since for any m, there exists some n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nSo, for example, if m is very large, but the code can handle it.\n\nNow, let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample input m=1:\n\nlow = find_min_n(1) = 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nhigh = find_min_n(2) = 10.\n\nso numbers are 5 to 9. Output 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5, which returns 0.\n\nSo the code would process that.\n\nNow, the code needs to read m from input, then process.\n\nBut the input is given as a list, like in the example, but the actual input is a single integer m. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput is a single integer m. The example shows input as ['1', '5'], but that's probably part of the test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as:\n\nInput\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut that's probably because the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given. But the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which probably represents two test cases. However, the user's code needs to read from standard input. So perhaps the example is showing that for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for m=5, output is '0'.\n\nBut the user's code needs to read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute the numbers as per the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut let's code this.\n\nBut first, for the case when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so no need to handle.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlow = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    numbers = list(range(low, high))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the first line is the count, then the numbers. So the code for the else part:\n\nprint(len(numbers))\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nBut in the sample, the first line is 5, then the numbers.\n\nBut for the code, when m=1, the numbers are from 5 to 9 inclusive. So range(low, high) is 5,6,7,8,9. Because high is 10. So range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. So that's correct.\n\nBut in Python, range is exclusive of the upper bound. So yes.\n\nBut what about when high is 10, then range(low, high) is 5 to 9 inclusive. So the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test for m=6.\n\nlow is 25, high is 30. So numbers from 25 to 29. So len is 5. So the code would output 5 and the numbers.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there are multiple numbers?\n\nBut now, what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m starts at 1.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the code would not handle it, but the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nNow, let's test the code for m=5. Let's compute:\n\nlow = find_min_n(5). Let's see:\n\ntarget is 5. So find_min_n(5) would search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=20: count_zeros(20) is 4. n=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So during the binary search, the code would find that the minimal n is 25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. low is 25, count_zeros(25) is 6. Then high is find_min_n(7) which is 30. So numbers from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=2. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then find_min_n(3) is 15. So numbers from 10 to 14. Which are 5 numbers. Let's check:\n\n10! has 2 zeros. 11! also 2, 12! 2, 13! 2, 14! 2. 15! is 3. So yes, 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about m=3?\n\nfind_min_n(3) is 15? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0. Total 3). So yes. Then find_min_n(4) is 20. Because count_zeros(20) is 4. So numbers from 15 to 19. Which is 5 numbers. So 15,16,17,18,19. So yes.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's only one n? For example, when m is 24?\n\nLet me think. Let's take m=24. Let's find the numbers.\n\nWhat's the count_zeros(99)? Let's compute:\n\n99//5 = 19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0. Total 22. Not enough.\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24 (100/5=20, 100/25=4, 100/125=0. Total 24). So for m=24, low is 100. Then find_min_n(25) is 100? Let's see. count_zeros(100) is 24. So for target 25, the minimal n is 100? No, because count_zeros(100) is 24 <25. So the code would search higher. Let's compute for 105: count_zeros(105) is 21 (105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25? 21+4=25. Yes. So the minimal n for target 25 is 105. So the numbers for m=24 are from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 numbers.\n\nSo in that case, the code works.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there's only one number? Let's think of m=25. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 25. Then find_min_n(25) is 105. Then find_min_n(26) is 110?\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(110) is 110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0. Total 26. So yes. So numbers from 105 to 109. Which is 5 numbers. So again, 5 numbers.\n\nWait, but why? Because for every m, there are 5 numbers? Or not?\n\nNo. For example, when m is 24, there are 5 numbers. For m=25, 5 numbers. But what about when the next number jumps by more than 1?\n\nLet me think of m= 5. Let's say, but there's no solution. So output is 0.\n\nBut when there is a solution, there are 5 numbers?\n\nWait, what about m= 4?\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4. Then find_min_n(4) is 20. Then find_min_n(5) is 25. So numbers from 20 to 24. Which is 5 numbers. So 20,21,22,23,24. All have 4 trailing zeros. Let's check:\n\n20! has 4 zeros. 21! same, 22!, 23!, 24! all have 4. Then 25! has 6. So yes, 5 numbers.\n\nSo why is that? Because when you cross a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1. But when you cross a multiple of 25, it increases by 2. So when there's a jump of 2, then for m=5, there's no solution. But for other cases, the numbers between the previous and next steps are 5 numbers.\n\nBut why 5?\n\nBecause the step between the minimal n and the next step is 5. For example, in the case where the count increases by 1, the next step is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nSo the code would generate the correct numbers.\n\nNow, the code needs to read m from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case is m=1, which outputs 5 numbers. The code would output 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nBut in the sample output, it's written as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the first line is the count, then the second line is the numbers.\n\nSo the code should print the count, then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, when the code is in the else clause, it prints len(numbers) and then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, the code for the else part is:\n\nprint(len(numbers))\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nBut in Python, the first print statement would add a newline. So for example, for the sample input, the output would be:\n\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct. But the sample output shows '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is the same.\n\nBut in the problem statement's sample output, the first line is the count, and then the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut for the case where the count is 0, the code prints 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1, so no need to handle.\n\nNow, the code can be written.\n\nBut in the code, the find_min_n function may take O(log(5m)) steps. For m up to 1e5, 5m is 5e5, and each step involves O(log n) steps for count_zeros. So the code is efficient enough.\n\nNow, testing for m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code returns 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nAnother test case: m=24. The code returns 5 numbers: 100-104.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when m is given as input, and the code is written in Python, the code should read from stdin, and write to stdout.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m from input. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlow = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    numbers = list(range(low, high))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but for the case where the numbers are empty? Well, if low is found and count_zeros(low) == m, then high is find_min_n(m+1). Since m+1 is larger than m, the high will be at least low + something. So the numbers list will have elements.\n\nBut what if m is very large and the high is low + 1? For example, if m is such that there's only one number. But according to our previous analysis, there are 5 numbers. But maybe not?\n\nWait, let's take m= 24, and the code returns 5 numbers. But what about m= 25?\n\nLet me compute for m=25:\n\nlow = find_min_n(25). Let's compute count_zeros(105) is 25 (as earlier). Then find_min_n(25) returns 105. Then find_min_n(26) returns 110. So the numbers are 105 to 109. 5 numbers. So yes.\n\nAnother case: m= 2. Let's see.\n\nSo the code returns 5 numbers. So the code seems to work.\n\nBut what if the code returns numbers with length 0? Well, that can't happen, because if count_zeros(low) is m, then high is find_min_n(m+1), which is >= low. So the numbers list is from low to high-1, which is at least one element. Because if low is such that count_zeros(low) = m, then for high, which is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So for example, if low is the only n with count_zeros(n) = m, then high would be low+1. Because count_zeros(low+1) is m+1. So numbers would be [low], and len is 1. But according to our previous examples, that's not happening. Why?\n\nBecause for example, if there is a jump of 2 in count_zeros. Let's think of m=5. Suppose there is no solution, but if m=6, then there are 5 numbers. But what if there is a case where there is only one n?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the count_zeros(n) jumps from m-1 to m+1. For example, suppose m=5, and there is no solution. But if m=6, and there is only one n where count_zeros(n) =6?\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of n=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then for n=26, 27, 28, 29, count_zeros is 6. For n=30, count_zeros is 7. So there are 5 numbers (25-29) for m=6. So that's 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m= 3. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3. Then count_zeros(16) is 3, ..., 19: 3. 20: 4. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo why is there always 5 numbers when there is at least one?\n\nBecause when the count_zeros increases by 1, there are 5 numbers. When it increases by more than 1, then there are zero numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nBut what if there is a case where there is only one number? Let's imagine that.\n\nLet me think of m= 4. For n=20, count_zeros is 4. Then for n=21, 22, 23, 24, count_zeros is 4. Then for n=25, it's 6. So there are 5 numbers (20-24). So yes.\n\nBut what if for some m, the next number after low is such that the count_zeros increases by 2. Then, the numbers between low and high-1 would be 5 numbers?\n\nNo. Let me think. For example, m=6. Suppose that for n=25, count_zeros is 6. For n=26, count_zeros is 6. For n=27, same. For n=28, same. For n=29, same. For n=30, count_zeros is 7. So the numbers are 25-29 (5 numbers). So yes.\n\nSo regardless of the jump, when there is a solution, there are exactly 5 numbers. Wait, but why? Because the next jump is when you reach a multiple of 5. For example, between n=5 and n=9, the count_zeros increases by 1. So there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to generate 5 numbers when there is a solution. But why?\n\nBecause the code finds the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m, and then the next jump is at some point. So the numbers between that minimal n and the next jump are 5 numbers.\n\nBut why 5?\n\nBecause the next jump occurs when you reach the next multiple of 5. For example, for the minimal n being a multiple of 5, but not of 25. Then, the next jump is when you reach the next multiple of 5. So between n and n+4, the count_zeros remains the same. So there are 5 numbers.\n\nBut if the minimal n is a multiple of 25, then the count_zeros increases by 2. So for example, n=25, which is 5*5. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then, for n=26, the count_zeros is 6. For n=29, same. For n=30, count_zeros is 7 (because 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7). So the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo in all cases, when there is a solution, there are exactly 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if the minimal n is 5*something, but the next jump is after 5 steps?\n\nYes. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the code doesn't handle it, but the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input: m=1. Output is 5 numbers.\n\nSample input m=5: output is 0.\n\nNow, the code for m=5:\n\nlow = find_min_n(5). Let's see:\n\nbinary search for target=5. The code will find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5. Which is 25, since count_zeros(25) is 6. So check count_zeros(25) ==5? No. So output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written as per the problem's instructions.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: For a given $ m $, we use binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $. We then check if this value actually results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: If there exists such an $ n $, we find the smallest integer where the trailing zeros exceed $ m $. The valid $ n $ values lie between these two bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlow = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    numbers = list(range(low, high))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by powers of 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target value. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the search space.\n3. **Main Logic**: The main part of the code reads the input $ m $, uses the `find_min_n` function to determine the smallest $ n $ with at least $ m $ trailing zeros. It then checks if this $ n $ indeed has exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it finds the upper bound for $ m+1 $ and lists all valid $ n $ values between these bounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
