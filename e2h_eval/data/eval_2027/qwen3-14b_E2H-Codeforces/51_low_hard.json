Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input. The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name. The third line is the pile of letters found. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the first two names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host names. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenation of the first two strings (guest + host) has the same character count as the third string (the pile). If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nHmm. So, for example, take the first sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS, Host: DEDMOROZ. Combined, their letters should be SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's see, maybe when sorted, they are the same.\n\nWait, but how to check that? Well, one way is to take the combined string of guest and host, sort the characters, and compare it with the sorted pile string. If they are the same, then output YES, else NO.\n\nYes. Because sorting both and comparing would check if they have the same characters in the same counts.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Check if the sorted version of this concatenated string is equal to the sorted version of the third line.\n4. If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the lengths are different? For example, if the sum of the lengths of the first two lines is not equal to the length of the third line. In that case, we can immediately return NO. Because even if the sorted strings are same, but the lengths differ, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but the sorted strings would have different lengths. So checking the sorted strings would automatically account for that. For example, if the concatenated string is length 5 and the pile is length 6, then their sorted versions would be different. So maybe checking the sorted strings is sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps checking the lengths first would be a quick way to return NO early. For example, if the sum of the lengths of the first two strings is not equal to the length of the third string, then it's impossible. So adding that check first could save some processing time, but for the problem constraints (each line up to 100 chars), it's negligible. But it's better to do that check first.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCheck if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile). If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nYes. That makes sense.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the three lines. Let's say, guest = input().strip(), host = input().strip(), pile = input().strip().\n\nThen, check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, print NO.\n\nElse, check if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile). If yes, print YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input given, let's look at the first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\nSo guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nLet me compute the lengths:\n\nlen(guest) is 10 (S A N T A C L A U S) ?\n\nWait SANTACLAUS: Let's count letters. S(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), A(5), C(6), L(7), A(8), U(9), S(10). Yes, 10 letters.\n\nHost is DEDMOROZ. Let's count: D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z. That's 8 letters. So total length is 10+8=18.\n\nPile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S. Let me count:\n\nBreaking down the pile string: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\nLet me count each character. But perhaps the length is 18. Let's see:\n\nThe sample says that the first case outputs YES. So the lengths must match.\n\nSo the code would check that.\n\n",
