Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. The other diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check if all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check if all elements not on the diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'o'.\n3. Ensure that 'd' is not equal to 'o'.\n\nBut how do I check these conditions?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to iterate through the diagonals.\n\nFor a cell (i, j) in 0-based indices:\n\n- It's on the main diagonal if i == j.\n- It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo for each cell in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal. For those cells, they must all be the same. For the others, they must be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the characters on the diagonals and the others.\n\nLet me think:\n\nFirst, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the other characters and check they are all same and different.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the two diagonals have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is 'x' and the other is 'y', then the first condition fails.\n\nSo first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect them into a set. If the size of the set is not 1, then it's invalid. Also, the same for the non-diagonal characters.\n\nWait, but the two diagonals must have the same character. So, for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x' and the other diagonal has all 'x', then that's okay. But if the main has 'x' and the other has 'y', then the set would have size 2, which is invalid.\n\nSo, first step:\n\nCheck all cells on the diagonals. Collect all their characters. If they are not all the same, return NO.\n\nThen, check all non-diagonal cells. Collect their characters. If they are not all the same, return NO.\n\nThen, check that the diagonal character is different from the non-diagonal character.\n\nBut how to collect these.\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string of length n. Let's store as a grid, perhaps a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 → NO\n\nif len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1 → NO\n\nif diagonal_chars.pop() == non_diagonal_chars.pop() → NO\n\nElse YES.\n\nWait, but what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Like when n=1? But n is at least 3, so for n=3, there are cells not on the diagonals. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center is on both diagonals, but the other cells are on one or the other. Wait, for n=3, the diagonals are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, the middle cell (1,1) is on both diagonals. So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are those not on either diagonal. Let's see:\n\nFor i=0, j=1: i + j = 1, which is not equal to 2 (n-1 is 2). And i != j. So yes, non-diagonal. So for 3x3 grid, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So four cells. So for n=3, there are",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all cells on both diagonals must contain the same character, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same character different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: Collect all characters from both diagonals and ensure they are all the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Collect all characters not on the diagonals and ensure they are all the same.\n4. **Character Comparison**: Ensure that the characters on the diagonals are different from those not on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n    if d_char != nd_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Collecting Characters**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal or anti-diagonal), its character is added to `diagonal_chars`. Otherwise, it is added to `non_diagonal_chars`.\n3. **Validation**: \n   - If the set of diagonal characters has more than one unique character, or the set of non-diagonal characters has more than one unique character, the answer is \"NO\".\n   - If the characters on the diagonals and non-diagonals are different, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations to ensure all characters on the diagonals and non-diagonals are uniform and distinct from each other.",
