Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\nFirst, check if all the elements on both diagonals are the same. Then, check that all the non-diagonal elements are the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). For each cell in these diagonals, we need to check if they are all the same.\n\nBut wait, for the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, their intersection is the center cell. So, for example, in a 5x5 grid, the center cell (2,2) is part of both diagonals. So when checking the diagonals, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are the same. So the diagonal letters must be the same across both diagonals. So, for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'x', then that's okay. But if one of them has a different letter, then it's invalid.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the two diagonals. Check that all of them are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n\nThen, check all the other cells (those not on either diagonal) are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it is on either diagonal. If it is, check that it's equal to the diagonal's character (which we can determine by checking the first diagonal cell, but need to make sure all are same).\n- For cells not on the diagonals, check that they are all same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect all positions on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.\n\nFor a grid of size n, the main diagonal is where row == column. The anti-diagonal is where row + column == n - 1.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on these positions. Then check that all of them are the same. Let's say that's the first check.\n\nThen, collect all the other characters (those not on the diagonals) and check that they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect these?\n\nLet me think about steps:\n\nStep 1: Check all diagonal elements are same.\n\nStep 2: Check all non-diagonal elements are same and different from diagonal's element.\n\nSo, first, let's get the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal element (0,0) as the reference. Then check that all other diagonal elements (both diagonals) are same as this.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a case where the main diagonal has all 'x', and the anti-diagonal has all 'x' as well. Then that's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'x' and the anti-diagonal is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo, for all cells in the diagonals, check that they are same as the first diagonal cell (for example, (0,0)).\n\nWait, but what if the first cell is part of both diagonals? Like in the case of n=3, (1,1) is part of both. But in any case, the first cell (0,0) is part of the main diagonal. So, for all cells in the diagonals, check that they are same as (0,0). But also, the (0,0) is part of the main diagonal, and (0, n-1) is part of the anti-diagonal. So, for example, if (0,0) is 'x' and (0, n-1) is 'y', then the diagonals are not same. So, the code needs to check that all diagonal cells are same.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal cells. Let's collect them into a set. If the size of the set is 1, then all are same. Otherwise, no.\n\nWait, but for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x' and the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all cells on both diagonals must contain the same letter, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all cells on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same character.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure that all cells not on the diagonals contain the same character, which is different from the character on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Collect diagonal characters\ndiag_chars = set()\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check if all diagonal characters are the same\nif len(diag_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check if non-diagonal characters are same and different from diagonal\n    if len(non_diag_chars) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if diag_chars.pop() != non_diag_chars.pop():\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Collecting Characters**: We use two sets to collect characters from the diagonals and non-diagonal cells. The diagonals are identified by checking if the row index equals the column index (main diagonal) or if the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (anti-diagonal).\n3. **Validation**: \n   - If the set of diagonal characters has more than one unique character, the answer is \"NO\".\n   - If the set of non-diagonal characters has more than one unique character, the answer is \"NO\".\n   - Finally, we check if the characters from the diagonals and non-diagonals are different. If they are, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions using set operations, making the solution both clear and optimal.",
