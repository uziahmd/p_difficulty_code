The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the construction rules again.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, every vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the previous step) must have k new vertices connected to them. And this step must be done at least once. Wait, so the process is:\n\nInitial step: 1 node.\n\nFirst expansion: connect the initial node to k new nodes. Now, total nodes is 1 + k. But then, each of those k nodes has degree 1 (they are connected only to the initial node). So the next step is to add k new nodes to each of them. So each of those k nodes gets k new children. So for each of the k nodes, we add k nodes. So the total nodes now is 1 + k + k*k. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that this step (adding k new nodes to each leaf node) should be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake for k=4 would be when we do this once. Let me think: initial node (1), then add 4 nodes (total 5). Then, each of those 4 nodes has k=4 new nodes. So adding 4*4=16 nodes. Total is 1+4+16=21? But the example given says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait, the example input includes n=13 as a YES. Let's see. How can 13 be formed?\n\nLet me think about the structure. The snowflake is built in such a way that each time you expand, you add layers. Let me model the number of nodes.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that the snowflake is constructed in m layers. The first layer is the root. Then, each layer adds more nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake can be represented as a tree where each node (except the leaves) has exactly k children. But the construction is such that the root has k children, and each of those children has k children, and so on. But the process must have at least one expansion step beyond the initial step. Wait, the initial step is adding the first level (the root's children). Then, the second step is adding children to each of those first-level nodes. And this step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two levels. For example:\n\n- Level 0: 1 node (root)\n- Level 1: k nodes (children of root)\n- Level 2: each of the level 1 nodes has k children. So total nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut according to the example, when n=13, it's possible. Let's see: suppose k=3. Then 1 +3 +9 = 13. Yes! So that's why 13 is a yes. So the problem is to find if n can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >=1 (since the expansion step must be done at least once). Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the construction process is as follows:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then, you add k nodes connected to the root. Then, each node that is a leaf (i.e., the ones added in the previous step) must have k new nodes connected to them. This step is done at least once. So the process is:\n\n- The initial step (level 0) is 1 node.\n- Then, the first expansion (level 1) adds k nodes. Now, the leaves are those k nodes. Then, the second expansion (level 2) adds k * k nodes. Then, the leaves are those k^2 nodes. Then, the third expansion (level 3) adds k^3 nodes, etc. However, the process requires that the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) is done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two expansions: the first expansion (level 1) and then the second expansion (level 2). Thus, the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the initial step is creating the first level (the root's children), and then the expansion step is adding children to the leaves. So the expansion step is done once. So the minimal case is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut what if we do more expansions? For example, after adding level 2, we can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph based on specific construction rules. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers where each layer adds more vertices to the previous leaves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex (root). This root is connected to $ k $ new vertices (first layer). Each vertex in the first layer is then connected to $ k $ new vertices (second layer), and this expansion continues. The expansion must be done at least once after the initial step.\n2. **Mathematical Representation**: The total number of vertices for a snowflake with $ m $ layers can be represented as a geometric series. For example, if the snowflake has $ m $ layers, the total number of vertices is $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m $.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each test case, check if there exists an integer $ k > 1 $ such that $ n $ can be expressed as the sum of the geometric series for some number of layers $ m \\geq 2 $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Check for cases where it's possible to have a snowflake\n    # Try different m values (number of layers)\n    # For each possible m, check if there exists a k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n    # But since m can be up to log_2(n), which is about 60 for n up to 1e18\n    # So iterate m from 1 to 60 (since 2^60 is ~1e18)\n    # For each m, check if there exists a k>1 such that (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k-1) = n\n    # But solving this equation directly is hard, so for each possible m, we can try to find k\n    # Also, note that for m >= 1, the minimal number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 (m=2)\n    # So for m=1: sum is 1 + k, but the expansion must be done at least once, so m must be at least 2\n    # Wait, m is the number of layers?
