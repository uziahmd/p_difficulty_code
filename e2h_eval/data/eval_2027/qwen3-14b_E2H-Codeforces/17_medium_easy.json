He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string.

It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the given prefixes and suffixes. Our job is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists some s that matches these assignments.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the correct assignments. Let's think about what's required for a string to be a prefix or suffix. For example, the original string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input includes all improper prefixes and suffixes, the actual s will have exactly n-1 prefixes (of lengths 1 to n-1) and similarly n-1 suffixes. But the input gives all of them, but mixed up. So our job is to assign which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes, such that there exists a string s that has those as its prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how do we find that?\n\nAn important observation here is that the original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1. Similarly for suffixes. But in the input, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So for each length l, one of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So, for example, for length 1, there are two strings. One is the first character of s (prefix), and the other is the last character of s (suffix). So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix, such that there exists a string s that has those prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how can we find such a selection? Well, perhaps the key is that the full string s must be such that for each prefix of length l, it's the first l characters of s, and for each suffix of length l, it's the last l characters of s.\n\nBut since we don't know s, maybe we can find possible candidates for s. However, considering that n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities might be feasible.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that when combined, they form the entire string. Because the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So combining them, the first n-1 characters and the last n-1 characters must overlap in a way that they share the middle part.\n\nWait, but for the original string s, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s without the last character. The longest suffix (length n-1) is s without the first character. So the concatenation of the longest prefix and the longest suffix would be s[0..n-2] + s[1..n-1], which is of length 2n-3. But the original s is of length n. So, for example, the first character of the longest prefix is the first character of s, and the last character of the longest suffix is the last character of s. Also, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must share some overlapping parts. For instance, the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the longest prefix's last n-2 characters must be the same as the longest suffix's first n-2 characters. Wait, no. Because the longest prefix is of length n-1, and the longest suffix is of length n-1. So their overlap is n-2 characters. For example, if the original string is ababa (as in the first example), then the longest prefix is abab (length 4), and the longest suffix is baba (length 4). The first n-2=3 characters of the longest prefix is aba, and the last n-2=3 characters of the longest suffix is aba. So they match. So the longest prefix and the longest suffix must have an overlap of n-2 characters. So, for the original string s, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must satisfy that the first (n-1) - (n-2) = 1 character of the longest prefix is the first character of s, and the last (n-1) - (n-2) = 1 character of the longest suffix is the last character of s. And their middle parts must match.\n\nBut how can we use this? Well, perhaps the correct way to find s is to take the longest prefix (say, p) and the longest suffix (say, s). Then, the original string s must be p + last character of s. But wait, because the longest prefix is p (of length n-1), and the longest suffix is s (of length n-1). Then, the original string must be p's first n-1 characters plus the last character of the suffix. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the original string is s. The longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, the first n-1 characters of s is the longest prefix. The last n-1 characters of s is the longest suffix. So, the original s can be found by taking the longest prefix (p) and adding the last character of the longest suffix (s). Because the longest suffix starts at position 1. So the original s is p + (last character of the longest suffix). Because the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], so its last character is s[n-1], which is the last character of the original string. So the original string is p + last_char_of_suffix.\n\nBut for that to be valid, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must overlap correctly. For example, the last n-2 characters of p must equal the first n-2 characters of the suffix. Because p is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. So the last n-2 characters of p are s[1..n-2], and the first n-2 characters of the suffix are s[1..n-2]. So yes, they match. Therefore, the original string can be determined as p + (last character of the suffix). But this requires that the suffix's first n-2 characters match the last n-2 of the prefix.\n\nSo, for any pair of longest prefix and longest suffix (there are two options for each, since there are two strings of length n-1 in the input), we can try to combine them into a candidate s. Then, check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate s. If so, then we can proceed to assign the labels accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all possible candidates for the original string s. How? For each possible choice of which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix (longest prefix) and which is the suffix (longest suffix), generate a candidate s by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix. Then check if this candidate s is valid (i.e., all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it).\n\nBut wait, there are two possibilities for the longest prefix (since there are two strings of length n-1). For each of those two, there are two possibilities for the longest suffix. So total of 2 * 2 = 4 possibilities. For each of these, generate the candidate s and check if it's valid. If any of these is valid, then we can use that s to assign the labels.\n\nOnce we have such a candidate s, then for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s (and thus assign P) or a suffix (assign S). However, there may be multiple possibilities for the assignments (like in the note where multiple answers are acceptable). But the problem allows any valid assignment.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem would be:\n\n- For each of the 4 possible combinations of the two strings of length n-1 (one as prefix, one as suffix), generate a candidate s.\n\n- For each candidate s, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\n- Once a valid s is found, then assign P/S to each input string based on whether it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how do we check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nWell, for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with that string) or a suffix (ends with it). But since the input strings are all the proper prefixes and suffixes of s, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. So for the generated candidate s, we can check that for every input string, it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nOnce we have a candidate s, we can loop through all the input strings. For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., len(input_str) <= len(s) and s[:len(input_str)] == input_str) or a suffix of s (s[-len(input_str):] == input_str). Since all input strings are of length between 1 and n-1, and s is of length n, this is possible.\n\nBut for the candidate s to be valid, all the input strings must be either prefixes or suffixes of s. So once we find such an s, we can proceed to assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how to generate the candidate s?\n\nLet me think again. The two strings of length n-1 in the input are the longest prefix and longest suffix. So, for each possible selection of one of them as prefix (call it p) and the other as suffix (call it sfx), the candidate s is p + (last character of sfx). Because the longest prefix is p (length n-1), and the longest suffix is sfx (length n-1). The original s must be p concatenated with the last character of sfx, because the longest suffix is the last n-1 characters of s. So the last character of s is the last character of sfx. So the candidate s is p + sfx[-1].\n\nBut then we need to check that the prefix p and suffix sfx are compatible. That is, the first n-2 characters of sfx must match the last n-2 characters of p. Because the sfx is the last n-1 characters of s, which is p + sfx[-1]. So the first n-2 characters of sfx must be equal to the last n-2 characters of p. Because the sfx is the last n-1 characters of s. Let's see:\n\ns is p + last_char. So the last n-1 characters of s are p[1:] + last_char. Because p is of length n-1. So p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-2]. The last n-1 characters of s is p[1:] + last_char. Which is of length (n-2) + 1 = n-1. So the sfx (the suffix of length n-1) should be equal to p[1:] + last_char. But the sfx is given as one of the input strings. So for the candidate s to be valid, the sfx must be equal to p[1:] + last_char. Which is automatically true because the last_char is sfx[-1], and p[1:] is the substring of p starting at index 1. So when we build s as p + sfx[-1], then the last n-1 characters of s is p[1:] + sfx[-1], which is exactly the sfx. Therefore, the sfx must be equal to p[1:] + sfx[-1]. Which is only possible if sfx is equal to p[1:] + sfx[-1]. Which implies that sfx[:-1] is equal to p[1:]. Because sfx is of length n-1, so sfx[:-1] is length n-2, and p[1:] is length n-2.\n\nTherefore, when building the candidate s, we need to check that the given sfx (the suffix of length n-1) is equal to p[1:] + sfx[-1]. But since sfx is given, and p is given, we can check if that holds. Otherwise, this combination is invalid.\n\nWait, but how? Because the sfx is supposed to be the last n-1 characters of s, which is p[1:] + last_char. So the sfx must be equal to p[1:] + last_char. But the last_char is sfx[-1], so substituting that, the sfx must be equal to p[1:] + sfx[-1]. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of sfx (sfx[:-1]) must be equal to p[1:]. So for the candidate s to be valid, this condition must hold.\n\nTherefore, when generating the candidate s, we need to check if this condition is met. Otherwise, this combination of p and sfx is not possible.\n\nSo the steps for generating a candidate s are:\n\nFor each possible pair (p, sfx) where p is one of the two strings of length n-1, and sfx is the other:\n\nCheck if sfx[:-1] == p[1:]. If yes, then construct s as p + sfx[-1], and then check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nIf this is true, then proceed.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, the input strings include 'abab' and 'baba' as the two strings of length 4 (since n=5). Let's say p is 'abab' (the prefix of length 4) and sfx is 'baba'. Then, check if sfx[:-1] is 'bab' (since sfx is 'baba', sfx[:-1] is 'bab'), and p[1:] is 'bab' (since p is 'abab', p[1:] is 'bab'). So yes. Then the candidate s is 'abab' + 'a' (since sfx[-1] is 'a') → 'ababa', which is the correct string.\n\nAnother possibility is if p is 'baba' and sfx is 'abab'. Then check if sfx[:-1] is 'aba' (since 'abab'[:-1] is 'aba') and p[1:] is 'aba' (since p is 'baba', p[1:] is 'aba'). So yes. Then the candidate s is 'baba' + 'b' → 'babab'. Now check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this s. But in the first example, the input includes 'a' as a string. For s='babab', the prefixes are 'b', 'ba', 'bab', 'baba', and the suffixes are 'b', 'ab', 'bab', 'abab'. So the input strings include 'a' which is not a prefix or suffix of 'babab', hence this candidate is invalid. Therefore, only the first case is valid.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nLoop over all possible pairs (p, sfx) where p and sfx are the two strings of length n-1. For each pair, check if sfx[:-1] == p[1:]. If yes, then build the candidate s as p + sfx[-1]. Then check if all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of s. If so, then this is a valid candidate. Once a valid candidate is found, proceed to assign P/S to each input string.\n\nOnce we have such a candidate s, we can process all the input strings. For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (then assign 'P') or a suffix (assign 'S'). However, since there are two strings for each length, we need to ensure that for each length l, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But since the candidate s is valid, this will be satisfied.\n\nBut how do we handle cases where multiple candidates are possible? For example, in the second sample input, the answer could be 'PPSS' or 'SSPP' etc. But the problem allows any valid assignment.\n\nSo once we find a valid candidate s, we can generate the answer by checking for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. But how to make sure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as prefix and the other as suffix. Well, since the candidate s is valid, for each l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because the input is guaranteed to be correct (the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be prefixes and suffixes of some existing string). Therefore, once we have a valid candidate s, the assignments will be correct.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, read n, then read the 2n-2 strings. Then, collect all the strings grouped by their lengths. For example, for each length l in 1..n-1, there are two strings. So for l = n-1, we have two strings.\n\nWe need to process the two strings of length n-1 first. For each possible combination (each of the two can be prefix, the other suffix), check if the conditions are met (sfx[:-1] == p[1:]) and then generate the candidate s. Then check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this s.\n\nOnce a valid s is found, then generate the answer by checking for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. Assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to check all input strings? For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (s.startswith(str)) or a suffix (s.endswith(str)). However, note that some strings could be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if the string is \"aaa\", then \"a\" is both a prefix and suffix. But in such cases, the problem says that the input contains exactly two strings for each length. However, for the original string, each length l has exactly one prefix and one suffix. So in the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, but for the same length, it's impossible. Because for that length l, there are two strings. But if one of them is the same as the other, but the problem says that the input has exactly two strings for each length. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So for example, if the original string is \"aaa\", then for l=1, the prefix and suffix are both \"a\". But the input would have two copies of \"a\" for length 1. But the problem says that the input is given with exactly two strings for each length. So in that case, the two strings are the same. But how would that affect our code?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So in such cases, when the candidate s is found, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix. However, for the same string, if it's both, then we can assign either P or S, but since for that length l, there are two strings (same as each other), but the code would have to assign one as P and the other as S. But since they are the same, it's allowed. However, in practice, the code would have to check for each input string, and for each, assign P or S. But when two strings are same, but for same length, the code would have to assign one as P and another as S. But how?\n\nBut the code would not have to worry about that, because when the candidate s is valid, for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Even if they are the same, but the problem says that the input is correct. For example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nWhich is for n=3. The two strings of length 1 are \"a\" and \"a\". The two of length 2 are \"aa\" and \"aa\". The correct s is \"aaa\". For length 1, both are prefixes and suffixes. But in this case, for the code, when checking, each of the two \"a\" strings would be considered as a prefix or suffix. But since the code can assign one as P and the other as S, even though they are same. So the code can choose any.\n\nBut for the code, when checking for each input string, if it's a prefix or suffix, but for the same string, both conditions are true, then the code can choose either. However, the code needs to assign exactly one P and one S for each length. But since the code is generating the answer based on the candidate s, which has exactly one prefix and one suffix for each length, the code can assign accordingly.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign 'P'; else assign 'S'.\n\nBut what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the case where the input string is \"a\" and the candidate s is \"aaa\". Then, \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix. However, in this case, for the length 1, there are two input strings (both \"a\"), and the code must assign one as P and the other as S. However, the code would check for each input string, and since they are the same, both would be considered as a prefix. But how to assign one as P and the other as S?\n\nAh, but the code would have to check for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix. However, in this case, for the two \"a\" strings, both are prefixes and suffixes. But since the code is allowed to assign either, but must assign exactly one P and one S for each length.\n\nBut how can the code ensure that? Because when the code checks for each input string, if it's a prefix, assign P, else S. But in this case, both are prefixes, so both would be assigned P. Which would result in two P's for the same length, which is invalid.\n\nBut this scenario can't happen. Because the original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length. So for length l, there's exactly one prefix (the first l characters of s), and exactly one suffix (the last l characters of s). Therefore, for the input strings, for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is the prefix (so it's a prefix of s), and the other is the suffix (so it's a suffix of s). Therefore, for each input string, exactly one of the two (for each length) will be a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut in the case where the two input strings for a certain length l are the same, then they must be both the prefix and suffix. But that's only possible if the prefix and suffix for that length are the same. Which can happen only if the original string is made of the same character. Like \"aaa\" for length 3. For l=1, the prefix and suffix are both \"a\". So for the two input strings (both \"a\"), one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So for the code, when checking, both will be a prefix and a suffix. So how to assign?\n\nIn that case, the code could assign one as P and the other as S. But how to decide which? Because the code's approach of checking if it is a prefix (and assign P) would assign both as P, which is wrong.\n\nWait, but in that case, the code would have to find for each input string whether it's a prefix or a suffix. However, when the code checks for the input strings, for the two same strings, they are both prefix and suffix. Therefore, the code can't rely on checking which one is a prefix, because both are.\n\nBut how can we resolve this? Because in the code, when we generate the candidate s, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix. So for the two same strings, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. But how can we distinguish between them?\n\nAh, but the code can't. However, the problem allows any valid assignment. Therefore, in such cases, we can assign one as P and the other as S, regardless of which. So for example, in the second sample input, the two \"a\" strings for length 1 can be assigned as P and S in any order. Similarly for the two \"aa\" strings for length 2.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nThe code must assign for each input string either P or S, ensuring that for each length, exactly one is P and one is S. However, the code's current approach (checking if the input string is a prefix of s, and assign P otherwise S) may not work in cases where the same string is both a prefix and suffix. Because for such cases, the code would assign P to both, which is invalid.\n\nSo how to handle that?\n\nAlternative approach: once the candidate s is found, for each length l, we can find which of the two input strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. Then, assign accordingly.\n\nFor example, for each length l, the prefix is s[0:l], and the suffix is s[-l:]. So for each l, we can check which of the two input strings equals the prefix, and which equals the suffix. Then assign P and S accordingly.\n\nYes! This seems better. Because for each l, there are exactly two input strings. For the candidate s, the correct prefix of length l is s[0:l], and the correct suffix of length l is s[-l:]. So for each input string, for each l, check if it is equal to the prefix or the suffix. Then, for each input string, assign P if it equals the prefix, else S.\n\nThis approach ensures that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is the prefix (and assigned P), and the other is the suffix (assigned S).\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, for each input string, we need to determine if it is the prefix of s for its length, or the suffix.\n\nSo for each input string, let's get its length l. Then check if the input string equals s[0:l] (prefix) or s[-l:] (suffix). Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the input string is both the prefix and the suffix? For example, when s is \"aaa\" and l=1. Then the prefix and suffix are both \"a\". So for the two input strings of length 1 (both \"a\"), one must be assigned P and the other S. But how to choose which one?\n\nBut in this case, since the input has two identical strings, but they are both the prefix and suffix, the code can assign one as P and the other as S. However, since the code can't distinguish between them, but the problem allows any valid assignment, it's acceptable to assign either.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe code can process all the input strings, and for each, check if it equals the prefix of length l. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, in cases where the input string is both prefix and suffix, the code will assign P. But in that case, the other input string of the same length will also be the same, and thus also be assigned P. Which would result in two P's for the same length, which is invalid.\n\nSo this approach would not work in such cases.\n\nAlternative idea: for each length l, collect the two input strings. Then, for the candidate s, the correct prefix is s[0:l], and the correct suffix is s[-l:]. So for each of the two input strings of length l, check which one equals the prefix and which equals the suffix. Then, assign P to the one that equals the prefix, and S to the one that equals the suffix. However, if both input strings are equal to the prefix (and also to the suffix), then we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nFor example, for a given l, collect the two input strings. Let's call them str1 and str2. Then, the correct prefix is pre = s[0:l], and the correct suffix is suf = s[-l:]. Now, check if str1 == pre. If yes, then assign P to str1, and S to str2. Else, check if str1 == suf. If yes, assign S to str1, and P to str2. But if both str1 and str2 are equal to pre (and also to suf), then assign P to one and S to the other.\n\nBut how to handle this in code? Because when processing the input strings, the code needs to know which of the two is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can process all the input strings, group them by their length, and for each length, check which of the two is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce that is done, then for each input string, we can assign P or S based on whether it is the prefix or suffix for its length.\n\nBut how to group them by length?\n\nThe code can create a dictionary, where for each length l, it stores the list of two strings. Then, for each l, check which of the two is the prefix (s[0:l]) and which is the suffix (s[-l:]).\n\nOnce that is determined, then for each input string, we can check if it's the prefix or suffix for its length, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle the order of the input strings? Because the code needs to output a string of 'P' and 'S' in the order of the input.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, for each input string, we need to determine whether it is the prefix or the suffix for its length. To do this, for each input string, we can:\n\n- Get its length l.\n\n- Check if it is equal to the prefix of length l (s[0:l]).\n\n- If yes, then assign 'P'.\n\n- Else, assign 'S'.\n\nBut again, this can fail when the input string is equal to both the prefix and the suffix. However, in that case, the code can assign 'P' to one and 'S' to the other. But since the code can't know which is which, how to handle that?\n\nBut the code can't just assign 'P' to all such cases, because that would lead to multiple 'P's for the same length. However, the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be correct. So for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Therefore, for each l, exactly one of the two input strings is equal to the prefix, and the other is equal to the suffix. Even if they are the same string (like in the case of s = 'aaa', l=1, and two input strings 'a' and 'a').\n\nWait, but in this case, both input strings are equal to the prefix (which is 'a') and also equal to the suffix (also 'a'). So for both, the code would think they are the prefix. But how can that be possible? Because for the original s, there's only one prefix of length l, and one suffix. So for l=1, the prefix is 'a', and the suffix is also 'a'. Therefore, both input strings are the prefix and the suffix. But how can that be? Because the input has two strings for l=1. But the original s has exactly one prefix and one suffix of length l. So the two input strings must be the same as the prefix and the suffix. But since they are same, the code can't distinguish between them. But the problem allows any assignment as long as one is P and the other is S.\n\nSo in this case, the code can assign one as P and the other as S, regardless of which. So during processing, for each l, the code can check which of the two input strings is the prefix (if any) and assign accordingly. If both are the prefix (same as the suffix), then assign P to one and S to the other.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nAn alternative approach is, for each l, find the two input strings. Then, compare them with the prefix and suffix of s for that length. For example:\n\nFor l, pre = s[0:l], suf = s[-l:]\n\nIf the two input strings are [pre, suf], then assign P to the first and S to the second, or vice versa. But if the two input strings are [pre, pre], then assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to find which input string corresponds to which in the original input list?\n\nThis suggests that the code needs to, for each input string, know which of the two for its length it is. However, since the input is given in arbitrary order, the code can't assume anything about their positions.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, for each input string, we can check if it is the prefix of s for its length. If it is, then assign 'P'; else assign 'S'. However, in cases where both input strings for a certain length are the same as the prefix (and suffix), this would assign both as 'P', which is invalid. But how to avoid that?\n\nBut this situation can't happen, because the input is guaranteed to be correct. For example, in the case of s being 'aaa', for l=1, the two input strings are 'a' and 'a'. But for the original s, the prefix of length 1 is 'a' and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So both input strings are both the prefix and the suffix. But the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S. However, the code can't know which is which, but the problem allows any assignment. So, for the code, when checking whether the input string is a prefix, it will return True for both, leading to both being assigned as P. But that would be invalid.\n\nSo this approach would not work. Therefore, the code must find for each length l, which of the two input strings is the prefix and which is the suffix, and assign accordingly.\n\nTo do this, the code can group the input strings by their lengths. Then, for each length l, process the two strings. For example, for a group of two strings for length l, compare them to the prefix and suffix of s for that l. Then, assign the correct labels.\n\nBut how to map back to the original input order?\n\nThe problem is that the code must output the answer in the same order as the input strings. Therefore, for each input string, we need to know whether it is the prefix or suffix of s for its length.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each input string, we can:\n\n- Determine its length l.\n\n- Check if the input string is equal to the prefix of s for length l. If yes, then assign 'P'.\n\n- Else, assign 'S'.\n\nBut this may not work when the input string is both prefix and suffix. However, in such cases, the code would assign 'P' to both, which is invalid. But how can this happen?\n\nIt can only happen if the prefix and suffix of s for that length l are the same. Which implies that the string s is such that its first l characters are equal to its last l characters. For example, 'aaaaa' with l=2, the prefix is 'aa' and the suffix is 'aa'.\n\nIn this case, for the two input strings for length l, which are both 'aa', the code would assign both as 'P', which is invalid. However, the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be correct. So the two input strings must be the prefix and suffix of s. But since they are the same, the code can assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nPerhaps the code can process the input strings in groups. For example, for each length l, collect the two input strings. Then, for each group, determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix. Then, for each of the two input strings in the group, assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nOnce that is done, the code can then go through the original input list and for each string, look up its assigned label.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nHere's an idea:\n\nCreate a dictionary for each input string, mapping it to a list of possible labels. However, this may not be feasible if there are duplicates. Alternatively, for each input string, store its length and the string itself, and then for each group of length l, determine which is the prefix and suffix, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut since the input strings may have duplicates, the code needs to track which of the two strings in the group is the prefix and which is the suffix, and assign labels accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, for a group of two strings for length l, say str1 and str2. The correct prefix is pre, the correct suffix is suf.\n\nIf str1 == pre and str2 == suf, then assign 'P' to str1 and 'S' to str2.\n\nIf str1 == suf and str2 == pre, then assign 'S' to str1 and 'P' to str2.\n\nIf both are pre (and suf), then assign 'P' to one and 'S' to the other.\n\nBut how to determine which one to assign 'P' and which 'S' when both are the same?\n\nWell, the problem allows any assignment. So, for example, we can assign 'P' to the first",
