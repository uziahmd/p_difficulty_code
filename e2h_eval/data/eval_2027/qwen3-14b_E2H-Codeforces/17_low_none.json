He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine for each given string whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string. The input gives me 2n-2 strings, which are all the improper prefixes and suffixes of some string s of length n. My job is to assign each of these strings as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there exists at least one possible s that fits.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the original string could be. Because once I know that, I can check each input string to see if it's a prefix or suffix of that string.\n\nBut how do I find the original string? Well, the original string must be such that all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes. Also, there's exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for example, for n=5, there are 2 strings of length 1, 2 of length 2, etc., up to 4.\n\nLet me think: the original string s has certain prefixes and suffixes. For example, the longest prefix is s[0...n-1], but since the input includes all improper prefixes and suffixes, the longest possible prefix is of length n-1. Wait, no. The problem says that the input contains all improper prefixes and suffixes. So for a string of length n, the proper prefixes are of lengths 1 to n-1. Same for suffixes.\n\nSo the original string s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. But how to find s?\n\nAn idea: the original string must be such that the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) are present in the input. But since there are two strings of each length, perhaps the original string's longest prefix and longest suffix are among those.\n\nWait, but for the original string s, the longest prefix is s itself except the last character. Similarly, the longest suffix is s except the first character. However, since the input includes all proper prefixes and suffixes, the original string's longest prefix (length n-1) must be in the input. Same with the longest suffix.\n\nBut how do I find which of the input strings are the longest prefix and suffix?\n\nAlternatively, the original string can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the original string must be a combination of the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1). But how?\n\nWait, suppose we take the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1). The original string s must be such that the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the original string s is the combination of the first n-1 characters of the prefix (which is the longest prefix) and the last character of the suffix (which is the longest suffix). But wait, the longest prefix is of length n-1, so the original string's first n-1 characters are that prefix, and the original string's last n-1 characters are the longest suffix. Therefore, the original string's first character is the first character of the longest prefix, and the last character is the last character of the longest suffix. But the original string's second to nth-1 characters must be the same in both the longest prefix and the longest suffix. So for example, if the longest prefix is P (length n-1), and the longest suffix is S (length n-1), then the original string is P + (last character of S). But also, the original string's last n-1 characters are S. So the original string is P's first n-2 characters plus S's last character. Because the first n-1 characters of the original string are P, and the last n-1 are S. Therefore, the original string must be P[0..n-2] + S[-1]. But also, the first n-2 characters of S must match the last n-2 characters of P. Because the original string's second to n-1-th characters are the same in both the prefix and suffix.\n\nTherefore, to find the original string, we can look for pairs of the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) such that their overlapping parts match. Once we find such a pair, we can construct the original string as P + S[-1], or S + P[-1]? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the original string is ababa (as in the first example). Then the longest prefix is abab (length 4), and the longest suffix is baba (length 4). The original string is ababa. The longest prefix is abab, and the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the original string `s` by leveraging the longest proper prefix and suffix from the input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The original string `s` must be such that its longest proper prefix (of length `n-1`) and longest proper suffix (of length `n-1`) are present in the input.\n2. **Construct Original String**: By combining the longest proper prefix and suffix, we can construct the original string `s` if their overlapping parts match.\n3. **Determine Prefix/Suffix Assignments**: Once the original string is determined, check each input string to see if it is a prefix or suffix of `s` and assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Separate the strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find the longest prefix and suffix candidates (length n-1)\n    candidates = len_to_strings[n-1]\n    \n    # Try all pairs of candidates as possible longest prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(len(candidates)):\n        for j in range(len(candidates)):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Check if they can form the original string\n            # The original string should be prefix_candidate + last character of suffix_candidate\n            # and also the suffix_candidate should be the last n-1 characters of the original string\n            # So, the original string would be prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if the overlap is correct\n            # The first n-2 characters of the prefix_candidate should match the last n-2 of the suffix_candidate\n            if prefix_candidate[:-1] == suffix_candidate[1:]:\n                original = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                # Now check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of original\n                # We need to assign P/S accordingly\n                # First, collect all the prefixes and suffixes of original\n                prefixes = set()\n                suffixes = set()\n                for l in range(1, n):\n                    prefixes.add(original[:l])\n                    suffixes.add(original[-l:])\n                # Now, for each input string, determine if it is in prefixes or suffixes\n                result = []\n                for s in strings:\n                    if s in prefixes and s in suffixes:\n                        # Need to decide which one to choose\n                        # But since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can check if it's a prefix first\n                        result.append('P')\n                        prefixes.remove(s)\n                    elif s in prefixes:\n                        result.append('P')\n                        prefixes.remove(s)\n                    elif s in suffixes:\n                        result.append('S')\n                        suffixes.remove(s)\n                    else:\n                        # This should not happen according to the problem statement\n                        pass\n                # Check if all are assigned\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n`, followed by the list of prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to easily access the longest proper prefixes and suffixes (length `n-1`).\n3. **Finding Original String**: By checking pairs of the longest proper prefixes and suffixes, we attempt to construct the original string `s` by ensuring their overlapping parts match.\n4. **Assigning Roles**: Once the original string is determined, each input string is checked against all prefixes and suffixes of `s` to assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the original string and validate each input string against it, providing a correct and valid assignment of roles.",
