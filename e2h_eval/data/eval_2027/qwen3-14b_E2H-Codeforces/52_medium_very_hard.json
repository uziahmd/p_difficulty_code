Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm. So the initial number of candles is 'a', and each time he burns a candle, it becomes a used one. Then, whenever he has 'b' used candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be burned again, adding more hours and more used candles. The question is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down. Initially, he has 4 candles. He burns them all, which takes 4 hours. Now he has 4 used candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used candles. He can make another 1 candle (since 2 / 2 = 1). Burn that, adding 1 hour. Now he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough to make another. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's see. Start with 6 candles. Burn them all: 6 hours. Now 6 used. Make 6/3 = 2 new. Burn them: 2 hours. Now 2 used. Not enough for 3. Wait, but wait. Wait, the example output is 8. 6 + 2 = 8? Oh, but then maybe there's another step. Wait, after burning the two new ones, he has 2 used. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. So total is 6+2=8. Which matches the example. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, the total hours is 'a' (since each candle gives one hour). Then, each time we have some used candles, we can make new ones. But each time we make new ones, they add to the total hours, and when they are burned, they become used again.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Start with 'a' candles. Burn them all, adding 'a' hours. Now, we have 'a' used candles.\n\nThen, while the number of used candles is >= b:\n\n- Take as many as possible (divided by b) to make new candles. Let's say we have 'used' candles. The number of new candles is used // b. \n\nBut wait, each time you make a new candle, you need to subtract the number of used candles you used to make them. For example, if you have 4 used candles and b=2, you can make 2 new ones. So you take 4 used candles (2 * 2), and get 2 new. Then, after burning those 2, you have 2 used candles again. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    used = (used % b) + new_candles\n\nSo this loop continues until used is less than b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because each time, you take the used candles, convert them into new ones, add the new ones to the total hours, and then the remaining used candles (after making the new ones) plus the new ones (which after being burned become used again) are kept for the next iteration.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first example.\n\nExample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours = 4\n\nused =4\n\nloop:\n\nused >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total_hours +=2 → 6. \n\nused = (4%2) + 2 → 0 +2=2.\n\nloop again: used=2 >=2. new_candles=2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7. used = (2%2) +1 → 0 +1=1. Now, loop ends. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 6. used=6.\n\nloop: 6//3=2 → total is 6+2=8. used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now, 2 <3, so loop ends. So total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. So initial total is 5. used=5. Then 5//5=1. total becomes 5+1=6. used is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. So total is 6. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=2. Initial total is 3. used=3. \n\nFirst loop: 3//2=1. total is 3+1=4. used is 3%2=1 +1=2. \n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total becomes 4+1=5. used is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. So total is 5. Let's check:\n\nBurn 3 candles → 3 hours. Now 3 used. Make 1 new (using 2), burn it → +1 hour. Now used is 1 (from original 3-2=1) +1 (burned new) = 2. Then make another new (using 2), burn → +1. Now used is 0 +1=1. So total is 3+1+1=5. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b. Then compute the total as described.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code steps:\n\nRead input line as two integers. For example, input could be like '4 2' or '6 3'.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of inputs, but in the problem statement, the input is a single line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers a and b. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the single line contains two integers a and b\". So the code should read a single line, split into a and b.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's part of the problem's example. For example, the user might have provided two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one input line. So for example, in the sample input, the first input is '4 2' and output is 7, and the second is '6 3' with output 8. But the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be a single line. So the code should read a and b from the input line.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input. Then compute the total hours as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a\n\nused = a\n\nloop while used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    used = (used % b) + new_candles\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nSo:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nLet me test this code with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 4 2.\n\ntotal starts as 4, used=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew = 4//2=2. total is 6. used is 0 + 2 =2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total 7. used is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. Output 7. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: 6 3. total is 6, used=6.\n\nnew=6//3=2. total is 8. used is 0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6. Let's see.\n\ntotal =5, used=5.\n\nnew=5//5=1. total=6. used =0 +1=1. loop ends. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=2. Output 5. Let's see:\n\ntotal=3, used=3.\n\nnew=3//2=1. total=4. used=3%2=1 +1=2. loop again: new=2//2=1. total 5. used is 0 +1=1. loop ends. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Because used is 1 <2. So output 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. total is 2. Then used is 2. new is 1. total is 3. used is 0 +1=1. So output 3.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nSo this should handle all cases. Edge cases like a=1, b=2. Or when a is zero? But according to the input constraints, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room using candles, considering that he can reuse burned-out candles to create new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and converting used ones into new ones until no more conversions are possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Burn**: Start by burning all the initial candles, which gives an initial number of hours equal to the number of candles.\n2. **Conversion Process**: Continuously convert used candles into new ones as long as there are enough used candles to make a new one. Each conversion reduces the number of used candles and increases the total number of hours by the number of new candles created.\n3. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Use a loop to keep track of the number of used candles and convert them into new ones until there are not enough used candles left to make another new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = (used % b) + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (number of initial candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initial Setup**: Initialize `total` with the value of `a` because each initial candle burns for one hour. The variable `used` is initialized to `a` to keep track of the number of used candles.\n3. **Conversion Loop**: While the number of used candles is at least `b`, convert them into new candles. The number of new candles created is determined by integer division of `used` by `b`. Add these new candles to the total hours and update the count of used candles to include the leftover used candles (after conversion) and the newly created candles (which will become used once burned).\n4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are not enough used candles to create a new one, at which point the total number of hours is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and reusing candles, ensuring that all possible conversions are made to maximize the total illumination time.",
