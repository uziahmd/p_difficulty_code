In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). She starts with three tiles and can add any number of tiles. We need to find the minimum required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. The output for each case is the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each of the three initial tiles, we need to check if there's already a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, figure out what's the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut how do I check if the current tiles already form a mentsu? Let's think.\n\nFor the initial three tiles, check if they can form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nFor triplet: all three must be same tile. Like 9m, 9m, 9m. So in that case, answer is 0.\n\nFor sequence: the three tiles must be in the same suit, and their numbers are consecutive. Like 1s, 2s, 3s. But the order doesn't matter. So for example, 3s, 2s, 1s is also a sequence.\n\nSo first step: check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nLet me think about the cases where the initial three tiles can be extended into a mentsu by adding some tiles.\n\nFor example, if two tiles are same, and the third is different. For example, 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding another 1m would make a triplet. Or adding 3m would allow a sequence (1m, 2m, 3m). So in this case, the minimal is 1.\n\nBut perhaps there are multiple possibilities, and we need to find the minimal.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles needed to add to the initial three to get at least one mentsu.\n\nSo how to model this?\n\nPossible approach:\n\nFor each possible way to form a mentsu (either triplet or sequence), calculate how many tiles are needed to be added. Then take the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut how to generate all possible mentsu possibilities that can be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, consider all possible mentsu that can be formed by adding tiles, and compute the minimal number of tiles required.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), compute the number of tiles needed to be added to the current hand to form that mentsu. Then take the minimal of all those numbers.\n\nBut how to generate all possible mentsu that could be formed with the current tiles plus some additions.\n\nBut since the current hand has three tiles, and after adding some tiles, the total number of tiles will be 3 + k, where k is the number of tiles added. However, the mentsu requires exactly three tiles. So for example, if the current hand has three tiles, and you add one more, then the total is four tiles. But to form a mentsu, you need three of them to be in a triplet or sequence. So the idea is that the mentsu can be formed from any subset of the tiles in the hand after adding some tiles.\n\nBut how to find the minimal k such that there exists a mentsu in the hand after adding k tiles.\n\nBut considering all possibilities may be computationally intensive, but given that the initial number of tiles is small (three), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The current tiles can form a triplet with adding some tiles. For example, if there are two tiles of the same type, then adding one more would make a triplet. Or if there are one tile, then adding two more.\n\nCase 2: The current tiles can form a sequence with adding some tiles. For example, if there are two tiles that are consecutive, like 1m and 2m, then adding 3m would make a sequence. Or maybe 1m and 3m, adding 2m.\n\nBut how to find for all possible sequences and triplets, what's the minimal tiles needed.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), determine how many tiles are needed to get that mentsu.\n\nSo for example, let's think about all possible triplets. Each triplet is three identical tiles. For the current tiles, suppose that there are some counts of each tile. For example, if the initial tiles have two of a certain tile, then to form a triplet, you need to add 1. If there's one, you need to add 2. If none, you need to add 3. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut for the triplet, the minimal required is 3 - count of that tile in the current hand. But wait, the current hand might have multiple tiles. For example, if the initial tiles have one 1m, then adding two more 1m's would make a triplet. So the required is 3 - count of that tile.\n\nBut for each possible tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.), we can compute how many tiles are needed to reach a triplet. Then take the minimal of all those possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences. For each possible sequence (like 1m-2m-3m, 2m-3m-4m, etc.), check how many tiles are missing in the current hand. For example, if the current hand has 1m and 2m, then the sequence requires adding 3m. So required is 1. If the current hand has 1m and 3m, then need to add 2m. So required is 1. If the current hand has 1m, then need to add 2m and 3m (required 2). Etc.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\n2. Else, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo for the triplet part, for each possible tile type (there are 9*3=27 possible types), compute how many tiles are already present in the initial hand. Then the required is 3 - count. For example, if the initial hand has two copies of 1m, then required is 1. But if the initial hand has zero copies, required is 3. Then take the minimal of all these possibilities.\n\nFor the sequence part, for each possible sequence (like 1m-2m-3m, 2m-3m-4m, ..., 7m-8m-9m; same for p and s), check how many of the three tiles are already present in the initial hand. Then the required is 3 - count. Take the minimal among all these possibilities.\n\nThen the answer is the minimum between the minimal triplet required and the minimal sequence required.\n\nWait, but this approach may not capture all possibilities. Because for example, the initial hand may have some tiles that can be part of multiple sequences. Also, the initial hand may have more than three tiles, but in our case, the initial hand is three tiles. So when considering sequences, for each possible sequence (three consecutive numbers in same suit), we check how many of the three tiles are already present. The required number of tiles to add is 3 - current count. For example, if the initial hand has two of the three tiles in the sequence, then adding one more. If only one, add two. Etc.\n\nBut for the initial three tiles, how do we check whether they can form a sequence or triplet?\n\nSo the first thing is to check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed to find the minimal required.\n\nSo let's think about how to check if the initial three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nFor triplet: check if all three are same.\n\nFor sequence: check if all three are same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence. For example, numbers sorted are x, x+1, x+2.\n\nSo, for example, 1s, 2s, 3s is a sequence. 3s, 2s, 1s is also a sequence. 2s, 3s, 4s is also a sequence.\n\nSo the code for checking if the initial three form a mentsu would be:\n\nCheck if all three are same (triplet) OR (all same suit and sorted numbers are consecutive).\n\nSo that's the first step.\n\nOnce that is determined, if not, then proceed to compute the minimal required.\n\nNow, for the triplet part: for each possible tile type, compute how many of that tile are present in the initial three. Then the required is 3 - count. For example, if the initial has two 1m, then required is 1. So for all possible tile types, compute this and take the minimum.\n\nBut for example, if the initial three tiles have two 1m and one 2m, then the minimal for triplet is 1 (adding one 1m) or 2 (adding two 2m's). So the minimal would be 1.\n\nFor the sequence part: for each possible sequence (each possible triplet of consecutive numbers in same suit), check how many of the three tiles in the sequence are present in the initial hand. The required is 3 - count. For example, if the initial has two of the three tiles, required is 1. Then take the minimal over all possible sequences.\n\nSo the overall answer is the minimum between the minimal triplet required and the minimal sequence required.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other possibilities. For example, when the initial tiles can be part of a sequence that requires adding more than one tile, but maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is the minimal number of tiles needed to add. So the approach of checking all possible triplets and sequences, and taking the minimal required, should work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case (each input line):\n\n- Check if the initial three tiles form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a triplet (call it min_triplet)\n\n   - Compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a sequence (call it min_sequence)\n\n   - The answer is min( min_triplet, min_sequence )\n\nBut how to compute min_triplet and min_sequence?\n\nLet's think about min_triplet.\n\nWe can collect the counts of each tile in the initial three.\n\nFor example, for the initial three tiles, create a frequency dictionary. For each tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.), how many times does it appear in the initial three.\n\nThen, for each possible tile type (all 27 possibilities), the required tiles to form a triplet is 3 - count. However, if the count is already >=3, then required is 0. But since the initial three tiles don't form a triplet (we checked that already), so for each tile type, the count can be 0, 1, or 2. So the required for that tile type is 3 - count. But for example, if the initial three have two of a tile, then required is 1. If they have one, required is 2. If zero, required is 3.\n\nSo the minimal triplet required is the minimum of (3 - count) across all possible tile types.\n\nBut wait, the initial three may have multiple tile types. For example, if the initial tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, the counts for 1m is 2, 2m is 1. For triplet, the minimal is 1 (for 1m) or 2 (for 2m). So min_triplet is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for min_triplet, the calculation is straightforward.\n\nNow for the min_sequence.\n\nWe need to check all possible sequences. Each sequence is a triplet of consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1m, 2m, 3m; 2m, 3m, 4m; ... up to 7m, 8m, 9m. Same for p and s.\n\nSo for each suit (m, p, s), and for each possible starting number from 1 to 7 (since 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9), there are 7 sequences per suit. So total of 3*7=21 possible sequences.\n\nFor each such sequence, we need to check how many of the three tiles in the sequence are present in the initial three. Then, the required tiles to add is 3 minus that count. For example, if the initial has two of the three tiles in the sequence, then required is 1. So for all sequences, compute this value and take the minimum.\n\nBut how to check for each sequence?\n\nFor example, for a sequence like 1m, 2m, 3m: check how many of these tiles are present in the initial three.\n\nBut the initial three may have duplicates. For example, if the initial three has 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, for the sequence 1m, 2m, 3m, the count is 2 (since there are two 1m and one 2m, but the sequence requires one of each). So the count is 2 (because the sequence requires one 1m, one 2m, one 3m. The initial has 1m and 2m, but no 3m. So count is 2. So required is 1.\n\nSo the way to compute for a given sequence is: for each of the three tiles in the sequence, check if it's present in the initial three. But since the initial three can have multiple copies, but for the sequence, we need exactly one of each. So the count is the number of distinct tiles in the sequence that are present in the initial three.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the initial has two 1m and one 2m. For the sequence 1m, 2m, 3m: the count is 2 (since 1m and 2m are present). Even though there are two copies of 1m, but the sequence only needs one. So the count is the number of unique tiles in the sequence that are present in the initial three.\n\nSo for the sequence, the count is the number of tiles in the sequence that are present in the initial three. For example, if the initial has 1m, 1m, 2m, then for the sequence 1m, 2m, 3m, the count is 2 (since 1m and 2m are present). So required is 3-2=1.\n\nThus, for each possible sequence, we need to check how many of the three tiles in the sequence are present in the initial three. The count is the number of unique tiles in the sequence that are present in the initial three.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFor example, for a given sequence (like [tile1, tile2, tile3]), check for each of these three tiles if they exist in the initial three. But since the initial three may have duplicates, but for the sequence, we need exactly one of each. So the presence of any number of copies of a tile in the initial three counts as 1 for that tile in the sequence.\n\nSo for the initial three, create a set of tiles. Then, for each sequence, check how many of its three tiles are in the set.\n\nFor example, the initial three is [1s, 2s, 3s]. The set is {1s, 2s, 3s}. For the sequence [1s, 2s, 3s], count is 3. So required is 0. Which would have been detected in the initial check.\n\nBut if the initial three is [1s, 2s, 2s], then the set is {1s, 2s}. For the sequence [1s, 2s, 3s], the count is 2 (since 1s and 2s are present). Required is 1.\n\nSo for each sequence, the count is the number of elements in the sequence that are in the initial set. Then required is 3 - count.\n\nSo for the min_sequence, we need to check all possible sequences and find the minimal required.\n\nOnce we have the minimal triplet and minimal sequence, the answer is the minimum between them.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is three strings. For example, in the sample input, the first case is ['1s', '2s', '3s'].\n\nSo for each input line, process the three tiles.\n\nNow, for each of the three tiles, check if they form a mentsu.\n\nHow to check for triplet:\n\nCheck if all three are same. For example, all three are same string.\n\nHow to check for sequence:\n\nCheck if all three are same suit. Then, extract their numbers, sort them, and check if they are consecutive.\n\nSo for example, tiles = ['1s', '2s', '3s']: sorted numbers are 1,2,3 → consecutive. So yes.\n\ntiles = ['3s', '1s', '2s']: sorted numbers are 1,2,3 → yes.\n\ntiles = ['1s', '2s', '4s']: sorted numbers 1,2,4 → not consecutive.\n\nSo code for checking sequence:\n\nsuit = first character of all three tiles? No, the suit is the second character. Wait, the tile is represented as a string, e.g., '1s' → first character is number, second is suit.\n\nSo, for the three tiles:\n\nCheck if all have the same suit. Then, collect the numbers as integers, sort them, and check if the max - min is 2 and they are consecutive.\n\nSo for example, numbers [1,2,3] → max - min is 2, and they are consecutive.\n\nAnother example: [2,3,4] → same.\n\nBut [1,3,5] → max - min is 4, which is not 2.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n    # check if triplet\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n    # check if sequence\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n        return False\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n    if nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and nums[1] - nums[0] == 1:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nSo that's the function. So for each input, if is_mentsu returns True, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for the case where it's not already a mentsu.\n\nCompute min_triplet and min_sequence.\n\nLet's think about min_triplet.\n\nWe need to find for all possible tile types, how many are present in the initial three. Then compute 3 - count, and take the minimum.\n\nFor example, initial three tiles are ['1s', '2s', '3s']. For each tile type, the count is 1 for each. So the required for triplet is 3 - 1 = 2 for each. The minimal is 2. But for the sequence, the required is 0. So the answer is 0, which is handled earlier.\n\nBut in the case where the initial three is not a mentsu, then for the triplet part, the minimal is the minimal of (3 - count) for all possible tile types.\n\nBut how to compute count for each tile type?\n\nWe can create a frequency dictionary. For example, for the initial three tiles, count how many times each tile appears.\n\nFor example, for tiles ['1s', '1s', '2s'], the frequency is {'1s': 2, '2s': 1}.\n\nThen, for each possible tile (like 1m, 2m, etc.), the count is the number of times it appears in the initial three. For example, for tile '1s', it's 2. For '2m', it's 0.\n\nSo for each tile in all possible 27, compute 3 - count, and take the minimum.\n\nBut since the initial three has only three tiles, for each tile type, the count is 0, 1, 2, or 3. However, since the initial is not a triplet, there is no tile type with count 3. So the possible counts are 0, 1, 2.\n\nSo the minimal for triplet is min(3 - count for all tile types in the initial three).\n\nBut for example, if the initial three has two of a tile, then 3 - 2 = 1. If there's a tile with count 1, then 3-1=2. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo code for min_triplet:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ntiles = list_of_initial_tiles\ncount = Counter(tiles)\nmin_triplet = min(3 - count.get(tile_type, 0) for tile_type in all_possible_tile_types)\n\nWait, but what are all possible tile_types? Well, the possible tile types are all combinations of digits 1-9 and suits m, p, s. So 9 * 3 = 27.\n\nBut generating all 27 possibilities is possible. How to generate them?\n\nWell, for each digit in '1' to '9', and each suit in 'm', 'p', 's', we can generate the tile string.\n\nBut in code, perhaps generate all possible tile types.\n\nBut perhaps, instead of generating all possible tile types, we can just consider all the possible tile types that are present in the initial tiles, and others. However, for the minimal, the best option would be to find the tile type that already has the maximum count in the initial tiles.\n\nAlternatively, since the initial tiles have three tiles, the maximum count for any tile type is 3 (but that would have been detected in the initial check). So for the case where the initial is not a mentsu, the maximum count for any tile is 2 (if two same tiles) or 1 (all different).\n\nSo the minimal for triplet is the minimal between (3 - count) for each tile type in the initial, and also for tile types not present (count 0, so 3 - 0 = 3).\n\nBut for example, if the initial tiles have two of a tile, then the minimal for triplet is 1. But if there's a tile type not present, then 3 is worse than 1.\n\nSo the minimal is the minimal of all possible (3 - count) for all possible tile types.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBut since the initial tiles have three tiles, the possible counts for each tile type are:\n\nfor each tile in the initial, count is 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is only possible if all three are same, which would have been detected in the initial check). So for the current case, the initial is not a mentsu, so no tile has count 3.\n\nSo for the possible tile types, the count is either:\n\n- 0 (if the tile is not present in the initial)\n\n- 1 (if present once)\n\n- 2 (if present twice)\n\nSo for each tile type in the initial, the 3 - count is either 2 (if count is 1) or 1 (if count is 2). For tile types not present, 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nSo the minimal for triplet is the minimal between 1 (if there's a tile with count 2) or 2 (if there's a tile with count 1 and no tile with count 2).\n\nSo for example, if the initial has two of a tile, then min_triplet is 1. If the initial has all three different, then min_triplet is 2 (since for any tile type, count is 1, so 3 - 1 = 2. Unless there's a tile type not present, which gives 3. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo in code, to compute min_triplet:\n\ncurrent_tiles = list of three tiles.\n\ncount = Counter(current_tiles)\n\nmax_count = max(count.values())\n\nif max_count == 2: then min_triplet is 1 (since 3 - 2 = 1)\n\nelse: (max_count is 1) then min_triplet is 2 (since 3 - 1 = 2)\n\nWait, but what about if the initial has two different tiles, but one of them appears once and another appears once. For example, tiles are 1m, 1p, 2p. Then, the count for 1m is 1, 1p is 1, 2p is 1. So for any tile type, the count is 1. So the minimal for triplet is 3 - 1 = 2. But if you choose a tile type that is not present, then 3 - 0 = 3. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo in this case, min_triplet is 2.\n\nSo the code can be simplified as follows:\n\nif there is any tile type in the initial with count 2 → min_triplet is 1.\n\nelse → min_triplet is 2.\n\nBecause, if there is a tile with count 2, then adding 1 more tile will make triplet. Else, all counts are 1, so for any tile type, you need to add 2 tiles (so 3 - 1 = 2).\n\nBut how to check if there is a tile type with count 2?\n\nIn code:\n\nif any(v == 2 for v in count.values()):\n\nthen min_triplet = 1\n\nelse:\n\nmin_triplet = 2\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's a simpler way to compute min_triplet.\n\nNow for the min_sequence part.\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a sequence. For that, we need to check all possible sequences and for each, compute how many of the three tiles in the sequence are present in the initial three. Then, the required is 3 - count.\n\nSo the minimal required is the minimal (3 - count) over all possible sequences.\n\nHow to generate all possible sequences.\n\nEach sequence is defined by a suit and a starting number. For example, for suit 'm', starting numbers 1-7, sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9.\n\nSo for each suit in ['m', 'p', 's'], and for each start_num in 1 to 7:\n\nsequence_tiles = [f\"{start_num}{suit}\", f\"{start_num + 1}{suit}\", f\"{start_num + 2}{suit}\"]\n\nThen, for each such sequence, check how many of the three tiles are present in the initial set of tiles.\n\nThe initial set can be converted into a set for O(1) lookups.\n\nSo, for example, initial_tiles_set = set(current_tiles)\n\nfor each sequence in all_sequences:\n\ncount_in_sequence = 0\n\nfor tile in sequence_tiles:\n\n   if tile in initial_tiles_set:\n\n       count_in_sequence += 1\n\nrequired = 3 - count_in_sequence\n\nkeep track of the minimal required.\n\nOnce all sequences are checked, the minimal required is the min_sequence.\n\nSo, for example, if the initial tiles are ['3p', '9m', '2p'], as in the third example.\n\ninitial_tiles_set is {'3p', '9m', '2p'}\n\nNow, for sequences in p suit:\n\npossible sequences are:\n\n1p-2p-3p → check how many of these are in the initial set. 2p and 3p are present → count is 2 → required is 1.\n\nAnother sequence is 2p-3p-4p → 2p and 3p are present → count is 2 → required 1.\n\nAnother sequence is 3p-4p-5p → 3p is present → count is 1 → required 2.\n\netc.\n\nSo the minimal required is 1, which is achieved by the first two sequences. Hence, the answer is 1.\n\nSo the code for min_sequence is:\n\ninitial_set = set(current_tiles)\n\nmin_seq = infinity\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for start in 1 to 7:\n\n        tiles_in_seq = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for t in tiles_in_seq:\n\n            if t in initial_set:\n\n                count +=1\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        if required < min_seq:\n\n            min_seq = required\n\nso after checking all sequences, min_seq is the minimal required for sequences.\n\nOnce we have min_triplet and min_seq, the answer is min(min_triplet, min_seq).\n\nSo combining all steps.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 3: ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nCheck if initial is a mentsu: triplet? All three are different. Sequence? Check suit: 3p, 9m, 2p → suits are p, m, p → not same. So no. So proceed.\n\nCompute min_triplet: current_tiles are ['3p', '9m', '2p']. Counts are 1 for each. So no tile has count 2. So min_triplet is 2.\n\nCompute min_seq:\n\nCheck all sequences.\n\nLooking for sequences in p suit:\n\nstart 1: 1p, 2p, 3p. Initial has 2p and 3p → count is 2 → required 1.\n\nstart 2: 2p, 3p, 4p → count 2 → required 1.\n\nstart 3: 3p, 4p, 5p → count 1 (only 3p) → required 2.\n\netc.\n\nOther suits: for example, m suit. The initial has 9m. So for sequences in m suit:\n\nstart 7: 7m, 8m, 9m. initial has 9m → count 1 → required 2.\n\nSo the min_seq is 1.\n\nThus, the answer is min(2, 1) = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input: '9m 9m 9m' → already a triplet, so answer 0.\n\nAnother sample input: '1s 2s 3s' → already a sequence, answer 0.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\nRead the input. For each input line (the three tiles), process as follows.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of three strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as \"the only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's probably a representation in Python. However, in actual input, the user would input three strings separated by spaces. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo for example, the input is a single line, like:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nOr for the third example, the input line is '3p 9m 2p'.\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into three parts.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of three strings. But that's probably a mistake in the problem description. The actual input is a single line with three strings separated by spaces.\n\nSo the code should read the input as:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nWhich gives a list of three strings.\n\nThen, process each case.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n    # Check if triplet\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n    # Check if sequence\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n        return False\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n    if nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and nums[1] - nums[0] == 1:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef min_tiles_needed(tiles):\n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n        return 0\n    # Compute min_triplet\n    count = Counter(tiles)\n    has_two = any(v == 2 for v in count.values())\n    min_triplet = 1 if has_two else 2\n    # Compute min_sequence\n    initial_set = set(tiles)\n    min_seq = float('inf')\n    # Generate all possible sequences\n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    for suit in suits:\n        for start in range(1, 8):  # 1 to 7 inclusive\n            seq_tiles = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n            cnt = 0\n            for t in seq_tiles:\n                if t in initial_set:\n                    cnt += 1\n            required = 3 - cnt\n            if required < min_seq:\n                min_seq = required\n    min_total = min(min_triplet, min_seq)\n    return min_total\n\ndef main():\n    tiles = input().split()\n    print(min_tiles_needed(tiles))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but the sample input has three test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is three strings. But the sample input shows three different cases. Oh, perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases, but the user input is three strings per line. But the sample input shows that for example, the first input line is ['1s 2s 3s'], and output is 0. But the actual input is one line with three tiles. So the code above is for a single test case.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting mistake. The actual input is three separate lines, each with three tiles. Or perhaps the input is three test cases, each given on a separate line. But the problem says \"the only line contains three strings\".\n\nAh, no. The problem says that the input is a single line with three strings. But the sample input shows three different cases. That suggests that perhaps the problem is in a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases, but the original problem's input may be different.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo for each test case, the input is a single line with three strings. So the sample input shows three different cases, each with their own input line. But the code is supposed to read one line of input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample shows that for three different inputs, the outputs are 0, 0, 1. So the code must process each input line as a separate case.\n\nBut in the code above, the code reads a single line of input. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code is run once per input line. However, in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement here says that the input is a single line.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads three separate test cases, but that's conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings...\n\nSo for each test case, the input is a single line with three strings. So for example, if the input is:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nThen the output is 0.\n\nBut the sample shows three different inputs. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows three different test cases, but the actual code must handle one test case per run.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of three strings. But that's probably a mistake. The actual input is a single line with three strings.\n\nBut the user is supposed to write a code that reads from stdin. So for example, in the sample input, the user would input three lines, each with three tiles. Or perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So the code should read one line, split into three tiles, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different cases. That suggests that perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where multiple test cases are given, but the problem statement is written in a confusing way.\n\nBut given the problem's note that the sample input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] and output is ['0', '0', '1'], perhaps the actual input is three lines, each being a test case. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is three strings on one line, I think the code should process a single test case. However",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the initial three tiles already form a valid meld, and if not, calculating the minimum number of additional tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Immediate Meld**: First, check if the initial three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence.\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: If the initial tiles do not form a valid meld, compute the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet. This is determined by finding the tile with the highest count in the initial set and calculating how many more tiles are needed to complete a triplet.\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: For each possible sequence (in each suit from 1-9), check how many tiles of that sequence are already present in the initial set. Calculate the minimum number of additional tiles required to complete any of these sequences.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value between the number of tiles needed to form a triplet and the number needed to form a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n    # Check if triplet\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n    # Check if sequence\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n        return False\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n    if nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and nums[1] - nums[0] == 1:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef min_tiles_needed(tiles):\n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n        return 0\n    # Compute min_triplet\n    count = Counter(tiles)\n    has_two = any(v == 2 for v in count.values())\n    min_triplet = 1 if has_two else 2\n    # Compute min_sequence\n    initial_set = set(tiles)\n    min_seq = float('inf')\n    # Generate all possible sequences\n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    for suit in suits:\n        for start in range(1, 8):  # 1 to 7 inclusive\n            seq_tiles = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n            cnt = 0\n            for t in seq_tiles:\n                if t in initial_set:\n                    cnt += 1\n            required = 3 - cnt\n            if required < min_seq:\n                min_seq = required\n    min_total = min(min_triplet, min_seq)\n    return min_total\n\ndef main():\n    tiles = input().split()\n    print(min_tiles_needed(tiles))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Immediate Meld Check**: The function `is_mentsu` checks if the initial three tiles form a valid triplet or sequence.\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: Using a counter, we determine if there is a tile that appears twice in the initial set. If so, only one more tile is needed to complete the triplet; otherwise, two more tiles are needed.\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: For each possible sequence in each suit, we check how many of the required tiles are already present. The minimum number of additional tiles required to complete any sequence is calculated.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum number of tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence is determined and returned as the result. This ensures the optimal solution with minimal additional tiles.",
