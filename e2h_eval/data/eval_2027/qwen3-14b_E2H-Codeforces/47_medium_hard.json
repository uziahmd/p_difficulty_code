    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, let's note that adding k to both a and b. Let me denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since k is the same for both, y - x = (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So the difference between x and y is fixed as (b -a). Let's assume without loss of generality that a ≤ b. Wait, but maybe I should first consider the case where a and b are swapped. Because if a is bigger than b, then maybe the same logic applies. So perhaps I should first compute the absolute difference between a and b. Let me think.\n\nLet me suppose that a and b are given. Let me define d = |a - b|. Let's say that a is the smaller one. Wait, no. Let me think: Let me assume that a ≤ b. Then, if I set a' = a, b' = b. Then, the difference between the two numbers is (b - a). So when we add k to both, their difference remains the same. So for x and y, which are a +k and b +k, their difference is (b -a). So, the problem reduces to finding x and y such that y - x = d (where d is fixed), and their LCM is minimized. Then, the minimal LCM would be achieved when x and y are as small as possible and share as much common factors as possible.\n\nBut how do I find such x and y?\n\nThe LCM of x and y can be written as (x * y) / gcd(x, y). Since y = x + d (assuming a < b, so d = b -a). So, the problem becomes find x such that x is as small as possible, and the LCM of x and x +d is minimized.\n\nWait, but x can't be less than a, since x = a +k, and k is non-negative. So x must be ≥ a. Similarly, if a is larger than b, then x would be ≥ b. So, the minimal x is the maximum of (a, b) when k is zero. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the first sample input, a=6, b=10. So d=4. The initial x is 6, y is 10. Their LCM is 30. But adding k=2 gives x=8 and y=12. Their LCM is 24. Which is better. So, how to find the optimal x?\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x such that x ≥ min(a, b) (since k is non-negative), and then compute the LCM of x and x +d, where d is the absolute difference between a and b. Then find the x that minimizes this LCM, and then find the corresponding k (which is x - a if a was the smaller one, or x - b if b was the smaller one? Wait, no. Let me rephrase.\n\nLet me assume that a and b are given. Let me compute d = |a - b|. Let me take the smaller of the two as m, and the larger as n. So m = min(a, b), n = max(a, b). Then, for any k ≥0, x = m +k, and y = n +k. So y = x + (n -m) = x +d. Therefore, the problem is to find x ≥ m (since k ≥0) such that the LCM of x and x +d is minimized. Once we find such x, then k is x - m. Because x = m +k → k = x -m.\n\nSo the problem now is to find x ≥ m such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Then, the minimal k is x - m. But how to find this x?\n\nLet me think about the LCM of x and x +d. Since x and x +d have a difference of d, their GCD must divide d. Because, gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d). Let me denote g = gcd(x, d). Then, x = g * p, and d = g * q, where p and q are coprime. Then x +d = g(p + q). So the LCM of x and x +d is (g*p * g*(p+q)) / (g) ) = g*p*(p+q). Which equals g*p*(p+q). Since q = d/g, and p is x/g. \n\nAlternatively, since LCM(x, x+d) = (x*(x+d))/gcd(x, x+d). And since gcd(x, x+d) = gcd(x, d). So, the LCM is (x*(x+d))/gcd(x, d).\n\nBut how to minimize this expression. Since d is fixed, we need to find x ≥ m such that this value is minimized.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about possible candidates for x. For example, the minimal possible LCM would occur when x and x +d share as large a GCD as possible. Because the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / g, where g is gcd(x, d). So if g is large, then the LCM is smaller.\n\nSo, the idea is to find x such that x is as small as possible and shares a large GCD with d. \n\nBut how to find such x?\n\nAlternatively, since x can be any number ≥ m, but d is fixed. Let me think about the possible divisors of d. Because, if x is chosen such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d, then the GCD(x, d) is that divisor. \n\nFor example, suppose that d is fixed. Let me think of all possible divisors of d. For each divisor g of d, we can try to find the minimal x ≥ m such that x is a multiple of g. Then, for each such x, compute the LCM and compare.\n\nBut why would that work? Because if x is a multiple of g, then the GCD(x, d) is at least g. However, since d is fixed, and x is a multiple of g, then x can be written as x = g * k. Then, since d = g * q, then the GCD(x, d) is g * GCD(k, q). But since q is d/g, and k is x/g. But since q and k may not be coprime, but in this case, we can't be sure. However, perhaps considering all possible divisors of d is a way to find possible candidates for x.\n\nBut what if the optimal x is not a divisor of d? For example, suppose d is 4. Suppose x is 6. Then, GCD(6, 4) is 2, which is a divisor of 4. So, even if x is not a divisor of d, the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. Therefore, for any x, the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. Therefore, the optimal x would be such that the GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. Hence, perhaps the optimal approach is to consider all possible divisors of d, and for each divisor g, find the minimal x ≥ m such that x is congruent to 0 mod g, and then compute the LCM for that x, and then choose the minimal among all these possibilities.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think. For example, if we take g as a divisor of d, then x must be a multiple of g. Then, since x and d have a GCD of at least g. But perhaps the actual GCD is higher. However, for the purpose of finding the minimal LCM, perhaps considering all possible divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, then a = b. So, adding any k will make both numbers equal. So the LCM is a +k, which is minimized when k is 0. So the answer is 0 in this case.\n\nOtherwise, for d > 0, we need to find x ≥ m (where m is min(a, b)), such that x is as small as possible, and the LCM is minimized.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, we can find the minimal x ≥ m such that x is congruent to 0 mod g. Then, for that x, the LCM is (x * (x +d )) / g. Wait, because the GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d) = g' (which is a divisor of d and also a divisor of x). But in our case, if x is a multiple of g (a divisor of d), then the GCD(x, d) could be g or a multiple of g. However, perhaps considering all possible divisors of d, and for each, find the minimal x that is a multiple of that divisor, and compute the LCM for that x, then compare all possibilities.\n\nBut how do I generate all possible divisors of d?\n\nBut d can be up to 1e9, so generating all divisors of d can be done in O(sqrt(d)) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have all divisors of d, for each divisor g, we can find the minimal x >= m that is a multiple of g. Let's call this x_candidate. Then, for each x_candidate, compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d. Then, select the x_candidate that gives the minimal LCM. If there are multiple x_candidates with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x_candidate (since that would correspond to the minimal k).\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another candidate that isn't based on a divisor of d. For example, suppose that d is 4, and x is 2. Then, GCD(2, 4) is 2, which is a divisor of d. So even though x is not a multiple of d, the GCD is a divisor of d. So, the approach of considering all divisors of d is valid.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return 0.\n\n- Else, compute m = min(a, b), n = max(a, b).\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x >= m that is a multiple of g. Let's call this x_candidate. Then compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d. Also, check if x_candidate is valid (i.e., x_candidate >= m).\n\n- Additionally, we need to check the case where x is m (i.e., k=0). Because perhaps the minimal x_candidate is m itself, but maybe that's not considered in the divisors. Wait, but if m is a multiple of some divisor of d, then it would be considered. However, if m is not a multiple of any divisor of d, then perhaps it's not considered. But that can't be, because every number is a multiple of 1, which is a divisor of d. So, for example, when considering g=1, the minimal x_candidate is m (since m is >= m, and the first multiple of 1 >= m is m itself). Therefore, considering all divisors of d includes checking x_candidate = m. So, the case where k=0 is covered.\n\nSo, once we generate all divisors of d, and for each, compute x_candidate, then compute their LCMs, then pick the x_candidate that gives the minimal LCM, and then the minimal k.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. What if the optimal x is not a multiple of any of the divisors of d? Well, that's impossible because the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So, for x, the GCD(x, d) is some divisor of d. Let me call that g. Then, x must be a multiple of g. Therefore, for that x, the minimal x_candidate for that g is the minimal multiple of g that is >= m. Therefore, considering all possible divisors of d, and their corresponding x_candidates, ensures that the optimal x is among them.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the steps to implement this:\n\nFirst, handle the case where a == b. Then, return 0.\n\nElse, compute d = |a - b|, m = min(a, b), n = max(a, b).\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x >= m such that x is divisible by g. How?\n\nWell, x is the smallest number >= m that is a multiple of g. That can be computed as follows:\n\nIf m % g == 0, then x = m.\n\nElse, x = ((m // g) + 1) * g.\n\nOnce we have x, compute the LCM of x and x +d. Which is (x * (x +d)) // gcd(x, x +d). But since x +d = x +d, and gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d) = g' (which is the GCD of x and d). However, since x is a multiple of g (a divisor of d), then the GCD(x, d) is at least g. But maybe more. For example, if d is 4, and x is 4 (so g is 2, but x is 4 which is a multiple of 2. Then, GCD(4, 4) is 4, which is a divisor of d (4). So, in this case, for x_candidate, the GCD(x, d) is the GCD of x and d. But since x is a multiple of g, which is a divisor of d, then GCD(x, d) is a multiple of g.\n\nBut regardless, the LCM can be calculated as (x * (x +d)) // gcd(x, x +d). But since x +d = x +d, and d is fixed, perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nBut for the purposes of code, perhaps it's easier to compute the GCD(x, x +d) which is GCD(x, d). So, for each x_candidate, compute GCD(x_candidate, d), then compute LCM.\n\nBut since x_candidate is a multiple of g (a divisor of d), then GCD(x_candidate, d) is equal to GCD(g * k, d), where k is some integer. Since d is divisible by g, let me write d = g * q. Then, GCD(g*k, g*q) = g * GCD(k, q). So, the GCD(x_candidate, d) is g * GCD(k, q), where q = d/g. \n\nBut perhaps this is not necessary. For code, we can compute the GCD(x_candidate, d) directly.\n\nOnce we have all possible x_candidate values (for each divisor of d), compute their LCM, then choose the x_candidate with the minimal LCM. If multiple x_candidates have the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x_candidate (since that gives the smallest k).\n\nOnce the optimal x_candidate is found, then the required k is x_candidate - m.\n\nBut wait, what if there are other x values that are not generated by this method? For example, suppose that d=4, m=5. The divisors of d are 1, 2, 4. For each divisor:\n\ng=1: x_candidate is 5 (since 5 is >= m=5). Then, x_candidate is 5, x_candidate +d is 9. LCM(5,9)=45.\n\ng=2: the minimal x >=5 that is multiple of 2 is 6. Then x=6, x+d=10. LCM(6,10) is 30.\n\ng=4: minimal x >=5 is 8. LCM(8, 12) is 24. So the best is 8, which gives k=8 -5=3.\n\nBut what about x= 5 + d = 9? Then x=9, x +d = 13. LCM(9,13)= 117. Which is worse.\n\nBut according to the approach, the minimal is found by considering the divisors of d.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nAnother example: in the first sample input, a=6, b=10. So d=4, m=6. The divisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor each divisor:\n\ng=1: x_candidate is 6. LCM(6, 10) is 30.\n\ng=2: x_candidate is 6 (since 6%2=0). LCM(6, 10) is 30. Wait, but in the sample, the optimal is x=8 (k=2). How does that fit in?\n\nAh, here's a problem. Because for g=2, the x_candidate is 6. But the optimal x is 8, which is a multiple of 2. So why isn't that considered?\n\nBecause when considering the divisors, for g=2, the x_candidate is the minimal x >= m (which is 6) that is a multiple of 2. Which is 6. However, there are other multiples of 2 (like 8, 10, etc.) that may give a better LCM. But according to our approach, we only consider the minimal x_candidate for each divisor. So, perhaps the approach is incomplete.\n\nOh! Oh right, this is a problem. Because for each divisor g, we are considering only the minimal x_candidate that is a multiple of g. However, there might be larger x_candidate (multiples of g) that have a better LCM. For example, in the first sample, the minimal x_candidate for g=2 is 6, which gives LCM 30, but the x_candidate 8 (also a multiple of 2) gives LCM 24, which is better. So our approach misses this case.\n\nSo, the approach of considering only the minimal x_candidate per divisor is incorrect. Therefore, the previous reasoning is flawed.\n\nHmm. This is a big problem. How to fix this?\n\nAlternative idea: For each divisor g of d, the optimal x_candidate for that g is the minimal x >= m such that x is congruent to 0 mod g. But that's not the case. Because for example, in the first sample, the optimal x is 8, which is a multiple of 2 (g=2), but not the minimal multiple of 2 (which is 6). So, the approach of considering only the minimal x_candidate for each divisor is insufficient.\n\nSo, how to find the optimal x_candidate for each divisor g? Because for each g, there are infinitely many x's that are multiples of g. How can we find which one gives the minimal LCM?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each divisor g of d, the optimal x is the minimal x >= m such that x is congruent to 0 mod g, and x is congruent to - (d mod something)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each divisor g of d, the optimal x is such that x is a multiple of g, and x +d is a multiple of some other number. But how?\n\nLet me think again. For a given g (divisor of d), x is a multiple of g. Let me denote x = g * t. Then, x +d = g*t + d. Since d is a multiple of g (because g is a divisor of d), let me write d = g * q. Then, x +d = g*t + g*q = g(t + q). Therefore, x and x +d are multiples of g. The LCM of x and x +d is LCM(g*t, g*(t + q)) = g * LCM(t, t + q). Since q is fixed for a given g (as d/g), and t is a variable (t >= ceil(m/(g))).\n\nBut LCM(t, t + q) = (t*(t+q)) / gcd(t, t + q) = (t*(t+q))/gcd(t, q). Because gcd(t, t + q) = gcd(t, q).\n\nSo, the LCM of x and x +d is g * [ t*(t + q) / gcd(t, q) ].\n\nTo minimize this expression, since g is fixed (for the current divisor), we need to find t such that t >= t_min (where t_min is ceil(m/g)), and the expression [ t*(t + q) / gcd(t, q) ] is minimized.\n\nBut how to find the minimal t for this?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, note that for the minimal value of this expression, we want t and t + q to be as small as possible and share as much common factors as possible. So, perhaps the minimal value occurs when t is as small as possible, and gcd(t, q) is as large as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since q is fixed (for a given g), and t can be any integer >= t_min, perhaps the minimal value occurs when t is the minimal possible such that t and q share a common divisor. For example, in the first sample, where d=4, and for g=2, q = d/g = 4/2 = 2. So, q is 2. Then, t must be >= 6 / 2 = 3. So t can be 3, 4, 5, etc. Let's compute for each t:\n\nFor t=3: x = 2*3=6, x +d = 6 +4=10. LCM(6,10) = 30. Which is (2 * (3*(3+2)/gcd(3, 2))) = 2*(3*5/1) = 30.\n\nFor t=4: x=8, x+d=12. LCM(8,12)=24. Which is 2*(4*(4+2)/gcd(4,2)) = 2*(4*6 / 2) = 2*12=24.\n\nFor t=5: x=10, x+d=14. LCM(10,14) is 70. Which is 2*(5*7 / 1) = 70.\n\nSo the minimal occurs at t=4. Which is larger than the minimal t (3). Thus, for this case, the minimal t is not the one that gives the minimal LCM. Therefore, the previous approach of taking the minimal t for each g is insufficient.\n\nSo, what's the solution here? How can we find for each g the optimal t?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps for each divisor g of d, the optimal x is such that x is the minimal multiple of g that is >= m and also such that x +d is a multiple of some other divisor of d. Or perhaps, for each g, we can find the optimal t by considering the divisors of q (where q = d/g).\n\nAlternatively, since q is fixed for a given g, the minimal value of [t(t + q)/gcd(t, q)] occurs when t is as small as possible and shares as much as possible with q. For example, in the first case, q is 2. The best t is 4, which is a multiple of 2. Then, t and q share a GCD of 2, leading to a lower LCM.\n\nSo, perhaps for each g, the optimal t is the minimal t >= t_min such that t is a multiple of some divisor of q. But again, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each divisor g of d, we can generate all possible divisors of q (where q = d/g), and then find the minimal t for each of those. But this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, for each g, we can find the minimal t >= t_min such that t is congruent to 0 mod h, where h is a divisor of q. Then, for each such h, find the minimal t. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal t for a given g and q is the minimal t >= t_min such that t is congruent to -q mod something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal value of t(t + q)/gcd(t, q) occurs when t is the minimal value such that t is congruent to 0 mod h, where h is a divisor of q. For example, in the case where q=2, the optimal t is 4, which is a multiple of 2. So, for h=2, which is a divisor of q=2.\n\nSo, for each g, after computing q = d/g, we can generate all the divisors of q, and for each divisor h of q, find the minimal t >= t_min that is a multiple of h. Then, for each such t, compute the value and find the minimal one.\n\nBut this seems like a recursive approach. However, given that d is up to 1e9, and the number of divisors is manageable, this could be feasible.\n\nBut this seems very complicated. Let me think of an alternative approach.\n\nLet me think back to the original problem. We need to find x >= m such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Let me think of x and x +d as two numbers with difference d. Let me denote x and y = x +d. So, their LCM is LCM(x, y) = (x*y)/gcd(x, y). Since y -x =d, and gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, d). Let me denote g = gcd(x, d). So, x = g * a, d = g * b, where a and b are coprime. Then, y = x +d = g(a + b). So, gcd(x, y) = gcd(ga, g(a +b)) = g * gcd(a, a +b) = g * gcd(a, b) = g * 1 = g, since a and b are coprime. Therefore, the LCM is (ga * g(a +b)) / g = g a (a +b). \n\nSo, LCM(x, y) = g * a * (a + b). But since d = g*b, and b = d/g. Also, since x = ga >= m, we have ga >= m. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding g and a such that:\n\ng divides d, and a is a positive integer such that ga >= m. And then, the LCM is g * a * (a + (d/g)).\n\nWe need to minimize this expression over all possible g (divisors of d) and a (positive integers with ga >= m).\n\nBut how to find the minimal value of this expression?\n\nFor each divisor g of d, we can find the minimal a such that ga >= m. Then compute the value of g*a*(a + d/g). However, this may not be the minimal value for that g, since perhaps a larger a would give a smaller value. For example, in the first sample, for g=2, d=4, so d/g=2. Then, the expression is 2 * a * (a + 2). The minimal a such that 2a >=6 is a=3. Then, the value is 2*3*(3+2) = 2*3*5=30. However, if a=4, then the value is 2*4*(4+2)= 2*4*6=48. Which is larger. But in the first sample, the optimal x is 8, which corresponds to a=4 (since x=2*4=8). But according to this calculation, this gives a larger value than when a=3. But earlier we saw that when a=3, the LCM is 30, but when a=4, the LCM is 24. Wait, there's a contradiction here. How?\n\nAh! Oh no, I think I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me recheck.\n\nEarlier, I said that LCM(x, y) = g*a*(a +b), where b = d/g. But in this case, x = ga, d = gb, so y = x +d = ga + gb = g(a +b). The LCM of x and y is (ga * g(a +b)) / gcd(ga, g(a +b)). The gcd is g * gcd(a, a +b) = g * gcd(a, b). Since a and b are coprime (because g is the gcd of x and d, and we divided by g), then gcd(a, b) is 1. So, the LCM is (g^2 a (a +b)) / g = g a (a +b). So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nIn the first sample, when g=2, b = d/g = 4/2=2. So the LCM is 2 * a * (a + 2). When a=3, it's 2 *3 *5 =30. When a=4, it's 2*4*6 =48. But earlier, when x=8 (a=4), the LCM is 24. Wait, this is conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because earlier calculation was for x=8, y=12. The LCM is 24. According to the formula, it's 2 *4 * (4 + 2) = 2*4*6 = 48. But this contradicts the actual LCM. So, clearly, there's a mistake in my derivation.\n\nLet me re-examine the derivation. \n\nOriginal variables: x = ga, d = gb. Then, y = x +d = ga + gb = g(a +b). The LCM(x, y) is LCM(ga, g(a +b)) = g * LCM(a, a +b). Since a and b are coprime, and a +b and a are coprime? No. For example, if a=3, b=2 (coprime), then a +b =5. gcd(3,5)=1. So LCM(a, a +b) = a*(a +b). So the LCM(x, y) = g * a*(a +b). \n\nBut in the first sample, when x=8 (ga=8, g=2, a=4), then a=4, b=2. But wait, earlier I said that b is d/g. But d is 4, g=2, so b=2. But then, a and b are supposed to be coprime? Because earlier I thought that since g is the gcd(x, d), then x = ga, d = gb, and a and b are coprime. But in this case, a=4, b=2. They are not coprime. So this suggests a mistake in the earlier assumption.\n\nAh! Yes! Here's the error. Earlier, I said that x = ga and d = gb, with a and b coprime. But that's not correct. Because g is the gcd(x, d). So, x = g * a, d = g * b, and gcd(a, b) = 1. But in the case where x=8 and d=4, then g is gcd(8,4) =4. So, x = 4 * 2, d=4 * 1. So a=2, b=1, which are coprime. So in this case, for g=4, not g=2. \n\nAh, I think I confused the value of g. So earlier, in the case of the first sample, when I considered g=2, but the actual g is the gcd(x, d). So, for x=8, d=4, the gcd(x, d) is 4, not 2. So the earlier analysis was incorrect. This explains the discrepancy.\n\nSo, the correct approach is that for any x, the gcd(x, d) is some divisor of d. Let me denote this as g. Then, x = g * a, d = g * b, where a and b are coprime. So, in the case of x=8 and d=4, g=4, a=2, b=1. So, LCM(x, y) = g * a * (a + b) = 4 * 2 * (2 +1) = 4*2*3=24, which matches the actual LCM of 8 and 12.\n\nSo, the earlier mistake was in assuming that g is a divisor of d, but for the case where x=8, the g is 4, which is a divisor of d=4. So, the correct way to proceed is to consider all possible g's that are divisors of d, and for each g, find the minimal a such that x = g*a >= m. And then compute the LCM as g*a*(a + b), where b = d/g, and since a and b are coprime.\n\nBut how to ensure that a and b are coprime? Because since g is the gcd(x, d), and x = g*a, d = g*b, then gcd(a, b) must be 1. So for each divisor g of d, we can consider it as a possible value for the gcd(x, d), and then find the minimal a such that x = g*a >= m, and then compute the LCM as g*a*(a + b), where b = d/g, and since a and b are coprime.\n\nBut how to find the minimal a for each g?\n\nWait, since a and b are coprime, and b = d/g, then for a given g, b is fixed. But a can be any integer such that x = g*a >= m. And since a and b are coprime, this imposes that a must be coprime with b.\n\nAh, this adds another constraint. For a given g, b = d/g. We need to find the minimal a >= ceil(m/(g)) such that gcd(a, b) = 1. And then compute the LCM as g*a*(a + b).\n\nBut how to find this a?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, for each g, the minimal a that satisfies gcd(a, b) = 1 and a >= ceil(m/g) is likely to be small. So perhaps for each g, we can iterate through a starting from the minimal possible value upwards until we find the first a that is coprime with b. Once found, compute the LCM and compare with others.\n\nBut for large values of m and g, this could be time-consuming. However, given that the number of divisors of d is small (up to around 1000 for d up to 1e9), and for each divisor, the number of a's to check is small, this might be feasible.\n\nLet me try to apply this to the first sample:\n\nSample input: a=6, b=10. d=4, m=6.\n\nDivisors of d=4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each g:\n\nCase 1: g=1. Then b = d/g =4/1=4. We need to find a >= ceil(6/1) =6, and gcd(a, 4)=1.\n\nThe minimal a is 7 (since 6 and 4 have gcd 2, 7 and 4 are coprime). Then the LCM is 1 *7*(7 +4) = 7*11=77.\n\nCase 2: g=2. b =4/2=2. Find a >= ceil(6/2)=3, and gcd(a, 2)=1. So a must be odd. The minimal a is 3. LCM is 2*3*(3+2)= 2*3*5=30.\n\nCase 3: g=4. b=4/4=1. Find a >= ceil(6/4) = 2. And gcd(a, 1) is always 1. So the minimal a is 2. LCM is 4*2*(2+1)=4*2*3=24. This is better than the previous cases. So the optimal is this case, with a=2. Then x = g*a =4*2=8. So k = x - m =8-6=2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, this approach works for the first sample.\n\nAnother example: the case where g=2, and we previously thought that for a=3, but there's a better a=4. But in this case, since a must be coprime with b=2, a=4 is even, so gcd(4, 2)=2, which is not allowed. So a=4 is not allowed. Hence, the minimal a for g=2 is 3, which gives LCM 30, which is indeed the case.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\n   b = d / g\n\n   min_a = ceil(m / g)\n\n   find the smallest a >= min_a such that gcd(a, b) == 1\n\n   compute LCM = g * a * (a + b)\n\n   keep track of the minimum LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, select the minimal LCM, and if there are ties, choose the smallest k.\n\nBut how to find the smallest a >= min_a with gcd(a, b) ==",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized. The solution involves leveraging the properties of divisors and greatest common divisors (GCD) to efficiently determine the optimal `k`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The LCM of two numbers can be minimized by ensuring they share a large GCD. Given the difference `d` between `a` and `b`, we need to find values of `k` such that the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized.\n2. **Key Insight**: For any valid `k`, the difference between `a + k` and `b + k` remains constant as `d = |a - b|`. Thus, the problem reduces to finding values of `x` such that `x` and `x + d` have the highest possible GCD.\n3. **Divisors of d**: By considering all divisors of `d`, we can efficiently check potential candidates for `x` that might yield a minimal LCM.\n4. **Optimal a Calculation**: For each divisor `g` of `d`, compute the minimum value of `a` such that `x = g * a` is greater than or equal to the smaller of `a` and `b`, and `a` is coprime with `d / g`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        return (a, 1, 0)\n    else:\n        g, x, y = extended_gcd(b, a % b)\n        return (g, y, x - (a // b) * y)\n\ndef modinv(a, m):\n    g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, m)\n    if g != 1:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return x % m\n\ndef find_min_k(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    m = min(a, b)\n    n = max(a, b)\n    d = n - m\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        b_val = d // g\n        min_a = (m + g - 1) // g  # ceil(m/g)\n        # Find the smallest a >= min_a where gcd(a, b_val) == 1\n        a_candidate = min_a\n        while True:\n            if math.gcd(a_candidate, b_val) == 1:\n                break\n            a_candidate += 1\n        current_x = g * a_candidate\n        current_lcm = g * a_candidate * (a_candidate + b_val)\n        current_k = current_x - m\n        if (current_lcm < min_lcm) or (current_lcm == min_lcm and current_k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = current_k\n    return best_k\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    for i in range(0, len(input), 2):\n        a = int(input[i])\n        b = int(input[i+1])\n        print(find_min_k(a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and processed in pairs of integers.\n2. **Divisors Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of the difference `d` between `a` and `b`.\n3. **Finding Optimal `a`**: For each divisor `g` of `d`, we compute the minimum value of `a` such that `x = g * a` is greater than or equal to the smaller of `a` and `b`, and `a` is coprime with `d / g`.\n4. **LCM Calculation**: For each valid `a`, compute the LCM and track the minimum LCM and corresponding `k`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore potential candidates for minimizing the LCM using properties of divisors and GCD, leading to an optimal solution.",
