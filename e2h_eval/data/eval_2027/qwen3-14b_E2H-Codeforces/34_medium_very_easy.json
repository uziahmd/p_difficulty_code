And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. Each week is k consecutive days, and I have to compute the average of all those weeks' total sleep times.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is find all the possible consecutive k-day periods in the array of n days. For each of those periods, sum their sleep times and then take the average of all those sums.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the output is the average of all the weeks. So the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of each consecutive k-day window.\n2. Sum all those window sums.\n3. Divide by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nThe challenge here is to compute the sum of all the windows efficiently. Because if n is up to 2e5, a naive approach where I compute each window's sum in O(k) time would result in O(nk) time complexity, which would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient method. Oh right! Sliding window technique. Let me think about that.\n\nThe sliding window approach can compute each window sum in O(1) time after the initial sum. Here's how it works:\n\n- Compute the sum of the first k elements. That's the first window.\n- Then for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving the window (the leftmost one) and add the new element that's entering the window (the next one). So each step is O(1).\n\nThis way, the total time to compute all window sums is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nOnce I have all the window sums, I need to sum them all and divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\nRead n and k from input. Then read the array a.\n\nCompute the initial window sum (sum of first k elements). Then iterate from index k to n-1, updating the current sum by subtracting a[i - k] and adding a[i]. For each step, add the current sum to a total sum variable.\n\nOnce all windows are processed, divide the total sum by the number of windows (which is (n - k + 1)) to get the average.\n\nWait, but what if k equals n? Then there's only one window, which is the entire array. So the code should handle that case as well.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given:\n\nIn the first sample input: 3 2, array [3,4,7]. The windows are [3,4] (sum 7) and [4,7] (sum 11). The average is (7+11)/2 = 18/2=9, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: when n=1 and k=1, the sum is just the single element, and the average is that same value.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. But the input seems to have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's example input:\n\nThe input examples are given as a list of inputs, like ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', ...]. But in the actual problem, how is the input given? Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per standard input. However, the user here provided some examples with multiple test cases. Wait, but looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line has n and k, the second line has the array. However, in the example, there are multiple test cases. But perhaps in the actual problem, each test case is given as per the input format. But the user's example shows that the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back: The problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\". The sample input shows three different test cases, but perhaps in the actual problem, each input is a single test case. Wait, looking at the original problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers. So each test case is two lines. But in the sample input given here, there are three test cases. For example, the first input is '3 2\\n3 4 7', which would be two lines. But in the actual problem, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the original problem's input may not have multiple test cases. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back, the problem says that the input is as follows: first line has n and k, second line has the array. So the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input provided in the problem seems to have multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake here. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nSo the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input provided in the problem shows multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nThe sample input given here is:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich is three separate test cases. But the problem's original description probably has a single test case. However, in the problem's note, the third example has 8 days and k=2, leading to 7 weeks. So perhaps the sample input provided by the user is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects to process a single test case. But why does the sample input have multiple test cases?\n\nWait, maybe the user is providing multiple test cases as part of the example. However, the actual problem may not have multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the sample input and output are given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nBut the user's example shows three test cases. So perhaps the user's code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description suggests that the code should process one test case. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's original statement again. The problem says that the input is two lines. So the code must read two lines. However, the sample input given in the user's message seems to have multiple test cases. But perhaps that's an error in the user's question. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nYou should write a program which will calculate average sleeping time of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\nSo the code must read from standard input, which for the problem's purposes is a single test case. However, in the user's example, they have multiple test cases. But perhaps that's just the way the user presented the examples. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, and the output is three lines. However, in the actual problem, the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut how can that be? Because in the sample input given by the user, the output is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. Which suggests that each test case is two lines. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to know? Well, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nBut in the user's example, the input is given as three test cases, and the output is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem statement doesn't mention that. However, the user's sample input includes multiple test cases, so perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is conflicting. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's sample input and output. The original problem's sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nBut the user's example shows three test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input, perhaps it's a mistake in the way they presented the problem. However, given that the user's sample outputs include three lines, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement's input says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So the code is supposed to read two lines for a single test case. Therefore, perhaps the user's sample input is not properly formatted. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is from a programming contest where multiple test cases are present.\n\nBut given that the original problem's note says that in the third example there are 7 weeks, which is for n=8 and k=2, and the input for that case is 8 2 followed by the array. So the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases. However, how to determine how many test cases there are?\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, there's no mention of multiple test cases. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one test case. However, the user's sample output shows three outputs, which suggests that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the user's problem is different. Let me look again at the problem statement's note. The third example's input is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'. The output is '28964.2857142857'.\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read multiple test cases. But how? Because in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the user's problem is actually from a programming contest where the code must process multiple test cases, but the problem statement didn't mention it. Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's sample input is a list of test cases, and the code is supposed to process each of them. However, the problem's original input format is unclear. But given that the user's sample input has multiple test cases, perhaps the code must process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWell, the original problem's sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nBut in the user's example, there are three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how to read them? Because for each test case, there are two lines.\n\nIn Python, the standard way to read multiple test cases is to read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of two lines (for each test case), and process each group.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, if the input is given as multiple lines, each test case being two lines. So for example, the first line is n and k, the second line is the array, then the third line is n and k again, and so on.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, perhaps the code should read all input lines, then process them in pairs. However, in some programming contest platforms, the input is given as a single test case, but the user's example shows multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original statement's input description doesn't mention multiple test cases. So perhaps this is a mistake in the user's problem description. However, given that the user's sample input shows multiple test cases, and the output is multiple lines, we need to code for that.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nWell, looking at the sample input provided by the user:\n\nThe input is given as a list of strings, each representing a test case. For example, the first is '3 2\\n3 4 7', which is two lines. So for each test case, the code reads two lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nTherefore, the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may not mention that. But given the sample input and output, it's necessary to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? Well, in the code, we can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut in practice, when you read from stdin, you can read all lines at once. For example, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines() to get all the lines.\n\nThen, for each pair of lines (i and i+1), process them as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think.\n\nSo, in the code, the steps would be:\n\nRead all lines from input.\n\nFor each test case, take two consecutive lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the number of lines is even? Well, assuming that the input is correct, as per the problem's input description.\n\nSo, the code would process the lines in pairs.\n\nBut the user's sample input shows that the input is given as three test cases. So, the code must read all lines, group them into pairs, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nTherefore, the code structure would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n    n, k = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process the test case and output the result\n\nBut this would work if the input is given as pairs of lines. However, in the problem's original input description, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But given that the sample input has multiple test cases, perhaps the code must process multiple.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input may have only one test case. However, the user's example shows multiple. It's possible that the user made a mistake in the problem description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's problem is from Codeforces or another platform where the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement didn't mention it. However, without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nBut looking at the sample outputs given by the user, for example, the first input is '3 2\\n3 4 7' and output is '9.0000000000', which is correct. The second input is '1 1\\n10' with output '10.0000000000', and third input is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1' with output '28964.2857142857'.\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nSo, the code will process all test cases in the input.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nNow, the code for each test case:\n\nCompute the sum of all k-length consecutive windows, then divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1).\n\nNow, the code for that.\n\nImplementing the sliding window approach.\n\nLet's think about the steps for a single test case.\n\nn, k = ... \n\na = list of integers.\n\nIf k == 0? No, since constraints say 1 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nThen, for i in range(k, n):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nThen, the average is total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n\nBut wait, for the first window, we added current_sum once. Then for each subsequent window, we add current_sum. So the total_sum is the sum of all window sums.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce we have total_sum, divide by the number of windows (which is (n -k + 1)), and output the result with sufficient decimal digits.\n\nNow, the problem requires that the answer has at least 6 decimal digits. So in Python, we can format the output to 10 decimal digits, as in the examples.\n\nSo, for example, print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average)).\n\nBut what about when the division is exact? Like in the first sample, 9.0, which is printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the code needs to output the average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, handling the case when n = k. Then the number of windows is 1, and the average is sum(a)/1 = sum(a).\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, let's think about the third example in the user's input:\n\nTest case input:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nThe array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nNumber of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nEach window is:\n\n[1,2] sum 3\n\n[2,4] sum 6\n\n[4, 100000] sum 100004\n\n[100000, 123] sum 100123\n\n[123,456] sum 579\n\n[456,789] sum 1245\n\n[789, 1] sum 790\n\nTotal sum is 3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n+100004 = 100013\n\n+100123 = 200136\n\n+579 = 200715\n\n+1245 = 201960\n\n+790 = 202750.\n\nThen average is 202750 / 7 = ?\n\nLet me calculate 202750 divided by 7.\n\nWell, 7 * 28964 = 202748. 202750 - 202748 = 2. So 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output of 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code would correctly compute that.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nFor each pair of lines:\n\nProcess as n, k and array.\n\nCompute the initial sum.\n\nBut for large k (like 2e5), sum(a[0:k]) could take O(k) time. But since n can be up to 2e5, and for each test case, this is O(n) time. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n        # process each test case\n\n        n_k_line = lines[i]\n\n        a_line = lines[i+1]\n\n        n, k = map(int, n_k_line.split())\n\n        a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n\n        # compute the sum of all windows\n\n        window_count = n - k + 1\n\n        if window_count == 0:\n\n            # but according to constraints, k <= n, so window_count >= 1\n\n            pass\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total_sum = current_sum\n\n        for j in range(k, n):\n\n            current_sum += a[j] - a[j - k]\n\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        average = total_sum / window_count\n\n        # print with 10 decimal digits\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, what if the input has an odd number of lines? Like, for example, if there's a test case with only one line. But according to the problem's input description, each test case has two lines. So the code assumes that the input is correct, and len(lines) is even.\n\nBut in practice, for programming contests, the code can assume that the input is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nwindow_count = 3-2+1=2.\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4=7. total_sum =7.\n\nThen j=2 (since k=2, range(2,3) is j=2.\n\ncurrent_sum += a[2] - a[0] → 7 + (7 -3) = 7 +4=11. total_sum becomes 7+11=18.\n\naverage is 18/2=9 → printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond test case: n=1, k=1. a=[10]. window_count=1. current_sum is 10. total_sum=10. average is 10.0 → printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nThird test case: as discussed earlier.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut in Python, for very large n (like 2e5), the code may take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut what about the initial sum(a[:k])? For k=2e5, that's O(k) time. But for each test case, it's O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, the code may take O(total n across all test cases) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's check for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=k=1 → output is a[0]/1 → correct.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, k=2 → sum is a[0]+a[1], average is same.\n\nEdge case 3: n=5, k=3. Then windows are positions 0-2, 1-3, 2-4. So three windows. The code computes sum of first 3 elements, then for j=3 (index 3) subtract a[0], add a[3], then for j=4 subtract a[1], add a[4].\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when k=1. Then each window is a single element. The total_sum is sum of all elements. The average is sum / n. Which is correct.\n\nBut in this case, the code computes sum of first 1 element (a[0]), then for each j from 1 to n-1, adds a[j] - a[j-1] (but since k=1, j-k = j-1). So current_sum is a[0], then for j=1, current_sum is a[0] + a[1] - a[0] = a[1], etc. So the total_sum is sum of all elements. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works for k=1.\n\nAnother case: when k=0. But according to constraints, k ≥1, so no need to handle.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, note that in Python, when using floating point division, the division is done with /, which returns a float.\n\nBut for very large numbers, the sum could be very big, but Python can handle big integers.\n\nNow, the code is written as per the above logic.\n\nNow, the code must be written with proper imports and helper functions. But the code is self-contained.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\nRead all lines, process each pair, compute the sliding window sum, and output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        n, k = map(int, lines[i].split())\n        a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n        window_count = n - k + 1\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        for j in range(k, n):\n            current_sum += a[j] - a[j - k]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        average = total_sum / window_count\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the case where the input has multiple test cases, but the code is run in a way that the lines are read properly.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nThe code would process each pair of lines, and output the three results.\n\nBut when the code is run, the output would be:\n\n9.0000000000\n\n10.0000000000\n\n28964.2857142857\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nBut in the third case, the code computes total_sum as 202750 (as discussed), divided by 7 → 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714..., which when printed with 10 decimals is 28964.2857142857.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the precision. The problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. Using Python's floating point division and printing with 10 decimals should be sufficient.\n\nBut when the sum is very large, but the division is precise, Python's floating point should handle it. However, for very large numbers, using floating points may introduce some errors, but the problem allows for up to 1e-6 error, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of `k` days from a given list of `n` days. The solution efficiently computes the sum of each consecutive `k`-day window using the sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: For each test case, compute the sum of the first `k` elements. Then, iteratively adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This allows each window sum to be computed in constant time.\n3. **Total Sum Calculation**: Accumulate the sum of all window sums.\n4. **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sum of all window sums by the number of windows (which is `n - k + 1`) to get the average sleep time.\n5. **Precision Handling**: Output the result with at least 10 decimal places to meet the required precision constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        n, k = map(int, lines[i].split())\n        a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n        window_count = n - k + 1\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        for j in range(k, n):\n            current_sum += a[j] - a[j - k]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        average = total_sum / window_count\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single block and split into lines for easier processing of multiple test cases.\n- **Sliding Window Technique**: By maintaining a running sum of the current window, we avoid recalculating the sum from scratch for each window, reducing the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n).\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently processes each test case in linear time relative to the number of days `n`, making it suitable for large inputs up to the constraint limits.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to ensure the required precision for the output.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and accurate, handling all edge cases and large input sizes effectively.",
