You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form an odd-length cycle, and also count the number of ways to do that. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's required. A simple cycle of odd length with each vertex appearing once. Oh right, so it's a cycle where the number of vertices in the cycle is odd. And we need to find the minimum t edges to add to create such a cycle, and the number of ways w.\n\nLet me think about the properties here. Wait, a graph that has no odd-length cycles is bipartite. So if the original graph is bipartite, then adding edges to create an odd cycle would require some changes. But if the graph already has an odd cycle, then t is zero, and w is the number of ways to choose such a cycle? No, wait, because the problem says that we need to add edges to form a cycle. But if there's already an odd cycle, then we don't need to add any edges. So the answer for t would be zero and w would be 1? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the existing graph may have multiple odd cycles, but the question is to find the minimum number of edges to add. If there's already an odd cycle, then t is zero, and w is the number of possible ways to add zero edges (which is 1, since you don't add any edges). But wait, the problem says that the existing graph may have multiple odd cycles. However, the output for w is the number of ways to add t edges to form such a cycle. But if there's already an odd cycle, then adding zero edges would count as one way. But maybe the problem counts all possible existing odd cycles as possibilities? No, because the problem says that the added edges must form a cycle. But if there's already an existing cycle, then adding zero edges would allow that cycle. However, the question is about the number of ways to add t edges. Since t is zero, the only way is to not add any edges. But how does that relate to existing cycles?\n\nWait, the problem states that we need to find the minimum t such that after adding t edges, there exists a simple odd cycle. So if the graph already contains an odd cycle, then t is zero, and w is the number of ways to add zero edges (i.e., 1) because there's at least one existing cycle. But maybe the problem counts the number of possible existing cycles? No, because the problem says that the way to add edges is considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. So when t is zero, the only way is to add no edges. But the existence of multiple existing cycles doesn't affect w. Because the question is about the number of ways to add edges (so if you don't add any edges, there's exactly one way, regardless of how many existing cycles there are). Wait, but the problem says that the output is the number of ways to add t edges to form a cycle. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then adding zero edges would be one way. But maybe there are multiple ways to form such a cycle? Like, if there are multiple existing cycles, but the way to add edges is not adding any. So the answer for w is 1. Because the way is to not add any edges, regardless of how many existing cycles there are. Because the question is about the number of ways to add edges. So even if there are multiple existing cycles, the way to add zero edges is only one way. Therefore, in this case, the output would be t=0 and w=1.\n\nSo, first, we need to check whether the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If it does, then t is 0 and w is 1. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal t and count the ways.\n\nSo the first step is to determine if the graph is bipartite. Because if it's bipartite, then it has no odd cycles. Otherwise, it has at least one.\n\nSo the first thing to do is check if the graph is bipartite. If it's not, then the answer is t=0 and w=1. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal t and w.\n\nNow, if the graph is bipartite, then adding edges to create an odd cycle. How can we do that?\n\nAn odd cycle can be formed by adding an edge between two nodes in the same bipartition. Because in a bipartite graph, all cycles are even-length. Adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd-length cycle.\n\nBut for a bipartite graph, each connected component is bipartite. So, for each connected component, we can consider its bipartition.\n\nSo, for each connected component, we can compute the size of the two partitions. Let's say the component has partitions A and B, with sizes a and b. Then, the number of possible edges that can be added between nodes in the same partition is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2). But adding any such edge would create an odd-length cycle in that component.\n\nBut the minimal t is the minimal number of edges needed to create an odd cycle. So, for each connected component, what's the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle?\n\nWell, if a connected component is bipartite, then adding any edge between two nodes in the same partition will create an odd cycle. So the minimal number of edges to add is 1. Because adding one such edge would create a cycle. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose a connected component is a tree. Then, it's bipartite. Adding any edge between two nodes in the same partition would create a cycle. The length of that cycle would be odd. Because the original path between those two nodes is even-length (since the tree is bipartitioned), adding an edge between them creates a cycle of odd length.\n\nSo, for each connected component that is bipartite, the minimal t is 1. But if there are multiple connected components, then we can choose any of them to add an edge. However, the problem requires the minimal t. So the minimal t is 1, because adding one edge is sufficient. But wait, the problem says that the minimal t. So, if the graph is bipartite, then the minimal t is 1. But how to compute w?\n\nWait, the problem says that we need to find the minimal number of edges to add. So for a bipartition graph, the minimal t is 1. So, the answer for t is 1, and w is the number of possible edges that can be added to any connected component (but each such edge would create an odd cycle).\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nFor each connected component, the number of possible edges that can be added between nodes in the same partition is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2), where a and b are the sizes of the two partitions. But adding any of these edges would create an odd cycle.\n\nBut since the minimal t is 1, the answer for w is the sum over all connected components of (number of possible edges in that component that connect same partitions) ?\n\nWait, no. Because adding any one of those edges would create an odd cycle. So, the total number of ways to add one edge to create an odd cycle is the sum over all connected components of (number of possible edges in that component that connect same partitions). But why?\n\nBecause for each connected component, adding any such edge would create an odd cycle. So, the total number of ways is the sum for each component of (number of edges that can be added in that component to create an odd cycle). Because each such edge is a different way.\n\nSo, for example, if there are two connected components, each with 2 possible edges, then the total w is 2 + 2 = 4. Because adding any of those edges would create an odd cycle. So, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2) across all connected components.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple connected components, and adding an edge in one of them would create an odd cycle. So the answer is the sum of all possible edges that can be added in each component to create an odd cycle.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\nCheck if the graph is bipartite. If not, output t=0 and w=1.\n\nIf it is bipartite, then:\n\nt is 1, and w is the sum over all connected components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions of that component.\n\nWait, but what if the component is a single node? Well, the component can't have any edges. For example, a single node. Then, the partitions are a=1, b=0. So (a choose 2) is 0, (b choose 2) is 0. So that component contributes 0. So adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would require that the component has at least two nodes. But for a component with a single node, there's no possible edges to add (since the graph can't have loops). So that component contributes nothing to the sum.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFirst, check if the graph is bipartite. If not, then output 0 1.\n\nElse, compute for each connected component the number of possible edges that can be added between same partitions, sum them up. Then, output t=1 and w=sum.\n\nBut wait, how do we check if the graph is bipartite?\n\nWe can perform BFS or DFS for each connected component, trying to color the graph in two colors. If during this process, we find a conflict, then the graph is not bipartite.\n\nBut for the problem, the entire graph must be bipartite. So if any connected component is not bipartite, then the whole graph isn't bipartite. So the first step is to check if the graph is bipartite. If not, then answer is t=0, w=1.\n\nBut how to handle disconnected graphs?\n\nSo, for each connected component, we check if it's bipartite. If any of them is not, then the entire graph is not bipartite.\n\nOnce we confirm that the entire graph is bipartite, then we proceed to calculate the sum for each component.\n\nNow, for each connected component, the number of possible edges that can be added between same partitions is (a * (a-1)/2) + (b * (b-1)/2), where a and b are the sizes of the two partitions.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nBuild adjacency list.\n\nCheck if the graph is bipartite. If not, then output 0 1.\n\nElse:\n\nFor each connected component, compute the size of the two partitions (a and b). Sum (a*(a-1)//2 + b*(b-1)//2) across all components.\n\nThen, output t=1 and w=sum.\n\nBut wait, what if the graph is bipartite but has no connected components with at least two nodes? For example, n=3, m=0. Each node is a separate component. Then, each component has a=1, b=0. So sum is 0. Then, according to this, t=1 and w=0. But that's impossible, because adding one edge can't create a cycle. Because a cycle requires at least three nodes.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Let me think again.\n\nIn the case where the graph is bipartite, but all connected components are trees (so no cycles), then adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create a cycle. However, the cycle's length depends on the distance between the two nodes. But in that case, the cycle length is even plus one (the added edge), which would be odd.\n\nBut if the component is a single node, adding an edge is impossible (since it's a loop). So, for components that are single nodes, they contribute nothing.\n\nBut for components that are single nodes, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition is not possible. So, for example, if the graph is made of three isolated nodes. Then, the sum is zero. So according to the previous approach, the answer would be t=1, w=0. But that's impossible. Because you can't add an edge to create a cycle. Because a cycle needs at least 3 nodes.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the cycle has more than one vertex. Which implies that it's a cycle of length at least 3.\n\nSo, in this case, if the graph is bipartite, but all connected components are trees (so no cycles), and there's no way to add an edge to form a cycle of odd length. Wait, but adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a connected component would create a cycle. So for that, the connected component must have at least two nodes.\n\nSo, if the graph is bipartite, but all connected components have only one node, then you can't add any edges to form a cycle. Because adding an edge between two nodes (say, from different components) would create a new component. But how?\n\nWait, suppose the graph is three isolated nodes. So, each is a component. The graph is bipartite. Now, adding an edge between node 1 and node 2. Then, the component containing 1 and 2 is a bipartition with partitions {1}, {2}. Adding another edge between 1 and 2 would create a cycle? No. Because adding one edge between 1 and 2 creates a tree (no cycle). To create a cycle, you need to add another edge. So, adding one edge cannot create a cycle. So in this case, the minimal t is not 1, but 2.\n\nBut according to our previous approach, the sum would be zero. So the code would output t=1 and w=0. Which is wrong.\n\nSo, there's a mistake in the previous reasoning. What's the correct approach here?\n\nSo, the problem arises when the graph is bipartite, but adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a connected component may not create a cycle. Because the component is a tree. So, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition creates a cycle. But how long is the cycle?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the component is a tree. The tree is bipartitioned into A and B. Suppose we add an edge between two nodes u and v in the same partition (say, A). The original path between u and v is of even length (since u and v are in the same partition). Adding the edge creates a cycle of length (original path length + 1), which is even + 1 = odd. So, yes, this creates an odd-length cycle. So, adding one edge to a tree (connected component) creates an odd-length cycle. So, for example, if the component has two nodes (u and v), connected by no edges. Then, adding an edge between u and v. Since the original path between u and v is zero edges (they are in the same partition?), wait, no. Wait, in a tree of two nodes, the bipartition is one node in A and one in B. So adding an edge between them would be between different partitions. But that would create a cycle of length 1? No. Wait, the original tree is two nodes connected by no edges. Then, adding an edge between them creates a single edge, which is a cycle of length 1? No, that's not possible. Wait, a cycle must have at least three nodes. Oh right! So, adding an edge between two nodes that are not connected in a tree creates a cycle. But the length of that cycle is the number of edges in the path between the two nodes plus one. In the case of a tree with two nodes, the path between them is zero edges. Adding an edge creates a cycle of length 1? That's impossible. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, the original tree is two nodes. They are in different partitions. So, adding an edge between them would be between different partitions. Which would not create an odd cycle. But adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would require that the component has at least three nodes. Because if the component is two nodes, then they are in different partitions. So, adding an edge between them would be between different partitions, which would create a cycle of length 2 (but that's not allowed as a cycle). Wait, no. A cycle must have at least three edges. So, adding an edge between two nodes that are already connected via a path of length 1 (like a tree of two nodes) would create a cycle of length 2 (two edges between the same two nodes). But the problem says that the graph has no loops or parallel edges. So the original graph has no such edges, but adding an edge between two nodes that are already connected by a path would create a cycle. However, in the case of two nodes, the original path between them is zero edges (if they are not connected). So adding an edge between them creates a cycle of length 1? No. It's just a single edge, which is not a cycle. Wait, a cycle requires that you start and end at the same node, with no repeated edges or vertices except the starting/ending. So, in a tree with two nodes, adding an edge between them creates a cycle? No. Because the tree has no edges. Adding an edge between them gives a single edge. There's no cycle. So, how can adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition create a cycle?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake here. The original tree must be connected. So, for example, if the component is a tree with three nodes arranged in a line (A-B-C). The bipartition is A and C in one group, B in the other. Adding an edge between A and C (same group) would create a cycle A-B-C-A, which is length 3 (odd). So that works. But for a component with two nodes (A-B), the bipartition is A in group 1, B in group 2. Adding an edge between A and B would not be same partition. Adding an edge between A and another node (but there's none). So, in this case, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition is not possible. So, for a component with two nodes, the number of possible edges that can be added between same partitions is zero. Because the two nodes are in different partitions. Hence, for such a component, the contribution to the sum is zero.\n\nSo, in the case of a graph consisting of three isolated nodes. Each component is a single node. Then, the sum is zero. So according to our previous approach, the answer is t=1 and w=0. Which is wrong, because adding one edge cannot create a cycle. So, what's the correct t and w?\n\nIn this case, the graph is bipartite. To create an odd cycle, we need to add edges. But the minimal number of edges to add is 3. Because adding two edges between three nodes would form a triangle. For example, adding edges between 1-2, 2-3, 1-3. But that's three edges. However, the minimal t is 3? Or is there a way to create a cycle with fewer edges?\n\nWait, to create a cycle of three nodes, you need three edges. So, for three isolated nodes, the minimal number of edges to add is 3. But according to our previous approach, the code would output t=1 and w=0. Which is wrong. Hence, the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the initial reasoning?\n\nThe initial reasoning assumed that adding one edge to a bipartite graph would create an odd cycle. But this is only true if the connected component has at least three nodes. Because adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a connected component (which has at least three nodes) would create an odd cycle. However, for connected components with less than three nodes, adding an edge may not create a cycle.\n\nSo, the problem comes down to: for each connected component, if it's bipartite, and has at least two nodes, then the number of edges that can be added to create an odd cycle is (a choose 2 + b choose 2). But if the component has only one node, then it contributes nothing. But if the component has two nodes, then a and b are 1 and 1. So (1 choose 2) is zero, and (1 choose 2) is zero. So the contribution is zero. Hence, for a connected component with two nodes, adding any edge (between the two nodes) would be between different partitions. Hence, adding such an edge would not create an odd cycle. So, the contribution is zero.\n\nTherefore, for the case where the graph is bipartite, but all connected components have size 1 or 2, then the sum is zero. Hence, the code would output t=1 and w=0, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, how to handle this case?\n\nWe need to find the minimal t. So, what is the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle?\n\nLet's think. If the graph is bipartite, but there are no existing odd cycles. Then, adding edges to create an odd cycle.\n\nCase 1: There exists at least one connected component with at least three nodes. Then, adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition of that component will create an odd cycle. So t is 1, and the w is the sum of (a choose 2 + b choose 2) for all components.\n\nCase 2: All connected components are of size 1 or 2. Then, adding one edge cannot create a cycle. So, we need to add edges to create a cycle. For example, if there are at least three nodes (each being isolated), then we need to add three edges to form a triangle (which is an odd cycle). But what is the minimal number of edges required?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the graph has three isolated nodes. To create a cycle of length 3, you need to add three edges. But that's not minimal. Alternatively, adding two edges between three nodes would form a path, but not a cycle. To form a cycle, you need three edges. So t is 3.\n\nAlternatively, if the graph has two components: one with two nodes, and another with two nodes. Then, adding edges between them. For example, adding edges between the two components. Suppose you have four nodes: A, B in one component, and C, D in another. Then, adding edges A-C, C-B, B-D, D-A. But that's getting complicated. Let me think of the minimal t.\n\nTo create an odd cycle, the minimal t is 2. For example, take two components, each with two nodes. Add two edges between them. For example, connect A-C and B-D. Then, there's no cycle. But if you add A-C and A-D, then there's no cycle. Hmm. Alternatively, connect A-C and B-C. Then, there's a cycle of two edges (A-C-B-C?), no. Not a cycle. Wait, no. To form a cycle, you need to have a closed path. So, if you have two components (each with two nodes) and you add edges between them. For example, connect A to C and B to C. Then, the component now has three nodes A, B, C. The edges are A-C, B-C, and the original edges between A-B (if they were connected?), no. Wait, the original components are two separate pairs. So, if the original graph has two components: A-B and C-D. Now, adding edges A-C and B-D. Then, there's no cycle. But adding edges A-C and B-C would create a cycle between A-B-C-A, which is a cycle of length 3 (assuming that A and B are connected). Wait, but in the original graph, A and B are connected. So, adding edges A-C and B-C creates a cycle A-B-C-A. Which is of length 3. So that's an odd cycle. So adding two edges. So in this case, t is 2.\n\nSo, for the case where all connected components are of size 1 or 2, the minimal t is 2 if there are at least two components with at least one node (so that you can connect them in a way to form a cycle). But how to compute this?\n\nThis seems complicated. So, perhaps we need to split into cases.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nIf the graph is not bipartite → t=0, w=1.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if there exists a connected component with at least three nodes. If yes, then t=1, and w is the sum over all components of (a choose 2 + b choose 2).\n\nIf not, then all connected components are of size 1 or 2. Then, we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle.\n\nIn this case:\n\nIf there are less than 3 nodes, then it's impossible. But since n ≥ 1, but for example, if n=2, then you can't form a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. So for n=1, it's impossible. But the input constraints say that the graph can have m=0, but n can be anything.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is such that the graph may not have any cycles. So, the problem requires us to find the minimal t and w.\n\nSo, for the case where all components are of size 1 or 2, and the graph is bipartite:\n\nIf there are at least three nodes, then we need to add edges to create a cycle.\n\nLet me think:\n\nIf there are k components. Each component is either a single node (size 1) or a pair (size 2).\n\nTo form a cycle, we need to have at least three nodes. So, if there are at least three nodes in the graph, then:\n\nCase A: There are at least three nodes in the graph.\n\nThen, the minimal t is 2 if there are at least two components (so that we can connect them in a way to form a cycle). Or wait, how?\n\nLet me think of examples.\n\nExample 1: n=3, m=0. Three isolated nodes.\n\nWe need to add edges to form a cycle of length 3. That requires adding 3 edges (connecting each pair). But that's three edges. But is there a way with fewer edges?\n\nNo. Because with two edges, you can't form a cycle. For example, adding edges between 1-2 and 1-3. That forms a tree (no cycle). Adding a third edge between 2-3 creates a cycle.\n\nSo t=3.\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nAnother example: n=4, m=0. Four isolated nodes. We can connect them in a way that adds two edges. For example, connect 1-2 and 2-3 and 3-1. Wait, that's three edges. Or perhaps connect 1-2, 2-3, and 3-1. No, again three edges. So t=3.\n\nBut wait, if there are two components, each of size 2. For example, n=4, m=0. Components are (1-2), (3-4). Then, adding two edges: 1-3 and 2-4. That creates a cycle of length 4. Which is even. Not helpful. But if you add edges 1-3 and 1-4. Then, there's no cycle. But if you add edges 1-3 and 2-3. Then, there's a cycle 1-2-3-1 (length 3). So adding two edges. So t=2.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal t is 2.\n\nSo, the minimal t depends on the number of components and their sizes.\n\nSo, this suggests that the problem is more complex than initially thought.\n\nThus, the initial approach is insufficient. We need to handle two cases:\n\nCase 1: There exists at least one connected component with size ≥ 3. Then, t=1, and w is the sum of (a choose 2 + b choose 2) for all components.\n\nCase 2: All connected components are of size ≤ 2. Then, we need to compute t and w accordingly.\n\nSo, how to compute t and w for case 2.\n\nIn case 2, the graph is bipartite, and all connected components are of size 1 or 2.\n\nLet’s denote the number of components of size 1 as c1, and the number of components of size 2 as c2.\n\nSo, the total number of nodes is n = c1*1 + c2*2.\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd-length cycle.\n\nTo create an odd-length cycle, the simplest way is to form a triangle (3 nodes) which requires adding 3 edges (as discussed earlier). But in some cases, like when there are two components of size 2, we can add two edges to form a cycle of length 3.\n\nSo, how to find the minimal t in this case.\n\nLet's think about the minimal t:\n\nIf there are at least three nodes (n ≥ 3), then the minimal t is:\n\nIf there are at least two components of size 2, then we can connect them to form a triangle with two edges. For example, take two components of size 2 (say, A-B and C-D). Connect A to C and B to C. This forms a triangle A-B-C-A (if A and B are connected). So that's two edges added. Hence, t=2.\n\nIf there are no components of size 2 (all components are size 1), then we need to select three components (each of size 1) and connect them in a triangle. This requires adding three edges. So t=3.\n\nIf there is one component of size 2 and the rest are size 1. For example, n=3: one component of size 2 (A-B), and one component of size 1 (C). Then, adding two edges: A-C and B-C. This forms a triangle A-B-C-A. So t=2.\n\nSo, in general, the minimal t is 2 if there are at least two components (regardless of their sizes) that can be connected to form a cycle with two edges. Otherwise, it's 3.\n\nSo, how to determine this.\n\nLet’s see:\n\nIf there are at least two components (each of size ≥ 1), then we can add two edges between them to form a cycle of length 3. For example, take two components: one with node X and another with node Y. Add edges between X-Y and X-Z (if Z is another node). Wait, but that requires three nodes. So, the condition is that there are at least three nodes in the graph.\n\nSo, if n ≥ 3, then the minimal t is 2 if there are at least two nodes (but that's always true if n ≥ 3). Wait, no. For example, if n=3 and the components are three single nodes. Then, adding two edges between them (say, A-B and B-C) creates a path, not a cycle. To create a cycle, you need to add a third edge (A-C). So, in this case, t=3.\n\nAh, right. So, the minimal t depends on the number of available nodes.\n\nSo, the key is:\n\nIf the number of components is at least two, and the number of nodes is at least three, then:\n\nIf there are at least three nodes, then:\n\nIf there exists at least two components with at least one node each (which is always true if there are two components and n ≥ 3), then:\n\nWait, but how to form a cycle with two edges. For example, if there are three components: A, B, C. Then, adding edges A-B and B-C creates a path of length two. To form a cycle, you need to add another edge between A and C, making three edges. So, in this case, t=3.\n\nBut if there are two components, one with two nodes (say, A-B) and one with one node (C). Then, adding edges A-C and B-C creates a cycle (A-B-C-A). Which is three edges. Wait, no. Adding two edges: A-C and B-C. Then, there's a cycle of A-B-C-A. That's three edges, forming a cycle of length 3. So yes, adding two edges.\n\nAh, right. So in this case, the cycle is formed with two added edges.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 2 if there exists at least one component of size ≥ 2 and at least one component of size ≥ 1 (so that you can connect them to form a triangle with two edges). Or, if there are three components of size 1, you need to add three edges.\n\nSo, the minimal t is:\n\nIf there is at least one component of size 2, then t=2.\n\nOtherwise, if all components are size 1 and n ≥ 3, then t=3.\n\nBut how to check this.\n\nSo, in case 2 (all components are size 1 or 2):\n\nIf there exists at least one component of size 2, then the minimal t is 2.\n\nElse, all components are size 1. Then, if n < 3, it's impossible. But since the problem requires to form a cycle of more than one vertex, but for n=1 or 2, it's impossible. However, the input may have such cases.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is valid, and the output must be computed. Let's think about these edge cases.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input can be like n=3, m=0. Then, the minimal t is 3.\n\nSo, in case 2:\n\nif there exists at least one component of size 2 → t=2, and the number of ways is the number of ways to select two components (one of size 2 and one of size 1) and connect two nodes, or something else?\n\nWait, no. The number of ways to add t edges (which is 2) in this case.\n\nBut how to compute w?\n\nThis seems very complicated. Let's think about the possible scenarios.\n\nIn case 2:\n\nIf there is at least one component of size 2, then the minimal t is 2. The number of ways is the number of ways to choose two nodes from different components (one from a component of size 2 and another from any component) and connect them in a way that forms a cycle with two edges.\n\nWait, no. Let's think of how to form the cycle.\n\nSuppose there is a component of size 2 (A and B), and another component of size 1 (C). To form a cycle of length 3, we need to add edges between A and C, and B and C. That's two edges. So, for this scenario, the number of ways is the number of possible pairs of (component of size 2, component of size 1) multiplied by the number of ways to choose two nodes from the component of size 2 and one node from the component of size 1. Wait, no. For each component of size 2, and each component of size 1, there is exactly one way to add two edges between them. For example, the component of size 2 has two nodes (say, u and v), and the component of size 1 has node w. Then, the two edges to add are (u,w) and (v,w). This forms a cycle of length 3.\n\nBut there are other possibilities. For example, adding edges between u and w, and between u and another node x from another component. But that would form a path, not a cycle. Unless there's another connection.\n\nWait, no. If there are two components of size 2: (u, v) and (x, y). To form a cycle of length 3, you need to add edges between u and x, and u and y. That would form a cycle of length 3 (u-x-u-y-u?) No, that's not a cycle. Wait, that would create a path of length 2, but no cycle. To form a cycle of length 3, you need to connect three nodes. So, for example, adding edges between u and x, and between x and v. Then, the cycle is u-v-x-u, which is length 3. So that's two edges added. So, for two components of size 2, the number of ways is the number of possible pairs of nodes between the two components. For each pair of components (say, component C1 and C2), the number of ways is (number of nodes in C1) * (number of nodes in C2) * (number of nodes in C1 - 1) ? Or wait:\n\nTake component C1 with nodes u and v, and component C2 with nodes x and y. To form a cycle of length 3, we can choose any one node from C1 and any one node from C2, then connect them with two edges. No, that's not sufficient. For example, connecting u to x and u to y. That creates a cycle between u-x-u-y-u? No, that's not a cycle. Wait, no. The edges are u-x and u-y. There's no cycle. To create a cycle, you need to have a path that starts and ends at the same node. So, for example, connecting u to x and x to v. Then, the cycle is u-v-x-u. Which is length 3. So that's two edges added.\n\nSo, for two components of size 2, the number of ways to add two edges to form a cycle of length 3 is 2 * 2 * 1 = 4? Let me think. Component C1 has two nodes (u, v), component C2 has two nodes (x, y). The possible",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to an undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and the number of ways to do so. The solution involves checking if the graph is bipartite and then handling different cases based on the structure of the graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Bipartiteness**: If the graph is not bipartite, it already contains an odd-length cycle, so the answer is `0 1`.\n2. **Component Analysis**: If the graph is bipartite, analyze each connected component:\n   - **Case 1**: If there exists a component with at least three nodes, adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition will create an odd cycle. The number of ways to do this is calculated by summing the combinations of nodes within each partition.\n   - **Case 2**: If all components are of size 1 or 2, the minimum number of edges required depends on the presence of components of size 2. If such components exist, we can form a cycle with 2 edges; otherwise, forming a cycle requires 3 edges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        v = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n    \n    color = [-1] * n\n    is_bipartite = True\n    for start in range(n):\n        if color[start] == -1:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(start)\n            color[start] = 0\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if color[v] == -1:\n                        color[v] = color[u] ^ 1\n                        queue.append(v)\n                    else:\n                        if color[v] == color[u]:\n                            is_bipartite = False\n    if not is_bipartite:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n    \n    # Now, the graph is bipartite.
