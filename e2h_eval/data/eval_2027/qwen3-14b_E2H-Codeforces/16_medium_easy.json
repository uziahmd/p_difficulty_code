Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the blocks are structured. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that moving between blocks requires crossing a road, but only if the blocks share a common segment (not just a point). So, two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. But how do we model this?\n\nThe problem seems similar to a graph traversal problem. Each block can be considered as a node, and edges exist between nodes if they are adjacent. Then, the task reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block. However, directly modeling all possible blocks is impossible because there are infinitely many blocks. So, we need another approach.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model the problem using the roads. Since each step crosses a road, perhaps the number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the regions. For example, when you cross a line, you switch regions. But with multiple lines, the regions are determined by the arrangement of all lines. However, how can we represent the region (block) that contains a given point (home or university)?\n\nAnother idea: For each line, determine which side of the line the home and university are on. Then, the problem becomes similar to finding the minimal number of lines that need to be crossed to get from the home's region to the university's region. But since each step can cross one line (but only if it's adjacent), perhaps the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university, but in some way.\n\nWait, but how do we model adjacency? Because two regions that are separated by a single line are adjacent. But if two regions are separated by multiple lines, then you need to cross those lines step by step. However, the problem is that the adjacency depends on the arrangement of the lines.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight here is that the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose that the home and university are in regions that are separated by k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k? Or maybe not. Because each step can cross one road. But if the regions are separated by multiple roads, but arranged in such a way that you can cross them one by one, then the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate them. But how do we find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of each region as being defined by the signs of the equations for each line. For example, for each line ai x + bi y + ci = 0, the home point (x1, y1) will be on one side of the line, say positive or negative. Similarly for the university. If the home and university are on the same side of a line, then that line does not separate them. Otherwise, it does. The minimal number of steps required is the number of lines that separate them. Wait, but that might not be correct. Because crossing a line can take you from one region to another, but the minimal steps may depend on how the lines intersect.\n\nWait, here's an example. Suppose there are two lines that cross each other. The home is in one region, and the university is in the opposite region. Then, the minimal steps would be 2, because you have to cross both lines. But if you cross one line first, then the other. However, if the lines are parallel, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both lines, then the minimal steps would be 2 again. But if the home and university are separated by one line, then the minimal steps is 1. \n\nSo, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. But how do we compute that?\n\nWait, but how to determine whether a line separates the home and university. For a line ax + by + c = 0, the home and university are on opposite sides if (a x1 + b y1 + c) * (a x2 + b y2 + c) < 0. Because that means the two points are on different sides of the line. So, if a line separates the two points, then it contributes to the count. So the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points. But why?\n\nBecause each time you cross a line that separates them, you can get closer. But how does that relate to the steps? Let me think. For example, if there are k lines separating the two points, then the minimal steps is k. Because each step can cross one line, and you need to cross each of the k lines once. But how can you be sure that the steps can be done in that way?\n\nLet me think of the case where two lines cross. Suppose the home is in a region, and the university is in a region that is separated by two lines. Then, the minimal steps would be two. But perhaps the two lines cross each other, so you can cross them one after another. So, the minimal steps is indeed the number of lines that separate the two points. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting how many lines separate the home and the university. Because each such line must be crossed once, and each crossing takes one step. So, the answer is the number of lines for which (a_i x1 + b_i y1 + c_i) * (a_i x2 + b_i y2 + c_i) < 0.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple lines that are redundant? For example, suppose there are three lines, and the home and university are separated by two of them. But perhaps the third line is not in between. Then, the answer would be two steps.\n\nBut according to this logic, the answer would be the number of lines that separate the two points. Let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Two lines: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 (y=0) and 1x + 0y +0=0 (x=0).\n\nFor each line:\n\nLine 1: y=0. For home (1,1): 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1. For university: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is 1 * -1 = -1 <0. So this line separates them.\n\nLine 2: x=0. Home (1,1) gives 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1. University gives 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0. So two lines. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Three lines: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nCheck each line:\n\nLine 1: x=0. As before, product is -1 <0. So separates.\n\nLine 2: y=0. Same as before, product is -1 <0. Separates.\n\nLine3: x + y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So this line does not separate them. So total lines that separate are 2. So answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to work for the samples. Therefore, the answer is the number of lines that separate the two points. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each line that separates them must be crossed once. And each step allows crossing exactly one line. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines. \n\nBut how to confirm this logic? Let's think of another example. Suppose there are two lines that are parallel. Suppose home is on one side of both, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, the two lines separate them. So the answer would be 2. But in reality, the two regions are separated by two lines. To get from one to the other, you have to cross both lines. So that's two steps. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: three lines, arranged in a way that the home and university are separated by two lines. But the lines are not overlapping. So the answer is 2 steps. \n\nThus, the solution is to compute the number of lines that separate the two points. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is straightforward:\n\nFor each line, compute the value of (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c). Multiply them. If the product is negative, then this line separates the two points. Count the number of such lines. That's the answer.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1 and x2, y2. Read n lines. For each line, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If val1 * val2 < 0, increment the count. Output the count.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 cannot be zero. So the product can't be zero. So for each line, the product is either positive or negative. \n\nYes. So this approach is valid.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me check the sample inputs again.\n\nSample 1: two lines, both separate. So answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2: three lines, two of them separate. Answer is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if there are no lines that separate, then answer is 0. Which makes sense, since home and university are in the same block.\n\nBut how can that happen? For example, if all lines do not separate them. So the home and university are in the same region. So the answer is 0 steps.\n\nSo the code is as simple as that. \n\nSo the Python code would read the input, process each line, and count the number of lines where the product is negative.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nRead the first two lines as x1, y1 and x2, y2. Then read n, then read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nFor each line, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c. val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If val1 * val2 < 0, count +=1.\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nYes. That's the code. Let me check for possible errors.\n\nWhat about if a line is the same as another? But the problem says that no two roads are the same. So no problem.\n\nBut the code doesn't need to worry about that, since even if two lines are same, the code will process them as separate lines. However, the problem says that the input ensures that no two roads are same, so the code is okay.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let's write it.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input. Then x2, y2. Then n. Then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as follows. However, the input may be given as multiple lines. For example, the first input example is given as:\n\nInput:\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, but in the actual input, the user would input the data as per the problem statement. So, the code should read from stdin. So, for example, the first line is x1 y1, second line x2 y2, third line n, then n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input().split()\n\nRead x2, y2 similarly.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nThen, for each of these lines, compute val1 and val2.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each line:\n\n    a, b, c = ... \n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nYes. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Lines:\n\n0 1 0 → 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 → y=0.\n\nval1 for home is 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2 is 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: 1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1. product -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nThird line is 1 1 -3. For home (1,1): 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0. So no count. So total 2 lines. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code works.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the first two lines. But note that the input could have multiple lines. For example, the first line is x1 y1, second is x2 y2, third is n, then n lines.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code. It seems straightforward. Let me check for possible issues.\n\nWhat if a line is vertical or horizontal? Doesn't matter, the code handles it.\n\nWhat about very large numbers? Since Python handles big integers, no problem.\n\nYes, this should be correct. So the answer is to write this code.\n",

Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If a road separates the home and university blocks, it must be crossed to move between these blocks. The number of such separating roads directly corresponds to the minimum number of steps required. \n\nFor each road defined by the equation $a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0$, we check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This can be determined by evaluating the sign of the expressions $a_i x_1 + b_i y_1 + c_i$ and $a_i x_2 + b_i y_2 + c_i$. If their product is negative, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, indicating that this road separates them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Checking Separation:** For each road, compute the values of the linear equations at the home and university coordinates.
