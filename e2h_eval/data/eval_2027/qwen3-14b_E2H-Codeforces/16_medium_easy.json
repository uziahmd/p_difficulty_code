Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Well, since each block is defined by the arrangement of the roads, maybe we can represent each block by the sign of each road's equation. Because for each line, a point is either on one side or the other. Since the home and university are not on any road, they are in some region.\n\nSo for each road, the home's position relative to it can be determined by plugging into the equation. For example, if the home is at (x1,y1), then for each road i, compute a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. The sign of this value determines which side of the line the home is on. Similarly for the university. \n\nBut how does this help in determining adjacency between blocks? Well, two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border, which would mean that they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because moving across a road would change the sign of that road's equation. So, if two blocks differ in exactly one road's sign, they are adjacent. Wait, but maybe there are multiple roads. So, the blocks are represented by a vector of signs for each road. Then, two blocks are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position. Because that would mean that they are separated by that road. \n\nBut how do I model this? The problem is that the number of possible blocks is 2^n, which for n=300 is way too big. So we can't generate all possible blocks. However, the home and university are specific points. So perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node is a possible sign configuration, but only those reachable via steps from the home's configuration. But even that seems impossible for n=300. \n\nWait, but maybe the minimal steps between the home and university can be found by considering the difference in their sign configurations. Let me think. Let's consider that each road contributes a bit (positive or negative) to the home's position and the university's position. \n\nFor each road, the home and university could be on the same side or opposite sides. If they are on opposite sides, then that road must be crossed once. But since each step can cross one road, maybe the minimal steps is the number of roads where the home and university are on different sides. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because maybe crossing a road once can affect multiple differences. Wait, no. Because each step moves you across one road. So, each step can flip the sign of exactly one road. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. Because each such road needs to be crossed once. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me think with an example. Suppose there are two roads. Home is on the positive side of both roads, and the university is on the negative side of both. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. Because you have to cross each road once. But if the university is on the negative side of one and positive of another, then you need to cross both roads once. So, the number of differing roads is 2. \n\nAnother example: if the home and university differ in exactly one road. Then, you can cross that road once, so the answer is 1. \n\nSo, the minimal steps required is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nWait, but how can that be? Because the problem says that the movement is allowed only if the two blocks share a common border. So, each step can cross one road. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. \n\nBut how do I check that? \n\nLet me think again. For each road, if the home and university are on opposite sides, then that road is part of the minimal path. Because you have to cross it. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nBut why? Because each such road must be crossed once. Because if you have two roads that separate the home and university, you can cross them in sequence. \n\nBut what if there's a scenario where crossing one road allows you to cross another road in the same step? No, because each step crosses exactly one road. So, each road that separates the home and university must be crossed once. \n\nSo the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nWait, but let's test the sample input. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0, and 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 → positive. \n\nFor second road (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1 → positive. \n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. \n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → negative. \n\nSo for both roads, home and university are on opposite sides. So the answer is 2. Which matches the first sample output. \n\nSecond sample input: home (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1 (x=0): 1 → positive.\n\nRoad 2 (y=0): 1 → positive.\n\nRoad 3 (x + y -3 =0): 1+1-3 = -1 → negative.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: -1 → negative.\n\nRoad 2: -1 → negative.\n\nRoad 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 → negative. \n\nSo for roads 1 and 2, home and university are on opposite sides. For road 3, they are same (both negative). So total of 2 roads differing. Hence the answer is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nSo the solution is to compute for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer. \n\nBut wait, how to check if two points are on opposite sides of a line. \n\nFor a line ax + by + c =0, the value of ax + by + c for a point (x,y) gives the sign. \n\nSo for home (x1,y1) and university (x2,y2), compute for each road:\n\nval1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i\n\nval2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i\n\nIf val1 and val2 have opposite signs, then the road separates them. So the count increases by 1. \n\nBut how to check if they are on opposite sides. \n\nWell, if val1 * val2 < 0, then yes. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nRead home and university coordinates.\n\nRead n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute val1 and val2. If val1 * val2 < 0, increment the count. \n\nThe answer is the count. \n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nBecause each road that separates the two points must be crossed once. And each such crossing is a step. \n\nBut why can't there be a case where two roads are crossed in a way that allows fewer steps? \n\nFor example, suppose there are two roads that cross each other, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. But perhaps there's a path that crosses one road twice? No, because each step moves across a road once. \n\nBut the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each such road must be crossed once. \n\nBut how can that be? For example, imagine two roads that are parallel. Suppose the home is on one side of both, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, you need to cross both roads. So steps is 2. \n\nAnother example: two roads that cross. The home is in a region that is on one side of both roads, and the university is on the opposite side of both. Then, you have to cross both roads. So steps is 2. \n\nBut how can you cross both roads in two steps? Because each step crosses one road. \n\nYes. So the answer is indeed the number of roads separating the two points. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting how many roads have the home and university on opposite sides. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases. \n\nWhat if there are zero roads? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, no, the input says n can be 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. Wait, no, looking back: the third line is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n is at least 1. So no case with zero roads. \n\nAnother case: when a road is such that the home and university are on the same side. Then, it's not counted. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each a, b, c in roads:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but why is this correct? Because the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. So the product can't be zero. So the check is safe. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the solution. \n\nLet me check the sample input again. \n\nFirst sample:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). \n\nRoads:\n\n0 1 0 → equation is 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0. \n\nval1 for home is 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 for univ is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * -1 = -1 <0 → count +=1. \n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x=0. \n\nval1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSecond sample:\n\nHome (1,1), univ (-1,-1). Roads are:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1, val2 is -1 → count +=1.\n\n0 1 0 → y=0. val1 is 1, val2 is -1 → count +=1. \n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0. \n\nval1: 1 +1 -3 = -1. val2: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0 → no count. \n\nTotal count is 2. Correct. \n\nSo this approach works. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, implement this in Python. \n\nRead input:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines of a, b, c. \n\nBut note that in the input examples, the first input is given as a string like ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', ...], but in actual input, it's read from stdin. \n\nSo, the code will read from stdin. \n\nIn Python, read the first two lines as home and university coordinates. Then read n, then read n lines for the roads. \n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each road:\n\ncompute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nYes. \n\nThis is very simple. \n\nBut let me check for possible integer overflows. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. \n\nWhat about the case when a road is vertical or horizontal? Doesn't matter, the calculation is the same. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, write the code. \n\nRead the input:\n\nWe can read the first line as x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nSame for the second line. \n\nThen n = int(input())\n\nThen for each of n lines, read a, b, c. \n\nThen process as described. \n\nSo the code is:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code. \n\nTesting the samples:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives count 2. \n\nSecond sample:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich gives count 2. \n\nSo the code works. \n\nLooks like this is the correct solution. The problem seems to be easier than it initially appeared. \n\nSo the answer is to count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each road is defined by a linear equation. The goal is to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves crossing a road.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border, which means they differ in exactly one road's sign. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads that separate these two blocks.\n\n3. **Check Separation by Roads**: For each road, check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This can be determined by evaluating the sign of the linear equation for both points. If the signs are different, the road separates them.\n\n4. **Count Separating Roads**: Count the number of roads where the home and university points lie on opposite sides. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Separation**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Steps**: The number of such roads that separate the home and university points is counted and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps required by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
