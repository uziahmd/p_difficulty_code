Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. The output for that case is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and see if they appear more than once. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate L from min possible (maybe 1) up to the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2? Or maybe len(s)-1? Because a substring longer than half the string can't appear twice. Wait, for example, if the string is length 5, then a substring of length 3 can appear twice if they overlap. Like 'aaaaa' has substrings of length 3: 'aaa' occurs three times. So the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1, but for the case where the same substring occurs twice. For example, in a string of length 2, the maximum L is 1. So for the general case, the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. But for the problem, we need to check all possible L's from len(s)-1 down to 1, and for each L, check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nFor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   collect all substrings of length L, check if any of them appears at least twice.\n\n   if yes, return L.\n\nIf none found after checking all L, return 0.\n\nBut how do I check for substrings of length L?\n\nFor example, for a string s of length N, for each starting index i from 0 to N-L, take the substring s[i:i+L]. Then check if any of these substrings occurs more than once.\n\nBut for each L, we can collect all substrings of that length, and check if any has a count >=2.\n\nBut for L= len(s)-1, there are two substrings (for example, for len(s)=5, L=4: substrings are s[0:4], s[1:5]). If they are same, then return 4.\n\nSo for each L, generate all substrings of that length, store them in a set or a frequency map. If any substring occurs at least twice, return L.\n\nBut for checking, perhaps using a set. For each substring in the current L, check if it's already been seen before. If yes, then return L.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps for each L, we can iterate through all possible substrings of length L, and track their occurrences. For example, for each L, loop through the string, collect all substrings, and check if any duplicates exist.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\ndef longest_substring(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - L +1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return L\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nWait, but this approach would return the first occurrence of a duplicate substring for the largest possible L. So for example, if there are multiple Ls with possible duplicates, the first one (the largest) is returned.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because we're checking from largest L down.\n\nBut wait, what if for a certain L, there are multiple substrings that appear twice. But the code would return L as soon as it finds the first occurrence of a duplicate.\n\nBut that's correct. Because the first occurrence of a duplicate in the largest possible L is the answer.\n\nBut wait, for example, suppose for L=3, there are two substrings that are same. But the code would return 3.\n\nBut what if there's a longer L where there's a duplicate? Well, since we are checking from the largest possible L down, the first L where any duplicate is found is the maximum possible.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 'abcd' → output is 0. Let's see.\n\nn is 4. So L starts from 3 down to 1.\n\nFor L=3: check substrings of length 3. There are two: 'abc' and 'bcd'. Both are",
