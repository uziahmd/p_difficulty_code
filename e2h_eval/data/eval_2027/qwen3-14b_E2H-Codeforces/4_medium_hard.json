The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly isn't feasible. So we need an efficient way to compute the results without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The key here is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can calculate the number of losses in each full cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the sequences work. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], and Polycarpus uses B[i % k]. So for each round, we can determine the moves of both players based on their respective sequences.\n\nThe challenge is to compute for each round from 0 to n-1, which player loses, but doing this for n up to 2e9 is impossible with a loop. So we need to find the total number of times each player loses over all rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences m and k. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = l. Because after l rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the pattern of moves for both players will repeat every l rounds. Therefore, the outcomes of the rounds will also repeat every l rounds.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the total number of rounds is n. So if we can find how many full cycles of l rounds there are in n, and then compute the remaining rounds, we can calculate the total losses.\n\nSo first, compute the number of full cycles: total_cycles = n // l. Then, the remaining rounds are rem = n % l.\n\nFor each full cycle, we can precompute the number of times Nikephoros loses (let's call it a_loss) and Polycarpus loses (b_loss). Then, multiply these by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining rem rounds, we simulate them once and add the losses.\n\nBut how do we compute a_loss and b_loss for one full cycle?\n\nWe need to iterate through each of the l rounds (since l is the LCM of m and k), compute for each round whether Nikephoros or Polycarpus loses, and sum those counts.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible value of l? Since m and k can be up to 1000, the LCM could be as big as 1000*1000 = 1e6. So for each test case, l can be up to 1e6. And for each of those l rounds, we need to compute the outcome. That's acceptable because 1e6 is manageable even for multiple test cases.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute l = LCM(m, k)\n- Precompute for each of the l rounds, the moves of A and B.\n- For each of these l rounds, determine who loses (if any), and accumulate the counts for a_loss and b_loss in one cycle.\n- Then, total_a = total_cycles * a_loss + count_in_remaining_rounds_a\n- Similarly for total_b.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So we need to compute GCD first.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute m and k. Compute l = LCM(m, k). Then for each of the l rounds, compute the moves of A and B. For each round, check who wins and increment the counts.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, multiply by the number of full cycles. Then process the remaining rounds (rem = n % l) by checking each of those rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round in the cycle?\n\nFor each round i in 0..l-1:\n\nA's move is A[i % m], B's move is B[i % k].\n\nSo for each i from 0 to l-1, we can compute the moves.\n\nNow, for each such pair of moves, determine who wins.\n\nSo for example, if A's move is 'R' and B's move is 'S', then A wins, so B gets a spot. If it's a draw, nothing. Otherwise, if B's move beats A's, then A gets a spot.\n\nSo for each pair, we can check the outcome.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute l = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the l rounds, the a_move and b_move, and count how many times a loses (a_loss) and b loses (b_loss) in one cycle.\n\nThen, total_cycles = n // l\n\nrem = n % l\n\ntotal_a = total_cycles * a_loss\n\ntotal_b = total_cycles * b_loss\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, we need to check each of the first rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1) and add the losses.\n\nSo for the remaining rounds, we can loop from 0 to rem-1, compute the moves, and add the losses.\n\nBut for rem up to l-1, which is up to 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\nBut what if l is larger than n? Like, when n is smaller than l. Then total_cycles is 0, and rem is n. So we just process all n rounds.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nBut first, how to compute the GCD and LCM.\n\nIn Python, we can compute GCD using math.gcd, but note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for Python 3.5+. Also, since m and k are positive integers, this is okay.\n\nBut for LCM, we can compute it as m * k // gcd(m, k).\n\nBut need to handle cases where m or k is zero? No, since the constraints say 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nImplement a function to compute LCM.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to l-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen check the outcome.\n\nHow to check who wins?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b, returns who wins.\n\nFor example:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a, b) is ('R', 'S') → a wins → b loses → so Nikephoros (a) is winner, so Polycarpus (b) gets a spot. So in this case, a_loss is 0, b_loss is 1.\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if there's a winner, the loser is the one who gets a spot. So:\n\nIf Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarpus's is +1? No, no. Wait:\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Nikephoros's red spots count increases? No, no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for each round, the loser is the one who gets a spot. So:\n\nIf Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot (so Polycarpus's count increases by 1). If Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros's count increases by 1. If it's a draw, nothing.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check if there's a winner, and if so, increment the corresponding count.\n\nSo for a_move and b_move:\n\nif a_move beats b_move → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets a spot → so add 1 to the second number (Polycarpus's count).\n\nif b_move beats a_move → Polycarpus wins → Nikephoros gets a spot → add 1 to the first number.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4). So LCM(3,4) is 12. So for each of the 12 rounds, we compute the moves.\n\nBut the sample has n=7 rounds, which is less than 12. So total_cycles is 0, and rem is 7. So we process 7 rounds.\n\nBut the sample output is 3 and 2. Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the code can handle that.\n\nSo, the helper function to check the outcome between a and b:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss for either\n\n    # else, check who wins\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so b loses. So Nikephoros (a) wins, so Polycarpus (b) gets a spot.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, so a loses. Nikephoros (a) gets a spot.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes. So for each pair, we can get the increments for a_loss and b_loss.\n\nSo, for each of the l rounds in the cycle, compute the (a_loss_contribution, b_loss_contribution) and sum them.\n\nOnce we have the per-cycle counts, then multiply by the number of full cycles.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute l = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b.\n\nThen, compute total_cycles = n // l\n\nrem = n % l\n\nThen, for the full cycles, total_a = total_cycles * per_cycle_a, same for total_b.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, we need to process each of the first rem rounds (i from 0 to rem-1) and compute the (a, b) moves and add to the totals.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for the rem rounds?\n\nFor each i in 0 to rem-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen, get the result and add to the total.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows.\n\nNow, considering that l can be up to 1e6, and for each of those steps, the code is O(l) time, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut let's check for m and k up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6. So for 1e6 steps, even multiplied by 2 (for the per_cycle and rem steps), it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n is 0? No, the constraints say n ≥ 1.\n\nCase 2: All rounds are draws. Then the output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: when l is larger than n, so rem is n.\n\nAnother case: when n is exactly divisible by l, so rem is 0.\n\nSo the code handles all these.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read A and B.\n\nBut the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as two lines? Or maybe the first line is n, then the next two lines are A and B. So the code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is a list with two elements, but that's probably a mistake in the way the example is presented. The actual input is:\n\nFor example, the first sample input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich would be read as n=7, A is RPS, B is RSPP.\n\nSo the code reads n, then A, then B.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nNow, compute LCM.\n\nImplementing LCM:\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd exists, but it returns the absolute value. However, since m and k are positive, we can proceed.\n\nBut for Python versions, math.gcd may not be available in some environments, but assuming that it's okay.\n\nBut to avoid issues, perhaps better to implement the GCD function ourselves, or use math.gcd.\n\nBut for code, let's use math.gcd.\n\nBut note that in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists and returns the correct value for positive integers.\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nSo, m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nl = lcm(m, k).\n\nThen, for the per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b:\n\nper_cycle_a = 0\n\nper_cycle_b = 0\n\nfor i in range(l):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    # compute the result\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so b gets a spot\n\n        per_cycle_b += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, a gets a spot\n\n        per_cycle_a += 1\n\nOnce that's done, then:\n\ntotal_cycles = n // l\n\nrem = n % l\n\ntotal_a = total_cycles * per_cycle_a\n\ntotal_b = total_cycles * per_cycle_b\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, process each of the first rem rounds:\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif ... same as before:\n\n        if a wins, add to total_b\n\n        else add to total_a\n\nSo, the code for the rem part.\n\nSo, putting all together.\n\nBut for the code, the code needs to read the input, process, etc.\n\nNow, let's test with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn =7\n\nA is 'RPS' (m=3)\n\nB is 'RSPP' (k=4)\n\nl = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b is computed for 12 rounds.\n\nLet's compute for each i from 0 to 11:\n\ni=0:\n\na = A[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nb = B[0%4] = B[0] = R → draw. No change.\n\ni=1:\n\na is A[1%3] = A[1] = P\n\nb is B[1%4] = B[1] = S → P vs S. S beats P? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRock beats scissors.\n\nScissors beat paper.\n\nPaper beats rock.\n\nSo, for a_move and b_move:\n\nif a is P (paper), b is S (scissors): scissors beats paper. So b wins. So a (Nikephoros) loses. So per_cycle_a +=1.\n\nSo in this case, for i=1, a_move is P, b_move is S. So b wins. So Nikephoros (a) loses. So total_a increases by 1.\n\nWait, in the code, for this case, the code checks if a wins. Else, b wins. So in this case, since a is P and b is S, the condition (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or ... ?\n\nThe code checks if a wins. For a to win, the conditions are:\n\na is R and b is S → a wins.\n\na is S and b is P → a wins.\n\na is P and b is R → a wins.\n\nElse, if the moves are different, then b wins.\n\nIn the case of a is P, b is S: the code checks if any of the three conditions are met. The third condition is a is P and b is R. So no. So the code goes into the else clause. So b wins. So Nikephoros (a) gets a spot. So per_cycle_a increases by 1.\n\nSo for i=1, per_cycle_a +=1.\n\nBut according to the first sample's explanation:\n\nThe first sample's rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (since S beats P). So Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait in the sample explanation, the first sample's rounds are:\n\nThe sample input is 7 rounds. The first round is R vs R (draw). Second round is P vs S (Nikephoros's move is P, Polycarpus's move is S. So S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1. But according to the sample explanation, in the first sample, Nikephoros has 3 losses, Polycarpus 2.\n\nBut according to the code's calculation for i=1, which is the second round (assuming rounds start at 0?), then in that case, the code would have added 1 to per_cycle_a (Nikephoros's loss count). So let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the code is processing the rounds correctly.\n\nBut perhaps I should go through the sample.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nSo for the first sample, the code's per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b for l=12 rounds would be calculated. Then, since n=7 < l=12, total_cycles is 0, and rem=7.\n\nSo the code processes the first 7 rounds.\n\nLet's compute each of the first 7 rounds:\n\nRound 0 (i=0):\n\na: R, b: R → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 1 (i=1):\n\na: P, b: S → S beats P. Nikephoros loses. So total_a +=1.\n\nRound 2 (i=2):\n\na: S (i=2 mod 3 is 2 → A[2] is S), b: B[2 mod 4] is B[2] is P. S vs P: S beats P. So a wins. So b loses. So total_b +=1.\n\nRound 3 (i=3):\n\na: i=3 mod 3 is 0 → R. B: i=3 mod 4 is 3 → B[3] is P. R vs P: P beats R. So b wins. So a (Nikephoros) loses. So total_a +=1.\n\nRound 4 (i=4):\n\na: i=4 mod 3 is 1 → P. B: 4 mod 4 is 0 → B[0] is R. P vs R: P beats R. So a wins. So b loses. total_b +=1.\n\nRound 5 (i=5):\n\na: 5 mod 3 is 2 → S. B: 5 mod 4 is 1 → B[1] is S. S vs S → draw. No change.\n\nRound 6 (i=6):\n\na: 6 mod 3 is 0 → R. B: 6 mod 4 is 2 → B[2] is P. R vs P: P beats R. So b wins. a loses. total_a +=1.\n\nSo after 7 rounds (i=0 to 6), the total_a is 1 (from i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) = 3. total_b is 1 (from i=2) + 1 (from i=4) = 2. Which matches the sample output of 3 2. So the code would correctly compute this.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, another sample input is given in the example: the second input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich outputs 0 0.\n\nSo for this case, A is 'RRRRRRRR' (m=8), B is 'R' (k=1). LCM(8,1)=8. So per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b are computed for 8 rounds.\n\nEach round, A's move is R, B's move is R. So all rounds are draws. So per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b are 0. So for n=5, total_cycles is 0 (since 5 < 8), rem=5. So for 5 rounds, all are draws. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling very large l (up to 1e6). For 1e6 steps, it's acceptable in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, the code would process l steps once, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    l = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    per_cycle_a = 0\n\n    per_cycle_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(l):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        # Determine who wins\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            per_cycle_b += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            per_cycle_a += 1\n\n    total_cycles = n // l\n\n    rem = n % l\n\n    total_a = total_cycles * per_cycle_a\n\n    total_b = total_cycles * per_cycle_b\n\n    # Now process rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            total_b += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            total_a += 1\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the code would compute per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b for 12 rounds. But for the first sample, the code would process the rem=7 rounds. Which is handled correctly.\n\nBut what about the case where l is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, so l is at least 1.\n\nAnother possible edge case is when n is zero, but the problem says n is at least 1.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nOutput: 3 2.\n\nAs discussed, the code returns that.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then, A wins, so B gets a spot. Output is 0 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1, A is 'S', B is 'R'. Then B wins, so A gets a spot. Output is 1 0.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut in Python, for very large l (like 1e6), the for loops may take some time, but given that 1e6 is manageable.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, the code is O(l) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo this should be the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player follows a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently determine the number of losses for each player over a potentially very large number of rounds (up to 2 billion).\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Since both players use cyclic sequences, their move patterns will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute results for one full cycle and then extrapolate for the total number of rounds.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By computing the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences, we can determine the number of full cycles within the given number of rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately. This reduces the problem from simulating each round individually to processing only the LCM length of the sequences, which is feasible even for large values of n.\n\n4. **Outcome Determination**: For each round in a full cycle, determine the winner and count the losses for each player. Multiply these counts by the number of full cycles and add the results from any remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    l = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_cycle_a = 0\n    per_cycle_b = 0\n    \n    for i in range(l):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            per_cycle_b += 1\n        else:\n            per_cycle_a += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // l\n    rem = n % l\n    \n    total_a = total_cycles * per_cycle_a\n    total_b = total_cycles * per_cycle_b\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is computed to determine the cycle length after which the move patterns repeat.\n\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round within one LCM cycle, the moves of both players are determined and the outcome of each round is checked. The number of losses for each player in one full cycle is recorded.\n\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles and remaining rounds are calculated. The losses from full cycles are multiplied by the number of cycles, and the remaining rounds are processed individually to account for any leftover rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large numbers of rounds by leveraging the repeating pattern of moves, thus avoiding the need to simulate each round individually.",
