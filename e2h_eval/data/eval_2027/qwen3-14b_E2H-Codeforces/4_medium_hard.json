The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. For each round, Nikephoros uses his sequence A cyclically. So for round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nThe challenge is to compute for each of the n rounds, who wins, and count the losses for each player.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round step by step is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the key is to find patterns or cycles that can be calculated efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible approach. Let's consider that the sequences A and B are periodic. So the combination of their moves will repeat after some period. The period would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so their move patterns repeat.\n\nSo, if I can calculate the number of wins for each player in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, then I can compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds, multiply by the counts, and then add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, let's compute the LCM of m and k. Let me recall that LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need a function to compute GCD, then LCM.\n\nBut for large m and k (up to 1000), the LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000=1e6). So for each possible round in the LCM period, we can precompute the moves of both players and determine who wins. Then, for the total n rounds, we can find how many full periods there are, multiply by the counts per period, and then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T. So T is the number of rounds in one full cycle of both sequences.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to T-1, determine what move A and B make. Then determine who wins. Count the number of times Nikephoros loses (which adds to his red spots) and Polycarpus loses (adds to his).\n\n3. Let total_full_cycles = n // T. The remaining_rounds = n % T.\n\n4. The total for full cycles is total_full_cycles * (count_A_loss_per_cycle, count_B_loss_per_cycle).\n\n5. Then, simulate the remaining_rounds rounds (from 0 to remaining_rounds-1) and add those counts.\n\nBut wait, for each round in the T rounds, we can compute the outcome. Then, the total for the full cycles is multiplied by the number of full cycles.\n\nBut how do I compute the counts for the full cycles?\n\nYes. So, for example, if T is 1e6, then for each of the T rounds, I can compute the outcome once, and sum up the number of times each player loses in that T-length cycle. Then multiply by the number of full cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds (less than T), simulate each of them once.\n\nThis approach would work because T is up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000 each, their LCM is up to 1e6). So for each T, even 1e6 rounds, processing them is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute T as LCM(m, k).\n\n- Precompute for each of the T rounds, the moves of A and B.\n\n- For each of these T rounds, compute if A wins, B wins, or draw. Accumulate the counts of A's losses and B's losses in one cycle.\n\n- Then, total_full_cycles = n // T. Multiply the counts by total_full_cycles.\n\n- Then, process the remaining rounds (n % T) rounds, again checking each of them and adding to the counts.\n\nNow, how to compute the moves for each round in the T rounds.\n\nFor each round i (from 0 to T-1):\n\nA's move is A[i % m], since the sequence cycles every m steps.\n\nSimilarly, B's move is B[i % k].\n\nOnce we have both moves, determine the outcome.\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b), we can check who wins.\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nIf same, draw.\n\nSo, for a given a and b, how to determine the outcome.\n\nWe can create a helper function that takes a and b and returns who wins.\n\nFor example:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) or (a is S and b is P) or (a is P and b is R): then A wins. So B loses, so Nikephoros (A) is the winner. So Polycarpus (B) gets a red spot.\n\nOtherwise, B wins. So Nikephoros (A) gets a red spot.\n\nSo for each pair, we can check.\n\nSo, for each of the T rounds, we can compute whether A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string and B string.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute the counts for one cycle (T rounds):\n\ncount_a_loss = 0\n\ncount_b_loss = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to T-1:\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    determine outcome.\n\n    if outcome is A wins: count_b_loss +=1\n\n    elif outcome is B wins: count_a_loss +=1\n\n    else: pass.\n\nThen, total_full_cycles = n // T\n\nremaining = n % T\n\ntotal_a_loss = total_full_cycles * count_a_loss\n\ntotal_b_loss = total_full_cycles * count_b_loss\n\nThen, process the remaining rounds (from 0 to remaining-1):\n\nfor i in 0 to remaining-1:\n\n    same as before, check a_move and b_move, add to the totals.\n\nFinally, output total_a_loss and total_b_loss.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, m is 3, k is 4. LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo T is 12. Let's see:\n\nn is 7, so total_full_cycles is 0 (7//12=0), remaining is 7.\n\nSo we process 7 rounds.\n\nWhich matches the sample explanation.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is 3 and 2. Let's see.\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds, the code would process each of the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut how does that work?\n\nYes. So the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute LCM(m, k). To compute LCM, we need GCD.\n\nImplementing GCD in Python is straightforward. For example, using Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nImplement a function to compute GCD of two numbers.\n\nThen, LCM(a, b) = a * b // GCD(a, b).\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, this is easy.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n from input. Then read A and B.\n\nBut wait, the input format is:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A as a string.\n\nThird line is B as a string.\n\nWait, the input given in the example is:\n\nInput:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nThe second line is the sequence A.\n\nThird line is the sequence B.\n\nSo in the sample input, the first case is:\n\nn=7, A is \"RPS\", B is \"RSPP\".\n\nSo, in code, read n as int(input()), then A as input().strip(), then B as input().strip().\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for very large n, like 2e9, but with T up to 1e6, the code will process T rounds once, then multiply by the number of full cycles, then process remaining rounds.\n\nSo for T up to 1e6, even with 1e6 steps, it's manageable.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nNow, the helper function for determining the outcome.\n\nLet me think: For a and b, what's the result.\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # A wins, B loses\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # B wins, A loses\n\nSo, for each pair, return 1, -1, or 0.\n\nSo, in code, for each i in 0 to T-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nres = get_result(a, b)\n\nif res == 1: then B loses, so count_b_loss +=1\n\nelif res == -1: count_a_loss +=1\n\nelse: nothing.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement this.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn =7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4).\n\nCompute T = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nFor each i from 0 to 11:\n\nLet's compute the moves and outcomes.\n\nBut for the first 7 rounds, which is the sample.\n\nBut let's see the sample's explanation.\n\nRound 1: R vs R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P vs S (A's move is P, B's move is S. So S beats P? Wait, no. Wait, the sample says in the first sample:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros (A) has P, Polycarpus (B) has S. S beats P, so B wins. So Nikephoros loses. So count_a_loss +=1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the first sample, the first round is a draw, then in the second round, Nikephoros loses. So in the sample's explanation, the rounds are numbered from 1 to 7, but in code, the rounds are 0-based?\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R - R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S → Nikephoros loses.\n\nBut according to the code, for i=0 to 6 (since n=7), the rounds are 0 to 6.\n\nSo let's see:\n\ni=0: A[0%3] = A[0] = R. B[0%4] = B[0] = R. Draw.\n\ni=1: A[1%3] = A[1] = P. B[1%4] = B[1] = S. So P vs S. S beats P. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So count_a_loss +=1.\n\ni=2: A[2%3] = A[2] = S. B[2%4] = B[2] = P. S vs P. S beats P. So A wins. B loses. So count_b_loss +=1.\n\ni=3: A[3%3=0] → R. B[3%4=3] → B[3] = P. R vs P. P beats R. So B wins. A loses. count_a_loss +=1.\n\ni=4: A[4%3=1] → P. B[4%4=0] → B[0] = R. P vs R. P beats R. A wins. B loses. count_b_loss +=1.\n\ni=5: A[5%3=2] → S. B[5%4=1] → B[1] = S. S vs S → draw.\n\ni=6: A[6%3=0] → R. B[6%4=2] → B[2] = P. R vs P → B wins. A loses. count_a_loss +=1.\n\nSo after 7 rounds, the counts are:\n\ncount_a_loss is 1 (from i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) → total 3.\n\ncount_b_loss is 1 (i=2) + 1 (i=4) → total 2. Which matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of T rounds, the counts for a_loss and b_loss in one cycle.\n\nThen multiply by full_cycles = n // T.\n\nThen process the remaining rounds (n % T) rounds.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing LCM.\n\nIn Python, for GCD, we can use math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut for LCM, since m and k can be up to 1e3, their product is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle when a or b is zero? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nCompute T = lcm(m, k).\n\nThen, for the T rounds, compute the counts.\n\nBut for T up to 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\ncount_a_loss = 0\n\ncount_b_loss = 0\n\nfor i in range(T):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    # determine outcome\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # A wins, B loses\n\n        count_b_loss +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        # B wins, A loses\n\n        count_a_loss +=1\n\nThen, full_cycles = n // T\n\nremaining = n % T\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * count_a_loss\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * count_b_loss\n\nThen, process the remaining rounds:\n\nfor i in range(remaining):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        total_b +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        total_a +=1\n\nThen, print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, T is 12. For n=7, full_cycles is 0, remaining is 7. So the code processes 7 rounds, which is correct.\n\nBut what about when T is larger than n? For example, n=5, T=12. Then remaining is 5, and process 5 rounds.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if T is zero? Well, since m and k are at least 1, T is at least 1.\n\nSo, this code should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nm=3, k=4. T=12.\n\ncount_a_loss and count_b_loss for T=12 rounds:\n\nWe can imagine that for the first 7 rounds, the code would process as above. But for the full T=12 rounds, the code would process all of them. However, in the sample, since n=7 < T=12, the full_cycles is 0, and the remaining is 7.\n\nThus, the code would compute correctly.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). T = LCM(8,1) = 8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds:\n\nA's move is R, B's move is R. All draws. So count_a_loss and count_b_loss are 0.\n\nfull_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0. remaining =5. So process 5 rounds. All draws. So output 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nNow, what about when n is larger than T?\n\nFor example, say n= T + 5. Then full_cycles is 1, and remaining is 5. The code would process the full cycle once, then the remaining 5 rounds.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All rounds are draws. Then output 0 0.\n\n- All rounds are A wins. So for each cycle, count_b_loss is T, count_a_loss is 0.\n\n- When n is exactly T * something.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement in Python.\n\nBut for very large T (like 1e6), the code may take O(1e6) time, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, the code is O(T) which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    T = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    count_a = 0\n\n    count_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            count_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            count_a +=1\n\n    full_cycles = n // T\n\n    remaining = n % T\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b\n\n    # process remaining rounds\n\n    for i in range(remaining):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            total_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_a +=1\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, the variables count_a and count_b are for the number of times A loses and B loses in one cycle. Because in the code:\n\nif A wins, then B loses → count_b increases. So count_b is the number of times B loses in the cycle. Similarly, count_a is the number of times A loses in the cycle.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in the code, for the full_cycles, total_a is the number of times A lost in full_cycles cycles. Same for total_b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, test the first sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives output 3 2. Which matches.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput is 0 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then A wins, so B loses. Output is 0 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is 'S', B is 'R'. Then B wins, A loses. Output is 1 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then for two rounds, each round A wins. So B has 2 losses. Output 0 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code is written. Now, considering that in Python, for very large T (like 1e6), the code may take some time, but since 1e6 is manageable.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, the LCM can be up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nSo this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even for a very large number of rounds.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Each player uses a sequence of moves that repeats cyclically. Nikephoros uses sequence A and Polycarpus uses sequence B.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The combined move patterns of both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This LCM value, denoted as T, represents the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By calculating the results for one full cycle (T rounds), we can determine the number of losses for each player in that cycle. For a large number of rounds (n), we compute how many full cycles fit into n and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            count_b += 1\n        else:\n            count_a += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remaining = n % T\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b\n    \n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds (n), and the sequences A and B for Nikephoros and Polycarpus respectively.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences A and B is computed to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within the LCM period, we simulate the game to count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles Handling**: We calculate how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds (n) and multiply the loss counts by the number of full cycles.\n5. **Remaining Rounds Handling**: Any remaining rounds after accounting for full cycles are processed individually to accumulate the final loss counts.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of n by leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies, reducing the problem complexity from O(n) to O(LCM(m, k)), which is feasible given the constraints.",
