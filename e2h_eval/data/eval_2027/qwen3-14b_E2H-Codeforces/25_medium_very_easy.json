При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap has to be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part must be a positive number of characters, but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where the entire message is overlapped) is not considered an error. Similarly, just appending without any overlap isn't considered an error either.\n\nSo, the task is to check if the given string t could be formed by such an error. If yes, output YES and a possible s. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the original string t must be formed by two copies of s merged with some overlap. Let's denote the length of s as len_s. Then, the length of t would be 2*len_s - overlap_length. But since the overlap is between the two copies of s, the overlap_length must be at least 1 and less than len_s.\n\nBut how can I find possible candidates for s?\n\nLet me think about the possible lengths of s. Since t is formed by two s's with an overlap of k characters (k >= 1, k < len_s), then the length of t is 2 * len_s - k. So len_s must be such that 2 * len_s - k = len(t). But since k can vary between 1 and len_s-1, we can express len_s in terms of len(t).\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let len_t be the length of t. Then:\n\nlen_t = 2 * len_s - k → k = 2 * len_s - len_t.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and len_s - 1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s - 1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities for len_s.\n\nFirst inequality: 2*len_s - len_t ≥ 1 → 2*len_s ≥ len_t + 1 → len_s ≥ (len_t + 1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s - 1 → 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s -1 → len_s ≤ len_t -1.\n\nSo combining both, len_s must be between ceil( (len_t + 1)/2 ) and len_t -1, inclusive.\n\nWait, but len_s must be such that len_t = 2*len_s -k, where k is between 1 and len_s-1. So for each possible len_s, there's a possible k.\n\nBut how do I find possible len_s values?\n\nLet me think. For example, len_t must be equal to 2*len_s -k, where k is between 1 and len_s-1. Let me think of len_s as being in the range from (len_t + 1)/2 to len_t -1. Because if len_s is (len_t +1)/2, then the maximum possible k is len_s -1. Let's see:\n\nFor example, suppose len_t is 5. Then possible len_s must be between (5+1)/2=3 and 5-1=4. So len_s can be 3 or 4.\n\nIf len_s is 3, then k = 2*3 -5 = 1. Which is between 1 and 2 (since len_s-1 is 2). So valid.\n\nIf len_s is 4, then k= 2*4 -5 = 3. But len_s-1 is 3, so k is exactly 3, which is allowed.\n\nSo for each possible len_s in this range, we can check if there exists a k such that the overlapping condition holds.\n\nBut how do I check if the string t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s?\n\nOnce I have a candidate len_s, the idea is that the first len_s -k characters of the first s must be the same as the last k characters of the second s. Wait, no. Wait, when you merge two s's with an overlap of k characters, the merged string is s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s. Because the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k of the second s. So the merged string would be s concatenated with s, but overlapping the last k of the first and the first k of the second. So the total length is len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k = len_t.\n\nSo for the merged string t to be formed by this process, the first part (the first s minus the overlapping part) plus the second s (but overlapping) must form t.\n\nAlternatively, the first occurrence of s in t is such that the last k characters of the first s are the same as the first k characters of the second s. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to the first s (without the overlapping part) followed by the second s. So, the first part of t (up to len_s -k) plus the entire second s (which is s) must be equal to t.\n\nBut how can I check this?\n\nLet me think. For a given len_s, the possible k is 2*len_s - len_t. Because len_t = 2*len_s -k → k = 2*len_s - len_t.\n\nSo for each possible len_s in the range (ceil((len_t +1)/2), len_t -1), compute k = 2*len_s - len_t. Then check if k is between 1 and len_s-1. Well, since len_s is chosen in that way, it should be.\n\nOnce I have k, then the overlapping part is k characters. So the first s is of length len_s, and the second s is also of length len_s. The merged string is the first s concatenated with the second s, but overlapping the last k characters of the first with the first k of the second. So the merged string would be s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s. Wait, no. Because the first s is len_s characters. The overlapping part is k characters. So the first s contributes len_s -k characters, then the second s contributes len_s characters. But since the first k of the second s is overlapping with the last k of the first s, the total is (len_s -k) + len_s = 2*len_s -k = len_t.\n\nTherefore, the merged string t must be equal to (s[0 : len_s -k ]) + s. Wait, no. Because the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k of the second s. So the merged string would be s[0 : len_s -k ] + s. Because the first s is split into two parts: the part before the overlapping (len_s -k characters) and the overlapping part (k characters). The second s starts with the overlapping part. So when merged, the overlapping part is only included once. So the merged string is the first part (len_s -k) of the first s plus the entire second s. Which is len_s -k + len_s = 2*len_s -k = len_t.\n\nSo, for the merged string t to be correct, the first len_s -k characters of the first s must be followed by the entire second s. But since the second s is the same as the first, the entire t must be equal to s[0 : len_s -k ] + s.\n\nBut how do I get s? Well, s is the first len_s characters of t? Or maybe not. Because the first part of t is s[0 : len_s -k], followed by s. So the entire t is s[0 : len_s -k ] + s. But the length of t is len_t = len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the entire t must be equal to s[0 : len_s -k ] + s. But since s is of length len_s, then the entire t can be written as (s without the last k characters) + s. Therefore, the first part of t is s without the last k characters, and the rest is s.\n\nBut how can I find s?\n\nWell, the entire t is (s without last k chars) + s. So the length of t is len_s -k + len_s = 2*len_s -k = len_t. So, the first part of t (of length len_s -k) is s[0 ... len_s -k -1], and the rest of t (from len_s -k onwards) is s. So the entire t must be equal to s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s.\n\nBut since the rest of t (from len_s -k onwards) is s, then the length of that part is len_s. So len_t - (len_s -k) = len_s → len_t = 2*len_s -k → which is true.\n\nSo, the part of t starting at position (len_s -k) must be equal to s. But s is of length len_s. Therefore, the substring of t starting at (len_s -k) and of length len_s must be equal to s.\n\nBut also, the first part of t (before that) must be s[0 ... len_s -k -1]. But since that part is part of s, then the entire s can be reconstructed as the first part plus the part from len_s -k onwards. Wait, perhaps the entire s is equal to the first part (len_s -k characters) plus the first k characters of the second part (which is s itself). Wait, no. Because the second part is s. So the first part is s[0 ... len_s -k -1], and the second part is s. So the entire s is s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s[len_s -k ... len_s -1]. But since the second part is s, the first len_s -k characters of the second part is s[0 ... len_s -k -1], which is the same as the first part. So perhaps the entire s is the first part plus the next k characters of the second part. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the part from len_s -k onwards is s, then s is equal to the substring of t starting at position (len_s -k) and of length len_s. So, for example, if we take that substring, that's our candidate s. Then, we need to check whether the first part of t (before that) is equal to the first (len_s -k) characters of s.\n\nBecause the first part of t is s[0 ... len_s -k -1], and the substring of t starting at len_s -k is s. Therefore, the first part must be equal to the first (len_s -k) characters of s. But since s is the substring of t starting at len_s -k, then the first part of t must be the first (len_s -k) characters of s.\n\nSo putting it all together, for a given len_s, compute k = 2*len_s - len_t. Then check if k is between 1 and len_s-1. Then, take the substring of t starting at (len_s -k) and of length len_s as candidate s. Then check whether the first part of t (the first len_s -k characters) is equal to the first len_s -k characters of s.\n\nIf that is true, then this s is a valid candidate.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor the input string t:\n\n- Compute len_t = len(t)\n\n- Iterate over possible len_s values. The possible len_s values are from ceil( (len_t + 1)/2 ) up to len_t - 1. Because len_s must be such that len_s >= (len_t +1)/2 and len_s <= len_t -1.\n\nWait, why? Because earlier analysis said that len_s must be between (len_t +1)/2 and len_t -1. Let me think again.\n\nWe had the inequalities:\n\n1 ≤ k = 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s -1.\n\nLet me re-express the inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: 2*len_s - len_t ≥ 1 → len_s ≥ (len_t + 1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s -1 → 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s -1 → len_s ≤ len_t -1.\n\nSo yes, len_s must be between (len_t +1)/2 and len_t -1. But since len_s must be an integer, we need to consider all integers in that range.\n\nSo for each possible len_s in that range, compute k = 2*len_s - len_t. Then check if k is between 1 and len_s -1. But since len_s is chosen such that len_s ≥ (len_t +1)/2 and len_s ≤ len_t -1, then k will be in the required range. Let me see:\n\nFor example, len_s is (len_t +1)/2 (if len_t is odd). Then k = 2*len_s - len_t = 2*( (len_t +1)/2 ) - len_t = len_t +1 - len_t = 1. Which is the minimum allowed value.\n\nFor len_s = len_t -1, k = 2*(len_t -1) - len_t = 2*len_t -2 - len_t = len_t -2. Now, len_s -1 is (len_t -1) -1 = len_t -2. So k = len_t -2 equals len_s -1. Which is allowed.\n\nSo for all len_s in that range, k is between 1 and len_s-1.\n\nSo for each len_s in that range, proceed as follows:\n\nCompute k = 2*len_s - len_t.\n\nCheck that k is between 1 and len_s-1. Which it should be.\n\nThen, the candidate s is the substring of t starting at position (len_s -k) and of length len_s. Because the part after the first (len_s -k) characters is s. So the starting index is len_s -k. Let me see:\n\nFor example, len_s = 5, len_t = 8. Then k = 2*5 -8 = 2. So len_s -k = 5-2 =3. The substring starting at 3 with length 5 is t[3:3+5] = t[3:8], which is 5 characters. Then, the first part of t is t[0:3], which is 3 characters. And that should be equal to the first 3 characters of s (which is t[3:8]).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each possible len_s in the valid range:\n\n   k = 2*len_s - len_t\n\n   start = len_s -k\n\n   candidate_s = t[start : start + len_s]\n\n   if the first part of t (t[0 : len_s -k ]) == candidate_s[0 : len_s -k ] ?\n\nWait, because the first part of t (length len_s -k) is supposed to be the first part of s (without the overlapping part). So the first part of t must be equal to the first len_s -k characters of candidate_s.\n\nBut candidate_s is supposed to be s. So if that is true, then the entire t is formed by overlapping two copies of candidate_s.\n\nSo for example, if the first part of t (t[0 : len_s -k ]) equals the first len_s -k characters of candidate_s, then the entire t is s (candidate_s) with the overlapping.\n\nSo, the code would check for that.\n\nOnce this is found, then return YES and the candidate_s.\n\nIf none of the len_s in the valid range satisfy this condition, then output NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the examples.\n\nTake the first example input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming the first sample input is the first element of the list, which is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'). The output is YES and 'abrakadabra'.\n\nLet me compute len_t. The input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is 19 characters? Wait, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. The sample input says that for the first example, the output is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). So the original t is 19 letters. Let me check:\n\nOriginal t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let's count:\n\nabrakadabra (11) + brakadabra (10?), but perhaps the actual length is 2*11 -1 = 21? Or perhaps the example is different. Maybe I should not get stuck here, but proceed.\n\nBut according to the example, for input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (probably length 21?), the output is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Let's see:\n\nlen_t = 21. Then len_s must be between (21+1)/2 = 11 and 20. So len_s can be 11, 12, ..., 20.\n\nFor len_s = 11, k = 2*11 -21 = 22 -21 =1. Then start = len_s -k = 11-1 =10. So candidate_s is t[10:10+11] = t[10:21], which is 11 characters. The first part of t is t[0: len_s -k ] = t[0:10]. So check if t[0:10] equals candidate_s[0:10].\n\nWhat is candidate_s here? Let's imagine that t is the merged string. For example, if the original s was 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), then merging with overlap of 1 character would be the first s (abrakadabra) and the second s (abrakadabra) overlapping on the last 1 character of the first and first 1 of the second. So the merged string would be abrakadabra (first s) with the second s overlapping by 1 character. So the merged string would be abrakadabra (11 letters) + the remaining 10 letters of the second s (since 1 is overlapped). So total length is 11 + 10 = 21. Which matches len_t. So the candidate_s is the second s, which is the substring from position 10 (since len_s -k is 11-1=10) to 10+11=21. So t[10:21] is the substring starting at index 10. Let's see, the original s is abrakadabra. So the first s is 0-10 (indices 0 to 10 inclusive?), then the second s starts overlapping. The first part of t is the first 10 characters of the first s (abrakadabr) and then the second s is abrakadabra. So the merged string would be abrakadabr (10 letters) + abrakadabra (11 letters). But that's 21 letters. However, the candidate_s is t[10:21], which is the second s. Which is 'abrakadabra' (assuming that the original s is that). So the first part of t (t[0:10]) is the first 10 letters of s (abrakadabr), which is the same as the first 10 letters of candidate_s (abrakadabra's first 10 letters). So the check would pass.\n\nThus, this len_s would be valid.\n\nSo the code would find this and return YES.\n\nAnother example is the second input: 'acacacaca' (output is 'acaca').\n\nLet me compute len_t = 9.\n\nPossible len_s ranges from (9+1)/2 = 5 to 8.\n\nSo len_s can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor len_s=5:\n\nk=2*5 -9=1. start =5-1=4. candidate_s is t[4:4+5] = t[4:9], which is 'caca' (wait, wait, t is 'acacacaca' (positions 0-8). So t[4] is 'c', t[4:9] is 'cacac'? Let me check:\n\nOriginal string is a c a c a c a c a (indices 0-8). So t[4:9] is positions 4,5,6,7,8: 'a c a c a' → 'acaca' (length 5). Then, the first part of t is len_s -k =5-1=4 characters. So t[0:4] is 'acac'.\n\nCheck if that equals the first 4 characters of candidate_s (which is 'acaca') → first 4 is 'acac' → yes. So this is valid. So candidate_s is 'acaca', which is the answer.\n\nSo the code would find this and output YES.\n\nAnother example is 'abcabc' → output is NO. Let's see.\n\nlen_t is 6. Possible len_s ranges from (6+1)/2=3.5 → ceil(3.5)=4 to 5.\n\nSo len_s can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor len_s=4: k=2*4 -6 = 2. start =4-2=2. candidate_s is t[2:2+4] = t[2:6] → 'cabc'. Check if first part (len_s -k =4-2=2) → t[0:2] is 'ab'. Check if that equals first 2 characters of candidate_s (which is 'ca') → no. So invalid.\n\nFor len_s=5: k=2*5-6=4. start is 5-4=1. candidate_s is t[1:6], which is 'bcabc' (length 5). Check first part len_s -k =5-4=1. t[0:1] is 'a'. Check if that equals first 1 character of candidate_s (which is 'b') → no. So no match. Thus, output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother example is 'abababab' (output is YES and 'ababab').\n\nLet me check. len_t is 8. Possible len_s ranges from (8+1)/2=4.5 → 5 to 7.\n\nSo len_s can be 5,6,7.\n\nCheck len_s=6:\n\nk=2*6 -8 =4. len_s -k =6-4=2. start is 6-4=2. candidate_s is t[2:2+6] = t[2:8] → 'ababab' (positions 2-7). len_s is 6. The first part is t[0:2] = 'ab'. Check if that equals the first 2 characters of candidate_s (which is 'ab') → yes. So this is valid. Thus, output is YES and 'ababab'.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string t.\n\nThen compute len_t = len(t).\n\nIf len_t is 1, then it's impossible (since two messages can't be merged into a single character). So output NO.\n\nElse, iterate len_s in the range from ceil((len_t +1)/2) to len_t -1, inclusive.\n\nBut how to compute the starting len_s. For example, (len_t +1)/2 may not be integer. So for len_s, the lower bound is (len_t +1 +1)//2? Or perhaps compute it as (len_t +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example, len_t is even. Suppose len_t is 6. (6+1)/2 = 3.5. So the lower bound is 4. So len_s starts from 4.\n\nIn Python, (len_t +1) // 2 would be (6+1)//2 = 3.5 floored to 3. But we need to ceil. So perhaps the lower bound is (len_t +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. How to calculate the minimal len_s. The minimal len_s is ceil( (len_t +1)/2 ). For example, len_t is 5: (5+1)/2 = 3 → ceil(3) is 3. For len_t=6: (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. So how to compute that in Python.\n\nIn Python, we can compute it as (len_t + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for len_t even:\n\nlen_t = 6 → (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. (6 + 1 +1) // 2 = 8//2 =4. Yes.\n\nFor len_t=5: (5+1)/2=3 → ceil is 3. (5+1 +1)//2 = 7//2=3.5 floored to 3. So that works.\n\nYes, so the minimal len_s is (len_t + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, (len_t +1) / 2 rounded up can be calculated as (len_t +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example, len_t=5:\n\n(len_t +1) is 6. Divided by 2 is 3. So ceil( (len_t +1)/2 ) is 3. Which is (len_t +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nNo. (5+1 +1) is 7. 7//2 is 3. So yes. For len_t=6, (6+1) is 7. Divided by 2 is 3.5, ceil is 4. (6+1 +1) is 8, divided by 2 is 4. So yes.\n\nSo the minimal len_s is (len_t + 2) // 2.\n\nSo the code can generate len_s in the range from (len_t + 2) // 2 to len_t -1, inclusive.\n\nSo for each len_s in that range:\n\n   k = 2 * len_s - len_t\n\n   start = len_s -k\n\n   candidate_s = t[start : start + len_s]\n\n   check if t[0 : len_s -k ] == candidate_s[0 : len_s -k ]\n\n   if yes, then return YES and candidate_s.\n\nOnce any such len_s is found, return the answer.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t.\n\nlen_t = len(t)\n\nif len_t < 2: print NO (since for len_t=1, can't have two messages merged with overlap. Also, for len_t=2, possible len_s is (2+2)//2 = 2, but len_s must be up to len_t-1 =1. So no possible len_s. So output NO.)\n\nElse:\n\nfor len_s in range( (len_t + 2) // 2, len_t ):\n\n   compute k = 2 * len_s - len_t\n\n   start = len_s -k\n\n   # check if start is within the string?\n\n   # since len_s is up to len_t -1, and k is 2*len_s - len_t.\n\n   # start = len_s - (2*len_s - len_t) = len_t - len_s.\n\n   # So start = len_t - len_s.\n\n   # since len_s >= (len_t + 2)//2, len_t - len_s is <= len_t - ((len_t +2)//2 )\n\n   # but for len_s in the range, len_t - len_s is between 0 and ... ?\n\n   # For example, len_t = 6, len_s can be 4,5.\n\n   # len_t - len_s = 6-4=2, 6-5=1.\n\n   # So start is len_t - len_s. So for len_s in the range, start is between 1 and len_t - ((len_t +2)//2 )\n\n   # But regardless, the start must be such that start + len_s <= len_t.\n\n   # Because len_s is up to len_t -1, and start is len_t - len_s.\n\n   # So start + len_s = len_t - len_s + len_s = len_t. So the substring t[start:start+len_s] is t[start: len_t], which is valid.\n\n   # So no problem.\n\n   # Now, len_s -k is len_s - (2*len_s - len_t) = len_t - len_s.\n\n   # So the first part of t is t[0 : len_t - len_s ].\n\n   # and candidate_s is t[start : start + len_s ] = t[ len_t - len_s : len_t ].\n\n   # So check if t[0 : len_t - len_s ] equals candidate_s[0 : len_t - len_s ] ?\n\n   # Because len_t - len_s is the length of the first part.\n\n   # So:\n\n   first_part_length = len_t - len_s\n\n   if first_part_length < 0: continue? No, since len_s is in the range (len_t +2)//2 to len_t-1. For len_s up to len_t-1, len_t - len_s is at least 1.\n\n   For example, len_s = len_t -1 → len_t - len_s = 1.\n\n   So first_part_length is len_t - len_s.\n\n   So, check if t[0 : first_part_length ] == candidate_s[ 0 : first_part_length ] ?\n\n   If yes, then return YES and candidate_s.\n\nOnce found, return.\n\nIf none found, output NO.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead t.\n\nlen_t = len(t)\n\nfor len_s in range( (len_t + 2) // 2, len_t ):\n\n    k = 2 * len_s - len_t\n\n    start = len_s - k\n\n    # start is len_t - len_s\n\n    first_part_length = len_t - len_s\n\n    candidate_s = t[ start : start + len_s ]\n\n    if t[:first_part_length] == candidate_s[:first_part_length]:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(candidate_s)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but why is start = len_s -k ?\n\nBecause k = 2*len_s - len_t → start = len_s -k → len_s - (2*len_s - len_t) → len_t - len_s.\n\nYes. So start is len_t - len_s.\n\nSo the code can be optimized by calculating start as len_t - len_s.\n\nBut the code above is correct.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample input 'acacacaca' (len_t=9):\n\nfor len_s in (9+2)//2= (11)//2=5 to len_t-1=8.\n\nSo len_s ranges from 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor len_s=5:\n\nfirst_part_length =9-5=4.\n\nstart = 9-5=4.\n\ncandidate_s = t[4:4+5] → t[4:9] → 'acaca'.\n\nCheck t[:4] is 'acac' and candidate_s[:4] is 'acac' → yes. So output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother example: 'abababab' (len_t=8). len_s ranges from (8+2)//2=5 to 7.\n\nlen_s=5: first_part_length=8-5=3. start=3. candidate_s is t[3:3+5] = t[3:8] → 'ababa'.\n\nCheck t[:3] is 'aba' and candidate_s[:3] is 'aba' → yes. So candidate_s is 'ababa'? Wait, but the sample output is 'ababab' (len 6). Wait, but in the sample input, the output is 'ababab' for input 'abababab' (the fourth example in the sample input). Wait, let me check.\n\nSample input 4 is 'abababab' → output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nWait, len_t is 8. So for len_s=6:\n\nlen_s=6 is in the range 5 to 7.\n\nlen_s=6:\n\nfirst_part_length = 8-6=2.\n\nstart = 8-6=2.\n\ncandidate_s = t[2:2+6] = t[2:8] → 'ababab'.\n\nCheck t[:2] is 'ab' and candidate_s[:2] is 'ab' → yes. So this is valid.\n\nSo the code would find this len_s=6 and return 'ababab'.\n\nSo the code would check len_s=5 first. For len_s=5, the candidate_s would be t[3:8] which is 'ababa' (positions 3-7). The first_part_length is 3. t[:3] is 'aba', and candidate_s[:3] is 'aba' → yes. So this would also be a valid solution. So the code would return the first valid len_s found. But the sample expects 'ababab' as the answer. However, the problem says that any valid answer is acceptable. So in this case, the code may return either 'ababa' or 'ababab' depending on the order in which len_s is checked.\n\nBut in the code, the loop is from len_s starting at (len_t +2)//2 (which is 5) up to len_t-1 (7). So for len_s=5, it would be checked first. So why does the sample output have 'ababab'?\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input is 'abababab' (len 8), and the code would find len_s=5, which gives candidate_s 'ababa' (len 5). But then the merged string would be t = (s[0: len_s -k ]) + s. Let's check what k is for len_s=5:\n\nk=2*5 -8 = 2. So len_s -k =5-2=3. So the first part of t is 3 characters. Then the candidate_s is s. The merged string would be s[0:3] + s. So s is 'ababa', and s[0:3] is 'aba', then the merged string is 'aba' + 'ababa' → 'abaababa' (length 3+5=8). But the original t is 'abababab' (which is 'abababab').\n\nSo comparing 'abaababa' with 'abababab' → not the same. So there's a mistake here. Wait, this suggests that the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, why? Because the code checks if the first_part_length (3) of t is equal to the first_part_length (3) of candidate_s. But in this case, the first_part_length is 3. The candidate_s is t[3:3+5] = t[3:8] = 'ababa' (positions 3-7: 'ababa').\n\nt[:3] is 'aba' (positions 0-2). candidate_s[:3] is 'aba' (positions 0-2 of 'ababa') → yes. But then, the code would think that this is valid, but the actual merged string would be the first_part_length (3) of t plus the candidate_s (5 letters) → total 3+5=8 letters. Which is the length of t. But how does that compare to the original t?\n\nThe merged string should be s[0: len_s -k ] + s. Which is s[0:3] + s. Which is 'aba' + 'ababa' → 'abaababa' which is 'abaababa' (positions 0-7). But the original t is 'abababab' (positions 0-7: a b a b a b a b). So the code would think that this is valid, but in reality, the merged string would not match the original t.\n\nThis indicates that there's a mistake in the logic. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh no! The code checks whether the first_part of t (the first len_s -k characters) equals the first len_s -k characters of the candidate_s. But the candidate_s is supposed to be s. However, the merged string is s[0 : len_s -k ] + s. So the entire t must be equal to that. But the code is checking that the first_part of t equals the first_part of s. But the rest of the t must be equal to s.\n\nBut the code is taking the candidate_s as the part of t that is supposed to be s. So the entire t must be the first_part (which is s[0 : len_s -k ]) plus s. So the entire t must be equal to s[0 : len_s -k ] + s. But since the candidate_s is s, then the entire t must be equal to candidate_s[0 : len_s -k ] + candidate_s. So the code checks if the first_part of t (which is the first len_s -k characters of t) equals the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second message, with the overlap being a positive number of characters less than the length of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Overlap**: The key insight is that the length of the original message `s` must be such that the merged string `t` can be split into two parts where the first part overlaps with the second part.\n2. **Range of Possible Lengths**: For a valid overlap, the length of `s` (denoted as `len_s`) must be in the range from `(len(t) + 2) // 2` to `len(t) - 1`. This ensures that the overlap is positive and less than the length of `s`.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each possible length of `s`, check if the string `t` can be split into two parts such that the overlapping part matches both the end of the first part and the start of the second part.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nlen_t = len(t)\n\n# Iterate over possible lengths of s\nfor len_s in range((len_t + 2) // 2, len_t):\n    first_part_length = len_t - len_s\n    start = len_t - len_s\n    candidate_s = t[start:start + len_s]\n    if t[:first_part_length] == candidate_s[:first_part_length]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(candidate_s)\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Range Calculation**: The possible lengths of `s` are calculated based on the derived formula to ensure valid overlap conditions.\n3. **Overlap Check**: For each possible length of `s`, we check if the string `t` can be split such that the first part of `t` matches the corresponding part of the candidate `s`. If a valid candidate is found, it is printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed after all possibilities are exhausted.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all potential valid lengths for `s` and ensures that the overlap conditions are met, providing the correct solution within the constraints.",
