Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about counting the number of valid Morse code substrings after each append operation. Let me break down what needs to be done.\n\nSo, the main idea is that each time we add a 0 or 1 to the string S, we need to check all possible substrings that end at the current position and see if they correspond to a valid English letter. Then, accumulate the count of all such valid substrings across all steps.\n\nFirst, I need to understand which Morse code strings are valid. The problem says that there are 30 possible Morse code strings of lengths 1-4 (since 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30), but four of them are invalid. The invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". Wait, but these are in terms of 0s and 1s. So any substring of S that matches one of these four is not a valid letter, and others are valid as long as their length is between 1 and 4.\n\nSo, for each new character added to S, we need to look back up to 4 characters (since the maximum length is 4) and check if any of those substrings (ending at the current position) are valid.\n\nBut how do we efficiently compute the total number of valid substrings after each step?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's say after each step, we track the number of valid substrings. But since each new character can form new substrings, perhaps we can keep track of the valid substrings ending at each position.\n\nFor example, when adding the i-th character, we can check for all possible lengths 1 to 4 (but not longer than i). For each possible length l (from 1 to 4), we take the substring ending at i with length l. If that substring is valid (i.e., not in the forbidden list and length between 1-4), then we add 1 to the total count. However, we also need to consider that this substring could be part of longer sequences. Wait, no. Because the problem counts all non-empty sequences of letters. Each valid substring represents exactly one letter. So each valid substring contributes exactly 1 to the total count. For example, if the string is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\". But each of these substrings that are valid contributes 1. However, the same Morse code can be used multiple times. For example, \"1\" can be part of different substrings. So the total count is the number of valid substrings.\n\nWait, the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So each valid substring (i.e., each substring that is a valid Morse code for a letter) contributes exactly one to the count. For example, if the substring is \"1\", which is valid, then it's one sequence. If there are two occurrences of \"1\" in S, then each counts as a separate sequence. So the answer is the total number of valid substrings in S after each operation.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, after each step, count the number of substrings of S that are valid Morse code letters.\n\nNow, the key is to find, for each step, how many valid substrings exist in the current S.\n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently for each step. Since m is up to 3000, and for each step, checking up to 4 possible substrings (since any substring longer than 4 is invalid), the total time would be O(m * 4) = O(12000), which is acceptable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Maintain the current string S as it's built step by step.\n- For each step, after appending the new character, check all possible substrings that end at the current position and have length 1 to 4 (but not longer than the current length of S).\n- For each such substring, check if it's in the forbidden list. If not, increment the count.\n- Accumulate this count over all steps.\n\nBut wait, for each step, the total count is the sum of all valid substrings in the entire string up to that point. However, if we process each step incrementally, we can compute the new valid substrings added by the current step and add them to the previous total.\n\nWait, but how? Because when you add a new character, the new substrings that end at this position are the ones that can be formed by taking the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters. All other substrings are already accounted for in previous steps. So, for example, if the previous total was T, and adding the new character adds k new valid substrings, then the new total is T + k.\n\nYes! Because each time we add a new character, the only new substrings that can be formed are those that end at this new position. All previous substrings were already considered in earlier steps. Therefore, we can maintain a running total, and for each step, compute how many new valid substrings are added due to the new character.\n\nThat's efficient. Because for each step, we only need to check up to 4 possibilities.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each step:\n\n   append the new character to S\n\n   for l in 1 to 4:\n\n      if the current length of S is >= l:\n\n          substring = last l characters of S\n\n          if substring is not in forbidden list:\n\n              total += 1\n\n   output total mod 1e9+7\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for example, when the new character is added, the substrings of length l=1, 2, 3, 4 ending at the current position. But for l=1, it's the last character. For l=2, it's the last two, etc. So for each of these, check if they are valid, and add to the total.\n\nYes. Because each of these substrings is a new substring that ends at the current position and wasn't present before. So adding them to the total gives the correct count.\n\nBut why is that? Because for example, when the string is \"11\", the first step adds \"1\" (count 1). The second step adds \"1\" (count increases by 1) and \"11\" (if valid). So total is 1 + 1 + 1 (if \"11\" is valid). But in reality, the total number of valid substrings is 2 (from the first \"1\") plus 2 (from the second \"1\" and \"11\"), but wait, no. The total number of valid substrings is the sum of all valid substrings in the entire string. For \"11\", the substrings are \"1\" (first), \"1\" (second), \"11\". So if all are valid, the count is 3. So the initial approach of adding for each step the number of new valid substrings that end at the current position would work. Because for step 1, it's 1. For step 2, it's 1 (the new single \"1\") and 1 (the \"11\") → total is 1 + 2 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the approach is correct.\n\nSo the key is to check, for each new character added, the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters (if possible), check if they are valid, and add to the total.\n\nNow, the forbidden list is given as four strings. Let's create a set containing these forbidden strings.\n\nForbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\nBut note that the strings are of lengths 4. So for substrings of length 1, 2, 3, they are allowed unless they are in forbidden. Wait, but forbidden strings are only of length 4. So for example, for substrings of length 1, 2, 3, they are automatically allowed, except if they are in forbidden. But the forbidden list has only 4-length strings. So for substrings of length less than 4, they are always allowed?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that each Morse code representation is of length 1-4. So all strings of length 1-4, except the four forbidden ones, are valid. So for example, a substring of length 3 is allowed, unless it's one of the forbidden strings. But the forbidden strings are of length 4. So for substrings of length 1, 2, 3, they are all allowed, since they are not in the forbidden list. Only substrings of length 4 need to be checked against forbidden.\n\nWait, no. The forbidden list contains four strings of length 4. So any substring of length 1, 2, 3 is automatically valid. Only substrings of length 4 need to be checked for being in forbidden.\n\nSo that's an important optimization. For example, when checking a substring of length 1, 2, or 3, we can immediately count it as valid. Only when the length is 4, we need to check if it's in the forbidden list.\n\nThis reduces the checks. So for each new character, when considering l=1, 2, 3, 4:\n\n- if l is 1, 2, 3: add 1 to total (since they are valid)\n- if l is 4: check if the substring is in forbidden. If not, add 1.\n\nSo that's a big optimization. So for each step, when we add a new character, we check for l=1, 2, 3, 4:\n\nBut for l=1: the substring is the last character. So it's valid. So add 1.\n\nFor l=2: the last two characters. Valid. Add 1.\n\nSimilarly for l=3: add 1.\n\nFor l=4: check if the substring is in forbidden. If not, add 1.\n\nBut only if the current length of S is >= l.\n\nSo for example, when the current length is 3, we can't check for l=4. So for each step, the code would be:\n\ncurrent_length = len(S)\n\nfor l in 1..4:\n\n   if current_length >= l:\n\n       if l < 4:\n\n           add 1\n\n       else:\n\n           substring = last 4 chars\n\n           if substring not in forbidden:\n\n               add 1\n\nSo this way, we can compute the number of new valid substrings added in this step.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows.\n\nFirst, predefine the forbidden set.\n\nThen, for each step:\n\n   append the new character to S.\n\n   current_length = len(S)\n\n   for l in 1 to 4:\n\n       if current_length >= l:\n\n           if l < 4:\n\n               total += 1\n\n           else:\n\n               substring = S[-4:]\n\n               if substring not in forbidden:\n\n                   total += 1\n\n   output total mod MOD\n\nWait, but for l=4, we need to check if the substring is in forbidden. For example, if the substring is \"0011\", then it's forbidden and not counted. Otherwise, it's counted.\n\nBut in the code, when l is 4, the substring is the last 4 characters. So for each step where the length is >=4, we check the last 4 characters.\n\nBut this approach would work.\n\nLet's test the first example from the problem.\n\nSample input 1: 3 steps, all '1's. So S becomes \"1\", then \"11\", then \"111\".\n\nAfter first step:\n\ncurrent_length = 1. Check l=1: yes, add 1. l=2: no. l=3: no. l=4: no. So total is 1 → output 1.\n\nSecond step: S is \"11\". current_length is 2.\n\nCheck l=1: add 1. l=2: add 1. l=3: no. l=4: no. So total increases by 2 → total is 1+2=3. Output 3.\n\nThird step: S is \"111\". current_length is 3. Check l=1: add 1. l=2: add 1. l=3: add 1. l=4: no. So total increases by 3 → total is 3 + 3 = 6. But according to the sample output, the answer is 7. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the sample input is 3 steps, and the output is 1, 3, 7. Wait, according to the sample explanation, after three steps, the answer is 7. But according to the above approach, after third step, the total would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Which is conflicting. So there's a mistake here. What's wrong?\n\nAh, because the approach above assumes that for l=1,2,3, the substrings are valid. But that's not correct. Because the problem says that the forbidden strings are only four strings of length 4. So any substring of length 1-3 is valid. So in the first example, the three steps would contribute:\n\nStep 1: 1 → total 1.\n\nStep 2: add 2 (l=1 and l=2) → total 3.\n\nStep 3: add 3 (l=1, l=2, l=3) → total 3 + 3 = 6. But the sample output says after third step it's 7. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, the sample output for the first input is ['1\\n3\\n7']. So after third step, the answer is 7. According to our calculation, it's 6. So clearly, there's a mistake in our reasoning.\n\nHmm. Let's re-examine the sample.\n\nIn the first sample, S is \"111\".\n\nThe valid substrings are:\n\nAll substrings of length 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut how many substrings are there?\n\nFor a string of length 3, the number of substrings is:\n\nLength 1: 3 (positions 1, 2, 3).\n\nLength 2: 2 (positions 1-2, 2-3).\n\nLength 3: 1 (positions 1-3).\n\nTotal 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 substrings. But according to the sample explanation, there are 7 valid sequences. Wait, but the sample explanation says that after three steps, the answer is 7. How?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nThe valid substrings are:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\" (111), \"TT\" (11), \"TM\" (111), \"MT\" (111), \"TTT\" (111). That's 7 entries. But according to the count of substrings, there are 6 substrings. How does this happen?\n\nAh, because each substring is considered as a separate entry. But in the sample explanation, the substrings are:\n\nFor \"111\", the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (position 1)\n\n- \"1\" (position 2)\n\n- \"1\" (position 3)\n\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2)\n\n- \"11\" (positions 2-3)\n\n- \"111\" (positions 1-3)\n\nSo that's 6 substrings. But the sample explanation lists 7 sequences. How?\n\nWait, looking at the sample explanation:\n\nThe sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\") → the first \"1\"\n\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\") → the first \"11\"\n\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\") → the entire string.\n\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\") → the two \"1\"s in positions 1 and 2, forming \"11\".\n\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\") → first \"1\" (T) and second \"11\" (M) → but that's a sequence of two letters. However, the problem says that the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. Wait, this is a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So each such sequence corresponds to a substring of S. But each substring is a single letter. Or is it that a sequence of letters is represented as a concatenation of Morse codes. For example, the sequence \"TT\" would be represented as \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\". So the substring \"11\" can represent either a single letter M (which is \"11\") or two letters T and T (each \"1\"). So how does the problem count this?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nSo for example, the substring \"11\" can represent either the letter M (as a single letter) or two Ts (as two letters). Therefore, each occurrence of a valid Morse code substring contributes as many sequences as the number of ways to split it into valid Morse code letters. But this seems to complicate the problem.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer for \"111\" is 7. Which includes both the single letters and the combinations.\n\nWait, this indicates that my initial understanding of the problem was incorrect. Oh no! This changes everything.\n\nSo the original approach of counting the number of valid substrings (each being a single letter) is wrong. Instead, the problem requires counting all possible sequences of letters whose concatenation forms a substring of S. So each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nFor example, the substring \"11\" can be split into \"1\" + \"1\" (two letters) or as \"11\" (one letter). So for the substring \"11\", there are two possible sequences. Thus, the total count is the sum over all substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut this makes the problem much more complex. How can this be handled?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nSo for example, the substring \"11\" can represent either one letter (M) or two letters (T and T). So each of these sequences must be counted. Hence, the total count is the sum over all substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut this is a completely different problem. Now, the problem is similar to counting the number of ways to parse a string into valid words, where each word is a valid Morse code.\n\nSo for example, the string \"111\" can be parsed in several ways:\n\n- \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" → 3 letters.\n\n- \"1\" + \"11\" → 2 letters.\n\n- \"11\" + \"1\" → 2 letters.\n\n- \"111\" → 1 letter.\n\nTotal of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 ways? Wait, but the sample explanation says that after \"111\", there are 7 sequences. Let me check the sample explanation again.\n\nSample explanation says:\n\nThe sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\") → 1 way.\n\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\") → 1 way.\n\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\") → 1 way.\n\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\") → 1 way.\n\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\") → 1 way.\n\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\") → 1 way.\n\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") → 1 way.\n\nTotal of 7 sequences. So each of these sequences corresponds to a different way of splitting a substring into Morse code letters.\n\nBut how does this relate to the substrings?\n\nLet me think:\n\nEach of these sequences corresponds to a particular way of splitting a substring. For example:\n\n- \"T\" is a single letter, which corresponds to the substring \"1\".\n\n- \"TT\" is two letters, which corresponds to the substring \"11\".\n\n- \"TM\" is two letters, which corresponds to the substring \"111\" (split into \"1\" + \"11\").\n\n- \"MT\" is two letters, which corresponds to the substring \"111\" (split into \"11\" + \"1\").\n\n- \"TTT\" is three letters, which corresponds to the substring \"111\" (split into \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\").\n\n- \"M\" is one letter, corresponding to the substring \"11\".\n\n- \"O\" is one letter, corresponding to the substring \"111\".\n\nSo the total number of sequences is:\n\nFor each substring, the number of ways to split it into valid Morse code letters. Summing over all substrings.\n\nSo the problem is now to compute, after each modification to S, the total number of such ways.\n\nThis is a completely different problem than initially thought. So the initial approach was wrong. Now, the problem is similar to the classic \"number of ways to parse a string into words\" problem, but applied to all substrings of S.\n\nThis is a significant change. So how to approach this?\n\nThe problem requires, after each step, to compute the total number of ways to parse any substring of S into sequences of valid Morse code letters.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nLet's denote dp[i] as the number of ways to parse the first i characters of S into valid Morse code sequences. Then, the total number of ways for all substrings would be the sum over all possible j and k (j <= k) of the number of ways to parse S[j..k] into valid sequences.\n\nBut calculating this for every substring after each step would be computationally expensive if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i in the string, we can track the number of ways to parse substrings ending at i. Let me think about dynamic programming approaches.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each position i (after adding the i-th character), we can compute for all possible j ≤ i, the number of ways to parse the substring S[j..i]. However, this would be O(n^2) time per step, which for m=3000 would be O(9 million) operations, which may be feasible.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, we can track the number of ways to parse substrings ending at i. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to parse the substring ending at position i. Then, for each i, we can look back 1 to 4 positions (since the Morse code is of length 1-4), and check if the substring S[j..i] is valid. If so, we add dp[j-1] to dp[i]. Here, dp[0] = 1 (base case for empty string).\n\nWait, this is similar to the classic problem of counting the number of ways to parse a string into words. For example, the problem where you have a string and a dictionary of valid words, and you want to count the number of ways to split the string into words.\n\nIn this case, the dictionary is the set of all valid Morse code strings (excluding the four forbidden ones). And for each position i in the string, the number of ways to parse the first i characters is the sum of dp[i - l] for each l in 1..4 where the substring ending at i of length l is valid.\n\nBut this would give us the total number of ways to parse the entire string up to i. However, the problem requires the total number of ways to parse all substrings. So, for example, for the entire string S of length n, the total number of ways is the sum for all k from 1 to n of the number of ways to parse the first k characters, but this isn't exactly right. Because the total number of ways to parse all substrings would be the sum over all possible substrings S[a..b], of the number of ways to parse S[a..b].\n\nSo how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think again. Let's suppose we have a dynamic programming array dp, where dp[i] represents the number of ways to parse the first i characters of S. Then, the total number of ways to parse all substrings would be the sum over all i from 1 to m (where m is the current length of S) of dp[i], but this is not correct. Because dp[i] counts the number of ways to parse the entire first i characters. However, the problem wants the number of ways to parse all possible substrings, not just the entire string.\n\nFor example, consider S = \"11\". The substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"11\". The ways to parse them are:\n\n- \"1\": 1 way.\n\n- \"1\": 1 way.\n\n- \"11\": 2 ways (as one letter or two letters).\n\nSo the total is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. However, using the dp approach for the entire string:\n\ndp[1] = 1 (ways to parse first 1 characters).\n\ndp[2] = dp[1] (if the substring of length 1 is valid) + dp[0] (if the substring of length 2 is valid). Since both are valid, dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2. So the sum of dp[1] + dp[2] is 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than the required 4. Hence, this approach doesn't directly give the desired total.\n\nTherefore, the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For each new character added to S, we need to consider all possible substrings that end at this new position, and for each such substring, compute the number of ways to parse it. Then, sum all these numbers across all substrings.\n\nFor example, after adding the i-th character, we look at all substrings ending at i (of lengths 1 to 4). For each such substring, we compute the number of ways to parse it, and add it to the total.\n\nBut how to compute the number of ways to parse a substring S[j..i]?\n\nLet's think recursively. For a substring S[j..i], the number of ways is equal to the sum of:\n\n- 1 (if the entire substring is a valid Morse code letter), plus\n\n- for each possible split into a valid letter followed by a valid parsing of the remaining substring.\n\nBut this seems like it would require dynamic programming for each substring. However, if we precompute for each position i, the number of ways to parse substrings ending at i, we can build upon previous results.\n\nLet's define for each position i, an array ways[i], which is the number of ways to parse the substring ending at i. For example, ways[i] would be the sum of ways[j-1] for all j such that the substring from j to i is a valid Morse code letter. Additionally, if the substring from i to i is valid, we add 1.\n\nWait, this is similar to the standard DP approach for the number of ways to parse the entire string. But here, we are interested in the sum of all ways to parse all substrings. So for each new character added, we can calculate the number of ways to parse substrings ending at this new position and add them to the total.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet’s define dp[i] as the number of ways to parse the substring ending at position i. For example, dp[i] is the number of ways to parse the substring S[1..i], but that's not quite right. Alternatively, for each position i, dp[i] represents the number of ways to parse the substring that ends at i. But to compute this, we need to look back 1 to 4 steps and check if the substring from i-l+1 to i is valid. If it is, then we can add dp[i-l] to dp[i].\n\nWait, here's the standard approach for the number of ways to parse the entire string. For the entire string up to position i, the number of ways is the sum for l in 1..4 of (if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then dp[i-l]).\n\nBut in this case, dp[i] represents the number of ways to parse the entire first i characters. However, we need to find the number of ways to parse all substrings. So, for example, for each position i, and for each possible length l (up to 4), the substring from i-l+1 to i can be parsed in some number of ways. The total is the sum of all these numbers for all possible substrings.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of maintaining a total variable. Initially, total = 0.\n\nWhen adding a new character (say, at position i), for each possible l (1-4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways to parse this substring is equal to the number of ways to parse the prefix before this substring, plus 1 (if the entire substring is valid). Wait, no. For example, the substring of length l ending at i can be parsed in dp[i-l] ways (assuming we have a dp array that tracks the number of ways to parse the first i-l characters) plus 1 if the substring itself is a valid letter.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. For the substring S[k..i], the number of ways to parse it is the sum of:\n\n- 1 if the entire substring is a valid Morse code letter.\n\nPlus, for each possible split into a valid letter of length l (1-4) followed by a valid parsing of the remaining part.\n\nBut this seems recursive. So, for example, the number of ways to parse S[k..i] is the sum over l=1 to 4 (if the substring S[k..i-l+1] is valid) multiplied by the number of ways to parse S[k + l ... i].\n\nBut this seems too slow to compute for every possible substring.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's use dynamic programming to compute for each position i, the number of ways to parse all substrings ending at i. Let’s call this value f[i]. Then, the total number of valid sequences is the sum of f[1] + f[2] + ... + f[i], where i is the current length of S.\n\nSo, how to compute f[i]?\n\nFor f[i], it is the number of ways to parse substrings that end at position i. These substrings can be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each possible length l (1-4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways to parse this substring is equal to the number of ways to parse the substring before it (i.e., the number of ways to parse the substring ending at position i - l, plus 1 if the entire substring is valid).\n\nWait, no. For example, if the substring is of length l, then the number of ways to parse it is equal to the number of ways to parse the part before it (if any) plus 1 for the case where the entire substring is taken as a single letter. Or wait, no. The number of ways to parse the substring of length l ending at i is equal to the sum of:\n\n- 1 (if the entire substring is a valid letter)\n\n- plus the number of ways to parse the first part (of length l') and the remaining part (of length l - l').\n\nBut this seems like the same as the standard problem of counting the number of ways to parse the entire string, but for each possible substring.\n\nAlternatively, for f[i], the number of ways to parse substrings ending at i is:\n\nFor each possible l (1-4):\n\n   if the substring S[i-l+1..i] is valid, then:\n\n       if l == 1, then add 1 (as a single letter)\n\n       else, add f[i-l] (the number of ways to parse the substrings ending at i-l, and then add this current letter as a new part?)\n\nNo, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think of f[i] as the number of ways to parse the substring ending at position i. For example, f[i] is the total number of ways to parse all substrings that end at i. So for each possible start position j (from 1 to i), the number of ways to parse S[j..i], summed over all j.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me consider that for each i, f[i] is the sum of ways to parse all substrings ending at i. To compute this, for each possible l (length of the substring ending at i), which can be 1-4:\n\nIf the substring of length l is valid, then the number of ways to parse this substring is equal to the number of ways to parse the prefix before it plus 1 (the case where the entire substring is taken as one letter). Wait, no. Because the substring is S[i-l+1..i]. If we take this as one letter, that's one way. Additionally, if there are ways to split this substring into parts, like taking a letter of length l' and then parsing the rest.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, the number of ways to parse substrings ending at i is equal to the sum over l=1 to 4 (if the substring of length l ending at i is valid) of (1 + the number of ways to parse the substring of length l-1, etc. ? No.\n\nAlternatively, think of the standard DP approach for the number of ways to parse the entire string. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to parse the first i characters of S. Then, dp[i] = sum_{l=1}^4 (if the substring S[i-l+1..i] is valid, then dp[i-l]).\n\nWith dp[0] = 1 (base case).\n\nNow, the number of ways to parse the entire string up to i is dp[i]. However, the total number of ways to parse all substrings is not directly dp[i], but we need to find for all possible j ≤ i, the number of ways to parse S[j..i].\n\nBut how can we express this in terms of dp?\n\nLet me think of another DP array, say, g[i], which represents the number of ways to parse all substrings ending at position i. Then, for each i, g[i] is the sum over all possible l (1-4) of the number of ways to parse the substring of length l ending at i.\n\nTo compute this, for each l, if the substring of length l ending at i is valid, then the number of ways to parse it is equal to the number of ways to parse the prefix before the substring plus 1. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nThe number of ways to parse the substring S[i-l+1..i] is equal to the number of ways to parse this substring as a sequence of letters. This is similar to the dp[i] for the entire string, but for this particular substring. However, this seems difficult to compute directly.\n\nBut if we use the standard DP approach for the entire string, then for any substring S[a..b], the number of ways to parse it is equal to dp[b] - dp[a-1], but this is not correct. Wait, no. Because dp[b] is the number of ways to parse the first b characters. But the number of ways to parse S[a..b] depends on how the first a-1 characters are parsed. It's not directly related.\n\nAnother approach: For each position i, we can calculate the number of ways to parse all substrings ending at i. Let's call this value ways[i]. Then, ways[i] = sum_{l=1}^4 (if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then (ways[i-l] + 1)) ?\n\nWait, for example, if the substring of length l is valid, then the number of ways to parse it is 1 (as a single letter) plus the number of ways to parse the previous part (if any). No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake i=2, and l=2. The substring is S[1..2]. If this is valid, then the number of ways to parse this substring is 1 (as one letter) plus the number of ways to parse the substring S[1..1] (if we split it into first 1 character and then the next 1). But this seems to be the same as the standard DP approach.\n\nActually, the number of ways to parse S[1..i] is dp[i], which equals the sum of ways to parse S[1..i-l] * 1 (for each valid l). Similarly, the number of ways to parse S[j..i] would be equal to the number of ways to parse S[j..i] as a standalone string, which can be computed with a similar DP.\n\nBut this would require, for each possible j, to compute this DP, which is not feasible for large m.\n\nAlternative idea: For each new character added to S, we can maintain the standard dp array, which tracks the number of ways to parse the first i characters. Then, the total number of ways for all substrings is the sum over all j from 1 to i of dp[i] - dp[j-1] ? No, this doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of ways for all substrings is the sum for each position i of dp[i], where dp[i] is the number of ways to parse the first i characters. But this counts the number of ways to parse the entire string",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to the string `S`. A valid Morse code substring is one that corresponds to a valid English letter, which means it must be a string of length 1 to 4 composed of '0's and '1's, excluding four specific invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to parse the first `i` characters of the string `S` into valid Morse code sequences.\n2. **Forbidden Set**: Maintain a set of forbidden Morse code strings to quickly check validity.\n3. **Efficient Updates**: For each new character added to the string `S`, update the DP array by checking all possible valid substrings ending at the current position.
