The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the sum of 2^i is maximized by keeping as many high-numbered districts as possible. Because 2^i increases exponentially with i. So, the optimal strategy would be to keep the districts with the highest possible numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected component.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure connectivity? Because even if we want to keep the largest districts, they might not be connected. So maybe we need to find a way to select a connected subtree that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nBut since the tree is connected, perhaps the approach is to start from the largest district (n) and then include as many higher-numbered districts as possible, making sure that the selected districts form a connected subtree.\n\nAlternatively, think about it this way: Since each district's value is 2^i, which is exponentially larger than lower ones, we want to keep the largest possible districts. So, the best way is to keep the districts with numbers from (n - m + 1) to n, where m is the number of districts we need to keep (n - k). But only if those districts form a connected subtree. If not, we have to include some lower-numbered districts to connect them.\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nWait, the tree structure is arbitrary. So maybe the optimal solution is to keep all the districts except the k smallest ones, but ensuring that they form a connected component. However, that's not necessarily true. For example, if the largest districts are not connected, we need to include some smaller ones to connect them.\n\nBut given that the tree is connected, perhaps the way to maximize the sum is to keep the largest (n -k) districts, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. How can we do that?\n\nAn approach could be:\n\nWe need to select a subset of (n -k) districts that are connected, and include as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nSo the idea is to find the minimal set of districts to remove (k of them) such that the remaining districts are connected and include the highest possible districts.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe districts with higher numbers have higher values. So we want to keep as many of them as possible. So, perhaps we can start by considering that we want to keep all districts except the k smallest ones, but check if they form a connected component. If they do, then that's our answer. If not, we need to remove some other districts.\n\nBut how to check if the largest (n -k) districts form a connected component?\n\nBut considering that the tree is connected, the largest (n -k) districts may not be connected. For example, imagine a tree where district n is connected to district n-1, which is connected to district n-2, etc. But if we have to remove k districts, maybe the largest (n-k) districts form a chain. However, if the tree is structured such that some of the larger districts are disconnected, then we need to include some lower ones to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which districts to remove?\n\nAlternative approach: think of the problem as selecting a subtree with (n -k) nodes that has the maximum possible sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and the sum is maximized when the nodes with the highest numbers are included.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree with (n -k) nodes that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the way to do this is to greedily select the largest nodes, and then include the necessary smaller nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAn efficient way could be to perform a priority-based selection. Let me think: the districts with higher numbers are more valuable. So, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to select a connected subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, and for that, we can use a priority queue approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. We can think of the tree as a graph, and we want to select a connected subgraph of (n -k) nodes with maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes, and higher nodes are better, we can think of this as trying to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and then connect them.\n\nAnother idea: the optimal solution must include the node with the highest number (n), because otherwise, if we exclude it, we could include it instead of some lower-numbered node, which would increase the sum. So the optimal solution must include node n. Then, the next step is to include the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts have exponentially more fans, so we should prioritize keeping them while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, which means there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since the number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure the remaining districts form a connected component.
