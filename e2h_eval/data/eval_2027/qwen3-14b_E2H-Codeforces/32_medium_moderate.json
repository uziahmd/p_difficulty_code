    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is defined as the max minus min of the array. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that when we take the remaining elements, their max and min difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to check for each element, what happens if we remove it. Then calculate the instability for each case and pick the minimum. But with n up to 1e5, doing this naively would be O(n^2), which would be way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find that the optimal element to remove is either the maximum or the minimum, or something like that. But not necessarily. For example, in the first sample input, removing the max (7) gives a better result. But maybe there are cases where removing a middle element would help more.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the min and max when we remove one element? Let's think: the original array's min and max are known. If we remove an element that's not the min or max, then the min and max of the new array would still be the same as the original. However, if we remove the original min, then the new min is the second smallest element. Similarly for the original max.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to consider the cases where removing the min, or the max, or some other element. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's sort the array. Suppose the array is sorted. Then, for each element, when we remove it, the new array's min and max would be determined by the elements around it. For example, if the array is sorted, then the original min is a[0], original max is a[-1]. If I remove a[0], then the new min is a[1], and the max remains a[-1]. If I remove a[-1], the new max is a[-2], and the min remains a[0]. But if I remove an element in the middle, say a[i], then the min and max of the new array would be the same as the original min and max (since the min is a[0] and max is a[-1], unless the element removed is the only occurrence of min or max).\n\nWait, but if the array is sorted, then the min is the first element and the max is the last. So if I remove any element except the first or last, the min and max would still be the same as before. Therefore, the instability would be a[-1] - a[0], which is the same as the original instability. But if I remove the first element, then the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If I remove the last element, the instability is a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). But wait, that's only if the array is sorted. So, maybe the answer is to sort the array, and then check for each possible removal of the first or last element, but also considering other possibilities?\n\nWait, no. Because in the original array, maybe there are multiple instances of the min or max. For example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 3], then removing one of the 1s would leave the min as 1, and the max as 3. So the instability is 2. Similarly, removing one of the 3s would leave the instability as 2. But if you remove the first element (1), then the new array is [1, 3, 3], which has min 1 and max 3. Same as before. So in this case, the instability is same as original. But if the original array was [1, 3, 3, 7], then removing the 7 (the last element) gives instability 3-1=2. Which is better than the original instability of 6. But if the array is [1, 3, 4, 7], then removing the 7 gives instability 4-1=3. Removing the 1 gives 7-3=4. So the best is to remove 7. But if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], then removing the first element gives 3-2=1, removing the last gives 3-1=2. So the best is to remove the first element.\n\nSo in the sorted array, the optimal choice is to remove either the first element or the last element. Because when you remove any other element, the instability remains the same as the original. So, the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If I remove 2, the instability is 5-1=4. Same as before. So the only way to get a better instability is to remove the first or last element.\n\nSo, according to this, the minimal instability after removing exactly one element is the minimum between (max of original array minus the second min) and (second max minus the min of original array). So, the approach would be:\n\nSort the array. Then, the answer is min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) )\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements with the same value? Like in the sample input where the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. After sorting, it's [1, 3, 3, 7]. So, the options are:\n\nIf we remove the first element (1), the new array is [3, 3, 7]. Max is 7, min is 3. Instability is 4. If we remove the last element (7), the array is [1,3,3]. Max is 3, min is 1. Instability is 2. Which is better. So the answer is 2. Which is the min between (a[-1] - a[1] = 7-3=4) and (a[-2] - a[0] = 3-1=2). So the correct answer is 2.\n\nAnother example: [1, 100000]. When sorted, it's [1, 100000]. The options are to remove the first element (instability is 0) or the second (instability is 0). So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the approach seems to work for those examples.\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3]. Original instability is 2. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 3-2=1. If we remove the last element (3), instability is 2-1=1. So the answer is 1. Which is min between (3 - 2 = 1) and (2 - 1 = 1). So that works.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If we remove 1, the instability is 6-3=3. If we remove 6, instability is 5-1=4. So the answer is 3. Which is min between (6-3=3) and (5-1=4). So yes.\n\nSo the approach would be to sort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). But why is that sufficient?\n\nBecause, when you remove any element that's not the first or last in the sorted array, the instability remains the same as the original. So, the only possible ways to reduce the instability is to remove the first or the last element. So the minimal instability is the minimum between the two possibilities.\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If we remove the 4, the array becomes [1,2,5], instability is 4. If we remove 2, the array is [1,4,5], instability is 4. So the only way to reduce is to remove 1 or 5. So the answer is min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) which is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is to sort the array, then check the two possibilities: removing the first element (so the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]) or removing the last element (new instability is a[-2] - a[0]). The minimum between these two is the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. Let's say we remove 3. Then the array is [1,4,5,7]. The instability is 7-1=6. Which is worse than if we remove the first element (instability is 7-4=3) or the last element (instability is 5-1=4). So the answer would be 3. So the approach works here.\n\nBut what about if there are multiple elements that are not the first or last, but their removal would lead to a lower instability? For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. If we remove 3, the array becomes [1,2,4,5,6]. The instability is 6-1=5. Which is same as the original instability (5). So no improvement. So the only way to improve is to remove the first or last element.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the two options:\n\nOption 1: Remove the first element. New instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nOption 2: Remove the last element. New instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nThe answer is the minimum between these two.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has duplicates in the first or last positions?\n\nLike, for example, [1, 1, 2, 2]. The original instability is 1. If we remove the first element (1), the array is [1, 2, 2], instability is 1. If we remove the last element (2), the array is [1,1,2], instability is 1. So the answer is 1. Which is min between (a[-1] - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1) and (a[-2] - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0). Wait, wait! Wait, the array is [1,1,2,2]. When sorted, a[-2] is 2, a[0] is 1. So a[-2] - a[0] is 2-1=1. Wait, but if we remove the last element (2), then the array is [1,1,2], which has max 2 and min 1. So instability is 1. But according to the calculation, a[-2] is 2 (since the original array is [1,1,2,2], a[-2] is 2, and a[0] is 1. So the option 2 is 2-1=1. Which matches. So the answer is min(2-1=1, 2-1=1) which is 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]. Then, the original instability is 2. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 3 - 2 = 1. If we remove the last element (3), the instability is 2 - 1 = 1. So the answer is 1. Which is min between (a[-1] - a[1] = 3 - 2 = 1) and (a[-2] - a[0] = 2 - 1 = 1). So correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The original instability is 5. If we remove the first element, the instability is 6-2=4. If we remove the last element, the instability is 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to sort the array, and then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array has n=2 elements? For example, the second sample input is [1, 100000]. Then, after sorting, a[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - 1 = 99999. But a[-2] - a[0] is 1 - 1 = 0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct. So that works.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n, read the array.\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n is 2, then the answer is 0 (since removing one element leaves one element, which has instability 0).\n\nWait, but according to the code, for n=2, the code would compute a[-1] - a[1] (which is a[1] - a[1] = 0) and a[-2] - a[0] (a[0] - a[0] = 0). So min(0, 0) is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code can handle that.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\noption2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nresult is min(option1, option2)\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3?\n\nFor example, n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. If we remove 1, the instability is 3-2=1. If we remove 3, instability is 2-1=1. If we remove 2, instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 1, which is min(3-2=1, 2-1=1). So correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. Then, after sorting, option1 is a[-1] - a[1] = 1-1=0. option2 is a[-2] - a[0] = 1-1=0. So answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list, convert to integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code would have a[-1] - a[1] as a[1] - a[1] = 0, and a[-2] - a[0] is a[0] - a[0] = 0. So even if n=2, the code can be handled by the same formula. So the code can be written without checking for n=2. Because when n=2, a[-1] is the second element, a[1] is the same. So the code can be written as:\n\nsort the array, compute min between a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], so a[-2] - a[0] is 0. So the code works.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nWait, but let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input: 4 elements [1,3,3,7]. After sorting, [1,3,3,7]. a[-1] - a[1] is 7 - 3 =4. a[-2] - a[0] is 3 - 1 = 2. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 2 elements [1, 100000]. sorted is [1, 100000]. a[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - 100000 =0. a[-2] -a[0] is 1 -1 =0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1,2,3]. min between 3-2=1 and 2-1=1. So 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: [1,3,3,7]. Correct.\n\nWhat about if the array is [5, 5, 5, 5]. Then the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The options are 5-2=3 and 4-1=3. So answer is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code seems to handle all cases. But wait, what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The code returns min(6-2=4, 5-1=4). So 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut why didn't we consider other possibilities, like removing elements in the middle?\n\nBecause when you remove elements in the middle, the instability remains the same as the original. So the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], removing 2 gives [1,3,4], instability is 3. Which is same as original instability (4-1=3). So the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut in this case, the code's options are (4-2=2) and (3-1=2). So the code returns 2, which is better than the original instability. Which is correct because when you remove the first element (1), the array becomes [2,3,4], instability is 2. Or remove the last element (4), array becomes [1,2,3], instability is 2. So the code returns 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is as simple as that. So the Python code would be:\n\nRead n, read the list, sort, compute min between a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] - a[0].\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me check the sample inputs again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted [1,3,3,7]. a[-1]-a[1] =7-3=4. a[-2]-a[0] =3-1=2 → min is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]. a[-1]-a[1] is 100000 - 100000 =0. a[-2] -a[0] is 1-1=0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 100]. sorted [1,1,100]. options are 100 -1 =99 and 1-1=0. So answer is 0. Which is correct. Because removing the last element (100) gives [1,1], instability 0. So the code returns 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1, 1, 2, 100]. sorted [1,1,2,100]. options: 100 -1=99, 2-1=1. So answer is 1. Which is correct. Because removing the 100 gives [1,1,2], instability 1. Which is better than removing the first element (1) which gives [1,2,100], instability 99.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum values. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is determined by the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. By removing one element, we aim to reduce this difference as much as possible.\n2. **Sorting Insight**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the potential minimum and maximum values after removing one element. When the array is sorted, the minimum value is at the start and the maximum value is at the end.\n3. **Key Observations**:\n   - Removing the first element of the sorted array reduces the instability to the difference between the last element and the second element.\n   - Removing the last element of the sorted array reduces the instability to the difference between the second-to-last element and the first element.\n4. **Optimal Calculation**: The minimum possible instability after removing one element is the minimum value between the two scenarios mentioned above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers.\n2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Calculating Minimum Instability**:\n   - After sorting, the instability when removing the first element is calculated as the difference between the last element and the second element (`a[-1] - a[1]`).\n   - Similarly, the instability when removing the last element is calculated as the difference between the second-to-last element and the first element (`a[-2] - a[0]`).\n4. **Result**: The minimum of these two calculated instabilities gives the desired result, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the potential candidates for removal to the first or last element in the sorted array, ensuring we find the minimum possible instability in linear time after sorting.",
