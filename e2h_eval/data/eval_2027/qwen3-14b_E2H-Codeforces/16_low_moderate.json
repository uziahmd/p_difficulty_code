Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the blocks are structured. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that moving between blocks requires crossing a road, but only if the blocks share a boundary segment. So, two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road, and their common boundary is a line segment (not just a point). \n\nBut how do we model the blocks? Since there are n roads, each block can be represented by a set of signs for each road. Because each road divides the plane into two halves. For example, for a road ax + by + c = 0, any point (x,y) will be on one side or the other. So, for each road, the block's position relative to that road can be determined by the sign of ax + by + c. \n\nSo, the idea is that each block can be uniquely identified by the signs of the expressions for each road. However, since there are n roads, the number of possible combinations is 2^n, which could be up to 2^300, which is way too big. But wait, that's impossible. Wait, but in reality, the actual number of regions created by n lines is O(n²), but for n=300, that would be 90,000 regions. However, with 300 roads, 2^300 is way too big. So, how can we model this?\n\nBut perhaps we don't need to model all the regions. Instead, we can model the problem as a graph where each node represents a region (block), and edges exist between regions that are adjacent (i.e., share a common boundary). Then, we need to find the shortest path from the home's region to the university's region.\n\nBut the problem is how to represent the regions and compute adjacency between them. How can we do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think: For each region, the sign of each road's equation determines which side of the road the region is on. So, for a given point (home or university), we can compute for each road whether it's positive or negative. Then, the home is in a region that has those signs. Similarly for the university.\n\nBut how do we find the adjacent regions? Well, two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if you cross a single road, you flip the sign of that road. But wait, that's only if the regions are separated by that road. So, if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are adjacent. But how can we confirm that?\n\nYes, because if two regions differ in exactly one road, then they are separated by that road. And since the road is a line, the regions on either side of it are adjacent. Therefore, moving between them requires one step. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to modeling each region as a binary string (or a vector of bits) indicating the sign for each road. Then, two regions are connected if their binary strings differ in exactly one bit. \n\nBut how do we model this? Because the number of possible regions is 2^n, which is way too large for n=300. So, we can't generate all possible regions. However, we can model this as a graph where each node is the sign configuration of the home's region and the university's region, and then find the minimal number of steps (flips) to get from one to the other, but considering that each flip corresponds to moving across a road. However, that's not correct because the actual adjacency depends on the roads. Because, for example, flipping a single bit (changing the sign of one road) would mean that the region is adjacent to another region. But in reality, the regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road. So, the problem becomes similar to a BFS where each node is a state (the sign configuration), and edges connect states differing in exactly one bit. \n\nBut the problem is that the number of possible states is 2^300, which is impossible to handle directly. So, this approach is not feasible. \n\nWait, but the home and university are two specific points. So, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the parity of the number of roads that separate the home and the university. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region, and edges are between regions that are adjacent. However, since we can't represent all regions, we need another approach.\n\nWait, here's an alternative idea: the minimal number of steps required to move from the home's region to the university's region is equal to the number of roads",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common boundary of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Regions**: Each road divides the plane into two regions. A point's position relative to a road can be determined by evaluating the sign of the road's equation at that point.\n2. **Sign Configuration**: For each road, determine whether the home and university points lie on the positive or negative side of the road. This gives us a binary representation (sign configuration) for both points.\n3. **Graph Representation**: Treat each region as a node in a graph where edges exist between regions that are separated by exactly one road. Moving between such regions is allowed in one step.\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to find the shortest path from the home's region to the university's region. The BFS will explore all possible sign configurations reachable by flipping one road's sign at a time, ensuring we find the shortest path.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Function to compute the sign for a point (x,y) with respect to the road (a, b, c)\n    def get_sign(x, y, a, b, c):\n        return a * x + b * y + c\n\n    # Compute the sign configuration for home and university\n    home_signs = []\n    univ_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        sign_home = get_sign(x1, y1, a, b, c)\n        sign_univ = get_sign(x2, y2, a, b, c)\n        home_signs.append(1 if sign_home > 0 else -1)\n        univ_signs.append(1 if sign_univ > 0 else -1)\n\n    # Now, model the problem as a BFS where each state is a tuple of signs\n    # But since n can be up to 300, we can't store all possible states.\n    # However, we can note that the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors,\n    # but only if they differ in exactly those roads.
