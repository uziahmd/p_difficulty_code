Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent each block? Since there are n roads, each block can be represented by the set of roads that separate it from the origin or something? Wait, maybe not. Another approach: think of each block as being determined by the sign of each road's equation. Because each road divides the plane into two halves. For a given point not on any road, each road will have the point on one side or the other. So, for each road, we can determine whether the home point is on the positive or negative side of the line. Similarly for the university. \n\nBut how does that help? Well, if two blocks are adjacent, they must differ in exactly one road's sign. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing a single road. So, the adjacency between blocks is determined by flipping the sign of exactly one road. \n\nWait, but the problem says that movement is allowed only if the common border has a non-zero length. Which implies that two blocks are adjacent if they share a common segment of a road. So, the adjacency would be when their regions are separated by exactly one road. \n\nSo, the key idea here is to model each block as a binary vector of signs. Each road contributes a +1 or -1 depending on which side of the line the block is on. Then, two blocks are adjacent if their vectors differ in exactly one position. \n\nBut how do we represent the home and university's blocks? Well, for the home point, we can compute for each road whether it's positive or negative. Similarly for the university. Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of steps needed to transform the home's sign vector into the university's sign vector, changing one bit at a time. However, each step corresponds to flipping a single bit. But wait, no. Because each step represents crossing a road, which changes the sign of exactly one road. So the minimum number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors. Because each differing bit represents a road where the two blocks differ. But wait, that's not correct. Because the Hamming distance is the number of differing bits. But the minimal steps would be the number of differing bits. Because you can flip each differing bit one by one. \n\nWait, but that would imply that the answer is the Hamming distance between the two vectors. However, this seems too simple. Let me check with the example.\n\nLooking at the first example input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0, and 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. \n\nFor home (1,1): \n\nFor the first road (y=0): 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1 >0 → sign is positive. \n\nSecond road (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1>0 → positive. So home's vector is [1, 1].\n\nUniversity is (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is -1. Second road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign -1. So university's vector is [-1, -1]. \n\nThe Hamming distance between [1,1] and [-1,-1] is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nAnother sample input is the second example. Let's see:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor home:\n\nx=0: 1 is positive. y=0: 1 is positive. x+y-3: 1+1-3 = -1 <0. So home's signs are [1,1,-1].\n\nUniversity: (-1,-1). \n\nx=0: -1 is negative. y=0: -1 is negative. x+y-3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. So university's signs are [-1,-1,-1]. \n\nThe Hamming distance is 2 (the first two bits differ). So the answer is 2, which matches the sample. \n\nSo this suggests that the answer is indeed the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which flips one bit in the sign vector",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves crossing a road, which changes the region (block) we are in. The key insight is that each block can be represented by a binary vector based on the signs of the equations defining the roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sign Vector Representation**: For each road, determine whether the home and university points lie on the positive or negative side of the road. This results in two binary vectors for the home and university positions.\n2. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between these two binary vectors. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding values are different.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read the roads\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute sign vectors for home and university\n    home_signs = []\n    univ_signs = []\n    \n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        sign_home = 1 if val_home > 0 else -1\n        home_signs.append(sign_home)\n        \n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        sign_univ = 1 if val_univ > 0 else -1\n        univ_signs.append(sign_univ)\n    \n    # Calculate Hamming distance\n    distance = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            distance += 1\n    \n    print(distance)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of the home and university positions, and the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Vectors**: For each road, we calculate whether the home and university positions lie on the positive or negative side of the road. This results in two lists of signs for the home and university positions.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The Hamming distance between the two sign vectors is computed, which directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block. Each differing sign indicates a road that must be crossed, hence contributing to the step count.",
