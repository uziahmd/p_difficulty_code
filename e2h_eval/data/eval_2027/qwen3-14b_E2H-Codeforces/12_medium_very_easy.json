The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks in certain houses arranged in a ringroad. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. \n\nSo the problem says that each task i requires her to be in house ai, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). Oh right, and moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Also, the houses are arranged in a circle, clockwise. So moving from house n to 1 would take 1 step, right?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's consider the initial position is house 1. Then for each task in order, we need to compute how much time it takes to get from her current position to the required house for the next task. But since the tasks have to be done in order, and each subsequent task depends on previous ones, we need to process them sequentially.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between two consecutive houses? For example, if she's currently at position curr and the next task is at pos, then the time taken is the minimal steps between curr and pos, considering the ringroad.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement is only clockwise. So the movement from curr to pos can't be counter-clockwise. So the time between curr and pos is (pos - curr) mod n? Wait, no. Let's think. Suppose curr is 3 and pos is 2. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going through 4, then 1, then 2. That's (n - curr + pos) steps? Let me see for n=4: 3 to 2: steps are 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Which is (4 - 3 + 2) = 3? Wait 4-3 is 1, plus 2 is 3. Yes. So in general, the steps needed when moving clockwise from curr to pos is (pos - curr) if pos >= curr, else (pos - curr + n). Or equivalently, (pos - curr) % n? Wait, no. Because if pos is less than curr, then (pos - curr) is negative. Let me take an example: curr is 3, pos is 2. (2-3) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the number of steps is (pos - curr) if pos >= curr, else (pos - curr + n). Which can be written as (pos - curr) % n if we're working with positive numbers. Wait, but (pos - curr) could be negative. Let me check: for curr=3, pos=2, (2-3) is -1. Adding n (4) gives 3. Which is correct. So the formula is (pos - curr) if pos >= curr else (pos - curr + n). Alternatively, (pos - curr + n) % n. Because if pos >= curr, then (pos - curr) is positive, adding n and mod n would give the same value. For example, pos=3, curr=2, n=4. (3-2) is 1. Adding 4 gives 5, mod 4 is 1. Which is correct. So yes, the steps between curr and pos is (pos - curr) if pos >= curr, else (pos - curr + n). Which can be calculated as (pos - curr + n) % n. But wait, if pos is equal to curr, then the steps are zero. So that's handled correctly.\n\nSo the idea is: for each task in the sequence, we need to compute the steps from the current position to the next position, and accumulate that. But the tasks are given in a list a1, a2,... am. However, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the time between them is zero. So we need to process each task in order, keeping track of the current position.\n\nLet me think about the example given. First input is 4 3, and the tasks are 3, 2, 3. Let's walk through that.\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. So steps from 1 to 3. Since 3 >=1, steps are 2. Time is 2. Current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. So steps from 3 to 2. Since 2 <3, steps are (2-3 +4) = 3. Time accumulates 2+3=5. Current position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Steps from 2 to 3: 1 step. Total time 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example input is 4 3 with tasks 2,3,3. Let's see:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps from 1 to 2 is 1. Time is 1. Current position is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps from 2 to 3 is 1. Time total 2. Current position is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps is 0. Total time remains 2. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate through the list of tasks, and for each task, compute the steps from the current position to the task's position, add that to the total, and update the current position.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each ai in the list of tasks:\n\n   if current_pos == ai: continue (no time added)\n\n   else:\n\n      compute steps as (ai - current_pos) if ai >= current_pos else (ai - current_pos + n)\n\n      add steps to total_time\n\n      set current_pos = ai\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, reading input from stdin. The input is two lines. First line has n and m, second line has m integers.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's example:\n\nThe first example input is given as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']? Or maybe that's the way the user presented it. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as two lines. So for example, the first input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich is read as n=4, m=3, and the list is [3,2,3].\n\nSo in code, the input is read as:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and m.\n\nThen read the second line, split into m integers.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the second line has exactly m elements.\n\nOnce that is done, process the list a.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop over each element in a:\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    if current_pos == ai:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        steps = (ai - current_pos) if ai >= current_pos else (ai - current_pos + n)\n\n        total_time += steps\n\n        current_pos = ai\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nWait, but what about when the ai is 1 and current_pos is n? For example, n=4, current_pos is 4, ai is 1. Then steps would be (1-4 +4) = 1. Which is correct: moving from 4 to 1 is one step.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos = 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3. current_pos is 1. steps is 3-1=2. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2. current_pos is 3. ai < current_pos. steps = 2-3 +4 = 3. total becomes 5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3. steps is 3-2=1. total is 6. current_pos is 3. So output is 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 4 3, a=[2,3,3].\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2. steps 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: steps 1. total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: no steps. total remains 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if the tasks are in the same house? For example, n=5, m=2, a=[1,1]. Then the total time is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Then:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: steps 1. total 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 1: steps (1-2 +2) = 1. total is 2. So output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n and m, then the list a.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each ai in a:\n\n   if current_pos == ai: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      compute steps as (ai - current_pos) if ai >= current_pos else (ai - current_pos + n)\n\n      add steps to total_time\n\n      current_pos = ai\n\nThen print total_time.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input. But in Python, sometimes when reading from stdin, there may be issues with leading or trailing spaces, but the code should handle it.\n\nBut for the problem's input, the second line is m integers. So the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to ensure that len(a) is m. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    if current_pos == ai:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        if ai >= current_pos:\n\n            steps = ai - current_pos\n\n        else:\n\n            steps = ai - current_pos + n\n\n        total_time += steps\n\n        current_pos = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nYes.\n\nThat should work.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1.\n\nai=3: steps 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nai=2: steps 2-3 +4 = 3. total 5. current is 2.\n\nai=3: steps 1. total 6. Output is 6.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\ncurrent_pos = 1.\n\nai=2: steps 1. total 1. current 2.\n\nai=3: steps 1. total 2. current 3.\n\nai=3: no steps. total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. As discussed, output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a=[1, 5, 1]. \n\ncurrent starts at 1. first ai is 1: no steps. Then ai=5: steps 5-1=4. total is 4. current is 5. Then ai=1: steps 1-5 +5 = 1. total is 5. So output 5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, write the Python code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she starts at house number 1 and must move clockwise around a ringroad. Each task must be completed in a specific house, and she can only proceed to the next task after completing all previous ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house number 1 with a total time of 0.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house for the task.\n3. **Clockwise Movement Calculation**: If the target house is ahead (clockwise) of the current house, the movement time is simply the difference between the target and current house numbers. If the target house is behind (counter-clockwise), wrap around the ringroad by adding the total number of houses to the difference.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Keep a running total of the time taken for each movement and update the current position after each task.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n    if current_pos == ai:\n        continue\n    if ai >= current_pos:\n        steps = ai - current_pos\n    else:\n        steps = ai - current_pos + n\n    total_time += steps\n    current_pos = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, check if the current position is already the target house. If not, compute the steps needed to move clockwise to the target house.\n- **Clockwise Steps Calculation**: The steps are calculated based on whether the target house is ahead or behind the current position. If it's ahead, the steps are straightforward. If it's behind, we wrap around using the total number of houses `n`.\n- **Update Total Time**: Accumulate the steps taken for each movement and update the current position to the target house after each task.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by considering the circular nature of the ringroad and processing each task sequentially. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of tasks, making it efficient even for large inputs.",
