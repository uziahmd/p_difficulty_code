The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task must be done in a specific house, and she can only do the i-th task after all tasks before it (with numbers less than i) are done. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nHmm, the input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks). Then the list of a_i's. The initial position is house 1.\n\nSo, the main thing is to calculate the total time she moves from one house to another, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks have to be done in order, and each task's position is given as a_i, we need to process them sequentially.\n\nLet me think about how movement works. Since the ringroad is clockwise, moving from house x to house y takes (y - x) mod n steps if y is ahead, but if y is behind, then it's (n - x + y) steps. Wait, no. Let's think: moving clockwise, the distance between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - x + y). So for example, if x is 3 and y is 2 in a 4-house setup, moving clockwise would require 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. Which is (4-3 + 2) = 3. So the formula is (y - x) if y >=x else (n - x + y). Alternatively, it can be written as (y - x + n) % n. Because if y is larger than x, then (y -x) mod n is same as y -x. If y is smaller, then adding n and mod gives the correct value.\n\nBut wait, the movement time between two consecutive tasks depends on the current position and the target. So for each task, starting from the previous position, we need to compute the steps required to reach the current task's house.\n\nBut the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if the tasks are [2, 2, 2], then she just stays there. So, the time between those tasks is zero.\n\nSo the approach is: track the current position, and for each task in order, compute the distance from current position to a_i, add that to the total time, then update current position to a_i.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let's take the first example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise. Steps: 2 (1→2→3). So time += 2. Now current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. So moving from 3 to 2. Since clockwise, that's 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. So time +=3. Now current position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Moving from 2 to 3: 1 step. Time +=1. Total is 2+3+1=6, which matches the example.\n\nYes. So the key is to process each task in order, and for each, compute the distance from the previous position to the current a_i, then add that to the total.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   compute distance between current_pos and a_i (clockwise)\n\n   add that distance to total_time\n\n   set current_pos to a_i.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current_pos and a_i?\n\nAs I thought earlier, the formula is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos else (n - current_pos + a_i). Alternatively, (a_i - current_pos) % n, but wait, because if a_i is less than current_pos, then (a_i - current_pos) is negative. For example, if current_pos is 3 and a_i is 2, then (2-3) = -1, mod 4 would be 3, which is correct. So (a_i - current_pos + n) % n gives the correct distance. Wait, let's check:\n\ncurrent_pos is 3, a_i is 2. (2-3 +4) = 3 → mod 4 is 3. Correct.\n\ncurrent_pos is 1, a_i is 3: (3-1) = 2 mod 4 is 2. Correct.\n\nYes. So the formula for the distance between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, what if the difference is negative? For example, current_pos is 3, a_i is 2. Then (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, (a_i - current_pos) % n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each step, the distance is (a_i - current_pos) % n. Then add that to the total.\n\nWait, but let's test with the first example:\n\nFirst step: current_pos is 1, a_i is 3. (3-1) mod 4 is 2 → correct.\n\nSecond step: current_pos is 3, a_i is 2. (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3 → correct.\n\nThird step: current_pos is 2, a_i is 3. (3-2) mod 4 is 1 → correct. So total is 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the second input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance is (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: distance is 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nYes. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through the list of a_i's, compute the distance between current position and a_i, add to total, update current position.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe need to read n and m, then the list of m integers.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m, the second line is m integers.\n\nIn Python, we can read the first line with input().split(), then the second line.\n\nBut for cases where the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but split() handles that.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about when the a_i is same as current_pos. Then the distance is zero, so nothing added. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this seems straightforward.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. So initial position is 1. Distance is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1, a=[2]. Distance is (2-1) mod 2 = 1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: m=0? But according to input constraints, m is at least 1. Wait, the problem says m is given as 1<=m<=1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nAnother edge case: when the tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a=[3,3,3]. Then the total time is 0.\n\nAnother case: when moving around the ring multiple times.\n\nLike, n=5, m=2, a=[5, 1]. So first move from 1 to 5: (5-1) mod 5 is 4. Then from 5 to 1: (1-5) mod 5 = ( -4 ) mod 5 = 1. So total is 4+1=5. Which is correct: moving 1→2→3→4→5 (4 steps), then 5→1 (1 step).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator for negative numbers returns a positive result. For example, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So the calculation (a - current_pos) % n will give the correct steps.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of a's.\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor a in list:\n\n    total += (a - current_pos) % n\n\n    current_pos = a\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's check the first example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the a's are [3,2,3].\n\nFirst step: 3-1=2 mod 4 is 2. total is 2.\n\ncurrent_pos is 3.\n\nSecond step: 2-3 = -1 mod 4 is 3. total is 5.\n\ncurrent_pos is 2.\n\nThird step: 3-2=1 mod 4 is 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 4 3, a's [2,3,3]. So steps:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 2: (2-1) mod 4 = 1 → total 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond a is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1 → total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird a is 3: 0 → total remains 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and m, the second line contains m integers.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples. But the user provided two examples as input and output. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and m. The second line contains m integers. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. However, the user probably provided two examples for illustration. But in the actual programming problem, the code is supposed to process one input.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin once.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nRead the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute as per the algorithm.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the first line: n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen the second line: a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen process.\n\nBut need to make sure that the list has exactly m elements. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nWhich the code produces.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nWhich the code produces.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[2]. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. Output is 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n",
