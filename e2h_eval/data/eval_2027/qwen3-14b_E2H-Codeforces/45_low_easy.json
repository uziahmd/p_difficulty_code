There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nLet me think about some examples first. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays the second game, the other player (player 3) has zero games played. The difference is 1 (since the winner has 1 game already). So that's allowed. So the answer is 2. For n=4, the example says the answer is 2. Why can't the winner play 3 games? Let's see. If the winner plays three games, that would require three opponents. But each time, the opponents must have a game count differing by at most one. Let's think: the first game, the winner plays someone (say, player 2). Then, the next game, they have to play someone who has either 0 or 1 games. Suppose they play player 3. Now, the winner has two games. Then, for the third game, the opponent must have either 1 or 2 games. But the remaining players are player 4 and maybe others. Wait, but in a knockout tournament, each game eliminates one player. So with four players, the total number of games is three. But the winner can't play three games because the structure might not allow it. \n\nWait, the example for n=4 says the answer is 2. So how does that work? The note says that the winner can't play against player 4 after playing two games. Because the other players would have 0 games. So maybe the structure is that the winner plays two games, but the other players are arranged in a way that they can't have more than one game. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of games the winner can play, given that the tournament is structured in a way that allows that. \n\nHmm. How to model this? Let's think recursively. Let's say the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How can we find f(n)?\n\nLet me think about the structure. For the winner to play as many games as possible, each time they play, they need to have opponents that meet the condition. \n\nEach time the winner plays a game, they must have an opponent who has either the same number of games as them, or one less. So, for example, if the winner has played k games, their next opponent must have played either k-1 or k games. But since the opponent must have won all their previous games, that implies that the opponent has a path of wins leading up to that point.\n\nThis feels similar to building a binary tree. Because in a normal knockout tournament, each game is between two players, and the winner proceeds. But here, the structure is constrained. For the winner to play as many games as possible, perhaps the tournament is structured such that the winner's path is as long as possible, but each time the opponent is chosen such that their number of previous games is within one.\n\nLet me think of the maximum number of games. For example, the winner's first game is against someone. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. But if the winner is to play as many games as possible, perhaps each time they play against someone who has played one less game. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a Fibonacci-like sequence. Let's think: to have a winner play k games, how many players are needed?\n\nFor example:\n\n- To have a winner play 1 game: needs 2 players. (k=1, n=2)\n- To have a winner play 2 games: they need to have two opponents. The first opponent is one game (so 2 players), then the second opponent must have played 1 game (so another 2 players?), but maybe not. Wait, perhaps the number of players required for the winner to play k games is the sum of the players required for the previous steps.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's suppose that to have the winner play k games, the number of players required is f(k). How is this related to f(k-1) and f(k-2)?\n\nBecause, for the winner to play the k-th game, they must have an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. But since the opponent must have won all their previous games, the number of players needed for that opponent's path would be f(k-1) or something else. \n\nWait, let's take the example",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given the constraint that two players can only compete if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight here is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. The idea is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play by considering the minimum number of players required for each possible number of games. \n\n1. **Base Cases**: \n   - If there are 2 players, the winner can play exactly 1 game.\n   - If there are 3 players, the winner can play 2 games.\n   \n2. **Recursive Relation**:\n   - For a winner to play `k` games, they must have an opponent who has played either `k-1` or `k-2` games. This leads to a recursive structure where the number of players needed for `k` games is the sum of the players needed for `k-1` and `k-2` games.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - Given the constraints (up to $10^{18}$ players), we use a loop to iteratively compute the minimum number of players required for increasing numbers of games until we exceed the given number of players `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # We need to find the maximum k such that f(k) <= n\n    # where f(k) is the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play k games\n    # f(1) = 2, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 5, f(4) = 8, etc. (similar to Fibonacci)\n    \n    a, b = 2, 3  # f(1) = 2, f(2) = 3\n    k = 1\n    if n < 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    while True:\n        if b > n:\n            print(k)\n            return\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Base Cases**: The initial values for the minimum number of players required for 1 and 2 games are set to 2 and 3 respectively.\n- **Iterative Calculation**: Using a loop, we iteratively calculate the minimum number of players required for increasing numbers of games using a Fibonacci-like sequence. This continues until the calculated number of players exceeds the given `n`.\n- **Result**: The maximum number of games `k` for which the minimum number of players required does not exceed `n` is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large input constraints by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
