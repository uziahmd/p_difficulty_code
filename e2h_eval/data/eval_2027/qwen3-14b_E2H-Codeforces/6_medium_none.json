Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers where one's duration is a, the other's is b, such that a + b = x. Also, they must not overlap. And find the minimum sum of their costs.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this efficiently?\n\nConstraints are n up to 2e5. So O(n^2) is impossible. Need something smarter.\n\nLet me think. For each voucher, we can check if there's another voucher that starts after this one ends, or ends before this one starts. But how to find the ones that have the required duration?\n\nWait, the durations need to add up to x. So for each voucher with duration d, we need another voucher with duration (x - d). So for each voucher, if there exists another voucher with duration (x - d), and they don't overlap, then we can consider their sum.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the minimal cost for such pairs?\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each possible duration, store the list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time (or start time?), and also keep track of the minimal cost for each duration.\n\nWait, but for each voucher with duration d, we need to find vouchers with duration (x - d) that either end before the current voucher starts, or start after the current voucher ends.\n\nSo for example, if I have a voucher A with duration d, and I want to find vouchers B with duration (x -d) that end before A's start. Then, for those B's, the earliest possible end time would be better, but perhaps we need the minimal cost.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration k, we can precompute the minimal cost of vouchers that end at or before a certain day, and similarly for starting after a certain day.\n\nLet me think. Let's say for each possible duration k, we have a list of vouchers with that duration. For each such list, we can sort them by their end time. Then, for a given voucher A with duration d, and looking for vouchers with duration (x-d), which end before A's li. Then, among those vouchers, we can take the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers that start after A's ri. So for each voucher, we can check both possibilities: one where the other voucher is before it, and one where it's after.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, we can have two sorted lists: one sorted by end time (ri), and another sorted by start time (li). Or maybe for each duration, we can have a list sorted by end time, and for each position in the list, we can have the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nWait, for example, for duration k, we have a list of vouchers sorted by their end time. Then, for a given query (find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration k that end before a certain day), we can perform a binary search on the list to find all vouchers with end time <= that day, and then take the minimum cost among them. To do this efficiently, we can pre-process for each duration k, a sorted list of (end_time, min_cost_so_far). So when we sort the vouchers for duration k by end time, we can create a prefix min array. Then, for any query of \"what's the minimal cost for vouchers with duration k that end before day t\", we can binary search the end times to find the latest end time <= t, and then take the corresponding prefix min.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers that start after a certain day. For that, we can have the same sorted list, but sorted by start time. Then, for a given start time s, find all vouchers with start time >= s, and take the minimal cost.\n\nBut maybe for the second case (vouchers that start after the end of the first voucher), we can have the list sorted by start time, and for each such list, have a suffix min array. So for example, if the list is sorted by start time, then for a given s, we can find the first voucher with start time >= s, and then take the minimum cost from that position onwards.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each duration k, we create two structures:\n\na) A sorted list of vouchers (by end time) along with a prefix min array. This helps when looking for vouchers that end before a certain day.\n\nb) A sorted list of vouchers (by start time) along with a suffix min array. This helps when looking for vouchers that start after a certain day.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher, we can check if there's a voucher of duration (x - d) that ends before the current voucher's start, or starts after the current voucher's end. For each of these cases, we can query the corresponding structure for the minimal cost.\n\nSo here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, where the key is the duration, and the value is a tuple of two lists:\n\n   For each duration k:\n\n   - list1: sorted by end time (ri), and a prefix min array (so that for any index, the min cost up to that index is known)\n\n   - list2: sorted by start time (li), and a suffix min array (so that for any index, the min cost from that index to the end is known)\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i with duration d_i, we check if x - d_i is a valid duration (i.e., exists in the dictionary). If yes, then:\n\n   Let target_duration = x - d_i.\n\n   Now, for this target_duration, we need to find vouchers that either:\n\n   a) end before li of voucher i (so that they don't overlap). For this, we look into the list1 of target_duration, find all vouchers with end_time <= li - 1 (since ri < lj, so voucher j's end is <= li-1). Then take the min cost of those.\n\n   b) start after ri of voucher i. So, we look into list2 of target_duration, find all vouchers with start_time >= ri + 1 (since rj >= li + 1, so voucher j starts after voucher i ends). Take the min cost of those.\n\n   For each of these two possibilities, if found, we can compute the sum of the current voucher's cost and the found min cost, and keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nWe need to do this for every voucher, and for each voucher, check both possibilities (a and b). Then, the overall minimum is our answer.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping vouchers? Because the two vouchers must not overlap. So for case a, the voucher j ends before voucher i starts. For case b, voucher j starts after voucher i ends. So these are the two non-overlapping possibilities.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement the prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nLet's take for example, for list1 (sorted by end time):\n\nWe sort the vouchers in increasing order of end time. Then, for each position in the list, we compute the minimum cost from the beginning up to that position. So for a given end time t, we can binary search in the list to find the largest end time <= t. Then, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimal cost for vouchers with duration k that end before t.\n\nSimilarly, for list2 (sorted by start time), we sort the vouchers in increasing order of start time. Then, for the suffix min array, we compute for each position, the minimum cost from that position to the end. So, for a given start time s, we can binary search the first start time >= s. Then, the suffix min from that index gives the minimal cost for vouchers with duration k that start after s.\n\nNow, the steps to build these structures:\n\nFor each duration k in the dictionary:\n\n   list1: sort all vouchers of duration k by end time (ri), then compute prefix min array.\n\n   list2: sort all vouchers of duration k by start time (li), then compute suffix min array.\n\nBut how to handle duplicates? For example, multiple vouchers with same duration and same start/end times. Well, since we want the minimal cost, even if there are duplicates, the prefix and suffix arrays will take care of that.\n\nNow, for each voucher in the original list, we process it as follows:\n\n   d = duration of voucher i (ri - li + 1)\n\n   target_d = x - d\n\n   if target_d is not present in the dictionary, skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      check for case a: find min cost of vouchers with duration target_d that end before li of voucher i.\n\n      check for case b: find min cost of vouchers with duration target_d that start after ri of voucher i.\n\n      for each of these two cases, if found, add current voucher's cost to the found min cost and compare with the global minimum.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the voucher i and the voucher j are the same? Because the problem says i != j. However, since we are checking for all vouchers, including the same voucher, but when we process voucher i, we are looking for vouchers with duration target_d. So if the target_d is equal to d, then the same voucher may be considered. However, since we need two different vouchers, we have to ensure that when target_d equals d, and the voucher j is the same as voucher i, it's not allowed.\n\nWait, but how? For example, suppose x is 2d. Then, for voucher i, target_d is d. So during processing, when we check for vouchers with duration d that end before li, or start after ri. But if the voucher i itself is part of the list for target_d, then when we check for case a (end before li), since voucher i's end time is ri, which is >= li (since li is the start of the voucher). So voucher i's end time is ri, which is >= li. So in case a, we are looking for vouchers that end before li. So voucher i can't be included here. Similarly, in case b, we are looking for vouchers that start after ri. Voucher i's start time is li, which is <= ri. So voucher i can't be in case b either. Therefore, even if the target_d is same as d, the voucher i is not considered in the case a or case b. Therefore, the code will automatically avoid using the same voucher twice. Because when processing voucher i, the other voucher j must be different. So this is handled automatically.\n\nTherefore, no problem here.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nNow, the steps for code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers. For each voucher, compute its duration (ri - li + 1).\n\nWe need to group vouchers by their duration. So create a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers. Then for each duration, process the lists to create list1 (sorted by end time) and list2 (sorted by start time) with prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nBut how to handle the prefix and suffix min arrays?\n\nFor example, for list1 (sorted by end time):\n\nSort the vouchers in increasing order of ri. Then, for the prefix min array, we can create an array where each element is the minimum cost from the start up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for list2 (sorted by start time), sort by li, then for the suffix min array, each element is the minimum cost from that index to the end.\n\nSo for each duration k in duration_dict:\n\n   vouchers = list of vouchers with duration k.\n\n   sort vouchers by ri, then create a list of their end times (for binary search) and a prefix min array.\n\n   sort vouchers by li, then create a list of their start times (for binary search) and a suffix min array.\n\nBut for each voucher, we need to have the end time and cost, and the start time and cost.\n\nSo for example, for list1:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nthen, for each entry in sorted_by_end, we collect the end time and the cost.\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_end)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len-1:\n\n   prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_by_start list:\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1].cost\n\nfor i from len-2 downto 0:\n\n   suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i].cost)\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher, we can process as follows.\n\nNow, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d = duration\n\n   target_d = x - d\n\n   if target_d not in duration_dict: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      process case a and case b.\n\nCase a: find vouchers with target_d that end before li of current voucher.\n\nSo, for the list1 of target_d (sorted by end time), we need to find the largest end time <= (li - 1). Then, if such a voucher exists, the prefix_min up to that index is the minimum cost.\n\nTo find the largest end time <= li-1, we can perform a binary search on the sorted end times.\n\nSimilarly for case b: find vouchers with target_d that start after (ri of current voucher). So, for the list2 of target_d (sorted by start time), find the first start time >= (ri + 1). Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSo, for case a:\n\nIn the list1 of target_d, which is sorted by end time. Let's get the list of end times. Let's call this end_times.\n\nWe can perform a binary search to find the rightmost end time <= (li - 1). If found, then the prefix_min up to that index is the minimum cost for that case.\n\nSimilarly, for case b:\n\nIn the list2 of target_d, sorted by start time. Let's get the list of start times. Call this start_times. We perform a binary search to find the leftmost start time >= (ri + 1). If found, then the suffix_min from that index is the minimum cost for that case.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement these binary searches.\n\nBut how to implement the binary search for case a and case b.\n\nFor case a: find the maximum end_time <= t (t = li-1). The list is sorted in increasing order. So we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of t+1, then subtract 1.\n\nFor example, in Python, using bisect.bisect_right(end_times, t) gives the insertion point. So the index is insertion_point - 1. If insertion_point is 0, then no such voucher exists.\n\nFor case b: find the first start_time >= t (t = ri + 1). This can be done using bisect_left. The insertion point gives the first element >= t. If insertion_point is equal to the length of the list, then no such element exists. Otherwise, the suffix_min from insertion_point gives the minimum.\n\nOnce we get the min cost for case a and case b, we can compute the sum with the current voucher's cost and update the global minimum.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nEach entry in duration_dict for a duration k will have:\n\n- list1_sorted_end: list of vouchers sorted by end time.\n\n- list1_end_times: list of end times (for binary search).\n\n- list1_prefix_min: list of prefix minima.\n\nSimilarly for list2_sorted_start, list2_start_times, list2_suffix_min.\n\nBut perhaps we can store for each duration k, the following:\n\nsorted_by_end: list of (end_time, cost), sorted by end_time.\n\nprefix_min: list of minima.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start: list of (start_time, cost), sorted by start_time.\n\nsuffix_min: list of minima.\n\nBut perhaps we can just store the end_times and prefix_min, and the start_times and suffix_min.\n\nBut how to get the end_times? Well, for the list sorted by end time, the end times are in order. So for example, for list1_sorted_end, which is sorted by end time, we can extract the end times as [v.ri for v in list1_sorted_end].\n\nBut perhaps during preprocessing, for each duration, we can precompute:\n\nfor list1:\n\nsorted_end_list = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nend_times = [v.ri for v in sorted_end_list]\n\nprefix_min = [ ... ]\n\nSimilarly for list2.\n\nSo, during the code:\n\nfor each duration in duration_dict:\n\n   sorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\n   end_times = [v.ri for v in sorted_end]\n\n   prefix_min = [ ... ]\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nWe can represent each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost). But during preprocessing, for each duration, we can process these vouchers.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = list of tuples (li, ri, cost) for each of the n lines.\n\nThen, create duration_dict, which maps duration to a list of vouchers.\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, precompute the sorted_end and sorted_start lists, along with end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min.\n\nOnce that is done, initialize the answer as infinity.\n\nThen, for each voucher in vouchers:\n\n   li, ri, cost = voucher\n\n   d = ri - li + 1\n\n   target_d = x - d\n\n   if target_d not in duration_dict:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       # process case a: find vouchers with target_d ending before li\n\n       # get the data for target_d\n\n       data_a = duration_dict[target_d].get_sorted_end_info()\n\n       end_times = data_a['end_times']\n\n       prefix_min = data_a['prefix_min']\n\n       t = li - 1\n\n       # find the largest end_time <= t\n\n       idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, t) - 1\n\n       if idx >= 0:\n\n           min_cost_a = prefix_min[idx]\n\n           total = cost + min_cost_a\n\n           if total < answer:\n\n               answer = total\n\n       # process case b: find vouchers with target_d starting after ri\n\n       data_b = duration_dict[target_d].get_sorted_start_info()\n\n       start_times = data_b['start_times']\n\n       suffix_min = data_b['suffix_min']\n\n       t = ri + 1\n\n       idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, t)\n\n       if idx < len(start_times):\n\n           min_cost_b = suffix_min[idx]\n\n           total = cost + min_cost_b\n\n           if total < answer:\n\n               answer = total\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if answer is still infinity, output -1, else output answer.\n\nBut how to structure the duration_dict? Maybe for each duration, we can precompute the sorted_end and sorted_start info, and store them in the duration_dict.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nfor each duration in duration_dict:\n\n   vouchers_in_duration = list of vouchers with this duration.\n\n   sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_in_duration, key=lambda v: v[1])  # since v is (li, ri, cost), ri is v[1]\n\n   end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\n   # compute prefix_min\n\n   prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_end)\n\n   prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n\n   for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n\n       prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n\n   # similarly for sorted_start:\n\n   sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_in_duration, key=lambda v: v[0])\n\n   start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n\n   # compute suffix_min\n\n   suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\n   for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n       suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2])\n\n   # then, store in duration_dict for this duration, the sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_start, start_times, suffix_min.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can store for each duration, a tuple containing:\n\n(end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min).\n\nWait, but for the sorted_end and sorted_start, we need the end_times and start_times, but also the prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nBut actually, for case a, we need the end_times and the prefix_min. For case b, we need the start_times and the suffix_min.\n\nSo, perhaps for each duration, we can store:\n\n- for the end-based search: end_times and prefix_min.\n\n- for the start-based search: start_times and suffix_min.\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration k, we can store:\n\nduration_info[k] = {\n\n    'end_data': (end_times, prefix_min),\n\n    'start_data': (start_times, suffix_min)\n\n}\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nIn Python, perhaps:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nThen:\n\nduration_info = defaultdict(lambda: {'end': None, 'start': None})\n\nBut for each duration, during preprocessing, we compute the end_data and start_data.\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c) )\n\nThen, create a duration_dict, which maps duration to list of vouchers.\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor l, r, c in vouchers:\n\n    d = r - l + 1\n\n    duration_dict[d].append( (l, r, c) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, precompute the end_data and start_data.\n\npreprocessing:\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    # process end_data\n\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # sort by end time (r)\n\n    sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\n    # compute prefix min\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_end)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n\n    # process start_data\n\n    sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n\n    # compute suffix min\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2])\n\n    # store in duration_info\n\n    # perhaps we can create a separate structure, like:\n\n    # for each duration, store (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\n    # but how?\n\n    # perhaps create a dictionary for each duration, storing these four arrays.\n\n    # Let's create a new dictionary, say, preprocessed = {}\n\n    # preprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\n    preprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nWait, but in Python, perhaps we can create a separate dictionary for this.\n\nBut during the code, for each duration d, during preprocessing, we compute these four arrays and store them.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, we process as follows:\n\nInitialize answer = infinity.\n\nfor l, r, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = r - l + 1\n\n    target_d = x - d\n\n    if target_d not in preprocessed:\n\n        continue\n\n    # process case a: find vouchers with target_d that end before l (current voucher's l)\n\n    # get the end_times and prefix_min from preprocessed[target_d]\n\n    end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min = preprocessed[target_d]\n\n    # case a: end before l (voucher's l)\n\n    t = l - 1\n\n    # find the largest end_time <= t\n\n    # use bisect_right on end_times\n\n    import bisect\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, t) - 1\n\n    if idx >= 0:\n\n        current_min = prefix_min[idx]\n\n        total = cost + current_min\n\n        if total < answer:\n\n            answer = total\n\n    # case b: find vouchers with target_d that start after r (voucher's r)\n\n    # get start_times and suffix_min from preprocessed[target_d]\n\n    # start_times is the list of start times (sorted)\n\n    t = r + 1\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, t)\n\n    if idx < len(start_times):\n\n        current_min = suffix_min[idx]\n\n        total = cost + current_min\n\n        if total < answer:\n\n            answer = total\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if answer is still infinity, output -1 else answer.\n\nBut wait, the preprocessed dictionary is built for each duration. So during the preprocessing phase, we need to build for each duration in duration_dict, the four arrays.\n\nBut in the code above, the preprocessed is a dictionary that maps each duration to (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min). So during the preprocessing step, for each duration in duration_dict, we compute these four arrays and store them in preprocessed.\n\nBut in code:\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # process end data\n\n    sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\n    prefix_min = [ ... ]\n\n    # process start data\n\n    sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n\n    suffix_min = [ ... ]\n\n    preprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the target_d is same as d? For example, if x is 2*d. Then, during processing, when looking for target_d = d, and the voucher's own duration is d. But during the case a and case b, the code would check for other vouchers with duration d that end before l or start after r. Which is correct, because the current voucher is not considered in those cases.\n\nBut what if there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and same l and r? Well, the code will find the minimal cost.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4\n\n1 2 5\n\n5 6 1\n\n1 2 4\n\nThe durations:\n\nFirst voucher: 3-1+1=3.\n\nSecond: 2-1+1=2.\n\nThird: 6-5+1=2.\n\nFourth: 2-1+1=2.\n\nSo duration_dict has:\n\n3: [(1,3,4)]\n\n2: [(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)]\n\npreprocessed for duration 2:\n\nsorted_end is sorted by ri. The vouchers for duration 2 are:\n\n(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4). Wait, ri for these are 2, 6, 2. So sorted by ri, the order is (1,2,5) (ri=2), (1,2,4) (ri=2), (5,6,1) (ri=6). So sorted_end would be sorted by ri, which for the first two is same. So sorted_end would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)] ?\n\nWait, when you sort by ri, if two have same ri, their order depends on the other fields. But for the purpose of the end_times, it's same. But for prefix_min, the order may affect the prefix min. However, since we are taking the minimum, the order doesn't matter. For example, if two vouchers have same end time, but different cost, the prefix_min will take the minimum between them.\n\nSo for the sorted_end list, the end_times would be [2, 2, 6].\n\nprefix_min would be:\n\nfirst element is 5.\n\nsecond element is min(5, 4) =4.\n\nthird element is min(4, 1) =1.\n\nSo prefix_min is [5,4,1].\n\nFor the start_data, sorted_start is sorted by li. The vouchers are (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1). Their li is 1, 1, 5. So sorted_start is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. start_times is [1,1,5]. The suffix_min is computed as:\n\nfor index 2: 1.\n\nindex 1: min(4, 1) =1.\n\nindex 0: min(5, 1) =1.\n\nso suffix_min is [1, 1, 1].\n\nNow, let's take the first voucher (1,3,4) with duration 3. x is 5, so target_d is 5-3=2. So check for duration 2.\n\ncase a: find vouchers with duration 2 that end before l=1. l is 1, so t = 1-1=0. end_times for duration 2 are [2, 2, 6]. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0, so idx is -1. So no case a.\n\ncase b: find vouchers with duration 2 that start after r=3. r=3, t=3+1=4. start_times for duration 2 are [1,1,5]. bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) returns 2. since idx=2 < len(3), check suffix_min[2] =1. So total is 4+1=5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother voucher is the third one (5,6,1) with duration 2. x is 5, target_d is 5-2=3. So check duration 3. preprocessed for duration 3 is:\n\nsorted_end is [(1,3,4)], end_times [3]. prefix_min [4].\n\ncase a: find vouchers with duration 3 that end before l=5. t=5-1=4. bisect_right([3],4) returns 1, idx=0. prefix_min[0]=4. sum is 1 +4=5.\n\ncase b: find vouchers with duration 3 that start after r=6. t=6+1=7. start_times for duration 3 is [1]. bisect_left([1],7) returns 1, which is >= len(1), so no.\n\nThus, this pair (voucher 3 and voucher 1) is considered, and the sum is 5.\n\nThus, the code will find this.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about the second sample input?\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3\n\n2 4 1\n\n3 5 4\n\nEach voucher has duration 3 (6-4+1=3, 4-2+1=3, 5-3+1=3). x is 2. So target_d for each voucher is 2-3 = -1. Which is invalid. So no possible pairs. Hence output is -1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if x is zero? But according to the problem statement, x is at least 2. Wait, input constraints: x is between 2 and 2e5. So no need to handle x=0.\n\nAnother edge case: when two vouchers have durations adding to x and are non-overlapping. For example, x=4, two vouchers with durations 2 and 2, and non-overlapping.\n\nAnother case: when there are multiple vouchers with same duration and overlapping, but some non-overlapping.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python:\n\nBut in code, the preprocessed is built for each duration. However, in the code, during the preprocessing step, the duration_dict is built as a defaultdict(list). Then, for each duration in duration_dict, process.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all this in Python.\n\nBut note that for the preprocessed dictionary, we need to process all durations in duration_dict. Also, in Python, we need to import bisect.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        c = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, c) )\n    \n    # Build duration_dict\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, c in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append( (l, r, c) )\n    \n    # Preprocess for each duration\n    preprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process end data\n        sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        # compute prefix_min\n        prefix_min = []\n        if len(sorted_end) ==0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_end)\n            prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n            for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n                prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2] )\n        # Process start data\n        sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        # compute suffix_min\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n        if len(sorted_start) ==0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n            for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2] )\n        # store in preprocessed\n        preprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        d = r - l +1\n        target_d = x - d\n        if target_d not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Case a: find vouchers with target_d that end before l\n        end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min = preprocessed[target_d]\n        # process case a\n        t = l -1\n        # find in end_times\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, t) -1\n        if idx >=0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[idx]\n            min_total = min( min_total, cost + current_min )\n        # case b: find vouchers with target_d that start after r\n        t = r +1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, t)\n        if idx < len(start_times):\n            current_min = suffix_min[idx]\n            min_total = min( min_total, cost + current_min )\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the preprocessing step, for the case where vouchers_list is empty (but that's not possible because duration_dict is built from vouchers, so each d in duration_dict has at least one voucher. So the code can safely assume that len(sorted_end) is >=1.\n\nBut in the code, for the preprocessed, the code for prefix_min and suffix_min is written with checks for len ==0, but since the vouchers_list is non-empty, those checks are redundant. So perhaps we can remove them.\n\nBut the code is written as:\n\n        prefix_min = []\n        if len(sorted_end) ==0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_end)\n            ...\n\nBut in reality, len(sorted_end) is not zero. So the code can be simplified.\n\nBut in the code, the preprocessed for each d is stored as (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min). However, in the code, for the case where the duration_dict has a duration, but during preprocessing, the code may have empty lists? No, because the vouchers_list is non-empty.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=4, x=5.\n\nvouchers are:\n\n(1,3,4) duration 3.\n\n(1,2,5) duration 2.\n\n(5,6,1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of vouchers and the required duration, followed by the details of each voucher.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Group vouchers by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, preprocess the vouchers to enable efficient querying:\n   - Sort vouchers by their end time and compute prefix minimum costs.\n   - Sort vouchers by their start time and compute suffix minimum costs.\n4. **Query Processing**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (such that their combined duration equals the required value) that either ends before the current voucher starts or starts after the current voucher ends. Use binary search to efficiently find these minimum costs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        c = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, c))\n\n    # Build duration_dict\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, c in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((l, r, c))\n\n    # Preprocess for each duration\n    preprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process end data\n        sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        # compute prefix_min\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n        prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n        # Process start data\n        sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        # compute suffix_min\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n        suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2])\n        # store in preprocessed\n        preprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\n    min_total = float('inf')\n\n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        target_d = x - d\n        if target_d not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Case a: find vouchers with target_d that end before l\n        end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min = preprocessed[target_d]\n        # process case a\n        t = l - 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, t) - 1\n        if idx >= 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[idx]\n            if cost + current_min < min_total:\n                min_total = cost + current_min\n        # case b: find vouchers with target_d that start after r\n        t = r + 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, t)\n        if idx < len(start_times):\n            current_min = suffix_min[idx]\n            if cost + current_min < min_total:\n                min_total = cost + current_min\n\n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and stored in a list of tuples representing each voucher's details.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for quick access.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end time and start time. Prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays are computed to facilitate efficient range minimum queries.\n4. **Query Processing**: For each voucher, we check if there exists a complementary duration voucher that does not overlap. Binary search is used to efficiently find the minimum cost vouchers that meet the non-overlapping criteria. The minimum total cost is updated accordingly, and the result is printed.",
