Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the task is to find two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the sum of their costs is as small as possible. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the duration is. Oh right, the duration is ri - li + 1. So for each voucher, we can calculate that. Then, for two vouchers i and j, their durations should sum to x. Also, they must not overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nSo the approach here is to find pairs of vouchers where one has duration d, the other has duration x - d, and they don't overlap. And find the minimum cost among all such pairs.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently? Because n can be up to 2e5, so O(n^2) is impossible. We need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. For each voucher, we can check if there exists another voucher with duration (x - current duration), and that they don't overlap. But how?\n\nMaybe pre-process vouchers by their duration. Like, group vouchers by their duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, look for vouchers with duration (x -d), and check if they are non-overlapping.\n\nBut even that might be too slow if done naively. Because for each voucher, you'd have to check all vouchers of the complementary duration. But perhaps we can find for each voucher of duration d, the minimal cost of vouchers with duration (x-d) that end before the start of this voucher, or start after the end of this voucher.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently find those?\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can keep track of the vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time. Then, for a voucher with duration d, which requires a voucher of duration (x-d), we can find the minimal cost of vouchers in the (x-d) group that end before li (the start of the current voucher), or start after ri (the end of the current voucher).\n\nBut how to do that quickly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose for each duration d, we have two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of end times, along with the minimum cost up to that point. So that for a given voucher's li, we can find all vouchers in the other duration that end before li. Similarly, for the other case where the other voucher starts after ri.\n\nWait, maybe for each duration, we can have two sorted lists: one sorted by end time, and another sorted by start time. Or maybe for each duration, we can have a list sorted by end time, and for each entry, we can have the minimum cost up to that end time. Similarly, for the start time.\n\nAlternatively, for a voucher with duration d, we want to find vouchers with duration (x-d) that end before li (so that the other voucher ends before the current voucher starts). For that, we can query the earliest end times in the (x-d) group. Or, more precisely, find all vouchers in (x-d) group with end <= li-1. Among those, we want the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case, vouchers in (x-d) group with start >= ri+1. Among those, find the minimal cost.\n\nSo for each duration, we can pre-process two structures:\n\n- For vouchers of duration d, sorted by end time, and for each position in the sorted list, we can have a prefix minimum of cost. This allows us to quickly find the minimal cost of vouchers ending before a certain time.\n\n- Also, for vouchers of duration d, sorted by start time, and for each position, a prefix minimum. Wait, no, maybe for the other case. For the start time, we need to find vouchers that start after a certain time. So if we sort the vouchers of duration (x-d) by their start time, then for a given ri, we can find the first voucher in that list with start >= ri+1. Then, among all those, find the minimal cost. But how to get that quickly?\n\nAlternatively, for each duration, we can have the vouchers sorted by end time, and also sorted by start time, with corresponding prefix minima or suffix minima.\n\nBut how to structure this?\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, calculate their duration. For each voucher, store li, ri, cost, duration.\n\n2. For each duration d, create a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each such list, sort them by end time (ri), and also sort them by start time (li). Also, for each sorted list, compute prefix minima and suffix minima?\n\nWait, for the first case: when looking for vouchers in duration (x-d) that end before li. So for those vouchers, their end time is <= li-1. So if we have a sorted list of vouchers of duration (x-d) by end time, we can perform a binary search to find the latest end time that is <= li-1. Then, the minimal cost among all such vouchers up to that point. So for this, we can have for each duration, a sorted list of end times, and a corresponding array of prefix minima.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case: vouchers in duration (x-d) that start after ri. So their li is >= ri+1. So if we have a sorted list of vouchers by start time, we can find the first voucher with li >= ri+1, and then find the minimal cost in the suffix of that list.\n\nSo for each duration, we need:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by end time, and a prefix minima array for the costs.\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by start time, and a suffix minima array for the costs.\n\nBut how to build these structures?\n\nLet me think. For each duration d, we can have:\n\n- A list called 'end_sorted' which is sorted by end time (ri). For this list, we can have a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from end_sorted[0] to end_sorted[i].\n\n- A list called 'start_sorted' which is sorted by start time (li). For this list, we can have a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from end_sorted[i] to end_sorted[-1].\n\nWait, for the start_sorted list, when we want to find vouchers that start after a certain value, say 'target', we can find the first index in start_sorted where li >= target. All elements from that index onwards have start >= target. Then, the minimal cost among those would be the suffix minima starting at that index.\n\nYes. So for each duration, we can precompute these two structures.\n\nOnce these are set up, for each voucher in the list, we can check if there exists a voucher of duration (x - d) that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\n- Calculate d = duration_i.\n\n- Check if (x - d) is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our duration groups). If not, skip.\n\n- Then, for the group of vouchers with duration (x - d), we need to find the minimal cost of vouchers that end before li (voucher i's start), or start after ri (voucher i's end).\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nIn the (x-d) group's end_sorted list, find the maximum end time <= li-1. If such vouchers exist, take the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nFor the second part:\n\nIn the (x-d) group's start_sorted list, find the first start time >= ri+1. If such vouchers exist, take the suffix_min from that index.\n\nWe can then take the minimum between these two possibilities (if any) and combine with the current voucher's cost.\n\nWe need to do this for every voucher, and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut how to handle the case where x - d is zero? Well, since x is at least 2 (since n >=2 and x is >=2?), wait no. Let me check the input constraints. The input says x can be as low as 2. For example, in the second sample input, x is 2. So for a voucher with duration d, x -d could be zero. But since duration is ri - li + 1 >=1, because li <= ri. So for x -d to be a valid duration, x must be >=d, and x -d must be >=1. So for a voucher with duration d, x -d must be >=1, so d must be <= x-1. So during the loop, for each voucher, we can check if x -d is positive, and if there exists vouchers of that duration.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into groups by duration. For each duration, store the end_sorted list and start_sorted list, along with their prefix and suffix minima arrays.\n\n2. For each voucher, compute its duration d. Check if (x -d) is a valid duration (i.e., exists in the groups, and x -d >=1). If not, skip.\n\n3. For the group of (x -d) duration:\n\n   a. Find the minimal cost of vouchers in this group that end before li (current voucher's start). How?\n\n      i. In the end_sorted list, perform a binary search for the largest end time <= li -1. If found, get the prefix_min up to that index.\n\n   b. Find the minimal cost of vouchers in this group that start after ri (current voucher's end). How?\n\n      i. In the start_sorted list, perform a binary search for the first start time >= ri + 1. If found, get the suffix_min from that index.\n\n   c. Take the minimum between the two options (a and b), if any, and add to the current voucher's cost. Update the global minimum if needed.\n\n4. After checking all vouchers, if the global minimum was found, output it. Else, -1.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement these steps efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nFor each duration d, we can have:\n\n- end_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by ri. Each element is a voucher (or just the ri and cost?), but we need to sort by ri. Then, for the prefix_min array, for each index i, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], cost of end_sorted[i]).\n\nSimilarly, for start_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by li. Then, for the suffix_min array, for each index i, suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], cost of start_sorted[i]).\n\nWait, but for the suffix_min array, perhaps it's better to build it from the end. For example, for the start_sorted list, sorted by li in ascending order, the suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end of the list.\n\nSo, for the start_sorted list, sorted by li, we can precompute a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] = min( start_sorted[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nThis way, once we find the first index in the start_sorted list where li >= target, the suffix_min for that index gives the minimal cost in that sublist.\n\nNow, for the binary searches:\n\nFor part a: in the end_sorted list, which is sorted by ri. We need to find the largest ri <= li -1. So we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of li-1, and subtract 1. If the insertion point is 0, then there are no such vouchers.\n\nFor example, using the bisect module in Python. Let's say we have a list of end times, sorted. For the current voucher's li-1, we can use bisect_right to find the index where li-1 would be inserted. The number of elements <= li-1 is that index. So if index is 0, there are none. Else, the prefix_min up to index-1 is the minimum cost.\n\nSimilarly for part b: in the start_sorted list, sorted by li. We need to find the first li >= ri + 1. Using bisect_left to find the insertion point. All elements from that index onwards have li >= target. If the insertion point is beyond the list length, then no such elements. Else, the suffix_min at that index is the minimum cost.\n\nNow, for the groups, how to store them. For example, for each duration d, we can have:\n\n- end_list: sorted by ri, and a prefix_min array.\n\n- start_list: sorted by li, and a suffix_min array.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration d in the groups:\n\n- collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\n- sort the end_list by ri, and compute prefix_min.\n\n- sort the start_list by li, and compute suffix_min.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, for each of the n vouchers, read li, ri, cost. Compute duration as ri - li + 1.\n\nThen, group them by duration. So a dictionary, say duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers.\n\nOnce grouped, for each duration d in duration_dict, process the lists:\n\nFor end_sorted:\n\nSort the list by ri. Then create a prefix_min array. For example:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for start_sorted:\n\nsorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost\n\nfor i in len(sorted_start)-2 downto 0:\n\n    suffix_min[i] = min( sorted_start[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, then for each voucher in the original list, we can check for possible pairs.\n\nNow, for each voucher:\n\ncurrent duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\nrequired duration is target_d = x - d.\n\nif target_d < 1, skip.\n\nif target_d not in duration_dict, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nlook into the duration_dict[target_d] group.\n\nFor that group, we have the end_sorted and start_sorted lists, along with their prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nNow, for the first part (vouchers in target_d that end before current voucher's li):\n\nWe need to find in the end_sorted list of target_d, the maximum end time <= li -1.\n\nSo, for the end_sorted list, which is sorted by ri, extract the list of ri's. Then perform a bisect_right on this list for (li-1). Let's call the index pos. If pos == 0, no such vouchers. Else, the minimum cost is prefix_min[pos-1].\n\nSimilarly, for the second part (vouchers in target_d that start after current voucher's ri):\n\nWe need to find in the start_sorted list of target_d, the first li >= (ri + 1). So extract the list of li's from start_sorted, and perform a bisect_left for (ri + 1). Let's call this index pos. If pos is beyond the length of the list, then no such vouchers. Else, the minimum cost is suffix_min[pos].\n\nThen, for both possibilities, we take the minimum between them (if they exist) and add to current voucher's cost. Then, keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that the voucher in the target_d group is not the same as the current voucher. Because the problem says i != j. However, since we're considering all vouchers in the target_d group, and the current voucher's duration is d, and target_d is x -d. So if d + target_d = x, but if the current voucher's duration is d, and the target_d is x -d, then if x -d is equal to d, then x must be 2d. So for example, if x is even, and d is half of x, then the current voucher could be paired with another voucher of same duration. However, in that case, when we check the group, we need to make sure that the voucher in the group is not the same as the current one. But how?\n\nBecause, for example, if the current voucher is in the group of d, and the target_d is same as d. So when processing this voucher, we look into the group of target_d (same as d). But the group includes all vouchers with that duration, including the current one. So when we look for vouchers in the target_d group that end before current's li, or start after current's ri, we may include the current voucher itself. But since i and j must be different, we need to make sure that the voucher in the group is not the same as the current one.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. How can we handle that?\n\nWell, for example, if the current voucher is in the target_d group. So when we process it, we check for other vouchers in the target_d group. However, during the binary search steps, the code may find the current voucher itself as a candidate. But since the current voucher's end time is ri, and the current voucher's li is li. So for the first case, when looking for vouchers ending before current's li, the current voucher's end time is ri, which may be larger than li-1. So perhaps the current voucher is not included. But if the current voucher's ri is <= li -1? That's impossible because li <= ri. So ri can't be less than li. So li-1 is at least li -1, which is less than ri (since li <= ri). So the current voucher's ri is >= li. Therefore, when looking for vouchers ending before li-1, the current voucher can't be part of that group. Because ri >= li, so ri >= li >= li-1 + 1. So ri is at least li, which is greater than li-1. Therefore, the current voucher will not be considered in that case.\n\nBut for the other case, when looking for vouchers starting after ri. The current voucher's li is li, and ri is the end. So the current voucher's start is li. So if someone is looking for vouchers that start after ri, the current voucher's start is li, which is <= ri. So again, the current voucher won't be in that group. Therefore, when processing the current voucher, the group of target_d may include the current voucher, but in the two cases (before li or after ri), the current voucher is not included. Therefore, even if the group contains the current voucher, the code will not pick it. Thus, the i != j condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the current voucher has duration d, and target_d is x -d. Suppose that x -d is equal to d, so x = 2d. Then, the current voucher is in the group of target_d. Now, when we check for vouchers in the target_d group that end before li, which is the start of the current voucher. Since the current voucher's ri is >= li, and the current voucher's end is ri. So the current voucher's end is >= li. So when we look for vouchers ending before li-1, the current voucher's end is ri >= li, which is larger than li-1. Therefore, it's not included. Similarly, when looking for vouchers starting after ri, the current voucher's start is li, which is <= ri. Therefore, not included. Therefore, the code will not consider the current voucher as a possible pair. Therefore, even if the group contains the current voucher, the code will not pair it with itself. Therefore, no need to worry about i != j. So that's handled automatically.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed without worrying about that.\n\nNow, the next step is to code this logic.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers. For each, compute duration.\n\nGroup them into duration_dict, where each key is a duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\nFor each duration in duration_dict, pre-process the end_sorted and start_sorted lists, along with their prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list, do the following:\n\nd = duration of voucher.\n\ntarget_d = x -d.\n\nif target_d < 1 or target_d not in duration_dict: continue.\n\nElse:\n\nget the group for target_d.\n\nCheck for possible pairs:\n\nCase 1: find vouchers in target_d that end before current voucher's li.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers in target_d that start after current voucher's ri.\n\nFor each case, find the minimal cost, if any.\n\nTake the minimum of the two (if any), add to current voucher's cost, and update the global minimum.\n\nSo, for the code, the voucher can be represented as a tuple (li, ri, cost). Or perhaps as a class, but in Python, tuples are easier.\n\nNow, for the preprocessing:\n\nFor each duration in duration_dict:\n\ngroup = list of vouchers.\n\nsorted_end = sorted(group, key=lambda v: v[1])  # since v[1] is ri.\n\nthen, create a list of end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\nprefix_min = [ ... ]\n\nSimilarly for start_sorted.\n\nBut in code, how to handle this?\n\nLet me think. For each duration in the duration_dict, we can precompute:\n\n- end_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by ri.\n\n- end_prefix_min: list of minimum cost up to each index.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- start_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by li.\n\n- start_suffix_min: list of minimum cost from each index to end.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration d in duration_dict:\n\ngroup = duration_dict[d]\n\nsorted_end = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nend_ri_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n\nSimilarly for start_sorted:\n\nsorted_start = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nstart_li_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n    suffix_min[i] = min( sorted_start[i][2], suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nThen, for each voucher, when checking for target_d:\n\nIf target_d is present in duration_dict, then:\n\ngroup_target = duration_dict[target_d]\n\nsorted_end_target = group_target's sorted_end list.\n\nend_ri_list_target = [v[1] for v in sorted_end_target]\n\nprefix_min_target = the prefix_min array for that group.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start_target, start_li_list_target, and suffix_min_target.\n\nNow, during the processing of the current voucher (li, ri, cost):\n\nFor case 1:\n\nWe need to find in end_ri_list_target the largest value <= li-1.\n\nWe can use bisect.bisect_right(end_ri_list_target, li-1) to get the insertion point. pos = bisect.bisect_right(...).\n\nif pos > 0:\n\n   min_cost_case1 = prefix_min_target[pos-1]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_cost_case1 = infinity\n\nFor case 2:\n\nWe need to find in start_li_list_target the first value >= ri + 1.\n\npos = bisect.bisect_left(start_li_list_target, ri + 1)\n\nif pos < len(start_li_list_target):\n\n   min_cost_case2 = suffix_min_target[pos]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_cost_case2 = infinity\n\nThen, total_min_candidate = min( min_cost_case1, min_cost_case2 )\n\nif total_min_candidate is not infinity:\n\n   current_total = current_voucher_cost + total_min_candidate\n\n   update the global_min.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle this.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all of this.\n\nBut how to store the sorted_end and prefix_min for each duration?\n\nPerhaps, for each duration d, we can store a tuple (sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min).\n\nBut in Python, perhaps for each duration, we can precompute and store these four components.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = r - l + 1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor v in vouchers:\n    l, r, cost, d = v\n    duration_dict[d].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n# Preprocess each duration group\npreprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (end_sorted, end_prefix_min, start_sorted, start_suffix_min)\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    group = duration_dict[d]\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n    end_sorted = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    end_ri_list = [x[1] for x in end_sorted]\n    prefix_min = []\n    if end_sorted:\n        prefix_min = [0]*len(end_sorted)\n        prefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(end_sorted)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i][2])\n    # process start_sorted and suffix_min\n    start_sorted = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    start_li_list = [x[0] for x in start_sorted]\n    suffix_min = []\n    if start_sorted:\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(start_sorted)\n        suffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(start_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min( start_sorted[i][2], suffix_min[i+1] )\n    preprocessed[d] = (end_sorted, end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_sorted, start_li_list, suffix_min)\n\nThen, for each voucher in vouchers:\n\nglobal_min = infinity\n\nfor v in vouchers:\n    l, r, cost, d = v\n    target_d = x - d\n    if target_d < 1 or target_d not in preprocessed:\n        continue\n    # get the preprocessed data for target_d\n    end_sorted, end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_sorted, start_li_list, suffix_min = preprocessed[target_d]\n    # case 1: find vouchers in target_d that end before l (current voucher's l)\n    # end <= l -1\n    # find pos in end_ri_list\n    pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_ri_list, l-1)\n    min_case1 = float('inf')\n    if pos > 0:\n        min_case1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n    # case 2: find vouchers in target_d that start after r (current voucher's r)\n    # start >= r + 1\n    pos2 = bisect.bisect_left(start_li_list, r + 1)\n    min_case2 = float('inf')\n    if pos2 < len(start_li_list):\n        min_case2 = suffix_min[pos2]\n    current_min = min( min_case1, min_case2 )\n    if current_min != float('inf'):\n        total = cost + current_min\n        if total < global_min:\n            global_min = total\n\nif global_min == float('inf'):\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(global_min)\n\nWait, but in the preprocessed, for the group of target_d, the end_sorted and others are stored. But for the case when the target_d group is empty? Well, the code checks if target_d is in preprocessed. But since preprocessed is built from duration_dict, which is built from the vouchers. So if target_d is in duration_dict, then preprocessed has it. So that's okay.\n\nBut what if the group for target_d is empty? No, because duration_dict only has durations that have at least one voucher. So target_d is in duration_dict implies that the group is non-empty.\n\nBut during the preprocessing, for each duration d in duration_dict, we process the group. So the preprocessed dict will have entries for all durations present in duration_dict.\n\nBut what if the target_d is present in duration_dict, but when we check for case 1 and case 2, there are no vouchers? Like, for example, the target_d group has vouchers, but none of them meet the conditions. Then, min_case1 and min_case2 would be inf, and current_min would be inf, so no contribution.\n\nBut in that case, the code skips adding anything.\n\nNow, let's test the first example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration is 3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo x is 5.\n\nSo for each voucher:\n\nFirst voucher: duration 3. target_d = 5-3=2. So look into target_d=2 group.\n\nThe group has three vouchers: (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4). Wait, no, original vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 1: l=1, r=3, cost 4, duration 3.\n\nvoucher 2: l=1, r=2, cost 5, duration 2.\n\nvoucher3: l=5, r=6, cost 1, duration 2.\n\nvoucher4: l=1, r=2, cost 4, duration 2.\n\nSo duration_dict for 2 has vouchers 2,3,4.\n\npreprocessing for duration 2:\n\nend_sorted is sorted by r. So voucher2 has r=2, voucher4 has r=2, voucher3 has r=6. So sorted by r:\n\nvoucher2 (r=2), voucher4 (r=2), voucher3 (r=6). So end_ri_list is [2, 2, 6]. prefix_min is [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4, 1)=1].\n\nstart_sorted is sorted by l. voucher2 has l=1, voucher4 has l=1, voucher3 has l=5. So start_li_list is [1,1,5]. suffix_min is [min(5,4,1) =1, min(4,1)=1, 1].\n\nNow, for the first voucher (l=1, r=3, cost=4, d=3):\n\ntarget_d is 2. So check case 1 and case 2.\n\ncase1: find vouchers in target_d that end before l-1 = 1-1=0. end_ri_list is [2, 2, 6]. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0. pos=0. So no case1.\n\ncase2: find vouchers in target_d that start after r+1 = 3+1=4. start_li_list is [1,1,5]. bisect_left for 4 is 2 (since 5 is the first >=4). pos2=2. suffix_min[2] is 1. So min_case2 is 1. So current_min is 1. total is 4 + 1 =5.\n\nWhich is the correct answer.\n\nAnother voucher, like voucher3 (l=5, r=6, cost=1, duration 2). target_d is x -2=5-2=3. Check if there are vouchers with duration 3. Yes, voucher1. So check case1 and case2.\n\nFor voucher3's l=5, r=6.\n\ntarget_d=3.\n\npreprocessed for d=3: group is [voucher1].\n\nend_sorted for d=3 is [(1,3,4)], end_ri_list [3]. prefix_min [4].\n\ncase1: find vouchers ending before l-1 =5-1=4. end_ri_list is [3], bisect_right([3], 4) returns 1. pos=1>0, so prefix_min[0] is 4. So case1 is 4.\n\ncase2: find vouchers starting after r+1=6+1=7. start_li_list for d=3 is [1]. bisect_left([1],7) returns 1, which is beyond len(1). So no case2. So current_min is 4. total is 1 +4=5. Which is same as before.\n\nSo the code would capture this.\n\nSo the code seems to work for that case.\n\nNow, the second sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 → duration 3\n\n2 4 1 → duration 3\n\n3 5 4 → duration 3.\n\nx is 2. So for each voucher, duration is 3. target_d = 2-3 = -1. So invalid. So no possible pairs. Hence output -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases: when x is 2, and there are two vouchers with duration 1 each. For example, n=2, x=2. vouchers (1,1,1) and (2,2,1). Then, they are non-overlapping. The code should find them.\n\nAnother edge case: when two vouchers have same duration and are non-overlapping. So code should find them.\n\nAnother case: when a voucher is in both cases. For example, a voucher with duration d, and another voucher with duration x-d that starts after the first's end. So code would find it.\n\nNow, code-wise, what about when the target_d is same as d, but there are multiple vouchers. For example, x=4, and two vouchers with duration 2 each, non-overlapping. Then the code would process each voucher and find the other.\n\nNow, code-wise, the problem is that for each voucher, we check for target_d, but when target_d is same as d, then the group is the same as the current voucher's group. But since during the case1 and case2, the current voucher is not considered, the code will find the other vouchers.\n\nNow, for the code, in Python, the preprocessed data is stored for each duration. So during the preprocessing, for each duration, the group is processed.\n\nNow, what about the initial code for the vouchers? The code uses a list of tuples (l, r, cost, duration). Then, during the preprocessing, for each duration, the group is stored as list of (l, r, cost).\n\nNow, in the code, during the processing of each voucher, the code uses l, r, cost, d. So yes.\n\nNow, for the code, the preprocessed data is stored as a dictionary. For each duration, the code stores (end_sorted, end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_sorted, start_li_list, suffix_min).\n\nBut in the code above, the preprocessed is built as follows:\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    group = duration_dict[d]\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n    end_sorted = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    end_ri_list = [x[1] for x in end_sorted]\n    prefix_min = []\n    if end_sorted:\n        prefix_min = [0]*len(end_sorted)\n        prefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(end_sorted)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i][2])\n    # process start_sorted and suffix_min\n    start_sorted = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    start_li_list = [x[0] for x in start_sorted]\n    suffix_min = []\n    if start_sorted:\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(start_sorted)\n        suffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(start_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min( start_sorted[i][2], suffix_min[i+1] )\n    preprocessed[d] = (end_sorted, end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_sorted, start_li_list, suffix_min)\n\nBut when group is empty? No, because duration_dict is built from the vouchers, and group is duration_dict[d], which is non-empty.\n\nNow, in code, when building prefix_min and suffix_min, for empty groups? No, since the group is non-empty.\n\nNow, during the case when target_d is present, but the group is empty? No, because target_d is in duration_dict, which implies that group is non-empty.\n\nNow, code-wise, for the first sample, the code would generate the correct answer.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple vouchers in the target_d group, and some of them are non-overlapping. The code should find the minimum.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the bisect correctly.\n\nAnother thing: the end_ri_list is built from the end_sorted, which is sorted by ri. So for bisect, we can pass the end_ri_list.\n\nSimilarly for start_li_list.\n\nNow, in Python, the bisect module functions take a list and a value. So, for example, bisect.bisect_right(end_ri_list, l-1) is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the initial code for vouchers? The code reads the vouchers as (l, r, cost, duration), but during the grouping, the duration_dict is built with (l, r, cost) tuples. So the duration is computed as r - l + 1. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the code for the first sample:\n\nIn the first sample, during the processing of the first voucher (l=1, r=3, cost=4, duration=3), target_d is 2. The preprocessed for target_d=2 has end_ri_list [2,2,6], and start_li_list [",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently finding pairs of vouchers that can potentially sum up to the required duration.\n2. **Preprocess for Efficient Lookup**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers into two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end date of the voucher, along with a prefix minimum cost array to quickly find the minimum cost of vouchers ending before a certain date.\n   - Another sorted by the start date of the voucher, along with a suffix minimum cost array to quickly find the minimum cost of vouchers starting after a certain date.\n3. **Check for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (i.e., the required duration minus the current voucher's duration). Use the preprocessed data to efficiently determine if such vouchers exist and compute the minimum cost.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        r = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost, duration))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for v in vouchers:\n        l, r, cost, d = v\n        duration_dict[d].append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    preprocessed = dict()\n    \n    for d in duration_dict:\n        group = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process end_sorted and prefix_min\n        end_sorted = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_ri_list = [x[1] for x in end_sorted]\n        prefix_min = []\n        if end_sorted:\n            prefix_min = [0] * len(end_sorted)\n            prefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0][2]\n            for i in range(1, len(end_sorted)):\n                prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i][2])\n        # Process start_sorted and suffix_min\n        start_sorted = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_li_list = [x[0] for x in start_sorted]\n        suffix_min = []\n        if start_sorted:\n            suffix_min = [0] * len(start_sorted)\n            suffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1][2]\n            for i in range(len(start_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min(start_sorted[i][2], suffix_min[i+1])\n        preprocessed[d] = (end_sorted, end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_sorted, start_li_list, suffix_min)\n    \n    global_min = float('inf')\n    \n    for v in vouchers:\n        l, r, cost, d = v\n        target_d = x - d\n        if target_d < 1 or target_d not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Get preprocessed data for target_d\n        end_sorted, end_ri_list, prefix_min, start_sorted, start_li_list, suffix_min = preprocessed[target_d]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers ending before l-1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_ri_list, l-1)\n        min_case1 = float('inf')\n        if pos > 0:\n            min_case1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n        # Case 2: find vouchers starting after r+1\n        pos2 = bisect.bisect_left(start_li_list, r+1)\n        min_case2 = float('inf')\n        if pos2 < len(start_li_list):\n            min_case2 = suffix_min[pos2]\n        current_min = min(min_case1, min_case2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = cost + current_min\n            if total < global_min:\n                global_min = total\n    \n    if global_min == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(global_min)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each with its start date, end date, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient access.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration group, vouchers are sorted by their end date and start date.
