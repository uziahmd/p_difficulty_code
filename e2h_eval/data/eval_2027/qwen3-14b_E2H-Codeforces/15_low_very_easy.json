They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can be the champion given the tournament structure and the string s that dictates the rules for each phase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the tournament works. So there are 2^n teams. Each phase halves the number of teams. For each phase, depending on whether s_i is 0 or 1, the matches are decided by lower or higher skill level. The question is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is given as part of the input? No, the problem says that we have to find all x that are possible for some permutation p. So the permutation p is not fixed; we can choose any permutation as long as the tournament results in x being the champion according to the rules given by s.\n\nBut how do I model this? For each possible x, can I determine if there's a way to arrange the permutation such that x ends up as the winner?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. Each round, teams are paired, and based on the current phase's rule (s_i), the winner is determined. The key is that for each phase, the winner is determined by the rule. So for example, in the first phase (phase 1?), if s[0] is 1, then the higher-skilled team wins each match. But the initial arrangement of the teams into pairs depends on their positions in the initial bracket.\n\nWait, but the initial bracket is fixed. Like, the first phase has teams 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. But the permutation p is the skill levels of the teams. Wait, no. Wait, the permutation p is the skill levels. So the team numbers are fixed, but their skill levels are given by p. So for example, team 1's skill is p_1, team 2's is p_2, etc. So the initial bracket is fixed: team 1 vs team 2, etc. But the actual skill levels are determined by the permutation p. However, the problem allows us to choose any permutation p (so any assignment of the numbers 1 to 2^n to the teams) such that the team with skill x ends up as the winner.\n\nSo the task is to find all x where there exists some permutation p such that when the tournament is played with the rules given by s, the team with skill x is the champion.\n\nHmm. How can I model the possible winners?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the tournament as a binary tree. Each round, the teams are grouped into pairs, and the winners proceed to the next round. The rules for each round (whether higher or lower skill wins) are determined by the string s.\n\nFor a team to be the champion, it must win all the rounds. So, for each round, depending on the rule (s_i for that round), the team must be able to beat its opponent in that round. However, the opponents depend on the structure of the tournament and the other teams' skills.\n\nBut since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange the other teams' skills in such a way that the required conditions are met for x to be the champion.\n\nSo the idea is to find for each x, what constraints must be satisfied so that x can be the winner.\n\nLet me think about each round. Let's say the tournament has n rounds. For example, if n=3, then there are 3 rounds. The first round (phase 1) has 2^(3-1) = 4 games, then phase 2 has 2 games, then phase 3 has 1 game.\n\nIn each phase i (starting from 0?), the rule is determined by s[i]. For example, for the first phase (i=0?), the rule is s[0].\n\nNow, for x to be the champion, it must win each of the n rounds. Let's think about each round's requirements.\n\nLet's think about the first round. Suppose in phase 1, the rule is s_0. For x to win this round, it must be in a pair where, according to the rule, it wins. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can arrange the opponents in such a way that x can win.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a bracket. For example, in the first round, the teams are arranged into pairs. For x to proceed to the next round, in its first match, it must be that either:\n\n- If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), then x must have a higher skill than its opponent.\n\n- If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), then x must have a lower skill than its opponent.\n\nBut since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange the opponents in such a way that x meets these conditions.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion in a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The tournament structure and rules are defined by the input parameters, and our goal is to identify all possible winning skill levels.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of $2^n$ teams and $2^n - 1$ games. Each phase halves the number of teams until one champion remains.\n2. **Rules for Each Phase**: Each phase has a rule (either '0' or '1') that determines the winner of each match based on the skill levels of the teams involved.\n3. **Skill Level Constraints**: For a given skill level $x$ to be a winner, it must be possible to arrange the permutation of skill levels such that $x$ wins all matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    \n    # For each x, determine if it can be the winner\n    winning = set()\n    \n    # We need to find for each x, the minimal and maximal required values in each round\n    # For each round i (starting from 0), the rule is s[i]\n    # We will compute for each round the constraints on x\n    \n    # For x to be the winner, in each round i, depending on the rule, it must be either:\n    # - the minimum in its group (if rule is '0')\n    # - the maximum in its group (if rule is '1')\n    # But since the group size doubles each round, we can model the required range of x\n    \n    # We can think recursively: in the first round, the group size is 2, then 4, etc.\n    # For each round i (0-based), the group size is 2^{i+1}\n    # So, for x to be the winner, it must be the min or max in its group at each round.\n    \n    # The key observation is that for each round i (from 0 to n-1), the x must be either:\n    # - the minimum of a group of size 2^{i+1} (if s[i] is '0')\n    # - the maximum of a group of size 2^{i+1} (if s[i] is '1')\n    \n    # So, we can compute the lower and upper bounds for x by considering each round's constraint\n    \n    # Initialize the lower and upper bounds\n    low = 1\n    high = total_teams\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            # x must be the minimum in a group of size 2^(i+1)\n            # So, there must be at least 2^(i+1) - 1 elements greater than x\n            # Which implies x <= total_teams - (2^(i+1) - 1)\n            high = min(high, total_teams - (1 << (i + 1)) + 1)\n        else:\n            # x must be the maximum in a group of size 2^(i+1)\n            # So, there must be at least 2^(i+1) - 1 elements less than x\n            # Which implies x >= 1 + (2^(i+1) - 1)\n            low = max(low, 1 + (1 << (i + 1)) - 1)\n    \n    # All integers between low and high inclusive are winning\n    winning = list(range(low, high + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, winning)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer $n$ and a string $s$ which dictates the rules for each phase of the tournament.\n2. **Total Teams Calculation**: The total number of teams is $2^n$, calculated using bit shifting.\n3. **Determining Winning Skill Levels**: For each phase, based on the rule ('0' or '1'), we adjust the possible range of skill levels that can be champions. If the rule is '0', the skill level must be the minimum in its group, adjusting the upper bound. If the rule is '1', the skill level must be the maximum in its group, adjusting the lower bound.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The valid skill levels are those within the computed range [low, high], which are printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible winning skill levels by iteratively adjusting bounds based on the tournament rules, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
