They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can win a tournament given certain rules for each phase. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: there are 2^n teams, each with a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament is structured in phases. Each phase halves the number of teams. For each phase i (starting from 1 to n), the outcome of the matches depends on the character s[i-1] (since the string is 0-indexed). If it's '0', the lower skill level wins; if '1', higher skill wins.\n\nOur goal is to find all integers x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. So the key is to model how the tournament progresses based on the rules of each phase and determine for each possible x whether it can be the winner.\n\nBut how do we model the tournament structure? Since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1..2^n, but the tournament results depend on the rules per phase. However, the problem says that we need to find x such that there exists some permutation where x wins. So we need to find all x that can reach the top through the tournament structure given the rules.\n\nWait, but the permutation p defines the initial arrangement of teams. But the tournament's structure is fixed. For example, in the first phase, the teams are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. Wait, but the actual teams are arranged in some order. Wait, noâ€”the way the tournament is structured is that the initial arrangement is fixed as per their positions, but the permutation p determines their skill levels. Wait, no. The problem says that the permutation p is given, and the teams are arranged in the initial bracket. Wait, perhaps the initial bracket is fixed as per the order of the teams. For example, team 1 is the first team, team 2 is the second, etc. But their skill levels are determined by p. So when they play, the actual skill levels determine who wins, according to the rules of the phase.\n\nSo the tournament bracket is fixed. The initial positions are fixed. For example, in the first round, the first two teams (positions 1 and 2) play each other, then positions 3 and 4, etc. Then the winners of those matches proceed to the next round, where they are paired again in the same way. For example, the winner of 1 vs 2 plays against the winner of 3 vs 4, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that the permutation p is such that the skill levels are assigned to the teams. So the initial arrangement of the teams (their positions) is fixed. But the skills are permuted. So the question is, for a given x, can we arrange the permutation p such that the team with skill x (which is placed in some position in the bracket) can win all the matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nSo the challenge is to find all x such that there's a way to assign the skill levels to the teams (permutation p) so that x ends up as the champion.\n\nNow, the key observation here is that for a given x to be a winning integer, it must be possible for x to win all the rounds, given the rules for each phase. But how?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each round (phase), the way the match is decided depends on the phase. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), the matches are between adjacent pairs. The winner proceeds. Then in phase 2, the winners are grouped into pairs again, and so on.\n\nBut since the permutation can be chosen arbitrarily, perhaps we can model for each x, what is the minimal and maximal possible value that x must have in order to win each round, given the rules of each phase.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each team must pass through log2(2^n) = n rounds. For each round, depending on the phase, the team's skill must be either higher or lower than its opponent in that round.\n\nBut since the opponents in each round depend on the initial bracket structure, perhaps we can model for each x, the required conditions on x's skill relative to other teams in each round.\n\nWait, but since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the other teams' skill levels as needed. So for x to be able to win, we need that in each round, there exists a way to arrange the other teams such that x can win each of its matches, given the phase's rule.\n\nSo for example, in the first round (phase 1), x's team has to be in a pair where, according to the rule (s[0] is 0 or 1), x's skill is either higher or lower than",
    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure is such that each phase halves the number of teams until only one remains. The rules for each phase dictate whether the team with the higher or lower skill level wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in `n` phases, where each phase halves the number of teams. The initial number of teams is `2^n`.\n2. **Rules per Phase**: Each phase has a rule (either '0' for lower skill winning or '1' for higher skill winning).\n3. **Skill Levels**: Each team has a unique skill level from 1 to `2^n`. We need to determine which skill levels can be the champion based on the given rules.\n\nThe key insight is to simulate the tournament for each possible skill level and check if it can reach the final by following the rules of each phase. This involves determining the minimum and maximum possible values that a team must have in each round to win based on the given rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    \n    # For each x in 1..total_teams, determine if it can be the winner\n    result = []\n    \n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        # We need to check if x can win the tournament\n        # We'll simulate the rounds\n        current_min = 1\n        current_max = total_teams\n        for i in range(n):\n            phase = i  # 0-based\n            rule = s[i]\n            # In this phase, the number of matches is 2^(n - i - 1)\n            # For each match, the rule applies\n            if rule == '0':\n                # Lower skill wins, so x must be the smallest in its bracket\n                # So, in this round, x must be the minimum in its group\n                # To ensure that, x must be <= current_max (but we need to track min and max)\n                # Wait, think differently: during each round, the team must be able to win its match\n                # For the current round, the team must be the minimum or maximum in its group\n                # So, we need to track the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have in each round\n                # Let's think recursively: for each round, depending on the rule, the x must be either the smallest or largest in its group of size 2^(n-i)\n                # But how to model this?

For x to be the winner, in each round, when it plays against another team, it must win according to the rule.\n                # Since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange the opponents such that x always wins.\n                # For example, in the first round (phase 1), if the rule is '0', then x must be the minimum in its pair. So in the pair, x must be less than the other team. Since we can arrange the other team's skill to be higher than x, this is possible.\n                # Similarly, if the rule is '1', x must be the maximum in its pair, so we can set the other team's skill to be lower.\n                # However, in subsequent rounds, x must be the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^{i+1} teams. So for each round i (0-based), the group size is 2^{i+1}.\n                # For example, in the first round (i=0), group size 2^1 = 2; second round (i=1), group size 4, etc.\n                # So for each round i, depending on the rule, x must be either the minimum or maximum of 2^{i+1} elements.\n                # Thus, the constraints are:\n                # For each round i:\n                # if rule is '0', then x must be the minimum in its group of size 2^{i+1}.
