The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells in that ring?\n\nLet me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a 3x3 rectangle's border is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice) → 8 cells, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1 and output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of that size. So for example, the first ring is the border of the original rectangle. The second ring is the border of a rectangle that's 4 units smaller in each dimension (since 4*(i-1) for i=2 is 4*1=4). Wait, but how does that work? Let me think: For the second ring, it's 2 cells away from the edge. So the original rectangle is w x h. The first ring is the outermost layer. Then, the second ring would be 2 cells inward. So the dimensions of the rectangle for the second ring would be (w - 2*2) × (h - 2*2) ? Wait, no. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. Wait, for example, the first ring is the outermost. Then, the next ring is 2 cells inward. So the rectangle for the second ring would be (original width - 2*2) in width and same for height. Because each side is reduced by 2 cells. Wait, but the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because for each ring, you subtract 4*(i-1) from both dimensions. For example, when i=1, it's 4*0 = 0, so the original dimensions. For i=2, subtract 4*(1) = 4 from each dimension. So that would be the rectangle that's 4 units smaller in each direction. So that makes sense. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left, right, top, bottom). So for each ring, the next one is 2 cells deeper. So the width and height for the rectangle of the i-th ring is (original width - 4*(i-1)) and same for height. \n\nBut then, for each i-th ring, the number of cells is the perimeter of that rectangle. So the formula for the perimeter is 2*(w' + h' - 2), where w' and h' are the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring. Because for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each side has W or H cells, but the four corners are counted twice. So 2*(W + H) - 4 = 2*(W + H - 2). \n\nSo for each ring i, compute 2*( (w' + h' - 2) ), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these values for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that for each i, the dimensions w' and h' are at least 1. Because if the rectangle is too small, then maybe there's no ring. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. The input says that k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ). Wait, the problem says that the input is given with k as up to that value. So for the given input, there's no problem. So we don't have to check for invalid cases.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   add perimeter to total\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example: input 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3 - 0 =3, current_h = 3-0=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4) =8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: input 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h is 9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: input 7 9 2. So for i=1: 7,9 → perimeter 28. For i=2: current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*(6) =12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So yes.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k. Then loop for each i from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, compute the perimeter, sum them all.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then compute the sum.\n\nBut wait, what if the input is given as, say, 3 3 1, which is allowed. So code:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nWait, but let me check for another example. Let's take the third example: 7 9 2. So i runs 1 and 2.\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. i=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose w=5, h=5, k=2. Let's compute.\n\nFor i=1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16. For i=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0. So total is 16 + 0 = 16? Wait but that's possible. Because the second ring would be a 1x1 rectangle, which has no perimeter. So the code would add zero. But according to the problem statement, the input k is valid. So for example, when min(w,h) is 5, then floor( (5+1)/4 ) is floor(6/4) = 1. So k can't be 2. So the code will not receive such input. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the input is read from stdin. The input is a single line with three integers. So in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the sum as discussed.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me code that.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. So output is 16.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=1. Output is 16.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=0? But according to input constraints, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
