    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is the edge, the second is two cells in, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\nHmm. Let me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For the i-th ring, it's based on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we calculate the number of cells in that ring?\n\nWait, the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. So for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, no, maybe a better way: the perimeter cells are (W * 2) + (H - 2)*2? No, wait. Let me think again. For a rectangle with width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (H-2) each. So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Yes, that formula.\n\nSo for each ring i, we compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i, h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for the first ring, i=1, so w_i is w, h_i is h. Then the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). Then for the next ring, i=2, the dimensions are (w - 4*(1)) and (h - 4*(1)), so (w-4) and (h-4). But wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for each ring, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle. Then sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each ring, the rectangle must be at least 3x3? Or maybe not. Because the problem says that the input k is such that it's valid. The constraints for k are given as 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Wait, let me check. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(n, m) + 1)/4 ), but n and m here are probably the original w and h. Wait, the problem says that the input has w, h, k. So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) is 1. So k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3 plate, you can only have one ring. For a 7x7 plate, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So k can be up to 2. So for each ring i from 1 to k, the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring must be at least 3x3? Because otherwise, the perimeter would be invalid. But since the input ensures that k is valid, we don't need to check that. So for each i from 1 to k, the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)) must be at least 3x3. Wait, maybe not. Let's think: For example, when i is such that the rectangle becomes 3x3, then the perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 8, which is correct. So the formula holds.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate for each ring from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i, h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Sum all these perimeters.\n\nWait, but let's test the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. So for i=1, w_i=3, h_i=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So the first ring is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14 = 28. Which matches the output of 28.\n\nThird example input is 7 9 2. For i=1: 7x9 → 28. For i=2: w_i =7 -4*(1) =3, h_i=9-4*(1)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Total sum is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, this approach works.\n\nSo the plan is to loop for each i from 1 to k, compute for each step the current width and height, compute the perimeter, add to the total.\n\nNow, the code. Let's see. Read w, h, k. Then for each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum += perimeter\n\nSo return sum.\n\nBut wait, let me check for i=2 in the third example. current_w is 7 - 4*(1) = 3, current_h is 9 -4*(1) =5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*(6) =12. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead input: the input is three integers. So read them from stdin. For example, in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen initialize total = 0\n\nLoop for i in range 1 to k inclusive:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\ntotal += perimeter\n\nThen print(total)\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Well, according to the problem statement, the input k is valid. So for the given k, the current_w and current_h for each i up to k will be at least 3. Because the constraints on k ensure that. For example, the maximum possible k is floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see for min(w, h) = m. For example, if m is 3, then k can be 1. For i=1, the current_w and current_h are 3 and ... Well, the other dimension is >=3. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nLet's test the third example: 7 9 2.\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28.\n\ni=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5 → 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's take w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be the outer ring. If k=2, then for i=2, current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. Wait, but that's 1x1. But according to the problem's input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). For w=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the Python code is straightforward. Let's write it.\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Then loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter and sum.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for another example. Suppose w=5, h=5, k=1. The perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct. If you imagine a 5x5 grid, the outer ring is 5*4 + 5*4 - 4 (corners counted twice?), no. Wait, the perimeter formula is 2*(w + h - 2). For 5x5, that's 2*(5+5-2) = 2*8=16. Which is correct. The outer ring has 5*4 cells? Wait, no. Let me think. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4 (since each corner is counted twice). Wait, for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Which equals 2*(W + H - 2). So yes. For 5x5, 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct. For example, the perimeter is 5*4 (each side) minus 4 (the four corners counted twice). So 5*4 - 4 = 16. Yes.\n\nSo the code is correct. Therefore, this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded when adding `k` rings around a rectangular plate of dimensions `w` by `h`. Each ring is placed such that the first ring is along the edge, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Ring Structure**: Each ring is essentially the perimeter of a rectangle. For the i-th ring, the dimensions of the rectangle are adjusted inward by `4*(i-1)` cells from both the width and height of the original plate.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter of a rectangle with width `W` and height `H` is given by the formula `2 * (W + H - 2)`. This accounts for the cells along the border of the rectangle.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the adjusted dimensions of the rectangle and use the perimeter formula to determine the number of gilded cells for that ring. Sum these values for all rings up to `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`).\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, adjust the dimensions of the rectangle inward by `4*(i-1)` cells from both the width and height.\n- **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, calculate its perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n- **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and applying the perimeter formula, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the problem constraints.",
