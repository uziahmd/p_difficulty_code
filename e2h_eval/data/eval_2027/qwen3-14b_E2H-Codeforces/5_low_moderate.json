Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair. \n\nSo, first, I need to figure out how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') can only pair with another 'a' or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'. \n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Maybe we can first pair the specific colors with each other, then use the question marks to fill in the remaining gaps. But how?\n\nLet's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots that have the same specific color. For example, if there's a left boot with 'a' and a right boot with 'a', pair them. But since there might be multiple instances, we need to count how many of each color are present on both sides.\n\nBut wait, the order matters here. Because for each color, the number of pairs we can make is the minimum of the count of that color on the left and on the right. However, once we pair those, the question marks can be used for the leftovers.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, some colors may have more on the left than on the right, and vice versa. So, for each color c (not '?'), we can pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (including the ones with '?') can be paired using the '?'s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can handle the '?'s in two parts: those that can be used as wildcards for specific colors, and those that can be paired together.\n\nBut how to model this optimally?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as a bipartite graph where left boots are on one side, right on the other. Edges exist between compatible pairs. We need to find the maximum matching. But with n up to 150,000, standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms (like Hopcroft-Karp) would be too slow. So that's not feasible. Thus, we need a greedy approach.\n\nSo, the problem requires a greedy strategy that can be computed efficiently.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots that have the same specific color. For example, for each color c (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have c, and how many right boots have c. The number of pairs for color c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Then, subtract those from the counts. However, this may not be optimal because perhaps pairing some of them with '?'s could allow more total pairs. Wait, no. Because if you have a left boot with 'a' and a right boot with 'a', pairing them is better than using them with '?'s. Because if you pair them, you can save the '?'s for other cases where they might be needed. So this step seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a scenario where using a '?' to pair with a specific color allows more total pairs. But I think that's not possible. Because if you have a left 'a' and a right '?', pairing them uses up the left 'a' and the right '?'. Alternatively, if you pair the right '?' with another left '?', and pair the left 'a' with a right 'a' (if available). But if there's no such right 'a', then the first option is better. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo Step 1: For all specific colors, pair as much as possible.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think. For each color c (from a-z), we can count the number of left boots with c, and the number of right boots with c. The number of pairs is min(left[c], right[c]). Then, subtract those from left and right counts. But how do we track which boots are used?\n\nWait, but the problem requires not just the count but also the actual pairs. So we need to track which left and right boots are used in these pairs.\n\nBut for the purpose of the algorithm, perhaps we can first process all specific color pairs, then process the '?'s.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of the following plan:\n\n- For each color c (not '?'), collect the indices of left boots with color c, and the indices of right boots with color c. Then, pair them up. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, pair the first 2 left 'a's with the first 2 right 'a's. The remaining left 'a's",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be part of at most one pair, and compatibility is determined by specific colors matching exactly or a question mark ('?') matching any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors**: First, we pair left and right boots that have the same specific color. For each color (excluding '?'), we count the occurrences on both left and right sides and pair them up.\n2. **Handle Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots with question marks. We use these wildcards to pair with remaining specific colors and other question marks. This involves:\n   - Pairing left question marks with right specific colors.\n   - Pairing right question marks with left specific colors.\n   - Pairing remaining question marks with each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l_str = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r_str = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read all test cases\n    test_cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        l_str = input[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        r_str = input[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        test_cases.append((n, l_str, r_str))\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, l_str, r_str = case\n        l = list(l_str)\n        r = list(r_str)\n        \n        left_pairs = []\n        right_pairs = []\n        used_left = [False] * n\n        used_right = [False] * n\n        \n        # Step 1: Pair same specific colors\n        color_count_l = defaultdict(list)\n        color_count_r = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if l[i] != '?':\n                color_count_l[l[i]].append(i)\n        for i in range(n):\n            if r[i] != '?':\n                color_count_r[r[i]].append(i)\n        \n        # For each color, pair as much as possible\n        for c in color_count_l:\n            if c in color_count_r:\n                left_list = color_count_l[c]\n                right_list = color_count_r[c]\n                min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n                for i in range(min_len):\n                    left_idx = left_list[i]\n                    right_idx = right_list[i]\n                    left_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n                    used_left[left_idx] = True\n                    used_right[right_idx] = True\n        \n        # Now collect remaining left and right boots\n        left_q = []\n        right_q = []\n        left_spec = []\n        right_spec = []\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if not used_left[i]:\n                if l[i] == '?':\n                    left_q.append(i)\n                else:\n                    left_spec.append(i)\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not used_right[i]:\n                if r[i] == '?':\n                    right_q.append(i)\n                else:\n                    right_spec.append(i)\n        \n        # Step 2: Pair left ? with right spec\n        # For each right spec, find a left ?\n        for i in range(len(right_spec)):\n            r_idx = right_spec[i]\n            if r[r_idx] != '?':\n                for j in range(len(left_q)):\n                    if not used_left[left_q[j]]:\n                        left_pairs.append((left_q[j], r_idx))\n                        used_left[left_q[j]] = True\n                        used_right[r_idx] = True\n                        break\n        \n        # Step 3: Pair right ? with left spec\n        for i in range(len(left_spec)):\n            l_idx = left_spec[i]\n            if l[l_idx] != '?':\n                for j in range(len(right_q)):\n                    if not used_right[right_q[j]]:\n                        left_pairs.append((l_idx, right_q[j]))\n                        used_left[l_idx] = True\n                        used_right[right_q[j]] = True\n                        break\n        \n        # Step 4: Pair remaining ? with ?\n        left_q_remaining = []\n        right_q_remaining = []\n        for i in range(len(left_q)):\n            if not used_left[left_q[i]]:\n                left_q_remaining.append(left_q[i])\n        for i in range(len(right_q)):\n            if not used_right[right_q[i]]:\n                right_q_remaining.append(right_q[i])\n        \n        min_len = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining))\n        for i in range(min_len):\n            left_pairs.append((left_q_remaining[i], right_q_remaining[i]))\n        \n        # Output\n        print(len(left_pairs))\n        for a, b in left_pairs:\n            print(a + 1, b + 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into individual test cases.\n2. **Color Counting**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), indices of left and right boots are collected.\n3. **Specific Color Pairs**: Left and right boots with the same specific color are paired first.\n4. **Handling Question Marks**: Remaining question marks are used to pair with specific colors and each other to maximize the number of compatible pairs.\n5. **Output**: The results for each test case are printed, including the number of pairs and their indices.",
