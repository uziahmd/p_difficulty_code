Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's think about the approach.\n\nThe problem says that we have n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a letter or a question mark. We need to pair them such that each pair is compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs and output them.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Let's think about the compatibility rules. Two colors are compatible if they are the same (if both are letters) or if one is a question mark. So, for example, a left boot with 'a' can pair with a right boot with 'a' or '?'. A left boot with '?' can pair with any right boot, regardless of its color.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can process the pairs in a way that matches specific colors first, then use the question marks as wildcards.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. For each color c, the number of possible pairs is min(left[c], right[c]). But since each boot can be used once, we need to assign these pairs first.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used to fill in gaps. So maybe the approach is:\n\n- First, pair up all the specific colors (non-?) where possible. For example, for each color c, match left[c] and right[c], and take as many as possible. But how to do this without overlapping?\n\nBut since each boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are already used.\n\nBut considering that the problem allows for any pairing as long as the constraints are met, perhaps we can proceed in steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair specific colors. For each color c (a-z), pair left boots with color c with right boots with color c. We can do this by taking all possible pairs. But how to track which ones are used?\n\nBut for this, perhaps we can create two dictionaries: left_count and right_count, which track the number of each color. Then, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). However, this might not account for overlaps, but perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nBut wait, this is not sufficient because the actual positions matter. For example, suppose there are multiple left boots of color 'a' and multiple right boots of color 'a'. We need to pair them, but how to track which ones are used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first process the non-? colors and pair them, then use the ?s to pair with remaining boots.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: For each position, we can try to pair left and right boots. But with n up to 150000, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, collect all the left boots that are not '?', and same for the right. Then, for each color, match the left and right boots of that color. Once those are matched, the remaining left and right boots (including the ?s) can be paired using the ?s as wildcards.\n\nBut how to handle the ?s. For example, after matching specific colors, the remaining ?s can be used to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Create two lists: left_non_q and right_non_q, which are the positions of left and right boots that are not '?'. Also, collect the counts of each color in left and right, excluding ?.\n\nBut perhaps more precise steps:\n\n- For each color c (a-z), collect the list of indices in left and right where the color is c. Then, for each c, pair as many as possible between left[c] and right[c]. For example, if there are 3 left boots of color 'a' and 5 right boots of color 'a', we can pair 3 of them. Then, the left boots are used up, and the right boots have 2 left.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Well, perhaps we can process each color, and for each, pair the left and right boots. For example, for each color c, iterate through the left and right lists for c, and pair them. But how to do that in code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a greedy approach. For each color c, we can take the minimum between the number of left and right boots of color c. Then, subtract that from both counts. Then, the remaining left and right boots (including those with ?) can be paired using the ?s.\n\nBut again, how to track which specific boots are used. Because the problem requires us to output the actual indices of the pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are",
    "response": "To solve the \"Colored Boots\" problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color (a-z) or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The goal is to pair each left boot with a right boot such that their colors are compatible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Color Matching**: First, we match boots of the same specific color. For each color from 'a' to 'z', we pair as many left boots with the same color as right boots.\n2. **Wildcard Matching**: After handling specific colors, we use the '?' (wildcard) boots to pair with any remaining boots. This includes both remaining specific color boots and other wildcard boots.\n3. **Tracking Used Boots**: We maintain sets to track which boots have already been paired to ensure each boot is used at most once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    left_pairs = []\n    right_pairs = []\n    \n    # For each color, store the indices of left and right boots\n    left_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    # Also collect the positions of non-question mark boots\n    left_non_q = []\n    right_non_q = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n            left_non_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_color_map['?'].append(i)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n            right_non_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            right_color_map['?'].append(i)\n    \n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    \n    # For each color except '?', pair left and right\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_list = left_color_map.get(c, [])\n        right_list = right_color_map.get(c, [])\n        min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(min_len):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            if left_idx not in used_left and right_idx not in used_right:\n                left_pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                used_left.add(left_idx)\n                used_right.add(right_idx)\n    \n    # Step 2: Pair ? with remaining non-? boots\n    # Collect remaining left and right boots\n    remaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if i not in used_left]\n    remaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if i not in used_right]\n    \n    # Create lists of remaining left and right non-? boots\n    rem_left_non_q = [i for i in remaining_left if l[i] != '?']\n    rem_right_non_q = [i for i in remaining_right if r[i] != '?']\n    \n    # Pair ? left with non-? right\n    for i in range(len(rem_left_non_q)):\n        left_idx = rem_left_non_q[i]\n        if l[left_idx] == '?':\n            for j in range(len(rem_right_non_q)):\n                right_idx = rem_right_non_q[j]\n                if r[right_idx] != '?':\n                    if left_idx not in used_left and right_idx not in used_right:\n                        left_pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                        used_left.add(left_idx)\n                        used_right.add(right_idx)\n                        break\n    \n    # Pair ? right with non-? left\n    for i in range(len(rem_right_non_q)):\n        right_idx = rem_right_non_q[i]\n        if r[right_idx] == '?':\n            for j in range(len(rem_left_non_q)):\n                left_idx = rem_left_non_q[j]\n                if l[left_idx] != '?':\n                    if left_idx not in used_left and right_idx not in used_right:\n                        left_pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                        used_left.add(left_idx)\n                        used_right.add(right_idx)\n                        break\n    \n    # Step 3: Pair ? with ?\n    rem_left_q = [i for i in remaining_left if l[i] == '?']\n    rem_right_q = [i for i in remaining_right if r[i] == '?']\n    \n    min_len = min(len(rem_left_q), len(rem_right_q))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        left_idx = rem_left_q[i]\n        right_idx = rem_right_q[i]\n        if left_idx not in used_left and right_idx not in used_right:\n            left_pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n            used_left.add(left_idx)\n            used_right.add(right_idx)\n    \n    print(len(left_pairs))\n    for pair in left_pairs:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Color Mapping**: We map each color (including '?') to the indices of the left and right boots.\n3. **Specific Color Matching**: For each color from 'a' to 'z', we pair left and right boots of the same color.\n4. **Wildcard Matching**: After handling specific colors, we use '?' boots to pair with remaining non-'?' boots and then pair remaining '?' boots with each other.\n5. **Output**: The number of pairs and their indices are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently, considering both specific and wildcard colors.",
