The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints, and we need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach starting from 0, without ever stepping outside the interval [0, x]. The frog can jump either +a or -b from its current position. But importantly, during any jump, the frog can't land on a position outside [0, x]. So, for each x, we need to find all positions reachable under these constraints.\n\nThe challenge is that m can be up to 1e9, which means we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need a mathematical approach to find a pattern or formula that allows us to calculate the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: When the frog can't make any jumps. For example, if a is larger than x, and b is larger than x. But since the frog starts at 0, maybe when a is larger than x, the frog can't jump forward. Similarly, if the frog can't jump backward (since 0 - b would be negative, but that's outside the allowed range). So in such cases, the frog can't move, so f(x) = 1 (only 0).\n\nBut in the third example given, a=100000, b=1, and m=100. Since a is 100000, which is way bigger than m=100, the frog can't make any forward jumps. Also, since b=1, the frog could jump back from 0, but that would take it to -1, which is outside [0, x], so no. So the frog can't move at all. Hence, for all x in 0 to 100, f(x) is 1. The sum is 101, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is whether the frog can actually move. If a and b are such that the frog can't make any moves (like when a > x and b > x), then f(x) is 1.\n\nBut when can the frog move? Well, the frog can make jumps as long as the landing position is within [0, x].\n\nNow, the key is to find for each x, the set of positions reachable by the frog under the constraints. But how?\n\nLet me think about the movement. The frog can add a or subtract b. So the positions reachable are those that can be expressed as some combination of adding a's and subtracting b's. But with the constraint that during the process, all positions are within [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a linear Diophantine equation. However, since the frog can make multiple steps, the problem is similar to finding all numbers that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, but also ensuring that during the path, the frog doesn't go outside [0, x].\n\nWait, but the problem is not just about the final position, but also the path. For example, even if you can reach a certain position through some sequence of jumps, but during that sequence, the frog might have stepped outside the allowed interval. So that position isn't counted unless there's a way to reach it without violating the constraints.\n\nThis seems complex. How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions that can be reached are those that are congruent to 0 modulo d, where d is the GCD of a and b. Because the frog's movements are combinations of a and b. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me think of the case where the frog can move freely. For example, if a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of their GCD (which is 1), but only if they can reach it through some combination. However, the constraints of not going out of [0, x] complicates things.\n\nBut perhaps, for large enough x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d, where d is the GCD of a and b. Let's suppose that d is the GCD of a and b. Then, any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Because each jump adds or subtracts multiples of d. So, the positions reachable are in the form of k*d, where k is an integer. But again, the constraints of not stepping outside [0, x] must be considered.\n\nBut for small x, the frog might not be able to reach all multiples of d within [0, x]. For example, in the first sample input: a=5, b=3. The GCD of 5 and 3 is 1. So theoretically, the frog can reach any integer once x is large enough. However, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5 (by jumping +a once). But can it reach 2? Let's see.\n\nWait, the frog starts at 0. To reach 2, perhaps via some combination. Let's think: 0 +5 =5, then from 5, subtract 3 to get 2. That's allowed if x is at least 5. So for x=5, the frog can reach 2. But in the first sample, f(5) is 3. The positions are 0, 5, 2. Wait, but according to the note, f(5) is 3, which includes 0, 5, 2. Then for x=5, the frog can reach those positions.\n\nSo, the idea is that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d (where d is GCD(a,b)), and also within [0, x]. However, the problem is determining for a given x, how many such positions are reachable.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about the conditions under which the frog can reach a certain position. Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Let's assume that a and b are positive integers.\n\nLet me consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that x is large enough. However, the problem is that even if the position is a multiple of d, the frog might not be able to reach it if it requires steps that take it outside the [0, x] range during the jumps.\n\nBut perhaps for x >= some value, the frog can reach all multiples of d between 0 and x. Then, for x less than that value, the number of reachable positions is less.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\n- Find the minimal x_min such that for all x >= x_min, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nOnce x is larger than x_min, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1 (since 0 is included). But wait, that's assuming that all multiples of d between 0 and x are reachable. However, this might not be the case. For example, if a and b are such that the frog can't reach certain multiples of d because of the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is reachable via some combination of a and b steps, and that the path to reach it does not require going beyond x.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of the ability to reach a certain position. For example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a (if that's within [0, x]), or k - b (if that's within [0, x]).\n\nBut this seems like a BFS problem. However, for large x (up to 1e9), we can't simulate this for each x.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find for each x, the number of positions that are multiples of d and can be reached, considering the constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's first compute d = gcd(a, b). If d is not 1, then all positions must be multiples of d. So, the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of d. Let me think of the problem in terms of dividing everything by d. Let's define a' = a /d, b' = b/d. Now, a' and b' are coprime.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to the case where a and b are coprime. Because the original positions are multiples of d, and the problem becomes equivalent to a frog that can jump a' or -b', and the positions are multiples of d. So, the problem can be transformed into solving for a' and b' coprime, and then multiplying the count by d.\n\nWait, but maybe this is a way to simplify the problem. Let me proceed with this approach.\n\nLet me suppose that d = gcd(a, b). Let's divide a and b by d. Now, the new a' and b' are coprime. The positions reachable by the frog are multiples of d. So, for each x, the number of positions is equal to the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are reachable by the frog using a' and b'.\n\nSo, the problem now is to find for each x, the number of positions k*d (for integer k) that can be reached by the frog, given that the frog can jump +a' or -b', and that during the jumps, the frog never steps outside [0, x/d], since the original x is divided by d. Wait, no. Because the original x is the upper bound. So, the original positions are k*d, and they must lie in [0, x]. So, k*d must be between 0 and x. Therefore, k can be between 0 and floor(x/d). However, the frog's movement in terms of the transformed variables (a' and b') would have to be such that the positions are in [0, x/d] *d. Wait, perhaps the transformed problem is that the frog can jump +a' or -b' steps, but the positions must be in [0, x/d] *d. However, the frog's movement in terms of the transformed variables is such that each jump adds a' or subtracts b'. So, the problem reduces to the same problem with a' and b' coprime, and x' = floor(x/d). Then, the number of positions reachable is the number of positions reachable in the transformed problem multiplied by 1 (since each position in the transformed problem corresponds to a unique position in the original problem). \n\nTherefore, the problem can be simplified by first computing d = gcd(a, b), and then solving the problem for a' = a/d, b' = b/d, and then considering x' = floor(x/d). However, the original problem's x is up to 1e9, so this approach may help reduce the problem to the case where a and b are coprime.\n\nBut how does that help us?\n\nSo, the main problem is now to find, for the transformed a and b (coprime), the number of positions reachable in the transformed problem (positions are integers, not multiples of d anymore) under the constraint that during jumps, the frog never steps outside [0, x'] where x' = floor(x/d). Then, the total number of positions in the original problem is equal to the number found in the transformed problem.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to solving for a and b coprime, and for x', find the number of positions reachable.\n\nSo, let's focus on the case where a and b are coprime. Let's think about this scenario.\n\nIn this case, the frog can reach any integer that is a linear combination of a and b, but again, with the constraints on the path.\n\nBut since a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any integer greater than or equal to (a*b - a - b) + something? Wait, perhaps not directly. But the problem here is that the frog can only jump forward by a or backward by b. However, the frog can't go below zero, and can't exceed x'.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find for each x', the maximum number of positions that can be reached. Let me think about the possible positions.\n\nLet me consider that the frog starts at 0. From 0, it can jump to a (if a <= x'). From a, it can jump to a + a, or a - b (if a - b >=0). But the problem is that the frog can make multiple steps, and the path must stay within [0, x'].\n\nBut for large x', the frog can reach all positions that are >= (some value) and are congruent to 0 mod gcd(a, b), but since a and b are coprime, all integers. Wait, but since the frog can add a and subtract b, then any integer can be formed as a linear combination. However, the problem is that the frog can't go negative, so the actual reachable positions depend on the ability to reach them through sequences of jumps without going below zero or above x'.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that during the process of reaching that position, all intermediate positions are within [0, x'].\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps for sufficiently large x', the frog can reach all positions >= some value. For example, the classic coin problem where with coins of denominations a and b (coprime), the largest amount that cannot be formed is a*b -a -b. But in our case, the frog can use both additions and subtractions, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as being able to reach any position that is a multiple of gcd(a, b) (which is 1 in this case) once x is large enough. But again, the constraints on the path complicate this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent the possible jumps. Then, the reachable positions from 0 are those that can be reached in this graph. But for x' up to 1e9, we can't compute this for every x'.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nLet me think of the problem when a and b are coprime. Let's suppose that the frog can reach all positions from some value onwards. For example, if x' is large enough, then the frog can reach all positions in [0, x'].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose a=5, b=3 (coprime). Let's say x' is 5. Then the frog can reach 0, 5, and 5-3=2. From 2, it can jump to 2+5=7 (but x'=5, so that's not allowed), or 2-3=-1 (invalid). So, only 0, 2, 5. So for x'=5, the count is 3. But if x' is 7, then from 2, the frog can jump to 7 (allowed), and from 5, it can jump to 5-3=2 (already counted) or 5+5=10 (if x' is 7, then 10 is invalid). So, with x'=7, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5, 7. Then, from 7, you can subtract 3 to get 4. So 4 is added. Then from 4, add 5 to get 9 (invalid), subtract 3 to get 1. So 1 is added. From 1, add 5 to get 6 (allowed). So 6 is added. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. From 3, add 5 to get 8 (invalid), subtract 3 to get 0. So now we have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. All positions from 0 to 7 except 8 (but x'=7). So for x'=7, the count is 8, which matches the first sample (f(7) = 8). \n\nSo, when x' is large enough (in this case, 7), the frog can reach all positions from 0 up to x'. So, the number of reachable positions is x'+1. But how to find when this becomes true?\n\nIn the first sample, for x'=7, the frog can reach all positions. But for x'=5, it can't reach 1, 3, 4, 6, 7. So, the question is: what is the minimal x' such that for any x' >= this value, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x'?\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of the \"Frobenius number\", but with different constraints. However, since the frog can both add and subtract, the problem is different.\n\nIn the example above, once the frog can reach a position that allows it to generate all numbers up to x' through adding and subtracting steps, then all positions are reachable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps once x' is >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions. Or some other threshold.\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For the case where a and b are coprime, the minimal x' such that all positions from 0 to x' are reachable is (a-1)*(b-1). Wait, that's the Frobenius number. But in the Frobenius problem, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination with non-negative coefficients. However, in our case, the frog can subtract as well, so perhaps the threshold is lower.\n\nIn the example above, a=5, b=3. Frobenius number is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. But in our case, when x'=7, all positions are reachable. Which is exactly the Frobenius number. Interesting.\n\nSo, perhaps for the case when a and b are coprime, once x' is >= (a*b -a -b), then the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x'. Wait, but in our example, when x'=7, which equals the Frobenius number, the frog can reach all positions. Let's check another example. Suppose a=3, b=2 (coprime). Frobenius number is 3*2 -3 -2 = 1. So for x'=1, can the frog reach all positions from 0 to 1?\n\nStarting at 0, the frog can jump to 3 (if x' is 1, which it's not). So for x'=1, the frog can only reach 0. So the threshold must be higher than the Frobenius number. Hmm, that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up two different problems. In the Frobenius problem, the frog can only add steps (i.e., can't subtract). Here, the frog can both add and subtract. So the situation is different.\n\nLet me think again. For a=3 and b=2 (coprime). What is the minimal x' such that all positions from 0 to x' are reachable?\n\nLet's see:\n\nAt x'=0: only 0.\n\nx'=1: 0 is reachable. Can't reach 1. So count is 1.\n\nx'=2: from 0, can jump to 3 (invalid) or -2 (invalid). So only 0. So count 1.\n\nx'=3: can jump to 3. So positions 0, 3. Count is 2.\n\nx'=4: from 3, can jump to 3+3=6 (invalid) or 3-2=1. So 1 is added. From 0, can jump to 3. So positions 0,1,3. Count 3.\n\nx'=5: from 1, can jump to 1+3=4 (allowed), or 1-2=-1 (invalid). So 4 is added. From 3, can jump to 3-2=1 (already there) or 3+3=6 (invalid). From 0, can reach 3. So positions 0,1,3,4. Count is 4.\n\nx'=5, but can we reach 2? Let's see. Starting from 0, can we reach 2?\n\nPossible steps: 0 → 3 → 3-2=1 → 1+3=4 → 4-2=2. Yes. So for x'=5, the frog can reach 2. But how?\n\nWait, the path is 0 →3 (allowed), then 3 →1 (allowed, since x'=5 ≥1), then 1 →4 (allowed), then 4 →2 (allowed). So yes. So for x'=5, the positions are 0,1,2,3,4. What about 5?\n\nFrom 4, can we jump to 4+3=7 (invalid) or 4-2=2. So no. From 3, can we jump to 3+3=6 (invalid) or 3-2=1. So no. How to reach 5?\n\nAlternative path: 0 →3 →3+3=6 (invalid). No. So 5 is not reachable. So for x'=5, the count is 5 positions (0,1,2,3,4). But 5 is not reachable. Then, what about x'=6?\n\nFrom 4, can we reach 4+3=7 (invalid). From 2, can we jump to 2+3=5 (allowed, since x'=6 ≥5). So yes. So 5 is added. Then, from 5, can we jump to 5-2=3 (already present) or 5+3=8 (invalid). So now, positions are 0,1,2,3,4,5. Can we reach 6?\n\nFrom 5, jump to 5+3=8 (invalid). From 3, jump to 3+3=6 (allowed). So yes. So 6 is added. Now, positions 0-6 except none missing. So for x'=6, all positions are reachable. \n\nSo in this case, the threshold is x'=6, which is higher than the Frobenius number of 1.\n\nSo, what's the pattern here? It seems that once x' is large enough, the frog can reach all positions. But how to find that threshold?\n\nAnother approach: For the case where a and b are coprime, the frog can reach all positions >= some value. Let's call this value T. Once x' >= T, then all positions from 0 to x' are reachable. So, the problem reduces to finding T, and then for x' < T, we need to compute the number of reachable positions manually.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is the maximum between a and b. Or a + b. Or something else.\n\nIn the previous example with a=3, b=2, T was 6. Which is a*b. Hmm, 3*2=6. Another example: a=5, b=3. Earlier example had T=7 (which is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7, the Frobenius number). But in that case, for x'=7, all positions are reachable. So perhaps T is the Frobenius number plus something?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. Once the frog can reach all positions from 0 to a + b -1, then it can reach all positions beyond that. Because for any position >= a + b, you can subtract b until you reach a position in the range [a, a + b -1], then add a to reach the desired position. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a BFS. For a and b coprime, the frog can reach any position once it can reach all positions in the range [0, a + b -1]. But how to verify this.\n\nLet me take the previous example with a=3, b=2. The positions from 0 to 4 (a + b -1 = 3 + 2 -1 =4) were not all reachable until x'=5. Wait, but in that example, at x'=5, the frog could reach 0,1,2,3,4, but not 5. Then, at x'=6, it could reach 5 and 6. So perhaps the threshold is a + b -1.\n\nBut in the first example with a=5, b=3, a + b -1 = 7. And for x'=7, the frog can reach all positions. So that seems to fit.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=2. a + b -1 =4. But for x'=4, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, earlier analysis said that for x'=4, the positions are 0,1,3,4. But I thought that 2 could be reached. Let me recheck that.\n\nIn the case of x'=4, can the frog reach 2?\n\nYes. Let's see: 0 →3 →1 →4 →2. But wait, during this path, the frog jumps from 4 to 2 (4-2=2). But x'=4 allows that. So yes, 2 is reachable. So for x'=4, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4. So all positions. Then why earlier analysis said that for x'=5, the frog couldn't reach 5?\n\nAh, because for x'=5, the frog can reach 5 by jumping from 2 (which is reachable) to 2 +3=5. So for x'=5, the frog can reach 5. But earlier analysis said that for x'=5, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5. So why did I think that 5 wasn't reachable before?\n\nMaybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nFor x'=5, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5. Because:\n\n- 0 →3 (allowed, since 3 ≤5).\n\n- 3 →1 (allowed, since 1 ≤5).\n\n- 1 →4 (allowed, since 4 ≤5).\n\n- 4 →2 (allowed, since 2 ≤5).\n\n- 2 →5 (allowed, since 5 ≤5).\n\nSo yes, 5 is reachable. Then, for x'=5, all positions are reachable. So in this case, T is a + b -1 = 4. For x'=4, all positions are reachable. Then why did I think that for x'=4, the frog couldn't reach 2? Probably a mistake in my earlier analysis.\n\nSo perhaps the correct threshold is a + b -1. Once x' >= a + b -1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x'.\n\nIf this holds, then for any x' >= a + b -1, the number of reachable positions is x' + 1. For x' < a + b -1, we need to compute the count manually.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the case when a and b are coprime:\n\n- For x' < (a + b -1), compute the number of reachable positions via BFS or some other method.\n\n- For x' >= (a + b -1), the number of reachable positions is x' + 1.\n\nBut how to compute the number of reachable positions for x' < (a + b -1)?\n\nBut given that a and b can be up to 1e5, and m up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to compute this. However, since the threshold is a + b -1, which is up to 2e5, we can precompute for all x' up to this threshold the number of reachable positions, and then for larger x', use the formula.\n\nSo, the overall approach for the problem would be:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b). Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\n2. If a' and b' are both zero (but since a and b are positive integers, this can't happen). So, proceed.\n\n3. Now, the problem is to compute for each x, the number of positions reachable in the transformed problem (with a' and b' coprime), and then multiply by 1 (since each position corresponds to a multiple of d in the original problem).\n\nBut wait, the original x is divided by d. So, for the original x, the transformed x' is floor(x / d). So, for each original x, we compute x' = floor(x / d), and then compute the number of positions in the transformed problem (with a' and b') for x', and then that's the value of f(x) in the original problem.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor the given m, we need to compute sum_{x=0}^m f(x), where f(x) is the number of reachable positions in the original problem.\n\nBut f(x) is equal to the number of reachable positions in the transformed problem (with a' and b') for x' = floor(x/d), multiplied by 1 (since each position in the transformed problem corresponds to one in the original problem).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute for the transformed a' and b' (coprime), for each x' from 0 up to floor(m/d), the number of reachable positions, and then multiply each by 1, and sum over x' = 0 to floor(m/d), multiplied by the number of original x's that map to each x'.\n\nWait, but for each x' in the transformed problem, there are multiple original x's that map to it. For example, original x can be in the range [d * x', d*(x'+1) - 1]. So, for each x' in the transformed problem, the number of original x's that map to it is (d*(x'+1) -1) - d*x' + 1 = d. Except possibly for the last x'.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, and d can be up to 1e5, the maximum x' is floor(m/d), which is up to 1e9 / 1 = 1e9. But if a' and b' are coprime, then for x' >= a' + b' -1, the number of reachable positions is x' + 1. However, if x' is up to 1e9, we can't process each x' individually. So we need to find a way to compute the sum over x' in the transformed problem, for x' from 0 to X_max = floor(m/d), of the number of reachable positions for x'.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think again. For the transformed problem (coprime a' and b'), the sum over x' from 0 to X_max of reachable_count(x').\n\nWe can split this sum into two parts:\n\n1. For x' < T, where T = a' + b' -1. For these x', we need to compute reachable_count(x') and sum them.\n\n2. For x' >= T, reachable_count(x') = x' + 1.\n\nSo, the sum is sum_{x'=0}^{min(X_max, T-1)} reachable_count(x') + sum_{x'=max(T, 0)}^{X_max} (x' + 1).\n\nBut how to compute reachable_count(x') for x' < T?\n\nSince T is up to 2e5 (since a' and b' are up to 1e5), we can precompute reachable_count(x') for x' from 0 to T-1 using BFS or dynamic programming.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the transformed problem (a' and b' coprime):\n\n- Precompute reachable_count[x'] for x' from 0 to T-1, where T = a' + b' -1.\n\nThen, for the sum:\n\nsum_part1 = sum_{x'=0}^{min(X_max, T-1)} reachable_count[x']\n\nsum_part2 = sum_{x'=max(T, 0)}^{X_max} (x' + 1)\n\nBut how to compute sum_part2?\n\nThe sum from x'=A to B of (x' + 1) is sum_{k=A+1}^{B+1} k = sum_{k= A+1}^{B+1} k = (B+1)(B+2)/2 - A(A+1)/2.\n\nSo, we can compute this with a formula.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the sum_part1 and sum_part2.\n\nNow, for the original problem, the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x) is equal to the sum over x' from 0 to X_max (where X_max = floor(m/d)) of (number of x's that map to x') * reachable_count(x').\n\nWait, no. Because for each x in the original problem, it maps to x' = floor(x/d). So, for each x' in the transformed problem, the number of original x's that map to x' is:\n\ncount_x' = min(d*(x'+1) - 1, m) - d*x' + 1.\n\nBut this depends on whether d*(x'+1)-1 is <= m or not.\n\nSo, for example, if x' is such that d*x' <= m < d*(x'+1), then the count_x' is m - d*x' + 1.\n\nOtherwise, it's d.\n\nSo, for each x' in the transformed problem, the contribution to the sum is count_x' * reachable_count(x').\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think. Let X_max = floor(m / d). For x' from 0 to X_max:\n\nif x' < X_max:\n\nthen the original x's that map to x' are d*x' to d*(x'+1) -1. So, count_x' = d.\n\nBut if x' == X_max, then the original x's are d*x' to m. So count_x' = m - d*x' + 1.\n\nThus, the total contribution for each x' is:\n\nif x' < X_max: d * reachable_count(x')\n\nif x' == X_max: (m - d*x' + 1) * reachable_count(x')\n\nSo, the overall sum is:\n\nsum_{x'=0}^{X_max} (contribution for x').\n\nBut how to compute this sum.\n\nSo, the problem is to compute:\n\nsum_contribution = sum_{x'=0}^{X_max} [ (if x' < X_max then d else (m -d*x' +1 )) ] * reachable_count(x').\n\nBut to compute this, we need to know reachable_count(x') for x' up to X_max.\n\nBut X_max can be up to 1e9 / 1 = 1e9, which is impossible to compute for each x' directly. However, for x' >= T, reachable_count(x') is x' +1.\n\nSo, we can split the sum_contribution into:\n\nsum_contribution = sum_{x'=0}^{min(X_max, T-1)} [ ... ] * reachable_count(x') + sum_{x'=T}^{X_max} [ ... ] * (x' + 1).\n\nBut how to compute the second part.\n\nLet me split it into two parts:\n\nFor x' in [T, X_max], the contribution is:\n\nif x' < X_max: d * (x' +1)\n\nif x' == X_max: (m -d*x' +1) * (x' +1)\n\nSo, the sum for this part is:\n\nsum_{x'=T}^{X_max-1} d*(x'+1) + (if X_max >= T then (m -d*X_max +1) * (X_max +1) else 0 )\n\nBut how to compute this sum.\n\nLet me compute the sum from x'=T to x'=X_max of [contribution].\n\nLet me denote:\n\nlow = T\n\nhigh = X_max\n\nif high < low: then no contribution.\n\nElse:\n\nsum_part = sum_{x'=low}^{high} contribution(x').\n\nWhere contribution(x') is:\n\nif x' < X_max: d*(x'+1)\n\nelse: (m -d*x' +1) * (x'+1)\n\nSo, this can be split into two parts:\n\nsum1 = sum_{x'=low}^{high-1} d*(x'+1) if high > low.\n\nsum2 = if high == X_max then (m -d*high +1) * (high +1) else 0.\n\nSo, sum_part = sum1 + sum2.\n\nNow, sum1 is d multiplied by the sum of (x'+1) from x'=low to x'=high-1.\n\nThe sum of (x'+1) from x'=a to x'=b is sum_{k=a+1}^{b+1} k = (b+1)(b+2)/2 - a(a+1)/2.\n\nSo, sum1 = d * [ ( (high) * (high +1) ) / 2 - ( (low) * (low +1) ) / 2 ) ] ?\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nsum_{x'=a}^{b} (x' + 1) = sum_{k = a+1}^{b+1} k = [ (b+1)(b+2)/2 ] - [ a(a+1)/2 ].\n\nSo, for sum1, a = low",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to m. The solution involves understanding the movement patterns of the frog and efficiently calculating the required values using mathematical insights.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either +a or -b. The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.\n2. **Transforming the Problem**: By dividing both a and b by their GCD, we reduce the problem to a simpler case where a and b are coprime. This allows us to focus on positions that are multiples of the GCD.\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: For coprime a and b, once the frog can reach up to a certain threshold (a + b - 1), it can reach all subsequent positions. This threshold helps in splitting the problem into manageable parts.\n4. **Efficient Summation**: Using precomputed values for positions below the threshold and mathematical formulas for positions beyond the threshold, we efficiently compute the required sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    def compute_sum(m, a, b):\n        d = math.gcd(a, b)\n        a_prime = a // d\n        b_prime = b // d\n\n        if a_prime == 0 and b_prime == 0:\n            return m + 1  # but this case is impossible since a and b are positive\n\n        # Now handle the transformed problem with a' and b' coprime\n        T = a_prime + b_prime - 1\n\n        # Precompute reachable_count for x' from 0 to T-1\n        max_x_prime_part1 = T - 1\n        reachable = [0] * (T)\n        visited = [False] * (T)\n\n        from collections import deque\n        q = deque()\n        q.append(0)\n        visited[0] = True\n        reachable[0] = 1\n\n        while q:\n            current = q.popleft()\n            for delta in [a_prime, -b_prime]:\n                next_pos = current + delta\n                if 0 <= next_pos < T and not visited[next_pos]:\n                    visited[next_pos] = True\n                    reachable[next_pos] = reachable[current] + 1\n                    q.append(next_pos)\n\n        # Now compute sum_contribution\n        X_max = m // d\n        sum_contribution = 0\n\n        # Part 1: x' from 0 to min(X_max, T-1)\n        upper_part1 = min(X_max, T - 1)\n        for x_prime in range(0, upper_part1 + 1):\n            if x_prime < X_max:\n                cnt = d\n            else:\n                cnt = m - d * x_prime + 1\n            sum_contribution += cnt * reachable[x_prime]\n\n        # Part 2: x' from T to X_max\n        if T <= X_max:\n            # Compute sum1: sum_{x'=T}^{X_max -1} d*(x' +1)\n            # and sum2: if X_max >= T, add (m -d*X_max +1)*(X_max +1)\n            low = T\n            high = X_max\n            sum1 = 0\n            if low <= high - 1:\n                # sum from x'=low to x'=high-1 of (x'+1)\n                # which is sum from k=low+1 to high\n                sum_k = (high * (high + 1) // 2) - (low * (low + 1) // 2)\n                sum1 = d * sum_k\n            sum2 = 0\n            if high == X_max:\n                term = (m - d * high + 1) * (high + 1)\n                sum2 = term\n            sum_contribution += sum1 + sum2\n\n        return sum_contribution\n\n    result = compute_sum(m, a, b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **GCD Calculation**: The problem is simplified by dividing both a and b by their GCD, reducing the problem to handling coprime values.\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For positions below the threshold (a + b - 1), BFS is used to precompute reachable positions.\n3. **Mathematical Summation**: For positions beyond the threshold, mathematical formulas are used to efficiently compute the sum without iterating through each value individually, ensuring the solution handles large inputs efficiently.",
