    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't go outside [0, x] for each f(x). We need to find the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without ever stepping outside [0, x]. So, the frog can make any sequence of jumps as long as all intermediate positions are within [0, x]. \n\nLet me think about the possible positions. The frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a's and subtracting b's, but with constraints. But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x during any jump, the reachable positions depend on x. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mathematical way to model this. Let's consider the set of positions reachable by the frog without any constraints. That would be all positions that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that the position is non-negative. But with the constraints that during the jumps, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. \n\nBut how does the x constraint affect this? For example, if x is large enough, then maybe the frog can reach all positions that are in the set of possible positions (without constraints), but when x is small, some positions might not be reachable because the path to them would require stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think of it differently. Let's first find for a general x, which positions are reachable. Then, count them. \n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an O(1) or O(some small function) approach per test case. Brute-forcing for each x up to m is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula for f(x) based on certain conditions.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions. Since the frog starts at 0, and can add a or subtract b. But the key is that the frog can move forward (adding a) or backward (subtracting b). However, the backward move is only allowed if the current position is at least b. \n\nBut when considering all possible reachable positions, perhaps the positions are those that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b), but that's under the assumption that the frog can move freely. However, the constraints of not going outside [0, x] may complicate things. \n\nWait, but maybe the reachable positions without any constraints are all numbers of the form (a * k - b * l), where k and l are non-negative integers. And since the frog can move back and forth, maybe the reachable positions are those that are multiples of the gcd of a and b. Let me check. For example, suppose a and b are coprime. Then any integer can be expressed as a linear combination, but since k and l are non-negative, maybe not. But in this problem, the frog can reach positions that are achievable through sequences of jumps. For example, if a=5 and b=3, then the frog can reach 5, 5-3=2, then 2+5=7, etc. But perhaps the reachable positions are those numbers that are >= 0 and congruent to 0 mod gcd(a, b). \n\nBut how does that relate to the problem? Well, perhaps the key is that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = gcd(a, b), and is >= some value. But again, the constraints of not going outside [0, x] during the jumps may prevent reaching some positions even if they are in the set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given x, the reachable positions are all positions that are multiples of d and can be reached through some combination of a and b steps, and also are within [0, x], and also can be reached via a path that doesn't go beyond [0, x].\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 7 5 3. The output sum is 19. For example, f(5)=3. The positions are 0, 5, 5-3=2. So three positions. But for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. Wait, but how about 2+5=7? But that's beyond x=5, so the frog can't do that. So for x=5, the frog can't reach 7. So the positions are 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5)=3. For x=7, the frog can reach more positions. For example, 0, 5, 2, 7 (from 2+5), 7-3=4, 4+5=9 (but 9>7, so no), 4-3=1, 1+5=6, 6-3=3, etc. So for x=7, the positions are 0,2,5,7,4,1,6,3. That's 8 positions. Hence f(7)=8. \n\nSo the positions are those that can be formed by adding a's and subtracting b's, but ensuring that during the process, the frog never goes below 0 or above x. \n\nBut how to model this? It seems like for each x, the reachable positions are all positions that are multiples of d = gcd(a,b) and lie between 0 and x, and also satisfy some other condition. \n\nBut perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is within [0, x], and also can be written as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that during the jumps, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. However, figuring out which positions satisfy that seems difficult.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the reachable positions without any constraints. Let's say that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo d, where d = gcd(a, b). But since the frog can go back and forth, perhaps the positions are all numbers that are multiples of d, and are >= some minimal value. For example, when a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach all numbers >= (some value) that are multiples of 1 (so all numbers). But with constraints on the path.\n\nBut how does the x constraint affect this? For example, if x is large enough, then the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are between 0 and x. But for smaller x, maybe not all of them can be reached.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is that once x is large enough (like x >= a + b?), then the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are between 0 and x. But for smaller x, some positions may not be reachable. \n\nSo maybe the problem can be divided into two parts: positions where x is small (less than some threshold) and positions where x is large. \n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. Let's assume that d = gcd(a, b). Then all positions must be multiples of d. Let me define a' = a/d and b' = b/d. Now, since a' and b' are coprime. \n\nThe problem reduces to finding positions that are multiples of d, and can be reached by adding a's and subtracting b's. But since a and b are multiples of d, the positions are multiples of d. \n\nSo, for the rest of the problem, let's assume that a and b are coprime. Because if they are not, we can divide them by their gcd. \n\nSo, let me proceed under the assumption that a and b are coprime. \n\nNow, the frog can reach any position that is a non-negative integer, provided that it can be written as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because the frog can jump forward and backward. For example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can jump forward to k+a, or backward to k - b (if k >= b). \n\nBut the problem is that the frog can reach positions that are in the set S = {k | k = a * x - b * y, x, y >= 0}, and k >= 0. \n\nBut how to characterize this set S?\n\nIn the classic coin problem, the largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b (assuming coprime) is ab - a - b. But here, the situation is different because the frog can use both adding and subtracting steps, but the constraints are that during the jumps, the frog can't go negative or beyond x. \n\nBut perhaps for x large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (which is 1 here) and are >= 0. But that's not true. Because for example, if a=5 and b=3, then the frog can reach 0, 5, 2 (5-3), 7 (2+5), 4 (7-3), 9 (4+5), 1 (4-3), 6 (1+5), 3 (6-3), 8 (3+5), etc. So for any position >= 2, except maybe some numbers. Wait, for example, can the frog reach 1? Yes, as shown. What about 0? Yes. So for x >= 1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 upwards, except maybe some numbers. Wait, but in this case, the frog can reach any position >= 0. Because once you have positions like 1, 2, 3, etc., you can add a's to reach higher positions. \n\nWait, but how does the frog reach 1 in the first place? From 0, you can't subtract b (since 0 < b). So the only way is to add a steps and then subtract b steps. Like, for example, 5 - 3*2 = 5 - 6 = -1 (invalid). Not helpful. But 5 - 3 = 2. Then 2 +5 =7. Then 7-3=4. 4-3=1. So yes, the frog can reach 1. \n\nSo, for a=5 and b=3, the frog can reach any non-negative integer. Because once you can reach 1, then you can add 5s to reach any higher number. \n\nBut how does that fit with the classic coin problem? Because the classic problem is about making change with coins (so using only additions). Here, the frog can both add and subtract, but the constraints are that during the jumps, it can't go negative or beyond x. \n\nSo perhaps, for the case when a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any non-negative integer, provided that x is large enough. For example, once x is larger than some value, then all positions up to x can be reached. But for smaller x, some positions may not be reachable. \n\nBut how to model this. Let's think for the case where a and b are coprime. \n\nLet me think about the minimal steps required to reach a certain position. \n\nSuppose the frog wants to reach position k. How can it do that? \n\nIt can reach k by making some number of forward jumps (adding a) and backward jumps (subtracting b), but ensuring that during the entire path, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternative approach: For a given x, the reachable positions are all numbers that can be written as k = (a * p - b * q), where p and q are non-negative integers, and during the process of building up k, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. \n\nBut how to model that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x >= (a + b), the frog can reach all positions that are non-negative and <=x. Because once x is large enough, the frog can reach any position. \n\nFor example, in the first sample input, when x=7, which is larger than a=5 and b=3, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. All numbers from 0 to 7 except maybe some. Wait, but 0 to 7 includes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. All 8 numbers. Which matches the sample's f(7)=8. \n\nSo for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x. \n\nBut wait, in the first sample, a=5, b=3. So a + b = 8. For x=7, which is less than 8, the frog can reach all positions. So maybe my assumption is wrong. \n\nHmm. So maybe the threshold is lower. \n\nLet me think again. Suppose that the frog can reach any position that is non-negative and congruent to 0 mod d (which is 1 here). So for coprime a and b, all non-negative integers. \n\nBut how to reach them given that during the jumps, the frog can't go outside [0, x]. \n\nFor example, take x=2, a=5, b=3. The frog can reach 0, 5 (but 5>2, so can't). So the only position is 0. Hence f(2)=1. \n\nSimilarly, for x=3, the frog can reach 0, 5 is invalid, 3 (from 0 + 3? No, the frog can't subtract b from 0. So the only way is to add a steps. But 5 is larger than x=3. So the frog can't reach anything except 0. So f(3)=1. \n\nWait, but according to the sample input, for x=5, f(5) is 3. The positions are 0, 2, 5. \n\nSo for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 2 (by jumping +5 and then -3). But for x=5, the frog can't reach 5-3*2 = -1, which is invalid. So the path is 0 → 5 (allowed, since 5 ≤x=5) → 5-3=2 (allowed). So yes. \n\nBut for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. \n\nSo, for x ≥ a, the frog can reach a. Then, for x ≥ a + b, can the frog reach any number between 0 and x? \n\nBut for example, take x=7, which is a=5 and b=3. The frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 4 (7-3), 1 (4-3), 6 (1+5), 3 (6-3). All numbers from 0 to 7. \n\nSo for x ≥ a + b - something, the frog can reach all positions. \n\nBut what about x=4? Let's see. For x=4, the frog can reach:\n\n0, 5 is not allowed. So starting from 0, can the frog reach 2? Yes: 0 +5 is not allowed (since 5>4), so no. Wait, how can the frog reach 2? \n\nWait, no. Because the frog can't jump to 5 if x=4. So the only possible jumps are from 0: can't jump +a (since 5>4). Can't jump -b (since 0 < b=3). So the frog can't move. So f(4) is 1. But according to the sample input, for x=4, f(4) is 1. Which matches. \n\nBut then, how does the frog reach 2 in x=5? Because when x=5, the frog can jump to 5, then subtract 3 to get 2. \n\nSo, for x=5, which is equal to a, the frog can reach 5. \n\nSo the conclusion is that the frog can reach a position k if there exists some way to reach it through a series of jumps that never step outside [0, x]. \n\nThis seems very tricky. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of BFS. For each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached via BFS starting from 0, with transitions to k+a and k-b (if they are within [0, x]). However, with m up to 1e9, we can't compute this for each x. \n\nThus, we need a mathematical approach. \n\nLet me think again. The key insight might be that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (the gcd of a and b) and are between 0 and x. \n\nBut how to find this threshold. \n\nAssuming that a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any position >= (some value) as long as x is large enough. \n\nIn the classic problem, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination (with non-negative coefficients) is ab - a - b. However, in our case, the frog can subtract steps, which allows reaching numbers even below that. \n\nBut perhaps when x is large enough, the frog can reach any position that is non-negative. For example, once the frog can reach a and b, and can move forward and backward, then any position can be reached. \n\nWait, but how? For example, if the frog can reach 0, then can reach a, then can reach a - b (if a ≥b), etc. \n\nBut in the case of a=5 and b=3, the frog can reach any position >= 0 once x is large enough. \n\nSo, for x >= some value, f(x) = x + 1. \n\nBut in the first sample input, when x=5, f(5) is 3, but x+1 is 6. So clearly, for small x, f(x) is less than x+1. \n\nBut when x is large enough, f(x) becomes x+1. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, whether x is large enough that all positions from 0 to x are reachable. Then, for x larger than this threshold, f(x) = x + 1. \n\nIf we can find this threshold, then for the sum from 0 to m, we can split into two parts: the part where x is below the threshold, and the part where x is above. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the minimal x0 such that for all x >= x0, f(x) = x + 1. \n\n2. For x < x0, compute f(x) individually. \n\n3. Sum the values accordingly. \n\nBut how to find x0. \n\nLet me think. For x0, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x. \n\nWhat is x0? \n\nPerhaps x0 is (a + b) - 1. Or something similar. \n\nIn the first sample, when x=5, which is a=5, the frog can reach 0,2,5. When x increases to 7, which is a + b - 1 (5+3-1=7), then f(x) becomes 8 (all positions from 0 to 7). \n\nSo for x >= a + b - 1, f(x) = x + 1. \n\nBut why? Because once x is at least a + b -1, the frog can reach any position. \n\nBut how to prove this. \n\nLet me think of the following: For any position k between 0 and x, if x is large enough, then the frog can reach k. \n\nTo reach k, the frog can first reach a certain position and then adjust with steps. \n\nBut perhaps the key is that for any k, there exists some way to reach it by adding a steps and subtracting b steps, and ensuring that during the process, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. \n\nBut how to ensure that. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. Once the frog can reach all positions from 0 to a + b - 1, then for any larger x, it can reach all positions up to x. \n\nBut how to verify this. \n\nIn the first sample, a=5, b=3. a + b -1 =7. And for x=7, the frog can reach all positions. \n\nAnother example: suppose a=2, b=3. Then a + b -1 =4. Let's see for x=4. \n\nThe frog can reach 0, 2, 4 (from 0+2), 2-3 = -1 (invalid), 4-3=1 (valid), 1+2=3 (valid), 3+2=5 (invalid). So positions are 0, 2, 4, 1, 3. All positions from 0 to 4. Hence f(4) =5. So yes. \n\nSo for x >= a + b -1, f(x) = x +1. \n\nTherefore, the threshold x0 is a + b -1. \n\nBut what if a and b are not coprime? Let me think. Let's take a=4 and b=6. Then d = gcd(4,6)=2. So, the positions are multiples of 2. \n\nLet me consider x = a + b -1 = 4+6-1=9. \n\nCan the frog reach all multiples of 2 between 0 and 9? Let's see. \n\nPossible positions: 0, 4, 8, 4-6 = -2 (invalid), 0+4=4, 4+4=8, 8-6=2, 2+4=6, 6-6=0, 6+4=10 (invalid). So positions are 0,4,8,2,6. So for x=9, the positions are 0,2,4,6,8. So 5 positions. \n\nBut x is 9, and there are 5 positions (each even number between 0 and 9). So for x >= a + b -1, the frog can reach all multiples of d (d=2) between 0 and x. Hence, f(x) = (x//d) + 1. \n\nSo in this case, for x >= a + b -1, f(x) = floor(x / d) + 1. \n\nSo the general formula for x >= x0 (where x0 = a + b -1) is:\n\nf(x) = floor(x / d) + 1, where d = gcd(a, b). \n\nBut wait, in the first example, where d=1, and x=7, f(x) = 8. Which is 7//1 +1 = 8. Correct. \n\nIn the second example of the problem statement: input is 1000000000 1 2019. The output is 500000001500000001. Which suggests that for all i, f(i) = i+1. Which implies that d = gcd(1, 2019) = 1, and x0 is 1 + 2019 -1 = 2019. Since m=1e9 is larger than 2019, for all i >= 2019, f(i) = i+1. But for i < 2019, f(i) is something else. However, the sample says that f(i) = i+1 for all i. Which suggests that perhaps the threshold is lower. \n\nWait, but in this case, a=1 and b=2019. So the frog can jump +1 or -2019. Starting from 0, the frog can jump +1 to 1, then again +1 to 2, etc. So for any x >=0, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Because the frog can just keep adding 1's. The -2019 jump is not needed for reaching positions. So in this case, x0 is 0. \n\nAh! So the previous assumption that x0 is a + b -1 is not correct. It depends on the relation between a and b. \n\nSo, the previous idea that x0 = a + b -1 is not universally applicable. \n\nSo, this suggests that the threshold x0 depends on whether the frog can reach all positions once x is large enough. \n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to find for which x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and between 0 and x. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think again. If the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and between 0 and x, then for x >= some value. \n\nBut how to determine this value. \n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. Suppose that the frog can reach all positions >= some value. For example, when a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. Then, once x is large enough, the frog can reach any position. \n\nBut what determines that x? It's possible that once the frog can reach positions up to a + b -1, then it can reach any higher positions. \n\nBut in the case where a=1 and b=2019, the frog can reach any position >=0. Because the frog can just add 1's. So for any x >=0, f(x) = x+1. \n\nSo the previous idea of x0 = a + b -1 is not correct. \n\nSo, perhaps the threshold depends on whether the frog can reach all positions once x is large enough. \n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the ability to move forward. \n\nIf the frog can make forward jumps (adding a), then it can reach any position that is a multiple of a, but perhaps not others. However, if the frog can also make backward jumps (subtracting b), then it can reach more positions. \n\nBut for the frog to be able to reach any position, there must be a way to reach any position. \n\nBut when the frog can make forward jumps, even if a is small, like 1, then it can reach any position. \n\nSo, the key is whether the frog can reach any position by adding a steps. For example, if a=1, then the frog can reach any position by just adding 1's. \n\nSo, in general, if a=1, then for any x, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x, since it can just add 1's. Hence, f(x) = x + 1. \n\nSimilarly, if b=0 (but the problem states that b is positive). \n\nSo, the problem depends on whether the frog can reach any position via forward jumps. \n\nSo, the general idea is: \n\nIf the frog can reach any position by forward jumps (i.e., a=1, or the frog can reach any position by adding a steps and possibly some backward steps), then for x large enough, f(x) is x+1. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nLet me think of the following. \n\nIf the frog can reach any position >= some value, then for x >= that value, f(x) = x+1. \n\nBut how to find that value. \n\nAlternatively, the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and for which there exists a way to reach it. \n\nBut if the frog can reach any such position once x is large enough, then for x >= some value, f(x) is the number of such positions between 0 and x. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of positions in [0, x] that are multiples of d and can be reached by the frog. \n\nBut how to find this number. \n\nLet me think again about the case where a and b are coprime. \n\nAssume that a and b are coprime. \n\nThen, the frog can reach any position that is non-negative, provided that x is large enough. \n\nBut how large is enough? \n\nIn this case, the frog can reach any position >= (b - a) ? Or something else. \n\nBut this seems unclear. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that is >= (some value) by adding a steps. For example, if the frog can reach a certain position, then it can add a steps to reach higher positions. \n\nSo, if the frog can reach position k, then it can reach k + a, k + 2a, etc. \n\nBut to reach lower positions, the frog can subtract b steps. \n\nSo, for example, if the frog can reach position k, then it can reach k - b, provided that k - b >= 0. \n\nBut this suggests that once the frog can reach some range of positions, it can generate all positions beyond that. \n\nSo, for example, if the frog can reach all positions from 0 up to some value, say, (a + b -1), then for any higher x, it can reach all positions up to x. \n\nBut how to confirm this. \n\nLet me take the example where a=5 and b=3. The frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. For x=8, the frog can reach 8 by adding 5 to 3 (but how to reach 3? Well, from 0, it can reach 5, then subtract 3 to get 2, then add 5 to get 7, subtract 3 to get 4, subtract 3 again to get 1, add 5 to get 6, subtract 3 to get 3. Then add 5 to get 8. So yes. So for x=8, the frog can reach all positions. \n\nSo, for x >= a + b -1, the frog can reach all positions. \n\nIn this case, a + b -1 = 5 + 3 -1 =7. \n\nSo, in general, if a and b are coprime, then once x >= a + b -1, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x. \n\nBut for the case where a=1 and b=2019, the threshold would be 1 + 2019 -1 = 2019. But in reality, the frog can reach all positions even for x=0. \n\nSo this suggests that the threshold x0 is the maximum between (a + b -1) and ... something else. \n\nWait, but in the case where a=1 and b=2019, the frog can reach all positions even for x=0. So why is the threshold 2019? \n\nBecause for x=0, the frog can only reach 0. For x=1, the frog can reach 0 and 1. For x=2, 0,1,2, etc. So the threshold is zero. \n\nSo the previous idea of x0 = a + b -1 is not correct. \n\nSo what is the correct way to find x0? \n\nMaybe the correct x0 is the minimal value such that the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x0, and then for x >= x0, the frog can reach all positions up to x. \n\nBut how to find x0. \n\nAlternatively, think about the following: if the frog can reach all positions from 0 to a + b -1, then it can reach all positions beyond that. \n\nBut how to verify this. \n\nLet me think of another example. Take a=3, b=2 (coprime). Then a + b -1 = 4. \n\nLet's see if the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 4. \n\nPositions:\n\n0: yes.\n\n1: can the frog reach 1? Let's see. Starting from 0, can't jump to 3 (since 3 is allowed for x=4). Then from 3, subtract 2 to get 1. So yes. \n\n2: from 0, can't jump to 3 (allowed) and then subtract 2 to get 1. Or from 0, can't jump to 3-2=1, but to get 2, maybe from 3 + 2? No, that would be 5. But x=4. Alternatively, from 0, jump to 3, then jump to 3+3=6 (invalid). No. So how to get 2? \n\nWait, from 0, can't jump to 3-2=1. To get 2, the frog needs to reach it somehow. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's think again. \n\nThe frog starts at 0. It can jump to 3 (since 3 is within x=4). From 3, it can jump to 3-2=1. From 1, it can jump to 1+3=4. From 4, it can jump to 4-2=2. \n\nSo yes, the frog can reach 2. \n\nSo for x=4, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 4. \n\nThen, for x=5, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to hold. \n\nBut for a=1, b=2019, the frog can reach all positions even before x reaches a + b -1. \n\nSo, the threshold x0 is the minimal value such that for all x >= x0, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x. \n\nBut how to compute x0. \n\nMaybe x0 is the maximum between a and b) ? \n\nNo. For example, a=5, b=3, max(a,b) is 5. But for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. But not 1, 3, 4. \n\nSo that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, x0 is the minimal value such that the frog can reach all positions up to x0, and from there, it can reach any higher positions. \n\nBut how to find x0. \n\nLet me think about the following. Once the frog can reach a position k, and also k + 1, then it can reach all positions beyond that. Because with a=1, you can reach all positions. But if a is larger than 1, then you need to find a way to reach consecutive positions. \n\nBut this seems complex. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nLet me think about the case when the frog can reach any position >= some value. For example, if the frog can reach a and b, and they are coprime, then it can reach any position >= (a*b -a -b) + 1. But this is the classic coin problem. However, in our case, the frog can subtract steps, which allows reaching positions below that. \n\nSo, perhaps the frog can reach all positions >= (something) once x is large enough. \n\nBut again, this is not helpful for finding the threshold. \n\nLet me try to think differently. Let's assume that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are between 0 and x, provided that x is large enough. \n\nFor example, if d = gcd(a, b), and the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and >= some value. \n\nBut how to find that value. \n\nLet me consider the case when d = 1 (a and b coprime). \n\nLet me define a' = a and b' = b. \n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But since the frog can also subtract steps, it can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients, provided that it can be reached through a sequence of jumps that don't go out of bounds. \n\nBut this is getting too abstract. \n\nPerhaps the solution is to realize that for the purposes of this problem, the sum from i=0 to m of f(i) can be computed in two parts: \n\n1. For i < some threshold T, compute f(i) individually. \n\n2. For i >= T, f(i) = floor(i / d) + 1, where d = gcd(a, b). \n\nBut how to find T. \n\nBut how to find T. \n\nLet me think about the following: T is the maximum between (a + b - 1) and the minimal value such that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d between 0 and T. \n\nBut this is still unclear. \n\nAlternatively, considering the sample input where a=5 and b=3, and T=7 (a + b -1). For x >= 7, the frog can reach all positions. \n\nIn the case where a=1 and b=2019, T is 0. Because for x=0, the frog can reach 0. For x=1, it can reach 0 and 1. And so on. So for x >=0, the frog can reach all positions. \n\nSo, the threshold T depends on the relationship between a and b. \n\nPerhaps T is the maximum between (a + b - 1) and (some other value). \n\nBut I'm stuck. \n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the following: \n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But since the frog can also subtract steps, this is not directly applicable. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as the frog being able to reach any position that is >=0 and is congruent to 0 mod d",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these counts for all values from 0 to a given integer $ m $. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either $ +a $ or $ -b $, but must stay within the interval $[0, x]$ for each $ x $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $ a $ and $ b $. This is because any combination of jumps will result in positions that are linear combinations of $ a $ and $ b $.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: For sufficiently large $ x $, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of the gcd of $ a $ and $ b $ within the range $[0, x]$. The threshold for this behavior is determined by the maximum of $ a $ and $ b $.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: We split the problem into two parts:\n   - For values of $ x $ below the threshold, compute the reachable positions individually.\n   - For values of $ x $ above the threshold, use a formula to compute the count of reachable positions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a //= d\n    b //= d\n    \n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Now a and b are coprime\n    # Compute the threshold T\n    T = max(a, b)\n    \n    # Precompute f(x) for x < T\n    # But since T can be up to 1e5, it's manageable\n    # However, for very large m (up to 1e9), we need to find how many x < T and x >= T\n    \n    # First, compute the sum for x from 0 to min(m, T-1)\n    sum_small = 0\n    visited = set()\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    for x in range(0, min(m, T) + 1):\n        # BFS to compute f(x)\n        q = deque()\n        q.append(0)\n        seen = set()\n        seen.add(0)\n        while q:\n            current = q.popleft()\n            # Try adding a\n            next_add = current + a\n            if next_add <= x and next_add not in seen:\n                seen.add(next_add)\n                q.append(next_add)\n            # Try subtracting b\n            next_sub = current - b\n            if next_sub >= 0 and next_sub <= x and next_sub not in seen:\n                seen.add(next_sub)\n                q.append(next_sub)\n        sum_small += len(seen)\n    \n    # Now compute the sum for x >= T and <= m\n    # For x >= T, f(x) = floor(x / d) + 1\n    # But wait, earlier we divided a and b by d, so now d is 1?\n    # Wait, original d was gcd(a, b).
