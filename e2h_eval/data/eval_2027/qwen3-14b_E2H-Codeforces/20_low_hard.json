For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to find the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to compute this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the example given, a beautiful multiset is one where for every string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. Also, the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. So each string in the multiset is of length n, and for all prefixes of those strings (of any length up to n), their counts must not exceed the corresponding c_s.\n\nThe main goal is to count the number of c_s assignments where the maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. That is, there exists at least one beautiful multiset of size f, and no larger one exists.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For a given set of c_s values, what determines the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset?\n\nThis feels like a problem related to constraints on the number of times each prefix can be used. Since each string in the multiset contributes to all its prefixes. For example, a string of length n contributes to its prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nSo the problem is similar to building a trie structure, where each node represents a binary string (prefix), and the count of how many times it's used as a prefix is constrained by c_s. The maximum size of the multiset would then be the maximum number of strings we can add without violating any of these constraints.\n\nBut how do we compute the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset given the c_s values? It seems like this is equivalent to finding the minimum over certain values. Wait, maybe it's similar to a flow problem or something else.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem of choosing how many strings to put in the multiset, considering that each string contributes +1 to all its prefixes. But the constraints are that for each prefix s, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using the inclusion-exclusion principle. For example, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the constraints on the prefixes. However, since each string contributes to all its prefixes, the constraints must be compatible. For example, if you have a prefix s of length l, and a longer prefix t (which is s followed by some bits), then the count for s must be >= the count for t. Otherwise, if you have more strings with t as a prefix than allowed by s's c_s, that would be impossible.\n\nWait, but the constraints are that for every s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s. So for example, suppose s is a prefix of t. Then, the number of strings with t as a prefix is <= the number of strings with s as a prefix. Because every string with t as a prefix also has s as a prefix. Therefore, for the constraints to be feasible, for any two prefixes where one is a prefix of the other, the c_s of the longer one must be <= the c_s of the shorter one. Wait, no. Because the count for the longer prefix can't exceed the count for the shorter one. But the c_s for the longer one could be less than or equal to the c_s of the shorter one. Otherwise, if c_t > c_s, then even if you have a lot of strings with t as a prefix, they would contribute to s's count. So for the constraints to be feasible, for any s and t where t is a prefix of s, the c_t must be >= the number of strings that have s as a prefix. But since the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix, which is <= c_s. But for the longer prefix, say s is a prefix of t (t is longer), then the count for t is <= the count for s. Therefore, for the constraints to allow any beautiful multiset, the c_s must satisfy that for any s, the c_s is >= the c_t for all t that are extensions of s. Or perhaps, for any s, the c_s must be >= the c of any of its extensions. Because if s is a prefix of t, then the count for t can't exceed c_t, and since that count is part of the count for s, then the count for s must be at least the count for t. But",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for `c_s` such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of binary strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. The constraints involve ensuring that for every binary string `s` (of any length from 1 to `n`), the number of strings in the multiset with `s` as a prefix does not exceed `c_s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: For each binary string `s`, the value `c_s` must be chosen such that it respects the hierarchical nature of prefixes. A longer string's `c` value must be less than or equal to the `c` value of its shorter prefixes.\n2. **Dynamic Programming on Prefixes**: We use dynamic programming to count valid configurations of `c_s` values. This involves considering all possible binary strings of lengths from 1 to `n` and ensuring their constraints are met.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Given the large constraints, results must be computed modulo `998244353`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n        idx += 3\n    \n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        # Precompute all possible binary strings of length up to n\n        # But since n can be up to 15, total number of nodes is sum_{i=1}^n 2^i = 2^{n+1} - 2\n        # We need to process them in order of increasing length, and for each node, ensure that\n        # c_s >= c_{child} for all children (i.e., extensions)\n        \n        # Let's model the problem by considering the constraints on c_s\n        # The maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum of (sum_{s} c_s * something?), but more accurately, it's the minimal value of the sum of c_s multiplied by some factors based on the trie structure.\n        \n        # However, the correct way to compute the maximum size of the beautiful multiset given c_s is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, think of it as a flow problem where each string contributes to all its prefixes.\n        \n        # Wait, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is the minimum of all c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}, but only if the constraints are satisfied. So for each node s (prefix), the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix is c_s. But since each string of length n has exactly one path from root to leaf, the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimal value of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} across all nodes s. But this is only valid if the constraints are satisfied (i.e., for any node s, c_s >= c_t for all t that are extensions of s).\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s, provided that the constraints are satisfied (i.e., for any s, c_s >= c_t for all t that are extensions of s). If the constraints are not satisfied, then there is no such multiset.\n        \n        # So our problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s to all prefixes s (length 1..n) such that:\n        # 1. For all s, 0 <= c_s <= k\n        # 2. For any s and its extension t (i.e., t is s followed by a bit), c_s >= c_t\n        # 3. The minimal value of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s is exactly f\n        \n        # So we need to count the number of such assignments where the minimal value of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) is exactly f.\n        \n        # To compute this, we can first compute the number of assignments where the minimal value is <= f, and subtract those where it is <= f-1. However, since the problem requires exactly f, we can compute the difference between the number of assignments where the minimal value is <= f and those where it is <= f-1.\n        \n        # However, we also need to ensure that the constraints on the c_s are satisfied (i.e., for any s, c_s >= c_t for any extension t of s).\n        \n        # So the approach is to:\n        # 1. For each possible assignment of c_s that satisfies the constraints (c_s >= c_t for any extension t of s), compute the minimal value of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # 2. Count how many such assignments have this minimal value exactly equal to f.\n        \n        # To do this, we can use dynamic programming on the trie structure of all prefixes. Since n is small (up to 15), the number of nodes is manageable.\n        \n        # First, generate all prefixes in order of increasing length. For each node, we can track the minimum value of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} in its subtree.\n        \n        # Let's think recursively. Each node can be considered as a root of a subtree, and the minimal value for the subtree rooted at this node is min(c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}, min of children's minimal values).\n        \n        # However, since the constraints require that c_s >= c_t for any child t, we can model this as a tree where each node's c_s must be >= the c values of its children.

Then, we can combine these counts using dynamic programming.\n        \n        # However, given the time constraints, perhaps we can precompute for each node, the possible values of c_s and propagate the constraints.\n        \n        # Let's proceed step by step.\n        \n        # Step 1: Generate all prefixes in order of increasing length. For each prefix, we can represent it as a node. For example, the root is empty string, but we don't consider it. The nodes are all binary strings of length from 1 to n.\n        \n        # But for the purpose of building the trie, each node has two children (if they exist). For example, a node 's' of length l has children 's0' and 's1' (if l < n).\n        \n        # The number of nodes is sum_{i=1}^n 2^i = 2^{n+1} - 2.\n        \n        # For each node, we can compute the exponent factor: 2^{n - len(s)}. Let's precompute this for all nodes.\n        \n        # For example, for a node of length l, the factor is 2^{n - l}.\n        \n        # Now, for each node, the contribution to the minimal value is c_s * factor.\n        \n        # The minimal value over all nodes is the minimal of all such contributions.\n        \n        # Our problem is to count the number of assignments where the minimal value is exactly f.\n        \n        # To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion. Let's first compute the number of valid assignments where the minimal value is <= f, and subtract the number where it is <= f-1.\n        \n        # However, how do we compute the number of valid assignments where the minimal value is <= m?\n        \n        # Let's think about the constraints. The minimal value must be <= m. This means that there exists at least one node s where c_s * factor(s) <= m. However, for the constraints to be satisfied, all ancestors of s must have c >= c_s.\n        \n        # But this seems complicated. Another approach is to realize that for the minimal value to be exactly f, the minimal value must be f, and for all nodes, their c_s * factor(s) >= f, and at least one node has c_s * factor(s) == f.\n        \n        # However, given the constraints on the c_s values (c_s >= c_t for any extension t), the minimal value is determined by the minimal among all c_s * factor(s).\n        \n        # So, the problem reduces to counting the number of valid assignments (satisfying the constraints) where the minimal of c_s * factor(s) is exactly f.\n        \n        # Let's proceed with dynamic programming on the trie structure. We'll process the nodes in order of decreasing length (from n down to 1), because each node's choice of c_s affects its children.\n        \n        # For each node, we can track the number of ways to assign c values to its subtree such that the minimal value in the subtree is at least m, and also track the possible minimal values.\n        \n        # However, this seems complex. Instead, let's consider that for the constraints to be satisfied, the c_s values must form a non-increasing sequence along any path from the root to a leaf. That is, for any node, its c value must be >= the c values of its children.\n        \n        # This is equivalent to saying that the c values form a \"monotonic\" sequence along the trie paths.\n        \n        # Now, for each node, we can think of the minimal value in its subtree as the minimum between the current node's contribution and the minimal values of its children.\n        \n        # Let's define dp[node][m] as the number of ways to assign c values to the subtree rooted at node, such that the minimal value in the subtree is exactly m.
