He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. Oh right, and there's some specifics about Roman numerals here. Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the second line is the number c in base a. So the plan is: convert c from base a to decimal (base 10), then convert that decimal number to base b, which could be another base or Roman numerals.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Convert the input string c (in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Convert that decimal integer to the target base, which is either a regular base (like 2, 16, etc.) or Roman numerals.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFor step 1: converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have letters? Wait, the problem says that when converting to base b, if it's not Roman, then the input c is a number in base a. Wait, but the input for c may contain letters if a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A, B (since 10 and 11). But the problem says that in the input, c is given as a string that may have leading zeros but its length is up to 10^3. So I need to process each character of c as a digit in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9, A-F. But how are they represented in the input? The problem says that the input is given as a string. So for example, in the sample input, there's a case like 'A' in the input for the fifth example. So the input for c can have letters (uppercase?), but I need to handle that.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that in the input, the number c is given in base a. So for bases larger than 10, the digits would be represented with letters. For example, in base 12, the digits would be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). So the input string for c would have characters like 'A', 'B', etc. So when converting from base a to decimal, I need to process each character as a digit, possibly with letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to parse the input string c into a decimal value. Let's think about how to do that. For each character in the string, I need to find its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So, for each character in c, I can convert it to its corresponding value. For example, for a digit character, it's int(c), but for letters, it's ord(c) - ord('A') + 10. But wait, what if the input is lowercase? The problem says that in the input, the number may have letters. But the examples show uppercase letters. Like the sample input has 'A' in one case. So perhaps the input is in uppercase. So I can assume that the input is uppercase, and process accordingly.\n\nSo, for the first step, converting c to decimal:\n\nInitialize a variable, say num = 0. For each char in the string:\n\ndigit_value = int(char) if it's a digit, else ord(char) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nThen, num = num * a + digit_value.\n\nBut wait, the input may have letters that are not in the base. For example, if a is 10, then the input can't have letters. But the problem says that the input is valid. So the input is guaranteed to be a valid number in base a. So no need to check for invalid characters.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, then I need to convert it to base b, which could be a number or 'R'.\n\nNow, the second part: converting the decimal number to base b.\n\nCase 1: b is not 'R'. Then, we need to convert the decimal number to base b. For example, if the decimal is 5 and base is 2, it becomes 101. But note that for bases larger than 10, letters are used (like A for 10, etc.). Also, the output should not have leading zeros. So for example, if the number is zero, but according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the input c could be zero? Wait, the problem says that in the input, if Roman numerals are included, the number is not zero. Otherwise, the number can be zero? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe input says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\"\n\nSo, when converting to Roman numerals, the number is non-zero. For other cases, the number could be zero? Well, the input c can be zero. For example, if the input is 10 2 and c is 0. But the problem says that in the input, c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. So for example, if c is \"0\", then the decimal value is zero. Then, converting to base b (not R) would be \"0\".\n\nBut the output says to omit leading zeros. So for example, if the result is zero, the output is \"0\".\n\nSo for converting to base b (non-R), we need to handle zero correctly.\n\nSo the steps for converting a decimal number to base b (non-R):\n\nIf the number is zero, output is \"0\".\n\nElse, we need to generate the digits in base b. For each digit, we can take the remainder when divided by b, then divide the number by b, and repeat until the number is zero. Then reverse the digits.\n\nBut for bases larger than 10, digits above 9 are represented as letters. For example, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc. So, for each digit value, we can map it to a character. For example:\n\ndigit_to_char = {0:'0', 1:'1', ..., 9:'9', 10:'A', 11:'B', ...}\n\nBut how to handle this. For example, if the base is 16, then digits can be 0-15, so for values 10-15, they are A-F.\n\nSo, during conversion, for each digit value, we can check if it is less than 10, then use the digit as a string, else use the corresponding letter.\n\nSo, for the conversion function, here's a possible approach:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        rem = n % base\n\n        digits.append(rem)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    # Now reverse the digits and convert to characters\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return res\n\nWait, but for example, if the base is 12, then digits can be up to 11, which would be 'B'. So that code would work.\n\nBut what about leading zeros? Well, the problem says to omit leading zeros. However, in this code, when n is zero, it returns '0', otherwise, the digits are generated correctly. For example, if the number is zero, it's handled. Otherwise, the digits list is generated without leading zeros because the loop stops when n becomes zero. So the code seems okay.\n\nCase 2: b is 'R', so we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nThis is more complex. Let's think about how to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, the standard list is:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, we take as many as possible and append the symbols.\n\nSo, for example, 4 is IV, 5 is V, 6 is VI, etc.\n\nSo the code for converting decimal to Roman would be something like:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and non-zero. So this function will work for numbers up to 3000.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000 (in decimal). So our code can safely handle that.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the steps for the program:\n\nRead the input lines. Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first line shows ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', ...], but in reality, the input is read from stdin. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as follows: the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So for each test case, two lines are given. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example input, the input is given as a list of inputs, but in reality, the actual input is multiple test cases? Or is the sample input showing multiple test cases as separate entries?\n\nWait, the problem's sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases, but in reality, the actual input is given as per each test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, each consisting of two lines. But in practice, the program must read from stdin. So for example, in the sample input, each test case is two lines. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, the next line contains c. So the program must process one test case per input. Wait, but the sample shows multiple outputs, which suggests that the problem may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the sample input and output show multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but in reality, the program should read from standard input. So perhaps the problem expects that the program reads multiple test cases? But the problem's input description says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo that suggests that each test case is two lines. So the program needs to read multiple test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nWait, the sample input shows multiple test cases. For example, the first input line is '10 2\\n1', which is two lines. Then the next is '16 R\\n5', which is two lines. So perhaps the program is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is a list of test cases. For example, the sample input has 5 test cases, and the output has 5 answers.\n\nBut how is the input structured? For example, in the sample input, each test case is two lines. So the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. Therefore, the program should read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is unclear. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo perhaps each test case is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, which implies that the program should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description may not clarify this. But looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is a list of test cases, and the output is a list of answers. Therefore, the program must read multiple test cases.\n\nWait, but the problem's sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a test case. But in reality, the program must read from standard input. For example, in the sample input, the user would enter:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\nWhich would be five test cases. Each test case has two lines. So the program needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? Well, the program can read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs of two lines, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that in code? For example, in Python, reading from stdin can be done via sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), then processing the lines in pairs.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, the next line contains c. So the input is multiple test cases. So the program should read all test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from input.\n\nProcess them in pairs: first line is a and b, second line is c.\n\nSo for each pair, process and output the answer.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\na=10, b=2, c=1 → output is '1'.\n\nSecond test case: a=16, b=R, c=5 → output 'V'.\n\nThird test case: a=5, b=R, c=4 → output 'IV'.\n\nFourth: a=2, b=2, c=1111001 → output '1111001'.\n\nFifth: a=12, b=13, c=A → output 'A'.\n\nSo the code must process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead all lines from input.\n\nLoop over the lines in pairs (i and i+1), for i from 0 to len(lines) - 1 in steps of 2.\n\nBut perhaps, the input is such that the number of lines is even. So that each test case is two lines.\n\nNow, for each test case:\n\nParse the first line into a and b. But b can be 'R' or a number. So, for example, the first line could be '10 2' → a=10, b=2. Or '16 R' → a=16, b='R'.\n\nThe second line is the string c.\n\nOnce parsed, process:\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal.\n\nThen, convert the decimal to base b (which is either a number or R).\n\nNow, the first part is converting c from base a to decimal.\n\nImplementing that:\n\nFor example, c is a string. For each character in c, we need to get its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n\nSo, for a given character, the code can be:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n\n    if c.isdigit():\n\n        return int(c)\n\n    else:\n\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\nBut need to make sure that the character is valid for the base a. However, the problem states that the input is valid.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 10, then the input c can only have digits 0-9. If a is 16, then the input can have 0-9, A-F, etc.\n\nSo, the code for converting the string c to decimal:\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        val = char_to_value(ch)\n\n        num = num * a + val\n\n    return num\n\nBut need to handle leading zeros. However, the problem says that leading zeros are allowed in the input, but the output must omit leading zeros. But in the conversion to decimal, leading zeros don't affect the value, so it's okay.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part is converting the decimal number to the target base.\n\nSo, for each test case, after getting the decimal value, we need to process based on whether b is 'R' or a number.\n\nSo, for example, if b is 'R', then call the decimal_to_roman function. Else, convert to base b as a string, using letters for digits above 9.\n\nBut also, the output must omit leading zeros. For example, if the number is zero, output '0'. Else, the conversion to base b should not have leading zeros.\n\nBut the code for converting to base b (non-R) already handles that. For example, the code returns '0' for zero, else, the digits are generated without leading zeros.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling very large numbers. Since the input c can be up to 10^3 characters long. For example, if a is 2, and c is 1000 1's. Then converting that to decimal would be 2^1000 - 1, which is a huge number. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's okay.\n\nBut for the code, converting a string of 1000 characters in base 25 would take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nAnother thing: when converting from base a to decimal, the code must handle the case where c is '0' (which is allowed, except when Roman is involved). So, for example, if the input is '2 10\\n0', then the output is '0'.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the functions:\n\nchar_to_value(ch) → returns the value of the character in base a.\n\nBut wait, the code for converting the string to decimal is as follows:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, a):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            val = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        num = num * a + val\n\n    return num\n\nBut what if the input is '0'? Then it returns 0.\n\nNow, for the conversion to base b:\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert to base b as a string, using letters for digits >=10.\n\nBut in the code, when converting to base b, the function decimal_to_base(n, base) must handle the case when n is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So in that case, the code for converting to Roman can assume that the number is non-zero.\n\nNow, code for converting decimal to base b (non-R):\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        rem = n % base\n\n        digits.append(rem)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return res\n\nBut for example, if the base is 13, and the number is 10, then the digit is 'A'.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nThen, for each pair of lines:\n\nFirst line: a and b. Split into parts. For example, line.split() → [a_str, b_str].\n\nBut a and b can be numbers or 'R' for b.\n\nSecond line: c_str.\n\nThen:\n\nConvert c_str from base a to decimal.\n\nThen, convert decimal to target base.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef char_to_value(ch):\n\n    if ch.isdigit():\n\n        return int(ch)\n\n    else:\n\n        return ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef to_decimal(s, a):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        val = char_to_value(ch)\n\n        num = num * a + val\n\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        rem = n % base\n\n        digits.append(rem)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < len(lines):\n\n        # Read a and b\n\n        a_line = lines[i]\n\n        a_str, b_str = a_line.split()\n\n        a = int(a_str)\n\n        b = b_str\n\n        # Read c line\n\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n\n        # Convert c to decimal\n\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n\n        # Now convert to target base\n\n        if b == 'R':\n\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n\n            print(roman)\n\n        else:\n\n            base = int(b)\n\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n\n            print(converted)\n\n        i += 2\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but what about when the decimal_val is zero and the target base is not R? For example, if the input is '10 2\\n0', then the code returns '0', which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\na=10, b=2, c=1 → decimal is 1 → converted to base 2 is '1' → correct.\n\nSecond test case: a=16, b=R, c=5 → decimal is 5 → Roman is 'V'.\n\nThird test case: a=5, b=R, c=4 → decimal is 4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nFourth test case: a=2, b=2, c=1111001 → decimal is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 → 64 +32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Converting to base 2: 121 in binary is 1111001 → output is same as input. Correct.\n\nFifth test case: a=12, b=13, c=A. The decimal value is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. So output is 'A'.\n\nSo all sample outputs are correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where the input is zero, and the target is not Roman. For example, input '10 10\\n0' → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: input '2 10\\n0' → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting to base higher than 10. For example, decimal 10 in base 11 is 'A'.\n\nAnother case: decimal 35 in base 16 is '23'.\n\nWhat about when converting to base 1? Wait, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code doesn't have to handle base 1.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nBut in the code, when parsing the first line, a and b are given as 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25. But for b, it can be 'R' instead of a number. So in the code, when b is not 'R', then the code converts it to an integer. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother edge case: when the input c is '0' and the target is Roman. But according to the problem statement, this case is not possible. So the code can safely assume that when b is R, the decimal_val is non-zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base R, the decimal is 3000 → 'MMM'.\n\nBut the code for decimal_to_roman handles that.\n\nAnother case: when the decimal is 4 → 'IV'.\n\nAnother case: 1994 → MCMXCIV.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing for leading zeros in the output. For example, if the decimal is 5, converted to base 10 → '5', which is correct. If the decimal is 0, converted to base 10 → '0'.\n\nNow, for the code, the function decimal_to_base returns '0' for zero, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 2, the number is zero. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 2, the number is 0, but the code returns '0'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code reads all lines, and processes them in pairs. So for example, if the input is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nThen the code processes two test cases.\n\nNow, in Python, the code uses sys.stdin.read().splitlines() and strips each line. Then, processes them in pairs.\n\nBut what if the input has empty lines? According to the problem statement, the input is correct, so probably not. The code skips empty lines by using [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()].\n\nBut in the code, the lines list is built by stripping each line and including only non-empty lines. Then, processing them in pairs. So for example, if there are 5 lines, then i runs 0, 2, 4. But if len(lines) is odd, then the last line is ignored? But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so the number of lines is even.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the code should be correct. Let me check for possible errors.\n\nWait, in the function to_decimal, what if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, the input is a non-negative integer, so the input c is not empty. So the code can proceed.\n\nAnother possible error: when the input c is '0' and a is 10. Then decimal_val is 0, which is handled correctly.\n\nAnother possible error: when converting to base R, the decimal_val is zero. But according to the problem statement, this is not possible.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nSo the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which could be a standard numerical base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input Number from Base `a` to Decimal**: This involves interpreting each digit of the input string as a value in base `a` and computing its equivalent decimal value.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base `b`**: Depending on whether `b` is a numerical base or the Roman numeral system, we use different conversion methods:\n   - **Numerical Base Conversion**: Convert the decimal number to the specified base using standard division-remainder techniques, handling bases greater than 10 with letters (A-Z).\n   - **Roman Numeral Conversion**: Convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef char_to_value(ch):\n    if ch.isdigit():\n        return int(ch)\n    else:\n        return ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef to_decimal(s, a):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        val = char_to_value(ch)\n        num = num * a + val\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(lines):\n        a_line = lines[i]\n        a_str, b_str = a_line.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_val))\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n            print(converted)\n        i += 2\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, stripping any extraneous whitespace. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input string from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating over each character and calculating its value.\n3. **Decimal to Target Base Conversion**:\n   - For numerical bases, the function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the specified base using division-remainder method and handles values greater than 9 with letters.\n   - For Roman numerals, the function `decimal_to_roman` uses a list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation of the decimal number.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including large numbers and special cases like Roman numerals.",
