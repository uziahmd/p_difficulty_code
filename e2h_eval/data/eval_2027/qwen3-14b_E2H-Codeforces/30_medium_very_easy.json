Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. Each takes exactly n moves, and the order of taking digits depends on who is chosen each turn. The output is the sequence of H and M that leads to the maximum total.\n\nHmm, the key here is to find the optimal way for them to pick digits so that their combined total is maximized. Since each choice affects the remaining digits, we need a way to decide at each step whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit.\n\nBut wait, how do we model this? Let's think about the decision process. At each step, there's a certain number of digits left, and we need to decide whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit. But since both have to take exactly n digits, the number of choices left depends on how many each has taken so far.\n\nLet me think about the state. The state can be represented by the number of digits remaining and the counts of how many times Homer and Marge have taken digits. Wait, but since the total number of digits is 2n, and each takes exactly n, the state could be determined by how many digits are left, and how many Homer has taken so far (since Marge's count would be total_moves - homer_count). Wait, for example, if the current state has k digits left, then the number of moves made so far is (original length) - k = 2n -k. Since each move takes one digit. So, the number of moves Homer has made is h, and Marge has made m = (2n -k) - h. But since each must make exactly n moves, the possible states are constrained such that h can't exceed n, and m can't exceed n. Also, the number of digits left is k, which starts at 2n and decreases by 1 each step.\n\nSo, for dynamic programming, perhaps we can model the state as (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken so far, and m is the number Marge has taken. But since h + m = (2n - k), and k is the number of digits left, maybe it's better to represent the state with h and the number of digits left. Wait, but when you have h steps taken by Homer, and m steps by Marge, then h + m = total steps taken so far. Since the total steps is 2n, the number of digits left is 2n - (h + m). But since each step is taking one digit, the digits left is 2n - (h + m).\n\nBut since h can't exceed n, and m can't exceed n, and h + m can't exceed 2n. However, since each step requires that the next move is either H or M, but the choice must ensure that after all steps, both have exactly n moves.\n\nSo, for the DP approach, the state can be represented by the number of digits left, and the number of H moves taken so far. Because, given that, the number of M moves is (total moves taken so far) - h, which is (2n - digits_left) - h. But since total moves taken is (original digits) - digits_left = 2n - digits_left. So, for example, if there are k digits left, then the number of moves taken so far is (2n - k). Then, h is the number of H moves taken, and m = (2n -k) - h. But since m can't exceed n, and h can't exceed n, the state transitions need to ensure that.\n\nSo, for each state (h, k), where k is the number of digits left, and h is the number of H moves taken so far. Wait, but k can be derived from the number of moves taken so far. Wait, if the current state is after some steps, then the number of digits left is k. For example, initially, k is 2n. Then, after one move, k is 2n-1.\n\nSo the state can be represented as (h, k), where h is the number of H moves taken so far, and k is the number of digits left. But since k = 2n - (h + m), and m = (number of M moves taken). But since m = (current total steps) - h, and current total steps is (original length - k) = 2n - k. Therefore, m = (2n -k) - h. And since m can't exceed n, and h can't exceed n, we can model this.\n\nThe idea is that for each state, we can decide whether to take H or M next, provided that taking that choice doesn't make h exceed n or m exceed n.\n\nAt each step, when we choose to take H, then the next state will be h+1, and k-1. Similarly for M.\n\nThe DP needs to track the maximum total value achievable from the current state. But how do we compute that?\n\nThe value of choosing a digit depends on which player takes it. For example, if Homer takes the next digit, then that digit contributes to S1, which is part of the total. Similarly for Marge. However, since the total is S1 + S2, each digit added to either S1 or S2 contributes its value multiplied by 10^{remaining digits} in their respective numbers. Wait, no. Wait, the digits are added to their numbers in the order they are taken. For example, if Homer takes the first digit, then the next digit he takes is added to the end of his number. So the first digit he takes is the most significant digit, and the last digit he takes is the least significant.\n\nTherefore, the value of a digit taken at position i (when there are k digits left) depends on the position in the player's number. For example, if Homer has already taken h digits, then the next digit he takes will be his (h+1)th digit. Which would be multiplied by 10^{n - (h+1)} } ?\n\nWait, the final number S1 has n digits. So the first digit he takes is the first digit of S1 (most significant), the second is the next, etc. So the value of the digit taken at step h (when he takes his h-th digit) is digit * 10^{n - h} ?\n\nYes. For example, if n is 2, and he takes the first digit, that's the 10^1 place. Then, when he takes the second digit, it's 10^0 place.\n\nSo, for each digit that is taken by a player, the contribution to the total depends on which player takes it, and how many digits they have already taken.\n\nSo, during the DP, for each state, we need to track not only the maximum total value but also the choices made to reach that maximum.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. Let's think about the possible states. The state is determined by h (number of H moves taken so far) and k (digits left). Since h can range from 0 to n, and k can range from 0 to 2n. But for each state, the possible k is determined based on the steps taken. For example, when h is 0, the number of digits left is 2n, and as steps proceed, k decreases by 1 each time.\n\nBut the number of possible states is O(n * 2n) = O(2n²). For n=18, that's 18*36 = 648. That's manageable for memoization. However, for each state, we need to compute the maximum value, and also track the path (the choices made) to get that maximum.\n\nBut wait, the digits are being taken from the front of the string. So, the digits available depend on how many have been taken so far. For example, if the original string is A, then when there are k digits left, the first digit is A[ (original length - k) ] ?\n\nWait, original length is 2n. Suppose we have taken (2n -k) digits. So, the digits that are left are the last k digits of the original string. Wait, no. Because each time, the leftmost digit is taken. So, the initial string is A. After taking the first digit, the remaining string is A[1:]. Then, after taking another digit, it's A[2:], etc. Therefore, when there are k digits left, the current string is A[ (2n -k) : ].\n\nWait, for example, original length is 2n. Suppose k digits are left. Then, the number of digits taken so far is (2n -k). So the first (2n -k) digits have been taken, and the remaining digits are the next k digits. So, the current leftmost digit is A[2n -k] (assuming zero-based index).\n\nSo, for a given state (h, k), the current digit is A[ (2n -k) ].\n\nSo, the problem becomes: at each state (h, k), we can choose to take H or M (if allowed). For each choice, we calculate the contribution of the current digit to the total, and then add the result of the optimal choice for the next state.\n\nBut how do we calculate the contribution? Let's think:\n\nIf the current digit is d, and the choice is to take it as H's next digit. Then, H has already taken h digits, so this is his (h+1)th digit. Since S1 has n digits, this digit contributes d * 10^{n - (h+1)} to S1. Similarly, if it's M's next digit, it contributes d * 10^{n - (m+1)}, where m is the number of digits M has taken so far.\n\nBut m is (current total steps taken) - h. Current total steps taken is (2n -k). So m = (2n -k) - h. So, when choosing to take M's next digit, the number of digits M has already taken is m = (2n -k) - h. Then, adding this digit makes it m+1, so the contribution is d * 10^{n - (m+1)}.\n\nBut since the total is S1 + S2, we can compute for each choice the contribution and add it to the recursive result.\n\nSo, the DP function can be defined as follows:\n\nDefine dp(h, k) as the maximum total value achievable from the current state (h, k), where h is the number of H moves taken so far, and k is the number of digits left. The function returns the maximum total value, and also the choice (H or M) that leads to that maximum.\n\nThe base case is when k = 0. Then, no more digits are left. But since each player must take exactly n moves, we need to ensure that h == n and m ==n. But since the problem says that the input is valid and the players must make exactly n moves, the code will only call the DP for valid states. So, the base case is when k=0, return 0.\n\nFor the transition, for the current state (h, k), we can choose H or M, provided that:\n\n- Choosing H: h + 1 <= n. Because Homer can't take more than n moves.\n- Choosing M: m + 1 <=n, where m is (2n -k) - h. Since m is the number of M moves taken so far. Adding one more M move would make m+1. So (2n -k) - h + 1 <= n.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, m = (2n -k) - h. Then, m +1 <=n → (2n -k -h) +1 <=n → 2n -k -h +1 ≤n → 2n -k -h +1 -n ≤0 → n -k -h +1 ≤0 → k + h ≥ n +1 ?\n\nNot sure. But during the DP steps, the code must check that choosing H or M is possible.\n\nSo, for each state (h, k), the code checks:\n\nIf we choose H, then the new h is h+1. We need to make sure that h+1 ≤n. Also, since the number of moves taken so far is (2n -k), and after adding this move, the total steps is (2n -k) + 1. But since the total steps after all moves is 2n, the k is decreasing.\n\nSo, for the current state (h, k), the possible choices are:\n\nOption 1: Take H. This is possible only if h <n. Because after taking, h+1 can't exceed n.\n\nOption 2: Take M. This is possible only if the number of M moves taken so far plus 1 is ≤n. The number of M moves taken so far is (2n -k) - h. So adding 1, it's (2n -k -h) +1 = (2n -k -h +1). This must be ≤n. So:\n\n2n -k -h +1 ≤n → 2n -k -h +1 -n ≤0 → n -k -h +1 ≤0 → k + h ≥n +1 ?\n\nBut since the current state is (h, k), and the total steps taken so far is (2n -k). The number of M steps is (2n -k) - h. So, the number of M steps taken so far is (steps_taken) - h = (2n -k) -h.\n\nSo, when choosing M, the new m steps would be (steps_taken +1) - h = (2n -k +1) -h. But steps_taken +1 is (2n -k +1) steps taken. However, the maximum allowed for m is n. So, (steps_taken +1) - h = (2n -k +1) -h ≤n → 2n -k +1 -h ≤n → n -k +1 -h ≤0 → h +k ≥n +1.\n\nBut how do I know if this is true?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the DP steps, the code can check if choosing M is possible. For example, when the current state is (h, k), then the number of M steps taken so far is (2n -k) -h. Adding one more M step would make it (2n -k -h +1). We need this to be ≤n. So:\n\n2n -k -h +1 ≤n → 2n -k -h +1 -n ≤0 → n -k -h +1 ≤0 → k + h ≥ n +1.\n\nSo, for the current state, if k + h ≥ n +1, then choosing M is possible.\n\nBut how can we ensure that during the DP steps?\n\nFor example, when the code is processing state (h, k), the code must check if choosing H or M is possible, and then proceed accordingly.\n\nSo, for the DP function:\n\nAt state (h, k), current digit is A[2n -k]. Let's denote this digit as d.\n\nIf we choose H:\n\n- Check if h <n. If yes, then:\n\n   contribution = d * 10^{n - (h+1)} \n\n   Then, the next state is (h+1, k-1).\n\nSimilarly, if we choose M:\n\n- Check if (steps_taken + 1 - h) <=n. Steps_taken is (2n -k). steps_taken +1 is (2n -k +1). steps_taken +1 - h is (2n -k +1 -h). This must be ≤n. So:\n\n2n -k +1 -h ≤n → rearranged as k + h ≥ n +1.\n\nSo, if (h + k) ≥ (n +1), then choosing M is allowed.\n\nSo, for the current state (h, k), we can choose H if h <n, and choose M if (h +k) ≥ n+1.\n\nOnce these conditions are met, we can compute the value of choosing H or M, and take the maximum between them.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the maximum value, and also track the path (sequence of choices) that leads to it.\n\nBut for n=18, the maximum possible digits is 36. The DP states are (h, k), where h ranges from 0 to n, and k ranges from 0 to 2n. But for each state, the value of k is constrained by the steps taken so far. For example, when h is 0, the steps taken is 0, so k must be 2n. When steps taken is s, then k = 2n -s. So, for a given h and k, the steps taken is (2n -k). Also, since steps_taken = h + m, and m = (steps_taken) - h. But perhaps the constraints on h and k are automatically handled by the DP transitions.\n\nBut for the DP, memoization can be done using memoization cache for (h, k) pairs.\n\nBut the problem is that for each state, the value depends on the current digit, which is determined by the position in the original string. So, the DP needs to know the original string A, which is fixed.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this in Python. Since n can be up to 18, the number of states is (n+1) * (2n +1) = 19 * 37 = 703 when n=18. Wait, for n=18, 2n=36. So k ranges from 0 to 36. For each h from 0 to 18. So total states are 19 * 37 = 703. Which is very manageable.\n\nSo, the DP can be implemented recursively with memoization. But since Python has a recursion stack limit, but for n=18, the maximum recursion depth would be 36 steps (since each step reduces k by 1). Which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps an iterative DP approach is better. Let's think about memoization.\n\nWe can use memoization with a dictionary, or a memo table. For each state (h, k), we store the maximum total value, and the choice (H or M) that leads to it.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the digits of A as a list, perhaps as integers.\n\n- For the DP, for each state (h, k), compute the best choice and the maximum value.\n\n- Once the DP is filled, we can reconstruct the path by starting from (h=0, k=2n) and making the choices according to the stored decisions.\n\nNow, for the memoization, we can use a memo table that stores for each (h, k) the maximum value and the choice (H or M) that gives that value.\n\nBut how to compute the contribution of the current digit?\n\nFor example, when choosing H, the contribution is d * 10^{n - (h+1)}. Similarly for M, the contribution is d * 10^{n - (m + 1)}, where m is the number of M steps taken before this choice. Which is (steps_taken) - h, where steps_taken is (2n -k). So m = (2n -k) -h. Then, after taking M, the new m is m +1. So the exponent is n - (m +1) = n - ((2n -k -h) +1) = n - (2n -k -h +1) = -n -1 +k +h.\n\nBut that seems complicated. However, during the DP calculation, for the current state (h, k), when choosing H, the contribution can be computed as d * 10^{n - (h + 1)}.\n\nSimilarly for choosing M, the contribution is d * 10^{n - (m + 1)} where m is (steps_taken - h) = (2n -k) -h. So, m +1 = (2n -k -h) + 1. Thus, the exponent is n - ( (2n -k -h) + 1 ) = n - 2n +k +h -1 = -n +k +h -1.\n\nBut how to compute this exponent? Well, for each choice, we can compute it as needed.\n\nBut for n up to 18, the exponents can be up to 10^18, which is a very large number. But since Python can handle big integers, that's okay.\n\nSo, the code can precompute the digits of A as a list, say digits = [int(c) for c in A].\n\nThen, for a given state (h, k), the current digit is digits[2n -k], since when there are k digits left, the first digit is at position (2n -k) in the original string (assuming zero-based index).\n\nSo, the code can proceed with memoization.\n\nNow, for the memoization, perhaps we can use a memo dictionary, and for each (h, k) store the maximum value and the choice.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, we can use lru_cache with memoization. However, since n can be up to 18, and the parameters h and k are small, this is feasible.\n\nBut the problem is that the digits are different for each test case. So, the DP function must be reinitialized for each test case. So, perhaps the code will have to use memoization per test case.\n\nBut in Python, for each test case, we can define a helper function inside the main code, which uses memoization, and then process the input.\n\nAlternatively, we can use memoization with parameters h and k, and for each call, the digits are known.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to implement this with memoization using a memo table, and for each state, compute the maximum value and the choice.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and A. Then, digits = list of integers of A.\n\nThen, the code needs to compute the optimal sequence of choices.\n\nImplement a recursive DP function with memoization.\n\nBut for Python, recursion may be slow for 700 states, but for n=18, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps an iterative approach is better. Let's think about the DP in terms of filling a table.\n\nThe DP table can be a 2D array, where dp[h][k] stores the maximum value achievable from state (h, k), and a separate choice table that records whether to choose H or M.\n\nThe transitions can be filled in order of decreasing k, since each state depends on k-1.\n\nLet's think about the order. For k from 2n down to 0:\n\nFor each possible h in 0..n:\n\n   if the current state (h, k) is valid (i.e., steps_taken = 2n -k, and h <= steps_taken, and steps_taken -h <=n).\n\nBut perhaps for each k, and for each h, we can compute the possible options.\n\nBut how to determine the valid h for each k?\n\nWell, for each k, steps_taken = 2n -k. The steps_taken must be equal to h + m, where m is the number of M steps taken. Since m can't exceed n, and h can't exceed n. So, h can be from max(0, steps_taken -n) to min(n, steps_taken).\n\nBut perhaps during the iteration, for each k, we can iterate h from 0 to n, and check if the state (h, k) is possible. But for the purposes of filling the DP table, perhaps it's better to process all possible (h, k) pairs, regardless of their validity, and let the transitions handle the invalid cases.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to process all possible (h, k) pairs, and for each, compute the possible transitions.\n\nSo, for the DP table, we can initialize a 2D array of size (n+1) x (2n +1), since h ranges from 0 to n, and k ranges from 0 to 2n.\n\nThe base case is when k=0. Then, dp[h][0] = 0 for any h (but only when h =n, since the steps_taken is 2n -0 = 2n, which implies that h + m = 2n, and m =n. So h must be n. But during the DP steps, the code must ensure that the state (h, k) is valid. However, for the purposes of the DP, even invalid states can be considered, but their transitions would not be allowed.\n\nBut perhaps during the filling of the DP table, for each (h, k), we check whether the current state is valid. For example, steps_taken = 2n -k. Then, h can't exceed steps_taken, and steps_taken -h can't exceed n. So steps_taken -h = m <=n → h >= steps_taken -n. So, for a state (h, k) to be valid, h must be between max(0, steps_taken -n) and min(n, steps_taken).\n\nBut perhaps during the DP filling, we can ignore invalid states, since they can't be reached.\n\nBut in practice, when processing the states, we can compute for all possible h and k, and for each, check if the state is valid.\n\nBut perhaps during the filling of the DP table, the code can process k from 2n down to 0, and for each k, process h from 0 to n.\n\nFor each (h, k):\n\n   if k ==0:\n\n       if h ==n: dp[h][k] =0\n\n       else: invalid state, but since the problem ensures that the input is valid, perhaps these states are not considered.\n\n   else:\n\n       current_digit = digits[2n -k]\n\n       max_value = -infinity\n\n       choice = ''\n\n       if h <n:\n\n           # can choose H\n\n           new_h = h +1\n\n           new_k = k-1\n\n           contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - new_h)) \n\n           # because new_h is h+1, which is the number of digits taken by H so far after this move.\n\n           # the exponent is n - new_h, since the new_h-th digit is added to S1.\n\n           # for example, if new_h is 1, the digit is multiplied by 10^(n-1)\n\n           value = contribution + dp[new_h][new_k]\n\n           if value > max_value:\n\n               max_value = value\n\n               choice = 'H'\n\n       if (h +k) >= (n +1):\n\n           # can choose M\n\n           steps_taken = 2n -k\n\n           m_prev = steps_taken -h \n\n           # after taking M, m_prev increases by 1 → m_prev +1\n\n           # the exponent is n - (m_prev +1)\n\n           contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m_prev +1)))\n\n           new_h = h \n\n           new_k = k-1\n\n           value = contribution + dp[new_h][new_k]\n\n           if value > max_value:\n\n               max_value = value\n\n               choice = 'M'\n\n       dp[h][k] = max_value \n\n       choice_table[h][k] = choice \n\nBut how to compute the exponents? For example, for H's contribution, when choosing H, the new_h is h+1. The exponent is n - new_h. For example, if n is 2 and new_h is 1, exponent is 1, so 10^1.\n\nBut for n up to 18, 10^18 is a very large number, but Python can handle it.\n\nBut computing 10 ** (n - new_h) can be precomputed for all possible h and n.\n\nBut for each choice, during the DP steps, the code can calculate it on the fly.\n\nBut for n=18, the exponents can be up to 10^18, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nOnce the DP table is filled, the choice_table can be used to reconstruct the path.\n\nStarting from h=0, k=2n, and for each step, append the choice (H or M) and update h and k accordingly.\n\nBut how to reconstruct the path:\n\nInitialize h=0, k=2n.\n\nresult = ''\n\nfor _ in range(2n):\n\n   choice = choice_table[h][k]\n\n   result += choice\n\n   if choice == 'H':\n\n       h +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       m_prev = (2n -k) -h \n\n       # but since we are choosing M, the new k is k-1, and h remains the same.\n\n   k -=1\n\nSo, the code can loop 2n times, each time getting the choice and updating h and k.\n\nNow, the problem is that for some states, there may be multiple choices leading to the same maximum value. In such cases, the code can choose any of them. The problem statement allows any correct solution.\n\nBut how to handle that in the code? The choice_table can store the first choice that gives the maximum value, or any choice that gives the maximum.\n\nBut for the DP filling, when two options give the same value, the code can choose either. For example, in the code above, when the value is equal to the current max_value, the code can choose to keep the previous choice or update it. But since the problem allows any correct solution, we can just pick the first option.\n\nBut in the code above, for the first option (H), if it gives the same value as the current max_value, the code would not change the choice. So, for example, if both H and M choices give the same value, the code would choose H first. However, the problem requires that the code outputs any correct solution. So this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this DP approach.\n\nBut in Python, for n up to 18, the exponents 10^something can be very large. However, since Python handles big integers, that's okay.\n\nBut what about the time complexity? For each state (h, k), the code does O(1) operations. The number of states is O(n * 2n) = O(2n²). For n=18, 2*18² = 648. So, the code is very efficient.\n\nNow, the next step is to code this.\n\nBut first, how to precompute the digits.\n\nFor example, input is a string like '1234', then digits is [1,2,3,4].\n\nNow, for the DP table, we can create a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2n +1). But since for each test case, the DP is recomputed, this is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for n=18, 2n=36. So, the DP table is (19) x (37) = 703 entries.\n\nNow, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n and A.\n\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nCompute len(A) = 2n.\n\nInitialize a DP table and a choice table.\n\nBut since Python is 0-based, the code can process k from 0 to 2n.\n\nBut for the DP, we can use memoization with recursion, or use an iterative approach.\n\nLet's try the iterative approach.\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (2n +1), filled with 0 or some default values.\n\nBut for the iterative approach, we need to process the states in the order of decreasing k. Because for a state (h, k), the next states are (h+1, k-1) or (h, k-1), which have smaller k.\n\nSo, the code can process k from 2n down to 0.\n\nFor each k in range(2n, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in 0 ... n:\n\n        if k ==0:\n\n            if h ==n:\n\n                dp[h][k] = 0\n\n            else:\n\n                # invalid state, but since the problem ensures that the input is valid, this state is not reachable.\n\n                # but during the DP filling, we can set it to -infinity or something.\n\n                # but for the code, perhaps we can just set it to 0, but this may not matter.\n\n                pass\n\n        else:\n\n            current_digit = digits[2n -k]\n\n            max_val = -infinity\n\n            best_choice = ''\n\n            # check if H can be chosen\n\n            if h <n:\n\n                new_h = h +1\n\n                new_k = k-1\n\n                # contribution for H is current_digit * 10^{n - new_h}\n\n                exponent = n - new_h \n\n                contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent)\n\n                val = contribution + dp[new_h][new_k]\n\n                if val > max_val:\n\n                    max_val = val \n\n                    best_choice = 'H'\n\n            # check if M can be chosen\n\n            steps_taken = 2n -k \n\n            m_prev = steps_taken - h \n\n            if (h +k) >= (n +1):\n\n                # can choose M\n\n                # contribution is current_digit * 10^{n - (m_prev +1)}\n\n                exponent_m = n - (m_prev +1)\n\n                contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent_m)\n\n                new_h_m = h \n\n                new_k_m = k-1 \n\n                val = contribution + dp[new_h_m][new_k_m]\n\n                if val > max_val:\n\n                    max_val = val \n\n                    best_choice = 'M'\n\n            # assign dp[h][k] = max_val \n\n            # but what if no options are possible? For example, when k is not 0, but no H or M can be chosen. But according to the problem, the input is valid, and the code is called only for valid states.\n\n            # So, during the filling, the code must ensure that for each state, there is at least one option.\n\n            # So, for the code, we can assume that for the states that are processed, there is at least one option.\n\n            # So, assign dp[h][k] = max_val \n\n            dp[h][k] = max_val \n\n            choice_table[h][k] = best_choice \n\nBut how to initialize the dp table? For example, when k=0, and h=n, dp[n][0] =0. For other h, perhaps it's not reachable, but during the code, those states may not be processed.\n\nBut during the filling, for k=0, we can set dp[h][0] = 0 if h ==n, else some invalid value. However, during the processing of the states, those states will not be considered as valid.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed with initializing the dp table with 0 for all, but then during the processing, for k=0, set dp[h][0] =0 if h==n, else -infinity (to indicate invalid states). However, for the code, during the processing of k>0, the code will only consider valid transitions.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps during the processing of k=0, the code sets dp[h][0] to 0 if h ==n, else to -infinity. Then, for the other states, the code uses the transitions.\n\nBut how to handle this in Python? Well, perhaps during the initial setup, the dp is filled with -infinity, and then for the base case (k=0, h=n), set to 0.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (2n+1), filled with -infinity.\n\nThen, for k=0:\n\n   for h in 0..n:\n\n       if h ==n:\n\n           dp[h][k] =0 \n\n       else:\n\n           dp[h][k] = -infinity \n\nThen, for k from 2n down to 1:\n\n   for h in 0..n:\n\n       steps_taken = 2n -k \n\n       if steps_taken < h:\n\n           continue \n\n       if steps_taken -h >n:\n\n           continue \n\n       # process this state \n\n       current_digit = digits[2n -k]\n\n       max_val = -infinity \n\n       best_choice = ''\n\n       # check H option \n\n       if h <n:\n\n           new_h = h+1 \n\n           new_k = k-1 \n\n           exponent = n - new_h \n\n           contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent)\n\n           val = contribution + dp[new_h][new_k]\n\n           if val > max_val:\n\n               max_val = val \n\n               best_choice = 'H'\n\n       # check M option \n\n       if (h +k) >= (n +1):\n\n           steps_taken = 2n -k \n\n           m_prev = steps_taken -h \n\n           exponent_m = n - (m_prev +1)\n\n           contribution = current_digit * (10 ** exponent_m)\n\n           new_h_m = h \n\n           new_k_m = k-1 \n\n           val = contribution + dp[new_h_m][new_k_m]\n\n           if val > max_val:\n\n               max_val = val \n\n               best_choice = 'M'\n\n       dp[h][k] = max_val \n\n       choice_table[h][k] = best_choice \n\nBut how to handle cases where neither H nor M can be chosen? Well, according to the problem, the input is valid, and the code is only called for valid states, so during the processing, those states will not be encountered.\n\nBut during the code, for example, when k=1, and h=0, and n=1. Then steps_taken = 2*1 -1=1. So steps_taken is 1. h is 0. m_prev = 1-0 =1. So, for M option",
