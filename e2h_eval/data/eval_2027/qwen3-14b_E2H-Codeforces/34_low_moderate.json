And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I need to compute the average sleep time. Then, I have to output the average of all those averages. Oh right, but the way the problem is structured, maybe there's a smarter way than calculating each window from scratch.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line has n and k. Then the second line has n integers representing the sleep times. The output needs to be the average of all the averages of each week. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the average is the sum of all the weeks' total sleep times divided by the number of weeks. Because each week's average is (sum of k days)/k, and then the overall average is the average of all those. But since the number of weeks is (n - k + 1), maybe we can compute the sum of all the week sums and then divide by (n -k +1) *k ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For each week, the average is (sum of that week's days) / k. Then, the overall average is the average of all those values. So that's equal to (sum of all week sums) / (number of weeks * k). Because each week's average is sum_week /k, and the average of those is (sum of sum_week) / (number_of_weeks *k).\n\nAlternatively, the overall average is the same as the average of all the individual days, multiplied by k? No, that's not right. Because each day is counted in exactly k different weeks? No, wait. For example, if n=3 and k=2, the weeks are [day1, day2], [day2, day3]. Each day is in some number of weeks. Day1 is in 1 week, day2 in 2, day3 in 1. So the total sum of all week sums is (a1+a2) + (a2+a3) = a1 + 2a2 + a3. So the average of all the week averages is (a1 + 2a2 +a3) / (2k) ? Wait, the number of weeks is 2 here. So the average would be ( (a1+a2)/k + (a2+a3)/k ) / 2 = ( (a1 + 2a2 +a3) /k ) /2 = (a1 + 2a2 +a3) / (2k) ). Which is same as (sum of all week sums) divided by (number of weeks *k). Because sum of all week sums is (a1+a2 +a2+a3) = a1 + 2a2 +a3, and number of weeks is 2. So dividing by 2*k gives the average of the averages.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the sum of all the week sums, then dividing by (number_of_weeks *k). But how do I compute the sum of all week sums efficiently?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to compute each window's sum and add them up. However, with n up to 2e5, and k up to n, that would be O(nk) time, which is not feasible. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then the number of windows is 1e5+1, and each sum would take O(k) time, leading to O(1e10) operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to compute the sum of all the window sums. How can we do that?\n\nLet me think about the contribution of each element a[i] to the total sum. For each a[i], how many times does it appear in the sum of all windows? For example, in the case of n=3, k=2, a[1] appears once, a[2] appears twice, a[3] once. So the total sum is a[1] + 2a[2] + a[3].\n\nSo for each element a[i], the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of positions where the window starts at or before i and ends at or after i. Let's think about the number of windows that include a[i].\n\nThe first position in the window is s, and the last is s + k -1. So for a[i] to be included in the window, s <= i <= s +k -1. Which implies that s can range from max(1, i -k +1) to min(i, n -k +1). Wait, maybe there's a better way to compute the number of windows that include a[i].\n\nAlternatively, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as a sequence of `k` consecutive days from a list of `n` recorded sleep times. The goal is to efficiently calculate the average of all these weekly averages.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each week consists of `k` consecutive days. For `n` days, there are `n - k + 1` such weeks. The task is to find the average of the averages of each week's sleep times.\n2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Directly calculating the sum for each window would be inefficient. Instead, we use a sliding window technique to compute the sum of each window in linear time.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: We first compute the sum of the first window of size `k`. Then, for each subsequent window, we subtract the element that is left behind and add the new element that comes into the window. This allows us to compute each window's sum in constant time after the initial computation.\n4. **Total Sum of All Windows**: By iterating through all possible windows and maintaining their sums, we can accumulate the total sum of all window sums efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        # Read n and k\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            a = []\n        else:\n            a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n            idx += 1\n        # Compute the total sum of all windows\n        total = 0\n        window_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total += window_sum\n        for i in range(k, n):\n            window_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n            total += window_sum\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        average = total / (num_weeks * k)\n        # Print with 10 decimal digits\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing. Each test case is handled sequentially.\n2. **Initial Window Sum**: The sum of the first `k` elements is computed to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by adding the next element and subtracting the element that is no longer in the window. This ensures each window sum is calculated in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is accumulated and then divided by the product of the number of weeks and `k` to get the final average, which is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution runs in linear time, making it efficient even for large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
