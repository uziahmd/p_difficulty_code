    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find all the integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some point during the file copying process. \n\nSo, first, I need to understand how the progress bars work. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied. The second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied. \n\nThe key here is to simulate all possible moments when a byte is copied and check for each moment what the two percentages are. Then collect all the values that are present in both.\n\nBut simulating every byte might be computationally feasible since the maximum total bytes is 100 files * 1000 bytes = 100,000 bytes. For each byte, we can compute the two percentages and track when they are equal. However, even with 1e5 steps, it's manageable for Python.\n\nWait, but for each byte copied, there's a moment where the progress bars update. So for each byte x in file i, we can compute:\n\ncurrent_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\ntotal_percent = floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum)\n\nWhere sum_prev is the sum of all previous files before the current one, and total_sum is the total of all files.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the total sum of all files.\n2. For each file i, iterate through each byte x from 1 to a_i (since after each byte, the progress is updated).\n3. For each such x, calculate the current percent and the total percent.\n4. Check if these two percentages are equal. If so, add them to a set of possible values.\n5. Also, need to consider the initial state (0% for both) which is present before any bytes are copied. Because the problem says that initially both show 0.\n\nWait, the problem says that after copying each byte, the progress bars are updated. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. But according to the note in the first example, when there's one file, the bars are always the same. So for example, when the first byte is copied, the first bar is floor(100 * 1 / 6) = 16 (since 100/6 is ~16.666, floored to 16). The total is also 100 * 1 / 6 = same value. So the initial 0 is included as a valid value.\n\nSo the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is considered as 0 for both. So we need to include 0 in our result if there's at least one moment where both are 0. Which is always true, because the initial state is 0 for both. Wait, but the problem says \"moment time\" when both are showing the same number. So the initial moment is included. So 0 will always be part of the answer? Well, unless there's no moment when both are 0. But according to the problem statement, the initial state is 0 for both. So 0 is always present. However, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, the output includes 0 and others. But in the second sample input, the output starts with 0. So yes, 0 is always present. But wait, in the second sample input, the output is 0, 95, etc. So the initial 0 is included. Therefore, the code must include 0 as a possible value.\n\nBut how do we handle that? Because during the simulation, when we start, before any bytes are copied, both are 0. So we need to check that 0 is present. However, when we simulate each byte, the initial state isn't captured. So perhaps we need to add 0 to the set of possible values, unless there's a case where even that initial state is not considered. Wait, the problem says that the initial state is when both are 0. So that's a valid moment. So the answer must include 0, unless there's some edge case where even that is not considered. But according to the problem statement, the initial state is considered. For example, the first sample input's output includes 0.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nInitialize a set with 0. Then, for each byte copied, check if the two percentages are equal and add them to the set. Then, after processing all bytes, output the sorted list of the set.\n\nWait, but what about the final state? For example, when all bytes are copied. At that moment, both progress bars are 100%? Let me think. For the total progress bar, when all bytes are copied, the total is 100 * total_bytes / total_bytes = 100. But since it's floored, it's 100. Similarly for the current file. For example, if the last byte is copied, then for the current file, x is a_i, so 100 * x / a_i is exactly 100. So the current bar is 100, and the total is 100. So the 100% is also a valid value. Therefore, the code needs to check for that.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- Compute total_sum = sum(a)\n- Initialize a set to store the valid percentages.\n- Add 0 to the set (initial state)\n- For each file i in 0..n-1:\n   - For each x in 1..a[i]:\n      - current_percent = floor(100 * x / a[i])\n      - sum_so_far = sum of a[0] to a[i-1] + x\n      - total_percent = floor(100 * sum_so_far / total_sum)\n      - if current_percent == total_percent, add to the set\n- After processing all bytes, also check if 100 is present. Because when all bytes are copied, both bars are 100. But during the simulation, when x is the last byte of the last file, the sum_so_far will be total_sum, which gives 100. So that case is covered. So the code should capture that.\n\nBut wait, in the simulation, when x is the last byte of the last file, the code will compute sum_so_far as total_sum, and 100 * sum_so_far / total_sum is 100. So the code would add 100 to the set. But what if the last byte is processed, and the code adds 100. So yes, the code will capture that.\n\nSo the initial 0 is added, and the rest is handled by checking each byte.\n\nBut what about the moment when the last byte is copied? For example, in the first sample input, the output includes 100. So the code will add that.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Initialize the set with 0.\n- Iterate through all the bytes, and for each, compute the two percentages and add to the set if they are equal.\n- Finally, output the sorted list of the set.\n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is added, but maybe there are other times when the two percentages are 0. For example, during the copying of the first byte, if the current file's percentage is 0, and the total is also 0. But that's already covered in the simulation. However, the initial 0 is added regardless. But in the simulation, when x=1, for example, the current percent may be 0 (if the file is larger than 100 bytes?), but the total percent is 0. So adding those cases would be covered.\n\nBut why do we need to add 0 initially? Because the initial state is before any bytes are copied. However, during the simulation, when x=1, the code checks for the first byte. But the initial state is not part of the simulation steps. So for example, if the initial state is 0, but during the simulation, there is no moment when both are 0 again. But the initial state is a valid moment. So the code must include 0 in the set. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there's a case where during the simulation, the two percentages are 0 again. For example, when the first byte is copied, but the current percent is 0 and the total percent is 0. Then, the code would add 0 again. But the initial 0 is already in the set. However, the initial 0 is a valid moment. So even if during the simulation, 0 is added again, the set will have 0 once.\n\nSo the code should add 0 to the set, and then process all the bytes. But what about the case when the initial state is 0 and there's no other moment when both are 0. For example, in a case where after the first byte, the two percentages are 1 and 0. Then the set will have 0 from the initial state, and that's correct.\n\nBut how to make sure that the initial state is considered. Because in the simulation steps, when you process x=1, you are after the first byte. The initial state is before any bytes are copied. So the code must explicitly add 0 to the set. Because during the simulation, the initial state is not captured. \n\nYes. So the code must start with adding 0 to the set. Then process all the bytes. \n\nNow, the question is: How to simulate all the bytes?\n\nFor example, for each file i (from 0 to n-1), and for each x from 1 to a[i], compute the current percent and total percent. \n\nBut how to compute the sum_so_far?\n\nLet me think: For the current file i, the sum_prev is the sum of the first i files. Wait, no. Let's say the files are a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For the current file i (assuming 1-based?), when we are processing the x-th byte of that file, the sum_so_far is sum_{k=1}^{i-1} a_k + x. \n\nSo for example, for the first file (i=1), sum_prev is 0, and sum_so_far is x. For the second file, sum_prev is a_1, and sum_so_far is a_1 + x. \n\nSo to compute sum_prev for each file, we can precompute a prefix sum array. Let's say prefix_sums where prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the first i files. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a_1, prefix_sums[2] = a_1 + a_2, etc. Then, for the i-th file (assuming 1-based?), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i-1], and when processing x-th byte of this file, sum_so_far is prefix_sums[i-1] + x. \n\nSo the steps for code:\n\nRead n, then the list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nCompute prefix_sums as a list where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. So for 0-based indexes.\n\nThen, for each file index i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n       sum_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * sum_so_far) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nBut also, the initial 0 is added. \n\nWait, but what about the moment when all bytes are copied? For example, when x is a[i], and sum_so_far is prefix_sums[i] + a[i] = prefix_sums[i+1]. So for the last file, when x is a[i], sum_so_far is the total_sum. So the total_percent is (100 * total_sum) // total_sum = 100. And the current_percent is (100 * a[i])//a[i] = 100. So that case is covered. \n\nSo the code will capture 100% if it occurs. \n\nNow, the initial 0 is added. But what about the case when after some bytes, both percentages are 0 again? For example, if the first file is of size 1000 bytes. Then, when x is 1, current_percent is 0 (since 100*1/1000=0.1, floor is 0). The total percent is (sum_prev +x)/total_sum. Suppose the total_sum is 1000. Then sum_so_far is 1, so 100 * 1 / 1000 = 0.1, floor is 0. So current and total percent are 0. So during the simulation, this would be added again. But since we have a set, duplicates don't matter. \n\nSo the code will add 0 once, and any other occurrences of 0 during the simulation would be added again, but the set will have it once. \n\nSo the code seems correct. \n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python. \n\nBut let's think about the edge cases. For example, when a file is of size 1. Then, for x=1, current_percent is 100 * 1 / 1 = 100. \n\nAnother edge case is when the total_sum is zero, but according to the input constraints, a_i is at least 1, so total_sum is at least 1. \n\nAnother case: when a file has size 1, and the total_sum is 1. Then, after the first byte is copied, both percentages are 100. \n\nSo the code will capture that. \n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n, then the list a. \n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nCompute prefix_sums. Let's see:\n\nprefix_sums can be computed as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nBecause for the first file (i=1), prefix_sums[1] = a[0].\n\nOnce that is done, for each file i (from 0 to n-1), which corresponds to the i-th file (0-based in a), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i], and the current file is a[i]. \n\nSo for each x from 1 to a[i], compute current_percent and total_percent. \n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}\n\nThen loop through each file:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        sum_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * sum_so_far) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nOnce all are processed, collect the sorted list of the elements in the set. \n\nBut wait, what about the 100% case? For example, when the last byte is processed, the code will add 100. But if the code didn't process that, would it be missing? No, because during the simulation, when the last byte is processed, the code adds it. \n\nSo the code should handle that. \n\nNow, let's test against the sample input. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is 1\\n6. So n=1, a = [6]. \n\ntotal_sum = 6. \n\nprefix_sums is [0, 6]. \n\nLoop over i=0 (only file). sum_prev = 0. file_size=6. \n\nx ranges from 1 to 6. \n\nFor each x:\n\ncurrent_p is (100*x)//6. \n\nsum_so_far is 0 +x =x. total_p is (100*x)//6. \n\nSo current_p equals total_p. So for all x, the two percentages are equal. So the set will include 0, and all the percentages generated during the steps. \n\nBut for x=1: current_p is 16 (100*1/6=16.666... floored to 16). total_p is same. So added. \n\nSimilarly for x=2: 33. \n\nSo the set will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. \n\nWait, when x=6: (100*6)/6 = 100. So added. \n\nThus the output is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample. \n\nAnother sample input is '2\\n100 500'. So n=2, a=[100, 500]. total_sum = 600. \n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100, 600]. \n\nFirst, process the first file (i=0, sum_prev=0, file_size=100). For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)/100 = x. \n\nsum_so_far is 0 +x =x. total_p is (100x)/600 = x/6. \n\nWe need to check when x equals x/6. That's only when x is 0, which isn't in this loop. So for x from 1 to 100, current_p is x, and total_p is floor(x/6). So these are equal only when x is 0 (but not in the loop). So during this phase, no values are added except possibly when x is such that x equals floor(x/6). But that's impossible for x>0. So nothing is added during this phase. \n\nThen, for the second file (i=1, sum_prev=100, file_size=500). \n\nFor x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 *x )//500 = (x//5). \n\nsum_so_far = 100 +x. \n\ntotal_p = (100*(100 +x )) // 600. \n\nWe need to check when (x//5) equals (100*(100 +x )) // 600. \n\nBut let's think about when this happens. \n\nFor example, when x=500: current_p is (500*100)/500 = 100. sum_so_far is 100+500=600. total_p is 100*600/600=100. So added. \n\nBut during the processing of the second file, there might be some points where the two percentages are equal. \n\nBut according to the sample output for this input, the output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. \n\nSo the 0 is included. How does that happen? Well, the initial state is 0. \n\nBut during the processing of the second file, when x is such that the current_p and total_p are 95, etc. \n\nSo the code would capture those. \n\nBut the code would process all the steps and add those values. \n\nSo the code seems correct. \n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n, then a. \n\nCompute total_sum. \n\nCompute prefix_sums. \n\nInitialize the set. \n\nThen process each file and x. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input given, the inputs are like:\n\nFor example, the first input is ['1\\n6', ...], but in actual code, the input comes from stdin. So the code should read from stdin. \n\nSo code:\n\nRead n from input, then the list a. \n\nThen compute prefix_sums. \n\nImplementing prefix_sums:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\ntotal_sum = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nThen, create a set:\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nThen loop over each file and x:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        sum_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * sum_so_far) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list. \n\nThen, output the sorted list, each element on a separate line. \n\nWait, but the sample outputs show that for the first input, the output is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'. So the elements are sorted. \n\nSo in code:\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the output is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which are the numbers generated. \n\nBut how does the code handle the 100%? For example, in the first sample, when x=6, current_p is 100, and total_p is 100. So added to the set. \n\nSo the code will capture that. \n\nBut what about the case when the total_sum is 0? Well, the input constraints say that each a_i is at least 1, so total_sum is at least 1. \n\nNow, let's test the code against the second sample input. \n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nSo total_sum is 600. \n\nProcessing the first file (size 100):\n\nfor x in 1..100:\n\ncurrent_p = x. \n\nsum_so_far = x. \n\ntotal_p = (100 * x) // 600. \n\nSo for x=1: 1 vs 0.166... → 0. So not equal. \n\nNo additions during this phase. \n\nThen, processing the second file (sum_prev = 100, size 500). \n\nFor x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * x) // 500 = x//5. \n\nsum_so_far = 100 + x. \n\ntotal_p = (100*(100 +x )) // 600. \n\nWe need to find x where x//5 equals (100*(100 +x )) // 600. \n\nLet me think for x= 500:\n\ncurrent_p = 500//5 = 100. sum_so_far = 600. total_p = 100*600/600=100. So added. \n\nWhat about when x is 575? Well, the file is size 500, so x can't be more than 500. \n\nLet me think for x= 475:\n\ncurrent_p = 475//5 = 95. \n\nsum_so_far = 100 + 475 = 575. \n\ntotal_p = (100 * 575) // 600 = 57500 // 600 = 95.833... → 95. So current_p is 95 and total_p is 95. So added. \n\nSo 95 is in the set. \n\nSimilarly, for x=476:\n\ncurrent_p is 476//5 = 95.2 → 95. \n\nsum_so_far = 100+476=576. \n\ntotal_p = (100 * 576)/600 = 57600 / 600 = 96 → 96. \n\nSo current_p is 95, total_p is 96. Not equal. \n\nSo no addition. \n\nWhat about x=480? \n\ncurrent_p is 480//5 = 96. \n\nsum_so_far is 100+480=580. \n\ntotal_p = 580 * 100 / 600 = 58000 / 600 = 96.666... → 96. \n\nSo current_p is 96, total_p is 96. So added. \n\nSo 96 is added. \n\nSimilarly, for x= 485:\n\ncurrent_p = 485//5 = 97. \n\nsum_so_far = 585. \n\ntotal_p = 585 * 100 /600 = 97.5 → 97. So equal. \n\nSo added. \n\nSimilarly for x=490:\n\ncurrent_p = 490//5=98. sum_so_far=590. total_p is 590*100/600= 98.333 → 98. Equal. \n\nx=495: 495//5=99. sum_so_far=595. 595*100/600= 99.166 → 99. Equal. \n\nx=500: 100, as discussed. \n\nSo the set will include 95,96,97,98,99,100. Plus 0. \n\nWhich matches the sample output. \n\nThus, the code works for that case. \n\nAnother sample input is '4\\n1000 2 2 998' which outputs 0,50,99,100. \n\nLet me think about that. \n\nTotal_sum is 1000 +2 +2 +998 = 2002. \n\nFor the first file (size 1000). \n\nsum_prev is 0. \n\nFor x from 1 to 1000:\n\ncurrent_p is (100 *x)/1000 = x/10. \n\nsum_so_far = x. \n\ntotal_p = (100 *x)/2002. \n\nWe need to find when x/10 equals floor(100x/2002). \n\nBut during this phase, the only possible case when they are equal is when x is 0 (initial) or when x= 1000. \n\nBut during the simulation, for x= 1000, current_p is 100, sum_so_far is 1000. total_p is (100 * 1000)/2002 = 50 (approx 49.95... → 49). So not equal. \n\nSo during the first file, nothing is added except maybe some cases. \n\nBut during the processing of the fourth file, perhaps there's a case where the percentages are 50. \n\nBut let's think of the sum_prev for the fourth file. \n\nprefix_sums for the 4 files: \n\nprefix_sums[0] = 0 \n\nprefix_sums[1] = 1000 \n\nprefix_sums[2] = 1000 + 2 = 1002 \n\nprefix_sums[3] = 1002 + 2 = 1004 \n\nprefix_sums[4] = 1004 + 998 = 2002. \n\nSo for the fourth file (i=3, 0-based), sum_prev is prefix_sums[3] = 1004. \n\nfile_size is 998. \n\nSo for x in 1..998:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * x) // 998 \n\nsum_so_far = 1004 +x \n\ntotal_p = (100 * (1004 +x )) // 2002 \n\nWe need to find x where current_p equals total_p. \n\nLet me think when x is 998. \n\nsum_so_far is 1004 + 998 = 2002. \n\ntotal_p is (100 * 2002)/2002 = 100. \n\ncurrent_p is (100 * 998)/998 = 100. So added. \n\nBut what about when x is 1004 + x = 1001? \n\nWait, for example, when x is 1004 +x = 1001 → x = 1001 - 1004 = -3? No. \n\nWait, sum_so_far is 1004 +x. \n\nWe need to find x such that (100x)/998 ≈ (100*(1004 +x )) / 2002. \n\nLet me simplify the equation. Let me ignore the floor for a moment. \n\nLet’s suppose that:\n\n(100x)/998 = (100 (1004 + x )) / 2002 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2002 * 998:\n\n100x * 2002 = 100 (1004 +x ) * 998 \n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\nx * 2002 = (1004 +x ) * 998 \n\nExpand RHS: 1004 * 998 + x * 998 \n\nRearranged:\n\nx * 2002 - x * 998 = 1004 * 998 \n\nx * (2002 - 998) = 1004 * 998 \n\nCalculate 2002 - 998 = 1004 \n\nSo x * 1004 = 1004 * 998 → x = 998 \n\nWhich is the case where x is 998, which is the last byte of the fourth file. \n\nSo that gives 100% as before. \n\nBut what about when sum_so_far is 1001. \n\nsum_so_far = 1001. \n\ntotal_p = 100 * 1001 / 2002 = 100 * 1001 / 2002 = 100 * 0.5 = 50. \n\nSo total_p is 50. \n\nWhat's the current_p for that case? \n\nsum_so_far is 1004 +x = 1001 → x = 1001 - 1004 = -3. Which is impossible. So no. \n\nBut maybe during the processing of the fourth file, when x is such that sum_so_far is 1001. \n\nBut sum_prev is 1004. So sum_so_far is 1004 +x. So for sum_so_far to be 1001, x would have to be negative. Which is not possible. \n\nSo how do we get 50% in this case? \n\nAh, perhaps during the third file. \n\nWait, let's think. \n\nThe third file is size 2. \n\nsum_prev for the third file is prefix_sums[2] = 1002. \n\nSo during processing the third file (i=2, 0-based), sum_prev is 1002, and x is 1 or 2. \n\nFor x=1:\n\nsum_so_far = 1002 +1 = 1003. \n\ntotal_p = (100 * 1003) // 2002 = 100300 // 2002. \n\nLet me compute that. \n\n2002 * 50 = 100100. \n\n100300 - 100100 = 200. \n\nSo 100300 // 2002 is 50. \n\ncurrent_p is (100 * 1) // 2 = 50. \n\nSo current_p and total_p are both 50. So added. \n\nThus, 50 is added to the set. \n\nThat explains why in the sample output for this case, 50 is present. \n\nSo the code will capture that. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nNow, implementing this in Python. \n\nPotential corner cases to consider:\n\n- All files are 1 byte. For example, n=2, a=[1,1]. \n\ntotal_sum is 2. \n\nInitial 0 is added. \n\nFor first file (x=1):\n\ncurrent_p = 100 *1 /1 = 100. \n\nsum_so_far = 1. \n\ntotal_p = 100 *1 /2 = 50. So 100 !=50. \n\nFor second file, sum_prev is 1. \n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_p is 100*1/1=100. \n\nsum_so_far = 1+1=2. total_p is 100*2/2 = 100. \n\nSo added. \n\nSo the set is {0, 100}. \n\nAnother case: n=1, a=[1]. \n\nInitial 0 is added. \n\nx=1: current_p 100, total_p 100. So added. \n\nThus, output is 0, 100. \n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[1, 1]. \n\nThe initial 0. \n\nProcessing first file x=1: current_p 100, total_p 50. Not equal. \n\nProcessing second file x=1: current_p 100, total_p 100. So added. \n\nThus, the set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: when during processing, the same percentage is achieved multiple times, but the set ensures uniqueness. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then a. \n\nCompute prefix_sums. \n\nCompute total_sum. \n\nInitialize result as {0}. \n\nLoop through each file and x. \n\nFinally, sort and print. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input. But for Python, the input is read via input() function. \n\nBut for the code, the input is given as per the problem statement. \n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\nresult = {0}\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n        sum_so_far = sum_prev + x\n        total_p = (100 * sum_so_far) // total_sum\n        if current_p == total_p:\n            result.add(current_p)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nThis code should handle all cases. \n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. \n\nprefix_sums is [0, 6]. \n\nLoop for i=0, sum_prev=0, file_size=6. \n\nx ranges from 1 to 6. \n\nFor x=1: current_p = 100*1//6=16, sum_so_far=1, total_p=100*1//6=16. So added. \n\nSimilarly for x=2: 200//6=33. \n\nAnd so on. \n\nThe result set includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. \n\nWhich matches the first sample. \n\nAnother sample input is the second one. \n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer percentages between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the cumulative size of files up to each point.\n3. **Simulation**: For each byte copied in each file, calculate the current progress percentage and the overall progress percentage. Check if these percentages are equal and record them.\n4. **Result Collection**: Collect all unique percentages where both progress bars show the same value, including the initial 0% state before any bytes are copied.\n5. **Output**: Sort and print the collected percentages.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\nresult = {0}\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n        sum_so_far = sum_prev + x\n        total_p = (100 * sum_so_far) // total_sum\n        if current_p == total_p:\n            result.add(current_p)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their sizes. These are read and stored in a list.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: A prefix sum array is constructed to quickly determine the cumulative size of files up to each index, which helps in calculating the overall progress percentage efficiently.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, the current progress percentage (for the current file) and the overall progress percentage (for all files combined) are calculated. If these values match, they are added to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n4. **Initial State**: The initial state where both progress bars show 0% is explicitly added to the set.\n5. **Sorting and Output**: The collected percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible moments when both progress bars show the same percentage are considered, leveraging efficient calculations and set operations to handle uniqueness and sorting.",
