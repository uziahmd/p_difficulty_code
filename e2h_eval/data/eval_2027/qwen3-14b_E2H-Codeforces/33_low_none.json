You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about replacing digits in a number 'a' with digits from a sequence 's' to make the maximum possible number. Each element in 's' can be used at most once. The goal is to choose which digits to replace and in what order to maximize the number.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, the key is to replace the digits in 'a' with the largest possible digits from 's', but in a way that each replacement is optimal. But how?\n\nThe strategy should be to go through each digit of 'a' from left to right (since the leftmost digits have higher weight), and for each digit, if there's a larger digit available in 's', replace it. But since we can use the digits in 's' in any order, but each only once, we need to select the best possible replacements.\n\nBut how to efficiently find which digits to replace?\n\nLet me think: The optimal approach would be to sort the 's' digits in descending order. Then, for each position in 'a' from left to right, if the current digit is less than the next available digit in the sorted 's', replace it. Otherwise, leave it as is. Because replacing a left digit with a larger one gives a bigger gain than replacing a right digit.\n\nWait, but the sorted s needs to be processed in a way that we can take the largest possible digits first. So let's sort s in descending order. Then, for each digit in a, starting from the left, if the current digit is less than the next available digit in s, replace it. Otherwise, skip.\n\nFor example, let's take the first sample input:\n\na is 1024, s is 010. So sorted s in descending order is 1,0,0. Then, process each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is 1. The first element in sorted s is 1. Since 1 is not less than 1, we don't replace. Then, move to next digit.\n\nSecond digit is 0. The next available in s is 1. Since 0 < 1, replace. Now, the s list has 0,0 left. So the second digit becomes 1. Then, third digit is 2. Next available is 0. 2 is larger than 0, so no replacement. Fourth digit is 4, same as before. So the result is 1124, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input: a is 987, s is 1234567. Sorted s is 7,6,5,4,3,2,1. Now, check each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is 9. The first element in s is 7. 9 is larger than 7, so no replacement. Second digit is 8. Next s element is 7. 8 is larger than 7, no replacement. Third digit is 7. Next s element is 7. Since 7 is equal, no replacement. So the output is 987. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read a as a string (since it's a big number, but we can process it as a string).\n2. Read s as a string, then sort it in descending order.\n3. Iterate over each character in a, and for each position, if the current digit is less than the next available digit in the sorted s, replace it and move to the next s digit. Else, leave it as is.\n4. Once we have processed all digits of a or all digits of s, return the modified a.\n\nBut how to manage the sorted s? For example, after sorting, we can have a list, and for each step, we check if the current digit is less than the next element in the sorted list. If yes, replace, and remove that element from the list. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nWait, but the sorted list can be processed as a pointer. Let me think:\n\nSort s in descending order. Then, for each digit in a (from left to right), check if the current digit is less than the first element of the sorted s. If yes, replace it with that element, and remove that element from the sorted s. Then proceed. Else, leave it as is.\n\nBut the sorted s is a list, and we can process it in order. Let's see:\n\nFor example, sorted s is [9,7,5,3, ...]. Then, for each digit in a, we check if the current digit is less than the first element of the sorted s. If yes, replace and pop the first element. Else, leave it.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nYes, because the sorted s is in descending order. So, for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given integer `a` by replacing its digits with digits from a sequence `s`. Each digit in `s` can be used at most once, and the goal is to use the digits in `s` in such a way that the resulting number is the largest possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input values for the integer `a` and the sequence `s`.\n2. **Sorting**: Sort the sequence `s` in descending order to prioritize using the largest available digits first.\n3. **Greedy Replacement**: Traverse each digit of `a` from left to right. For each digit, if it can be replaced by a larger digit from the sorted sequence `s`, perform the replacement. This ensures that we maximize the value of the number by making the most significant changes first.\n4. **Efficient Replacement**: Use a pointer to track the current position in the sorted sequence `s`, ensuring each digit is used only once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    a = input[0]\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    # Sort s in descending order\n    sorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Convert a to a list for easy manipulation\n    a_list = list(a)\n    \n    # Pointer for sorted_s\n    s_ptr = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(a_list)):\n        if s_ptr < len(sorted_s) and a_list[i] < sorted_s[s_ptr]:\n            a_list[i] = sorted_s[s_ptr]\n            s_ptr += 1\n    \n    print(''.join(a_list))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string split into two parts: the integer `a` and the sequence `s`.\n2. **Sorting**: The sequence `s` is sorted in descending order to ensure we always consider the largest available digit first.\n3. **Greedy Replacement**: By iterating through each digit of `a` from left to right, we check if the current digit can be replaced by a larger digit from the sorted sequence. If so, we replace it and move the pointer in the sorted sequence forward. This ensures that each replacement contributes maximally to the overall value of the number.\n4. **Output**: After processing all digits, the modified digits are joined into a string and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the number `a` is maximized using the available digits from `s`, adhering to the constraints and achieving optimal performance.",
