Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the ones that have gone out. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is 'b' used candles to make one new one. And this new candle can be used again, possibly leading to more cycles.\n\nThe goal is to find the total number of hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles. That's 4 hours. Then, he has 4 used candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new ones. So he uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, he has 2 used ones. He can make 2/2=1 new. Use that, adding 1 hour. Now, he has 1 used candle. Not enough to make another (since b=2). So total is 4+2+1=7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 3. Output is 8. Let's see:\n\nStart with 6, 6 hours. Then, 6 used. 6/3=2 new. Use them, 2 hours. Now, 2 used. Not enough for 3. Wait, but maybe there's a way to collect more? Wait, after using the 2 new ones, you have 2 used. But then you can't make any more. So total is 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nThe idea is to keep track of the total hours and the number of used candles. Let me think of the steps:\n\nInitialize total_hours = a. Because initially, he uses all a candles, each burning for an hour. Then, the number of used candles is a. Then, while the number of used candles is >= b, we can make new candles.\n\nBut wait, each time you make new candles, you take (used // b) new ones. But then, after making them, those new ones are used, so they contribute to the total hours. Also, the used candles after making new ones would be (used % b) + (number of new candles made), because the new candles are used once, so after making them, they become used again.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let's say we have 'used' candles. We can make new_candles = used // b. Then, the number of used candles after this process is (used % b) + new_candles. Because the new_candles are now used once, so they add to the used pile. Wait, no. Because when you make new candles, you take 'b' used ones to make one new. So, for example, if you have 4 used candles and b=2, you make 2 new. Then, those 2 new candles are used (burned) in the next step. So after making the new ones, the used candles are (4 - 2*b) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2. Wait, but that's equivalent to (used % b) + new_candles. Because 4 % 2 is 0, plus 2 (new_candles) equals 2.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours starts as a.\n\nused = a\n\nthen, while used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    used = (used % b) + new_candles \n\nRepeat until used < b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because each time, we take the used candles, convert them into new ones, add the new ones to the total hours, and then the remaining used candles are the leftover from the conversion plus the new ones that have been used (since after making them, they are used again).\n\nSo for example, in the first case:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours = 4. used =4.\n\nLoop:\n\nused >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 =2. total becomes 4+2=6.\n\nused becomes 4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, loop:\n\nused=2 >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles=2//2=1. total is 6+1=7.\n\nused becomes 0 +1=1. Now, less than 2. So exit. Total is 7.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3.\n\ntotal_hours =6. used=6.\n\n",
