    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nThe input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. If there's no such substring, return 0.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nBut since the string can be up to 100 characters long, the number of possible substrings is O(n^2), which for n=100 is 10,000. For each substring, we can check all possible starting positions and see if it appears again elsewhere.\n\nBut how to efficiently do this?\n\nLet me think. For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once we find the maximum L where this is true, return it.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths L from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1. For each L, check all possible substrings of length L. For each such substring, check if it appears again in the string. If any such substring is found, return L as the answer.\n\n2. The maximum possible L is len(s) - 1, because for a substring to appear twice, it needs to have at least two positions. For example, in a string of length 5, the maximum possible L is 4 (like 'aaaaa' has substrings of length 4 'aaaa' appearing twice).\n\nWait, but for a string of length N, the maximum possible L where a substring can appear twice is N-1. Because for example, if the string is 'aa', then L=1, and the substring 'a' appears twice. But for a string of length 3, the maximum L is 2, like in 'aaa', the substring 'aa' appears twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So yes, the maximum possible L is N-1. So for the loop, we can start checking from L = len(s)-1 down to 1. Once we find the first L where there's a duplicate substring, return it. If none are found, return 0.\n\nSo for each possible L, starting from the largest possible, check all possible substrings of length L. For each substring, check if it occurs more than once.\n\nBut how to check if a substring occurs more than once? For each substring of length L, collect all the starting indices, and see if there are at least two different starting positions.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking existence, perhaps we can use a set. For each L, iterate through all possible starting positions i (from 0 to len(s) - L), and collect the substrings. If any substring is found more than once, then return L as the answer.\n\nWait, but how to check that? For example, for each L, we can create a dictionary where the keys are the substrings, and the values are the count of how many times they appear. Then, for any key with count >= 2, we can return L.\n\nBut since we are checking from largest L down, once we find such a substring, we can immediately return that L as the maximum.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor L in range (max_len, 0, -1):\n\n   create a set or a dictionary to track substrings of length L.\n\n   for i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr is already in the set, then return L.\n\n       else add it to the set.\n\n   if after checking all substrings of length L, there's at least one that appears twice, then return L.\n\nWait, but the code above would check for duplicates as we go. For example, for each substring, if we have already seen it before, then we can immediately return L. Because once we find a duplicate for this L, we can stop processing and return.\n\nBut for the case where multiple substrings of the same L exist, but only one of them is duplicated. So, for example, for L=3, if the string is 'ababa', then the substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). So when we process i=0, add 'aba' to the set. Then i=1, add 'bab'. Then i=2, check 'aba' again. Since it's already in the set, return L=3.\n\nYes. So this approach would work.\n\nBut for the code, for each L, we need to check all possible substrings of length L, and see if any of them appears more than once.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nIn Python, for each L, we can loop from i=0 to len(s) - L. For each i, take the substring s[i:i+L]. We can keep a set of the substrings we have seen so far. If during the iteration, we find that the current substring is already in the set, then return L as the answer. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nBut wait, the same substring can be found multiple times. For example, in 'aaaaa', for L=2, the substrings are 'aa', 'aa', 'aa', 'aa'. So during the iteration, the first occurrence is added to the set, then the second occurrence is checked and found in the set. So return L=2.\n\nBut for the code, we can process each L in descending order. Once we find that for a certain L, there is a duplicate substring, then return that L as the maximum possible.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nCompute the maximum possible L as len(s) - 1. Then check for each L from that maximum down to 1.\n\nFor each L, check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice.\n\nOnce found, return L.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, no such substring is found, return 0.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\ns = input string\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but for the example input given:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → Output is 0.\n\nBecause for L=3, possible substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates. For L=2, 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no duplicates. For L=1, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' → no duplicates. So returns 0.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → Output is 3. Let's see:\n\nFor L=4 (n-1 is 4, since len(ababa) is 5). Check substrings of length 4:\n\npositions 0-3: 'abab', 1-4: 'baba'. No duplicates. So move to L=3.\n\nCheck substrings of length 3:\n\ni=0 → 'aba', add to set.\n\ni=1 → 'bab', add.\n\ni=2 → 'aba' → already in the set. So return 3. Which is correct.\n\nThird sample input: 'zzz' → output is 2. Let's see.\n\nlen(s) is 3. So L starts at 2. Check substrings of length 2:\n\npositions 0-1: 'zz', 1-2: 'zz'. So during the loop, when i=1, substr is 'zz' which is already in the set (added when i=0). So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works for the examples.\n\nBut what about overlapping occurrences? Like in 'aaaaa', for L=2, the substrings are 'aa' (positions 0,1,2,3). So the code would find that 'aa' is present multiple times. So returns 2. But the maximum possible is 4 (for L=4, the substring 'aaaa' occurs twice: positions 0-3 and 1-4). Wait, but in this case, for L=4, the code would check substrings of length 4. For the string 'aaaaa', the substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). So during the loop, when i=1, substr is 'aaaa' which is already in the set (from i=0), so returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would handle that.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where the entire string is the same character, like 'aaaaa' → the maximum L is 4, which is len(s)-1. So code returns 4.\n\nAnother case: string of length 2, like 'aa' → returns 1. Because for L=1, the substrings are 'a' and 'a' → which is found in the set. So returns 1.\n\nAnother case: string of length 1 → output is 0. Because there's no possible substring that can appear twice. But according to the problem statement, the input string is non-empty. So for input of length 1, output is 0.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, what about the code? Let's think about the code.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nif n < 2: return 0.\n\nElse, for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n\n   for i in 0 ... n-L:\n\n      substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n      if substr in seen: return L\n\n      else add to seen.\n\nSo for each L, check all possible substrings, and if any is found twice, return L.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first input line containing the string. Wait, the example shows input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but that's probably a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nBut the example shows input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and outputs ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nWait, perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases. But the actual problem is that the code should read a single string from stdin, and output the answer. But the example shows that perhaps the input is a list of strings. Wait, maybe the original problem was presented with multiple test cases, but the user's input is a single string.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nSo the code should read a single string. But the example shows that the input is a list of three strings. But that's probably an error in the problem description. Because in the sample input, it's written as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but that's perhaps a mistake. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one string per input line.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the original problem is that the input is a single string, and the sample input is perhaps a mistake.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and output the desired output. So for example, for the sample input, perhaps the input is three separate test cases, but the code needs to process each one. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo the code should read a single string from input. But in the sample input, there are three strings. That suggests that perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem statement is unclear.\n\nBut the sample input and output are given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWhich implies that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nBut the original problem may have been presented with multiple test cases. However, the user's instruction says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each being a string. But the original problem says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is conflicting. However, looking back at the problem statement, the sample input shows three strings, and the sample output shows three numbers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each being a string, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the actual code should process a single string.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should be ready to run and not include any explanations. So perhaps the original problem is that the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list for illustrative purposes, but the actual input is a single string.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nSo the code should read a single string. For example, for the sample input, perhaps the first input line is 'abcd', and the output is 0, then another input line 'ababa' gives 3, etc. But the sample input shows all three in a list. So perhaps the problem is that the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So maybe the sample input is a mistake, and the code should process a single string. However, the sample input and output suggest that there are multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a problem. How to resolve this?\n\nWell, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut in reality, the code would need to process each of these strings as separate test cases. Therefore, perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a string, and for each, output the answer.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. Which implies that there is only one string to process.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, given that the sample input shows three strings and the output three numbers, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read all lines from input, process each as a string, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. Which suggests that the code is supposed to process one string. However, the sample input shows three strings. Maybe the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to pass the input as a list, but in reality, the code should read from stdin, which for the sample input would be three lines, each being a string.\n\nBut this is ambiguous. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. So for example, in the sample input, the input is three strings, each on a separate line, and the output is three numbers, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first line. So perhaps the sample is incorrect, and the actual code should process one string.\n\nBut given that the sample shows three inputs and outputs, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each being a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nFor example, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    # process s and output the answer\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code should read one line, process it, and output one number.\n\nBut the sample shows three input strings. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one string. However, the user's note says that the code should be ready to run, which implies that the code should handle the sample input correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the code should read a list of strings. However, in practice, when you run code in programming contests, the input is usually given as a single line per test case.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps the original problem is that the code should process a single string. So the sample input is perhaps a mistake, and the code should process a single string.\n\nIn that case, the code would be as discussed before.\n\nBut the sample input shows three strings, and the output three numbers. So perhaps the problem is that the code should process multiple test cases. For example, the code reads all lines from input, and for each line, outputs the answer.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list, but the actual input is a single line. For example, in the sample input, the first input line is 'abcd', then the next is 'ababa', then 'zzz'.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should process one string.

However, given that the sample input shows three strings and outputs three numbers, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, in that case, the code should read all lines from input, process each as a string, and for each, output the answer.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nSo, in the sample input, the code would read three lines, each being a string, and output three lines of answers.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        max_len = 0\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            else:\n\n                continue\n\n            break\n\n        else:\n\n            print(0)\n\nBut wait, this code would process each line. For each string, it checks for the maximum L. Let me think about the code structure.\n\nFor each line (string s):\n\n   n = len(s)\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n       seen = set()\n\n       for i in 0 ...:\n\n           substr = ...\n\n           if in seen: print(L) and break out of loops.\n\n       if found, break and proceed to next line.\n\n   else:\n\n       print(0)\n\nBut in Python, the code for this would be:\n\nBut the code inside the for line loop would be:\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    found = False\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(0)\n\nBut this would handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. However, the sample shows three strings. So this code would handle that.\n\nBut the original problem may have a different setup. However, given that the sample shows three inputs and outputs, and the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nBut let's look back at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nAssuming that each of these is on a separate line, the code would process each and output the respective numbers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 'abcd', which has output 0, the second 'ababa' outputs 3, the third 'zzz' outputs 2.\n\nSo the code would produce the correct outputs.\n\nNow, let's test the code for the sample input 'zzz' (length 3). For L=2 (n-1 is 2). The code checks substrings of length 2: 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). When i=1, substr is 'zz' which is already in the set, so returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' (length 5). For L=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). So returns 4.\n\nNow, considering the code for the case where the string is 'a', the code would have n=1. Then, the loop for L in range(0, 0, -1) does not run. Then, print 0.\n\nAnother case: 'aa' (n=2). L starts at 1. For L=1, the substrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). So returns 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, the for loop for L in range(n-1, 0, -1). For n=2, n-1 is 1. So the loop runs for L=1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input 'ababa' would process L=4 (n-1=5-1=4). The substrings of length 4 are 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1). No duplicates. Then L=3. The substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. When i=2, substr is 'aba', which is already in the set. So returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, the problem says that the code must be written as a Python script that reads input from stdin and outputs to stdout. So the code should handle multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. However, the sample input shows multiple strings, so I think that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement's sample input is incorrect, and the actual code should process a single string. However, given that the sample shows three strings and outputs, it's better to assume that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code would be written as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if not found:\n\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but in reality, when reading from stdin, each line is a string. So perhaps the sample input is three lines, each containing one of the strings.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is written as a list, but the actual code should read each string as a separate line.\n\nSo for example, the input would be:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nAnd the output would be:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nBut the code above would process each line and output the correct answer.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is said to be the first line. So perhaps the code should read only one line. But the sample shows three lines. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, I think that the code should process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\nBut let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nAssuming that each of these is on a separate line, the code would output 0, 3, 2 on separate lines. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first line. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to pass the input as a list, but the actual code should read one line. However, given the ambiguity, the code that passes the sample input and output is the one that processes multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is that the input is a single string, and the sample input is written incorrectly. For example, the sample input may be:\n\nInput:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nOutput:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nBut the problem says that the first line contains the string. So perhaps the code should read one line, but the sample shows three lines. This is very confusing.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and output as ['0', '3', '2'], it's possible that the code is supposed to read a list of strings, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code should process a single string, and the sample input is written in a way that the three strings are separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process each one. But in that case, the code would need to read all the test cases from input.\n\nBut without further information, it's hard to say. However, the code that handles multiple test cases is more likely to pass the sample input, assuming that each line is a test case.\n\nThus, the code I wrote above is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nFor the sample input:\n\nInput line 1: abcd → output 0.\n\nInput line 2: ababa → output 3.\n\nInput line 3: zzz → output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: input 'aaaaa' → output 4.\n\nAnother test case: input 'a' → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input 'aa' → output 1.\n\nAll handled correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The solution must efficiently handle overlapping occurrences and work for strings up to a maximum length of 100 characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read multiple lines of input, each representing a separate test case.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each string, check all possible substring lengths starting from the longest possible (length of the string minus one) down to 1.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each length, use a set to track substrings encountered. If a substring is found more than once, return the current length as the result.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid length is found, terminate further checks for that string to ensure efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input lines from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n2. **Length Iteration**: For each string, the algorithm starts checking from the longest possible substring length (which is `len(s) - 1`) down to 1.\n3. **Substring Tracking**: For each length, a set is used to keep track of substrings. If a substring is encountered again, the current length is printed and the loop breaks early.\n4. **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible length downwards, the solution ensures that the first valid length found is the maximum possible, thus optimizing the search process.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the longest repeating substring while handling multiple test cases as specified in the problem's sample input.",
