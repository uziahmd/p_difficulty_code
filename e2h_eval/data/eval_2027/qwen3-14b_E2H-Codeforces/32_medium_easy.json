    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what instability is. It's the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, when we remove one element, we want this difference to be as small as possible.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be: for each element in the array, consider removing it, then compute the max and min of the remaining elements, and track the minimum instability. However, if the array is large (like up to 1e5 elements), this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. For n=1e5, that's 1e10 operations, which won't work.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). When we remove one element, the new max and min could be either the same as before (if the removed element wasn't the max or min) or they could change.\n\nWait, but if the array has multiple instances of the max or min, removing one of them might not affect the overall max or min. For example, if there are two 3s and one 7, removing the 7 would leave the max as 3. But if there's only one 7 and multiple 3s, removing the 7 would make the new max the next highest number.\n\nSo the key idea here is that the optimal element to remove is either the maximum or the minimum. Because if you remove a max, the new max is the second highest, and similarly for min. But wait, maybe not always. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], removing 1 gives instability 3 (4-2=2?), no, wait 4-2 is 2. Wait, original instability is 3 (4-1). If you remove 1, instability is 4-2=2. If you remove 4, instability is 3-1=2. So in this case, removing either end gives the same result.\n\nBut how do we find the best element to remove? Well, the minimal instability after removal can be achieved by considering two cases:\n\nCase 1: Remove the first element (the min) or the last element (the max) of the sorted array.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Let's think again. Suppose the array is sorted. Let's say the array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. Then the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, if we remove a[0], the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If we remove a[-1], the new instability is a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal between these two options. But what if there are duplicates?\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], as in the example. The sorted array is [1,3,3,7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove 7, the instability becomes 3-1=2. If we remove 1, it's 7-3=4. So the minimal is 2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo, the idea is that the minimal instability after removing one element can be found by considering the cases where we remove the first element (min) or the last element (max) of the sorted array. However, what if there are multiple minima or maxima?\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 7], then removing one of the 1s would give a new instability of 7-1=6, but removing the 7 would give instability 3-1=2. So again, the best is to remove the max.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 3, 3, 7]. Removing 7 gives instability 3-1=2. Removing 1 gives 7-3=4. So again, best to remove the max.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The original instability is 4. If we remove 1, the instability is 4 (5-2=3?), wait 5-2 is 3. If we remove 5, it's 4-1=3. So the minimal is 3. But if we remove 2, the instability is 5-1=4, which is worse. So the best is to remove either the first or last element.\n\nSo, the conclusion here is that the optimal choice is to remove either the first element (min) or the last element (max) of the sorted array. Therefore, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (max of the array after removing the first element) minus (min of the array after removing the first element) and (max of the array after removing the last element) minus (min of the array after removing the last element).\n\nWait, but in the sorted array, removing the first element would leave the max as the original max (since the first element is the min). So the new instability is (a[-1] - a[1]). Similarly, removing the last element (the max), the new instability is (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nSo the answer is min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) ) ?\n\nWait, but what if the array has more than one element that's the same as the min or max?\n\nFor example, if the array is [1,1,2,3]. The original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the first element (1), the array becomes [1,2,3], instability 2. If we remove the last element (3), the array becomes [1,1,2], instability 1. So the minimal is 1. Which is the min between (a[-1] - a[1]) = 3-1=2 and (a[-2] - a[0]) = 2-1=1. So yes, the min between those two.\n\nSo this seems to work. Therefore, the approach would be:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what if the array has n=2 elements? For example, input is [1, 100000], then after removing one element, the instability is 0. Which is the correct answer. Let's see: sorted array is [1, 100000]. Then a[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - a[1], but a[1] is 100000. So 0. Similarly for a[-2] - a[0], which is 1-1=0. So the min is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nSort the array. Then, the answer is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5]. Let's see:\n\nOriginal instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, the instability is 5-3=2. If we remove 5, the instability is 4-1=3. So the answer is 2, which is min(5-3, 4-1) = min(2,3) = 2. Correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Then the answer would be min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 3, 7]. The answer is min(7-3=4, 3-1=2) → 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works. Therefore, the solution is to sort the array, then compute the minimum between the two possibilities: removing the first element (so the instability is max - a[1], which is a[-1] - a[1]) or removing the last element (instability is a[-2] - min, which is a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements that are the same as the min or max? For example, [1,1,3,3]. Then the original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 1s, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 2. According to our formula, the min between (a[-1] - a[1]) = 3 - 1 = 2 and (a[-2] - a[0]) = 3 - 1 = 2 → min is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 2, 3]. The answer is min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to cover all cases.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array has n=2 elements? Then, a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So, for example, in the case of n=2, the two options are (a[1] - a[1]) = 0 and (a[0] - a[0]) = 0. So min is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works for all n ≥ 2.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n, read the array. Sort it. Then compute the two values: (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). Take the minimum between them.\n\nWait, but why not consider other possibilities? For example, if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. Suppose we remove 3, then the array becomes [1,4,5,7]. Instability is 7-1=6. Which is worse than removing the first element (instability 7-4=3) or the last element (instability 5-1=4). So the minimal is 3. So the formula works.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]. Suppose we remove 5. Then the array becomes [1,2,6,7]. Instability is 7-1=6. Which is worse than removing the first element (instability 7-2=5) or the last element (instability 6-1=5). So the formula gives min(7-2=5, 6-1=5) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Then removing 4 gives instability 7-1=6. But if we remove 7, the instability is 6-1=5. Which is better. So the formula works.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is indeed min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nFirst, sort the array. Then compute those two values and take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3?\n\nFor example, array [1, 2, 3]. Then, the two options are:\n\nremove first element: array [2,3], instability 1.\n\nremove last element: array [1,2], instability 1.\n\nSo the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 5]. The answer is min(5-3=2, 3-1=2) → 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n, then the list of numbers. Sort them. Then compute the two options and output the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has all elements the same? Like [2,2,2,2]. Then the instability is 0. After removing any element, the instability is still 0. So the code will compute a[-1] - a[1] = 2-2=0, and a[-2]-a[0] = 2-2=0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, [1, 1]. The answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n, read list, sort it. Then compute min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) )\n\nBut wait, for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So the two options are (a[1] - a[1]) = 0 and (a[0] - a[0]) = 0. So min is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=3, the code would compute option1 as a[-1] - a[1], which is the max minus the second element. For example, sorted array [1,2,3]. option1 is 3-2=1, option2 is 2-1=1. min is 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. The options are 5-2=3 and 4-1=3. So min is 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. Then, the options are 7-3=4 (removing first element) and 5-1=4 (removing last element). So the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there is a scenario where removing a middle element gives a better result?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]. The original instability is 99. If we remove 100, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, the instability is 100 - 2 = 98. So the best is to remove 100. Which is covered by option2 (a[-2] - a[0] = 5 - 1 = 4). So the code returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 100]. Removing 100 gives instability 7-1=6. Removing 1 gives 100-2=98. So code returns 6. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 5, 6, 7, 100]. Then the code would compute option1 as 100 -5=95, option2 as 7-1=6. So min is 6. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 100, 101, 102]. Then, the options are:\n\noption1: a[-1] - a[1] = 102 - 100 = 2.\n\noption2: a[-2] - a[0] = 101 - 1 = 100. So the code returns 2, which is correct (removing the first element, which is 1, gives instability 102-100=2. Or removing the last element, which is 102, gives instability 101 -1=100. So the code picks the correct option.)\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, read list, sort, then compute min between a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3 and the array is [1, 2, 3]. Then, the code computes option1 = 3-2=1, option2 = 2-1=1. So min is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1: 7 - 3 = 4.\n\noption2: 3 -1 = 2. So min is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]. option1 is 100000 - 100000 = 0. option2 is 1 -1 = 0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The code returns min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the code is handled by the 'if n == 2' part. But in the code above, when n=2, the else part is not executed. But for n=2, the code is:\n\nprint(0).\n\nBut in the case of n=2, the code can also be handled by the same formula. For example, a[-1] - a[1] is a[1] - a[1] = 0, and a[-2] - a[0] is a[0] - a[0] = 0. So min(0, 0) is 0. So the code can be simplified to not have the if condition.\n\nWait, let's see. For n=2, the code:\n\na is sorted. So a is [x, y], with x <= y.\n\noption1 is a[-1] - a[1] → y - a[1]. Since a[1] is y. So y - y = 0.\n\noption2 is a[-2] - a[0] → a[0] - a[0] = 0.\n\nSo min(0, 0) is 0. So the code can be written without checking for n=2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nsort the array, then compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nBut for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1].\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\nprint( min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] ) )\n\nBut wait, for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So the code works.\n\nBut what if n=2, and the array is [1, 1]. Then, the code returns min(1-1, 1-1) = 0. Correct.\n\nSo this code handles all cases, including n=2.\n\nSo why did the previous example code have an if condition? Because perhaps the user thought that for n=2, the code would have a[-2] as a[0], but that's correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, read list, sort, then compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nThus, the code is simple and handles all cases.\n\nLet me check for n=3.\n\nFor example, n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. The code computes a[-1] - a[1] → 3-2=1. a[-2] - a[0] → 2-1=1. min is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, array [1, 3, 5]. The code returns min(5-3=2, 3-1=2) → 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, read a, sort, then print min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, let's write it in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for a list, a[-1] is the last element, and a[1] is the second element. So for n=2, a[1] is the second element.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2? Then a[-2] is a[0], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThis code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me test the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, array [1,3,3,7]. After sorting, [1,3,3,7].\n\na[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3 → 7-3=4.\n\na[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1 → 3-1=2. min(4,2)=2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, array [1, 100000]. sorted is [1, 100000]. a[-1] -a[1] = 100000 - 100000 = 0. a[-2] -a[0] is 1-1=0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: array [1, 1, 1, 1]. min(1-1=0, 1-1=0) → 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: array [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. min(7-3=4, 5-1=4) → 4. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nTherefore, this is the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. By strategically removing one element, we aim to achieve the smallest possible instability.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. Removing an element can potentially reduce this difference if the removed element was contributing significantly to the instability.\n2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the potential new maximum and minimum values after removing an element.\n3. **Key Insight**: After sorting, the optimal elements to remove are either the first element (minimum) or the last element (maximum). This is because removing these elements will leave the remaining array with the smallest possible range (difference between the new maximum and minimum).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to facilitate efficient calculation of potential instabilities after removing elements.\n3. **Calculating Minimum Instability**:\n   - **Option 1**: Remove the first element (minimum value) and calculate the instability as the difference between the last element (new maximum) and the second element (new minimum).\n   - **Option 2**: Remove the last element (maximum value) and calculate the instability as the difference between the second-to-last element (new maximum) and the first element (new minimum).\n4. **Result**: The minimum value between the two calculated instabilities is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal element to remove by leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic operations, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step. This is efficient and handles all edge cases effectively.",
