For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three notes forms a major, minor, or strange chord. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the chord is made of three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria. Since the chord is unordered, the order of the input notes doesn't matter. But for checking, we need to consider all permutations of the three notes and see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor conditions.\n\nLet me recall the definitions:\n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. So total from X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, maybe I need to calculate distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad has X to Y as 3, Y to Z as 4. So the total from X to Z is 7 as well. Wait, but the order matters here. So for each permutation of the three notes, I need to check if any of the possible sequences meets these conditions.\n\nBut how to calculate the distance between two notes? Let's think about the note order. The notes are in a cyclic order. Let me assign each note a numerical value. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Wait, but according to the problem statement, after H comes C again. So the list is [C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H], right? Wait, the problem says that the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then the next note after H is C again.\n\nSo the order is as follows. Let me create a list of the notes in order, then for any two notes, the distance between them is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but multiplied by 1 semitone per step. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between consecutive notes is one semitone. So for example, the distance from C to C# is 1 semitone, from C to D is 2, etc. But when you go from C to E, it's 4 semitones. However, if you go from E to C, since it's the other way around, the distance would be 8 semitones. Because the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. Wait, but how do you know which is lower? Oh, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower note to the upper. So, for example, between X and Y, the distance is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, but if that's negative, then you add 12. Wait, no. Let me think: if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))? Or maybe the distance is always (Y - X) mod 12, but in the context of the problem, the distance is measured as the number of semitones moving upwards. So for example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones because if you start at E and go up to C, you have to wrap around. Let me see:\n\nThe notes are arranged in a circle. The distance between X and Y is the minimal number of steps moving forward (i.e., in the order of the list) from X to reach Y. So for example, between C (0) and E (4), the distance is 4. Between E (4) and C (0), the distance is 8 (since moving forward from E, you have 5 (F), 6 (F#), 7 (G), 8 (G#), 9 (A), 10 (B), 11 (H), 0 (C) — that's 8 steps).\n\nSo the distance between two notes X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12 if you consider the direction. Wait, but how to compute that. For example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then (4-0) = 4, which is correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0-4) = -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. Wait, but how do we know which is lower? Well, perhaps the way to compute the distance is as follows: if you have two notes, X and Y, then the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. However, if the distance is more than 6, then perhaps it's considered as the other way around. Wait, no. The problem says that the distance is measured along the musical scale from the lower to upper. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))?\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Which would be the case if you take the distance from E to C as moving forward (i.e., going up in the scale). So the way to compute the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem defines the distance as from the lower note to the upper, perhaps the actual distance is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (12 - (X - Y))? Or perhaps the problem defines the distance as the number of semitones you need to move up from X to reach Y. So for example, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But that's not correct. Because if X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0 - 4) mod 12 is 8. Which is the correct distance. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Because if you have X and Y, then the distance from X to Y is the number of semitones you need to move up from X to reach Y. So that's (Y - X) mod 12. So for example, between C and E, it's 4. Between E and C, it's 8.\n\nSo the key is to compute the distance between two notes as (Y - X) mod 12. But since we can have negative numbers, mod 12 gives us the correct positive value. So, for example, (Y - X) could be negative, but mod 12 would make it positive.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its numerical value. Let's create a dictionary for that. Let me list the order again:\n\nThe notes are given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in the problem statement, the order is written as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again.\n\nSo the order is:\n\nindex 0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nSo for example, H is index 11. So the note_to_index dictionary would map each note to its index. So for example, 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, etc.\n\nOnce I have that, for any two notes, I can compute their distance as (y - x) mod 12. Wait, but how to get the distance between X and Y as per the problem's definition. Let me think: for example, if X is C (0), Y is E (4), the distance is 4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), the distance is (0 - 4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the next step is to generate all possible permutations of the three notes, and for each permutation, check whether the first to second is 4, and second to third is 3 (for major) or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nBut since the chord is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. For example, for three notes A, B, C, there are 6 permutations. For each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor condition.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations? Well, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, for the three notes, generate all 6 permutations, then for each permutation, check the distances between first and second, and between second and third.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes as input.\n\n2. For each of the permutations of the three notes:\n\n   a. Check if the distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3. If yes, then it's a major chord.\n\n   b. Check if the distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4. If yes, then it's a minor chord.\n\n3. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we don't have to worry about overlapping cases.\n\nNow, the steps to code this:\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index mapping. Let's create a list of the notes in order, then use a dictionary to map each note to its index.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the list is correct. So the indexes are as follows.\n\nSo, for example, note_to_index['C'] = 0, note_to_index['C#'] = 1, etc.\n\nOnce I have that, then for any two notes, say note1 and note2, their distance is (note2_index - note1_index) % 12.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4 semitones. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), the distance is 8 semitones.\n\nSo the calculation is correct.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the three notes, check:\n\ndistance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3 → major.\n\nOR\n\ndistance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4 → minor.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input is 'C E G'.\n\nLet's look at the permutation C, E, G. The distance from C to E is 4 (correct), E to G is 2 semitones? Wait, E is index 4, G is index 7. 7-4=3. So yes. So that's 3. So the first permutation would satisfy major. So the answer is major.\n\nAnother example is 'C# B F'. Let's see. Let's take the permutation B, C#, F. B is note index 10. C# is 1. F is 5.\n\nDistance between B and C#: (1 - 10) mod 12 is ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3. Because 1-10 is -9, adding 12 gives 3. So that's 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5-1=4. So yes, that's a minor.\n\nSo the code needs to check all permutations of the three notes, and for each, check the two possibilities.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead the input line as a list of three strings. For example, input is split into three elements. Then, for each permutation of the three elements:\n\nCheck for major and minor.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies major, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n- Create the note_to_index mapping.\n\n- Read the three notes into a list.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n- For each permutation:\n\n   - Compute d1 = distance between first and second.\n\n   - Compute d2 = distance between second and third.\n\n   - if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\n   - elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\n- If any permutation meets major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Using itertools.permutations.\n\nSo in Python, import itertools.permutations.\n\nBut since the input is three notes, the permutations would be 3! = 6 possibilities.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the note_to_index as a dictionary.\n\nBut what about the note names? For example, the note 'H' is in the list. So the notes_order list is as follows:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo the index for 'H' is 11.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nThen, for a given note, get its index.\n\nNow, for the three input notes, let's say they are stored in a list called notes = [n1, n2, n3]\n\nThen, for each perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n   y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n   z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n   d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       return 'major'\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       return 'minor'\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the chord is a set of three notes. So, the order of the three notes in the permutation is important for checking. So, for example, the permutation (X, Y, Z) is checked for X-Y and Y-Z distances.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies either condition, then the answer is determined.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation, check the two conditions. Once any permutation meets the major condition, we can immediately return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut since there are 6 permutations, we can loop through them all, and check for any of them meeting the conditions.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead the input as a list of three notes. For example:\n\ninput_line = input().strip().split()\n\nnotes = input_line\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation in permutations(notes):\n\n   check the distances.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then answer is 'major'.\n\nSame for minor.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfound_major = False\n\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        found_major = True\n\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n\n    print('major')\n\nelif found_minor:\n\n    print('minor')\n\nelse:\n\n    print('strange')\n\nWait, but this code checks all permutations. For example, if one permutation meets the major condition, then found_major is set to True. But even if another permutation also meets the same condition, it's okay. The code will check all permutations, but once found_major is True, it's sufficient.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So, there can't be a case where both major and minor are found. But the code checks for both, and if found_major is True, it returns 'major', else if found_minor is True, returns 'minor', else 'strange'.\n\nBut let's think about the example input given:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nLet's take the first case, 'C E G'.\n\nIn the permutation (C, E, G):\n\nd1 = E - C = 4-0 =4. d2 = G - E = 7-4=3 → yes, major.\n\nSo found_major becomes True.\n\nOther permutations may not meet the conditions, but once found_major is True, the code will output 'major'.\n\nFor the second case, 'C# B F'.\n\nLooking at permutation (B, C#, F):\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nd1 = 1-10 mod 12 = -9 mod 12 = 3. d2 = 5 - 1 =4. So yes, minor.\n\nSo found_minor is True.\n\nThird case: 'A B H'.\n\nNotes are A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nCheck all permutations. Let's take all permutations:\n\nFor example:\n\nA, B, H:\n\nd1 = B - A = 10-9=1 → no.\n\nA, H, B:\n\nd1 = H - A = 11-9=2 → no.\n\nB, A, H:\n\nd1 = A - B → 9-10 = -1 mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nB, H, A: d1 = H - B is 11-10=1. Then d2 = A - H → 9 - 11 = -2 mod 12 is 10. No.\n\nH, A, B: d1 = A - H → 9-11 = -2 mod 12 → 10. No.\n\nH, B, A: d1 = B - H is 10 -11 = -1 mod 12 is 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code seems to work.\n\nBut wait, let's think about another example. Suppose the three notes are C, E, G#. Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nBut what about the case where the same note is present multiple times? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes. But according to the problem statement, the chord is a set of three notes. However, the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So perhaps the input will not have duplicates. But the code can handle duplicates, but the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So, for example, if all three notes are same, then the code would check permutations, but d1 and d2 would be zero. So no conditions met, output 'strange'.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can proceed.\n\nNow, what about the note names? For example, the note 'H' is in the list. What about the input being 'H C E'? Let's see.\n\nFor example, the permutation H, C, E.\n\nH is 11, C is 0, E is 4.\n\nd1 = 0 - 11 mod 12 → (0-11) is -11 mod 12 → 1. So d1 is 1. Not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, H.\n\nd1 = 4-0=4. d2 = H - E = 11-4=7. So not 3. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: C, H, E. d1 is H - C = 11 -0 = 11. d2 is E - H = 4 - 11 = -7 mod 12 = 5. No.\n\nAnother permutation: E, H, C. d1 is H - E = 7. d2 is C - H = (0 - 11) mod 12 = 1. No.\n\nSo, no match. So output is strange.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input 'C# B F' → the permutation B, C#, F. As discussed earlier, d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So found_minor is True.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code checks for all permutations. So even if there are multiple permutations that meet the condition, the code will find it.\n\nBut what about the code's logic? For example, in the code, for each permutation, it checks if d1 and d2 meet the major or minor conditions. So, for each permutation, if any of the two conditions is met, the flags are set.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, both conditions are checked. So even if a permutation meets both (which is impossible?), but the code would set both flags. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so no such case exists.\n\nBut for the code, the code will check all permutations. So, for example, if a permutation meets both conditions (unlikely), but the code would set both flags. But according to the problem statement, this can't happen.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code is written as:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where multiple permutations meet the same condition? For example, if two permutations meet the major condition, but the code will set found_major to True once, and then again, but that's okay.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 'C E G' → the code finds found_major = True, outputs 'major'.\n\nSample Input: 'C# B F' → found_minor is True, outputs 'minor'.\n\nSample Input: 'A B H' → outputs 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about the case where the three notes form a major chord in one permutation and a minor in another? According to the problem statement, this can't happen. But the code would check for both, and since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, the code will not have both flags set.\n\nBut the code will check all permutations and set the flags accordingly. For example, suppose a chord that can be ordered as major and minor in different permutations. But according to the problem statement, this is not possible.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about the note 'H'? Let's take an example where the chord is H, C, E. Let's see:\n\nH is 11, C is 0, E is 4.\n\nCheck permutations:\n\nH, C, E: d1 is 0 - 11 mod 12 → (0-11) = -11 mod 12 is 1. d1=1. No.\n\nH, E, C: d1 is E - H → 4 - 11 = -7 mod 12 is 5. No.\n\nC, H, E: d1 is H - C → 11 -0 = 11 mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nC, E, H: d1=4-0=4, d2= H - E = 11-4=7 → no. So no.\n\nE, H, C: d1 is H - E = 7. d2 is C - H → 0 - 11 = -11 mod 12 → 1. No.\n\nE, C, H: d1 is C - E → 0-4 = -4 mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nSo no, output is strange.\n\nAnother example: let's take a minor chord. For example, B, C#, F. Which is the sample input. So permutation B, C#, F:\n\nd1 is C# - B → 1 - 10 = -9 mod 12 = 3. d2 is F - C# →5-1=4. So minor.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, F, B. Let's check:\n\nd1 is F - C# →5-1=4. d2 is B - F → 10 -5=5. Not 3. So no.\n\nBut in another permutation, F, B, C#?\n\nd1 is B - F → 10-5=5. No.\n\nSo only the permutation B, C#, F meets the minor condition.\n\nSo the code will find found_minor = True.\n\nNow, what about a case where the same chord can be ordered as major in one permutation and minor in another? Let's think. For example, suppose the three notes are X, Y, Z such that there's a permutation that meets major and another that meets minor. But according to the problem statement, this is impossible. Because the major and minor conditions require different distances.\n\nBut let's think: suppose the three notes are X, Y, Z such that X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3 (so major). But also, there exists another permutation where X to Y is 3 and Y to Z is 4. How?\n\nFor example, if the three notes are X, Y, Z where the distances between X and Y is 4, Y and Z is 3. Then, the total distance from X to Z is 7 semitones. But if we arrange them as Y, Z, X, then the distance from Y to Z is 3, and Z to X is (X - Z) mod 12. Since X is 7 semitones above Y, and Z is 3 semitones above Y, then X is 7 semitones above Y, so Z is 3 semitones above Y, so X is 4 semitones above Z. So the distance between Z and X is (X - Z) mod 12 = (Y +4 - (Y +3)) mod 12 = 1 mod 12. So in that permutation, the first distance is 3 (Y to Z), and the second distance is 1 (Z to X). So no.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code uses itertools.permutations, which is acceptable for three elements.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. The input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, the sample input is given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but the actual input is a single line. Wait, the problem says that the input is the only line contains 3 space-separated notes. So the code reads input().split().\n\nSo for example, if the input is \"C E G\", then input().split() returns ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about the note names? For example, 'B' and 'H'? In the note_order list, 'B' is at index 10 and 'H' is at index 11. So the code correctly maps them.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to an index based on its position in the cyclic musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, check if the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note, meet the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on the checks, determine if the chord is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its corresponding index for quick lookup.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three input notes to check each possible configuration.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Check Conditions**: Each permutation is checked against the criteria for major (distance of 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) and minor (distance of 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones) triads. If any permutation meets these conditions, the corresponding flag (`found_major` or `found_minor`) is set.\n5. **Result Determination**: After checking all permutations, the result is determined based on the flags set during the checks.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the notes are considered, providing an accurate classification of the chord type.",
