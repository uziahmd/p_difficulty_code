Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. The output is 3 for that case.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nBut since the string can be up to 100 characters long, maybe the brute force approach is manageable here. Let's think about the steps.\n\nThe steps could be:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the string.\n2. For each substring, check how many times it appears in the string.\n3. Keep track of the maximum length where the count is at least two.\n\nBut generating all substrings might be computationally feasible for n=100. Let's think about the number of substrings. For a string of length n, there are O(n^2) substrings. For n=100, that's 10^4 substrings. For each substring, checking all possible positions in the string for occurrences. But that could be O(n^3) time. Wait, but for each substring, how do we check if it appears at least twice?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can generate all possible substrings, store them in a dictionary with their counts, but considering all possible occurrences. However, overlapping occurrences are allowed, so for example, in 'aaaaa', the substring 'aa' occurs multiple times.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings and count their occurrences?\n\nWait, but the problem is that for a substring of length l, how do we count how many times it appears in the string? For example, for 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4). So when generating all possible substrings, we need to collect all possible ones and count how many times each occurs.\n\nBut generating all substrings and then for each, checking how many times they appear in the original string. However, this might be computationally expensive, but for n=100, perhaps acceptable.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nLoop over all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n) down to 1. For each length l, generate all possible substrings of that length, and check if any of them appears at least twice. Once we find the maximum l where this is true, return that l. If none found, return 0.\n\nThis way, we can start checking from the largest possible length and return as soon as we find a valid one. That would optimize the process.\n\nFor example, for the input 'ababa', the maximum possible substring length is 5. Check if any substring of length 5 appears twice. Obviously not. Then check length 4. Substrings are 'abab', 'baba'. Neither appears twice. Then check length 3: 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. The 'aba' appears twice. So return 3.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n   collect all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\n   if yes, return l.\n\nIf after checking all lengths down to 1, no such substring is found, return 0.\n\nNow the question is, how to efficiently check for each l, whether there's a substring of length l that occurs at least twice.\n\nFor each l, generate all substrings of length l, and for each, count how many times it appears in the string.\n\nBut how to count the occurrences? For example, for a substring s[i:i+l], how many times does it appear in the string? Well, we can collect all substrings of length l, and for each, count how many times they occur. But for that, perhaps we can create a dictionary where the key is the substring, and the value is the count. Then for each l, we generate all substrings of that length, add them to the dictionary, and check if any key has a count >=2.\n\nBut for each l, we can generate all possible substrings of length l, and for each, add to a dictionary. Then check if any of the entries in the dictionary have a count >= 2.\n\nBut for each l, the number of substrings is (n - l + 1). For each of those, we can generate the substring and count.\n\nBut for l=100, there is only 1 substring. For l=99, two substrings, etc. So for each l, the number of substrings is O(n). So overall, for all possible l's, the total number of substrings is O(n^2), which for n=100 is 10^4, which",
