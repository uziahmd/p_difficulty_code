After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But we need to count each student once even if they are the best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column), determine the maximum score.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their score in that subject is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count all such students.\n\nHmm. How to implement this?\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow, each being a string of m digits.\n\nLet me think about the data structure. Let's parse the gradebook into a 2D list. Each row is a student, each column is a subject.\n\nBut for processing, maybe it's easier to process each column (subject) and find the maximum value in that column. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the maximum of that column.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines as a list of strings. Let's call this grid.\n- For each subject (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum value in that column. Let's create a list called max_per_subject, where max_per_subject[j] is the maximum of column j.\n- Then, for each student (row), check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to max_per_subject[j]. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nYes. So how to compute the max_per_subject?\n\nFor each column j:\n\nmax_val = 0\n\nfor each row i in 0..n-1:\n\n   current_val = int(grid[i][j])\n\n   if current_val > max_val: max_val = current_val\n\nSo after processing all rows for column j, max_per_subject[j] = max_val.\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the max for that column.\n\nNow, for each student, iterate through each of their marks. For each mark, check if it's equal to the max of that column. If any of them is, then the student is successful.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nRead n, m.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmax_per_subject = [0] * m\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        val = int(grid[i][j])\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n    max_per_subject[j] = max_val\n\nThen, count the number of students who have at least one mark equal to the max in their respective column.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if int(grid[i][j]) == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break  # break out of the j loop once a subject is found\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nWait, but how about for a student who has multiple subjects where they are the best? For example, in the first sample input, student 1 is best in subject 1 and 3. But we need to count him once. So in the code, for each student, we check if any of their marks meet the max. Once one is found, we add 1 to the count and move to the next student.\n\nYes. So the code for checking each student is:\n\nfor each student i:\n\n    flag = False\n\n    for each subject j:\n\n        if their mark in j is equal to max_per_subject[j]:\n\n            flag = True\n\n            break\n\n    if flag:\n\n        count +=1\n\nSo that's the correct approach.\n\nNow, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 3\n\nRow 1: 2 3 2\n\nRow 2: 1 1 2\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\nColumn 0: 2 (from row 0 and 1)\n\nColumn 1: 3 (from row 1)\n\nColumn 2: 3 (from row 0)\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent 0:\n\nCheck column 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So he is counted.\n\nStudent 1:\n\nCheck column 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So counted.\n\nStudent 2:\n\nCheck column 0: 1 < 2. Column 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject, calculate the maximum grade obtained by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their grade matches the maximum grade for that subject. If so, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmax_per_subject = [0] * m\n\n# Calculate the maximum for each subject\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        val = int(grid[i][j])\n        if val > max_val:\n            max_val = val\n    max_per_subject[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\n# Check each student\nfor i in range(n):\n    successful = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if int(grid[i][j]) == max_per_subject[j]:\n            successful = True\n            break\n    if successful:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The subsequent lines contain the grades of each student as strings.\n2. **Finding Maximum Grades**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest grade. This helps in determining the best student(s) for each subject.\n3. **Checking Successfulness**: For each student, check if they have at least one grade that matches the maximum grade in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the successful students by leveraging the maximum grades per subject and checking each student against these maxima, ensuring an optimal solution within the given constraints.",
