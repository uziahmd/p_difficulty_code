They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about restoring the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the GCD and LCM values given for each road between two lawns. \n\nSo, the input gives us a graph where each edge has a GCD and LCM of the two nodes it connects. Our job is to assign numbers to each node such that for every edge, the GCD and LCM match the given values. If it's not possible, we return NO.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the relationship between the GCD and LCM. For two numbers a and b, we know that GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So, if we have a GCD g and LCM l for an edge between nodes u and v, then a and b must be multiples of g, and their product must be g*l. Also, since LCM(a,b) is l, which is a multiple of both a and b, so l must be divisible by both a and b. \n\nWait, but for two numbers, their GCD divides their LCM. Because GCD(a,b) divides both a and b, and LCM(a,b) is a multiple of both. So, the given GCD and LCM must satisfy that GCD divides LCM. Otherwise, there's no solution. Wait, but the problem says that the original map had valid numbers. But in the input, maybe the given GCD and LCM could be invalid? Like, suppose someone gave a GCD of 2 and LCM of 3. Then, since 2 doesn't divide 3, there's no possible a and b. So in that case, the answer would be NO. So first, for each edge, we need to check if the given GCD divides the LCM. If not, immediately return NO.\n\nSo that's one check. For example, if the GCD is g and LCM is l, then we must have that g divides l. Because for any a and b, their GCD divides their LCM. So if that's not the case, the answer is impossible.\n\nOnce that's checked, then for each edge, the two numbers a and b must be multiples of g. Let me think: Let's say that for an edge between u and v, the GCD is g and LCM is l. Then, a = g * x, b = g * y, where x and y are coprime (since GCD(a,b) is g). Also, since LCM(a,b) is g * x * y. Because LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/GCD(a,b) = (g^2 x y)/g = g x y. So the LCM is g * x * y. Therefore, according to the problem, this must equal l. So:\n\ng * x * y = l → x * y = l / g. \n\nBut since x and y are coprime, then x and y must be divisors of l/g, and their product is l/g, and they are coprime. Therefore, x and y must be a pair of coprime factors of (l/g). \n\nBut how do we choose x and y? Well, for each edge, we can have two possibilities: x and y are some pair of coprime numbers whose product is l/g. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can assign x and y in a way that allows building a consistent graph.\n\nBut how to model this for the entire graph?\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node has a value, and edges impose constraints on pairs of nodes. The problem resembles building a graph with constraints that can be modeled as equations or relations. \n\nAn approach here might be to model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, if we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then the values of u and v must be multiples of g, and their product is g*l. So, if we can assign variables to each node, and for each edge, set up constraints, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each connected component can be handled separately. For each connected component, we can assign a value to one node (say, root), and then compute the rest based on the edges.\n\nBut how to ensure consistency across the edges. For example, if there's a chain of edges, the assignments must be consistent.\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a graph where each node's value is determined by the edges. For example, consider that for each edge u-v with GCD g and LCM l, the values of u and v must be multiples of g, and their product is g*l. Let's denote the value of u as a, and v as b. Then, a = g * x, b = g * y, with x and y coprime, and x*y = l/g.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can think of x and y as coprime factors of (l/g). However, since x and y are coprime, the pair (x,y) is unique up to swapping. So for each edge, the possible pairs (x,y) are coprime pairs such that x*y = k, where k = l/g. Since x and y are coprime, they must be a pair of factors of k that are coprime. For example, if k is 6, then possible pairs are (1,6) and (2,3) (since 1 and 6 are coprime, 2 and 3 are coprime).\n\nBut how do we choose which pair to use for each edge? Because choosing different pairs could lead to different assignments, but we need to find at least one that is consistent across the entire graph.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of solving the problem, we can model the relationships between nodes as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to another. For example, if we have an edge between u and v, then once we assign a value to u, the value of v is determined as (g * y), where x and y are such that x*y = k and x is (a/g). But since x and y are coprime, once we fix x (the value of a/g), then y must be k/x, and since x and y are coprime, we can determine the value of v.\n\nBut how to handle this in practice. Let's think of the following approach:\n\n- For each connected component in the graph, pick a starting node and assign a value to it. Then, perform a BFS or DFS to assign values to other nodes based on the edges.\n\nBut how to assign the initial value? Because for the first node, its value can be any multiple of the GCDs of its edges. Wait, but maybe not. For example, if a node is connected via multiple edges, the value must satisfy all those edges' constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to another. For example, for each edge between u and v, the ratio between their values is fixed. But since the values are not necessarily unique, perhaps there's a way to model this with a system of equations.\n\nWait, considering that for each edge u-v, the values of u and v are a and b. We have:\n\ngcd(a, b) = g, lcm(a, b) = l. Which implies that a*b = g*l. Also, since a and b are multiples of g, let me write a = g * x, b = g * y. Then, x and y are coprime, and x * y = (g*l)/(g^2) ) = l/g. So x * y = l/g. And since x and y are coprime, that means that x and y are coprime factors of l/g.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can think of the values of u and v as being g*x and g*y, where x and y are coprime and their product is k = l/g.\n\nBut how to choose x and y for each edge. For example, if we have an edge between u and v, and we have already assigned a value to u, then we can determine the value of v. Suppose u is assigned a value of a. Then, since a must be equal to g*x (from the edge's perspective), then x = a/g. Then, y must be k / x, which is (l/g) / (a/g) ) = l/(a). Then, since a and b are g*x and g*y, then b = g * y = g * (l/a). But since a is g*x, then substituting:\n\nb = g * (l/(g*x)) ) = l/(x) = (l/g) / x * g. Wait, maybe I should think of this as:\n\nGiven that a * b = g*l, then once a is known, b = (g*l)/a. \n\nSo, if we have an edge between u and v, and we know the value of u, then the value of v is (g*l)/u. But wait, that's only if the GCD and LCM for that edge are correct. Because for that edge, the product of u and v must be g*l. But also, the GCD of u and v must be g. \n\nWait, but if we set v = (g*l)/u, then the product is correct. However, the GCD may not be correct. Because for example, suppose u is 2, v is 3. Then their product is 6, and GCD is 1. But if the given GCD is 1 and LCM is 6, then that's correct. But if the given GCD is 2, then even though the product is 6, the GCD is 1, which is not equal to the given GCD. So, this approach would not work unless we also ensure that the GCD is correct.\n\nSo, the problem is that just setting v = (g*l)/u may not ensure that the GCD is correct. Therefore, this approach is not sufficient. \n\nHmm. So how can we ensure that the GCD of u and v is exactly the given g?\n\nWell, since u and v are multiples of g, then their GCD must be at least g. So, if we can make sure that u and v are multiples of g, and that their GCD is exactly g. \n\nBut if u and v are multiples of g, then their GCD is g multiplied by the GCD of (u/g) and (v/g). So, for the overall GCD to be exactly g, the GCD of (u/g) and (v/g) must be 1. \n\nWhich brings us back to the earlier approach where u/g and v/g are coprime. \n\nSo, for each edge, the values of u and v must be such that u/g and v/g are coprime. \n\nSo, when building the graph, we need to ensure that for each edge, when we assign values to u and v, their division by the given g is coprime. \n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps, during the traversal (like BFS or DFS), when we process an edge between u and v, we can assign the value of v based on the value of u. But we need to make sure that the ratio between u and v satisfies the conditions. \n\nFor example, suppose we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. Then, the product u*v must be g*l. Also, u and v must be multiples of g. \n\nSo, if we have already assigned a value to u, then v must be (g*l)/u. But then, we have to check whether u is a divisor of g*l, and also that the GCD(u, v) is indeed g. \n\nWait, but if we set v = (g*l)/u, then u*v = g*l, which is correct. However, the GCD(u, v) may not be equal to g. How?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the given GCD is 2, LCM is 6. Then, for u and v, their product is 2*6 = 12. Let's say u is 2. Then v is 6. Their GCD is 2, which is correct. Now, if u is 4, then v is 12/4 = 3. Then, GCD(4,3) is 1, which is not equal to the required GCD of 2. So that's invalid. \n\nSo, this approach of setting v = (g*l)/u may not work, because the resulting GCD may not be correct. \n\nSo, what's wrong here? Because in this case, u is 4, which is not a multiple of g (which is 2). Wait, but according to the problem statement, u and v must be multiples of g. So, how did u become 4 in this example? Because if the edge has GCD g=2, then u must be a multiple of 2. So, if u is 4, which is a multiple of 2, then v must be 3. But then, the GCD of 4 and 3 is 1, which is less than the required 2. Which is invalid. \n\nSo, this suggests that even though u is a multiple of g, the value of v may not be a multiple of g, leading to an invalid situation. Wait, but according to the equation u*v = g*l, and since u is a multiple of g, then v must be (g*l)/u. Let's see: if u is a multiple of g, then u = g * x. Then, v = (g*l) / (g*x) ) = l/(x). But since l is the LCM of u and v, which must be a multiple of both u and v. But in this case, l is the LCM given for the edge, which was supposed to be the LCM of u and v. However, in our example, l is 6. So, for u = 4, which is g * x = 2 * 2, then x is 2. Then, v = 6 / 2 = 3. But 3 is not a multiple of g (2). So this would imply that the LCM of 4 and 3 is 12, but the given LCM is 6. Which contradicts. \n\nAh! So, this shows that our initial assumption that u is a multiple of g is necessary, but also that v must be a multiple of g. Therefore, when we set v = (g*l)/u, we must ensure that v is also a multiple of g. \n\nBut how can we ensure that? \n\nBecause, since u is a multiple of g, let's write u = g * x. Then, v = (g*l)/u = (g*l)/(g*x) ) = l/(x). For v to be a multiple of g, l/x must be divisible by g. So, l must be divisible by x * g. \n\nBut l is the LCM of u and v. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the LCM of u and v is l. So, since u is a multiple of g, and v must be a multiple of g (because the GCD of u and v is g, which implies that both are multiples of g), then l must be a multiple of g. \n\nSo, for the given edge, the LCM l must be a multiple of g. Which is the same as saying that the given GCD divides the LCM. Which is the first check we need to perform. \n\nBut in our example, the given GCD is 2 and LCM is 6. Which is valid. \n\nSo, going back to the example where u is 4 (g*x = 2*2), then v = 6/(2) = 3. Which is not a multiple of 2. That's invalid. So why is this happening? Because when we set u to be 4, which is a multiple of g, but the calculation of v gives a value that is not a multiple of g. Which violates the condition that v must be a multiple of g. \n\nTherefore, the problem is that when choosing u's value, we have to ensure that l is divisible by x (since v is l/x), and that v is a multiple of g. \n\nSo, let's re-express this. \n\nSince u = g * x, and v must be a multiple of g, then v = g * y. \n\nThen, the product u * v = g x * g y = g² x y = g * l → x y = l/g. \n\nAlso, since GCD(u, v) = g * GCD(x, y) = g. Therefore, GCD(x, y) must be 1. \n\nSo, x and y are coprime and x y = k, where k = l/g. \n\nTherefore, for the edge between u and v, once we choose x (as part of the assignment for u), then y is determined as k/x, and since x and y are coprime, this ensures that the GCD of u and v is exactly g. \n\nBut how do we ensure that when we assign values to the nodes, the x and y are chosen such that this holds?\n\nThis seems to suggest that during the traversal, when we assign a value to a node, we must ensure that the value is compatible with the edges. \n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the graph as a system where each node's value is determined by the edges. For example, when processing an edge between u and v, if u's value is known, then v's value is determined as (g * (k / x)), where x is (u/g), and k is l/g. \n\nBut how to ensure that this value is consistent with other edges connected to v. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have a simple edge between u and v. Let's say the given GCD is 1, LCM is 3. So k = 3/1 = 3. Then x*y = 3. Possible pairs (x,y) are (1,3) and (3,1). So, if u is assigned 1 (so x = 1), then v must be 1 * 3 = 3. Alternatively, if u is assigned 3, then v must be 1. \n\nSo, for this edge, we can choose either direction. \n\nNow, if we have a connected component, we need to assign values to the nodes in such a way that all edges are satisfied. \n\nThis seems similar to a bipartition problem, where each edge imposes a certain relation between nodes. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAnother idea: for each connected component, we can choose a root node and assign it a value. Then, for each node in the component, the value is determined based on the path from the root. \n\nBut how to ensure that the values are consistent. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Choose a starting node. Assign it a value. The value must be a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. Wait, but how to choose that value? \n\nAlternatively, since for any edge, the value of the nodes must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge. So, for a node that is connected via multiple edges, its value must be a multiple of the GCD of each of those edges. \n\nBut how to find such a value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by the product of the GCDs and LCMs along the edges. \n\nBut this is vague. Let's think again. \n\nLet me think of the following. For each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we can represent that u and v must be multiples of g. Also, their product is g*l. \n\nSo, if we have a tree structure (connected component without cycles), we can assign a value to the root node, then compute the values of the other nodes based on their edges. However, the problem is that for each edge, the value of the adjacent node depends on the value of the current node. \n\nLet me take an example. Suppose we have a tree with root u, and an edge between u and v. The GCD is g and LCM is l. \n\nIf we assign u's value as a, then v's value is (g*l)/a. However, this requires that a divides g*l. Also, since a must be a multiple of g, and (g*l)/a must also be a multiple of g. \n\nLet me see. Since a is a multiple of g, let's write a = g * x. Then, v's value is (g*l)/(g*x) = l/(x). For v to be a multiple of g, l/x must be a multiple of g. So, l must be divisible by x * g. \n\nBut l is given, and x is a/g. \n\nBut how do we ensure that this condition holds? \n\nAlternatively, since x and y (where y = l/(x)) must be coprime (as per earlier analysis), and x*y = k = l/g. \n\nSo, if we choose x to be a divisor of k, then y is k/x, and they are coprime. \n\nBut how does this relate to the value of a (which is g * x)? \n\nSo, for the edge between u and v, the value of u is g * x, and the value of v is g * y, where x * y = k and GCD(x, y) = 1. \n\nTherefore, for the edge, once x is chosen (as part of u's value), y is determined. \n\nThus, during the traversal, when processing an edge between u and v, if u's value is known, then v's value is determined as g * y, where y = k / x, and x = (u's value) / g. \n\nBut for this to work, we need that (u's value) / g divides k. Because k is l/g, and y = k / x. \n\nSo, x must divide k. \n\nBut x is (u's value)/g. So, u's value must be equal to g * x, where x divides k. \n\nWhich implies that u's value must be a divisor of g*k. \n\nBut how can we ensure this? \n\nThis suggests that during the traversal, when assigning values to nodes, we must choose them such that for each edge, the value is compatible with the GCD and LCM of that edge. \n\nBut how to choose the initial value for the root node. \n\nPerhaps, for the root node, we can choose x as 1 (so that the value is g * 1 = g). Then, for each edge connected to the root, the other node's value is determined. \n\nBut this may not always work. For example, if there's a cycle in the graph, then the assignments must be consistent around the cycle. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose there's a triangle of three nodes: A connected to B with GCD 1, LCM 6; B connected to C with GCD 1, LCM 6; and C connected to A with GCD 1, LCM 6. \n\nIf we assign A as 1 (g=1, x=1), then B must be 6/1 = 6. Then, for B connected to C, C must be 6/6 = 1. Then, for C connected to A, 1 * 1 = 1, which must be equal to the LCM of 6. But 1 * 1 = 1, which is not equal to 6. So this is invalid. \n\nWait, this suggests that there's no solution. But the problem says that the initial map had valid numbers, but in this case, the input is invalid. However, in this example, the given edges have GCD 1 and LCM 6. For each edge, the product of the two nodes must be 1*6=6. \n\nSo for the triangle, if A is 1, B is 6, C is 1, then the product between B and C is 6*1=6, which is correct. The product between C and A is 1*1=1, which is not equal to 6. So this is invalid. Hence, there's no solution. \n\nBut how can we detect that during the traversal?\n\nIn this case, when we process the third edge (C to A), we find that the product of their values is 1 * 1 = 1, which is not equal to 6. Hence, this indicates inconsistency, and the answer is NO. \n\nSo, during the traversal, whenever we reach a node that has already been assigned a value, we must check that the new computed value matches the existing one. If not, return NO. \n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Pick a starting node. Assign it a value. How? Well, perhaps we can assign it as g * x, where x is 1. But this may not work. Or perhaps we need to choose x such that during the traversal, all constraints are satisfied. \n\nBut how to choose x? \n\nAlternatively, for the starting node, we can assign it any value that is a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. But how to find that? \n\nAlternatively, during the traversal, for the first node, we can assign it a value of g (the GCD of the first edge) multiplied by some x, which is a divisor of k (l/g). However, since the choice of x affects the rest of the assignments, perhaps the initial assignment can be made with x=1. \n\nBut how to handle cases where this leads to inconsistency. \n\nLet me outline the steps of the algorithm:\n\n1. Check for each edge if the GCD divides the LCM. If not, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component in the graph:\n\n   a. Choose a starting node. Assign it a value. How?\n\n      i. For the first edge connected to this node, we can assign the value as g (the GCD of that edge) multiplied by 1. \n\n      But perhaps this is not sufficient. For example, if the node has multiple edges, the initial value must be compatible with all of them. \n\n   b. Perform BFS or DFS to assign values to other nodes. For each edge, when visiting a node, compute the value of the adjacent node based on the current node's value. \n\n   c. When visiting a node that has already been assigned a value, check if the computed value matches the existing one. If not, return NO.\n\nBut how to choose the initial value for the starting node. \n\nWait, for example, if the starting node is connected to multiple edges, then the initial value must be compatible with all of them. However, since the initial value is arbitrary, perhaps we need to find a value that is compatible with all edges connected to the starting node. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, the initial value can be chosen as follows: for the starting node, look at all edges connected to it. Each edge has a GCD g_i and LCM l_i. For the node's value, it must be a multiple of all g_i. Also, for each edge, the value of the node times the adjacent node's value must be g_i * l_i. \n\nBut since the adjacent node's value is not known yet, this seems difficult. \n\nAlternatively, during BFS, for the starting node, we can assign it a value of g (from the first edge) multiplied by some x, which is a divisor of k (l/g). However, since the value of the starting node is arbitrary, but must be compatible with all edges connected to it, perhaps we need to find a value that works for all edges. \n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps the key is that the initial assignment can be arbitrary, but during the traversal, the constraints will propagate. However, if there's a cycle in the graph, the constraints may lead to contradictions. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have a single edge between u and v with GCD 2 and LCM 6. Then, u and v must be multiples of 2. Their product is 2 * 6 = 12. So possible pairs are (2,6), (6,2). \n\nSo, during BFS, assign u to 2. Then v is 6. That works. \n\nIf there's another edge between u and another node w with GCD 2 and LCM 8. Then, the product of u and w must be 2 * 8 = 16. Since u is 2, w must be 8. \n\nBut then, if there's a third edge between v and w with GCD 2 and LCM ... Let's say the LCM is 24. Then, product of v and w is 2 * 24 = 48. v is 6, w is 8. 6 * 8 = 48. Which is correct. GCD(6,8) is 2. Which is correct. So this works. \n\nBut if there's a cycle that leads to inconsistency, like the earlier triangle example. \n\nSo, the algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Choose a starting node, assign it a value. How? Well, perhaps the first edge connected to it determines the initial value. For example, for the first edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, assign u a value of g * x, where x is a divisor of k = l/g. \n\nBut since the choice of x can be arbitrary (as long as x divides k and x and k/x are coprime), but for simplicity, perhaps we can choose x as 1. \n\nSo, for the starting node, assign it a value of g * 1 = g. \n\nThen, for each edge connected to it, we can compute the adjacent node's value. \n\nBut how to handle cases where the starting node has multiple edges. For example, if the starting node is connected to two edges, each with different GCDs. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the edges are given with their respective GCDs. So, for the starting node, its value must be a multiple of all GCDs of edges connected to it. \n\nBut how to ensure that. \n\nAh, here's the problem. Suppose the starting node is connected to two edges. One edge has GCD g1, another has GCD g2. The value of the starting node must be a multiple of both g1 and g2. So, the initial value must be a multiple of the LCM(g1, g2). \n\nBut how to choose such a value. \n\nBut this complicates the initial assignment. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value can be chosen as the product of all GCDs of edges connected to the starting node. But this may not be feasible. \n\nAlternatively, during the BFS traversal, when we process an edge, we can assign the value of the adjacent node based on the current node's value. However, if the current node's value is not compatible with the edge's GCD and LCM, then this would be a problem. \n\nWait, but the current node's value must be a multiple of the edge's GCD. Because, according to the problem's constraints. \n\nSo, during the BFS traversal, whenever we process an edge, the current node's value must be a multiple of the edge's GCD. Otherwise, it's invalid. \n\nSo, the algorithm steps could be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Initialize all nodes as unvisited.\n\n   Pick a starting node. Assign it a value. How? Well, for the first edge connected to this node, the value must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge. So, for example, assign it the GCD of that edge. \n\n   Then, perform BFS:\n\n      For each node in the queue, iterate through its edges. For each edge to an unvisited node:\n\n         Compute the expected value of the adjacent node as (g * l) / current node's value. \n\n         Check if this value is a multiple of the edge's GCD. \n\n         If not, return NO. \n\n         Assign this value to the adjacent node, mark it as visited, and add it to the queue. \n\n      If the adjacent node is already visited, check if the computed value matches the stored value. If not, return NO.\n\nBut wait, this approach assumes that the current node's value is compatible with the edge's GCD. Because, during the traversal, the current node's value was assigned based on previous steps. \n\nBut how to ensure that the current node's value is a multiple of the edge's GCD. \n\nLet me think: when we assign the initial value to the starting node, we set it to the GCD of the first edge. So, it's a multiple of that edge's GCD. Then, when processing edges, the adjacent nodes are assigned values based on the formula (g * l) / current node's value. \n\nBut for this to work, the current node's value must be a divisor of (g * l). \n\nBut how to ensure that. \n\nFor example, suppose the edge has GCD g and LCM l. Then, the product of the two nodes is g*l. So, if the current node's value is a, then the adjacent node's value is (g*l)/a. \n\nBut for this to be valid, a must divide g*l. \n\nBut since a is a multiple of g (because the current node's value was assigned based on previous steps), and g*l is divisible by g (since l is a multiple of g?), no. Wait, earlier we checked that for each edge, the GCD divides the LCM. So l is divisible by g. \n\nSo, g*l is divisible by g. \n\nBut a is a multiple of g. So, a = g * x. Then, (g*l)/a = (g*l)/(g*x) = l/x. \n\nBut for this to be an integer, x must divide l. \n\nBut l is the LCM of the two nodes, which is given. \n\nBut how to ensure that x divides l. \n\nAh, but x is the value of (current node's value) / g. And the current node's value was computed based on previous edges. \n\nThis seems to be getting complicated. \n\nMaybe the correct approach is:\n\nFor each edge, during the BFS traversal, when processing it, the current node's value is known. Then, the adjacent node's value is computed as (g * l) / current_value. \n\nBut we must check that this value is valid. For example, it must be a positive integer. Also, that the GCD of current_value and new_value is equal to the given GCD. \n\nBut checking the GCD may be computationally expensive, but perhaps necessary. \n\nAlternatively, since the product is correct (current_value * new_value = g*l), and the GCD(current_value, new_value) must be g. \n\nBut how to ensure that. \n\nAs discussed earlier, for the product to be g*l, and the GCD to be g, the current_value must be a multiple of g, and the new_value must be a multiple of g. \n\nSo, during the traversal, when computing new_value, we must ensure that new_value is a multiple of g. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think. \n\ncurrent_value * new_value = g * l. \n\nWe want new_value to be a multiple of g. So, current_value must be a divisor of g * l, and new_value = (g*l)/current_value. \n\nBut if current_value is a multiple of g, then (g*l)/current_value = l / (current_value/g). \n\nSo, current_value/g must divide l. \n\nBut why would that be true? \n\nBecause during the traversal, current_value is computed based on previous steps, which were validated. \n\nBut how to ensure that. \n\nPerhaps during the BFS, whenever we assign a new_value, we must check that it is a multiple of the edge's GCD. \n\nSo, during the computation of new_value, we check if (g*l) is divisible by current_value. If not, it's invalid. \n\nAnd also check that new_value is divisible by g. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think. \n\nIf current_value is a multiple of g, then:\n\nnew_value = (g*l) / current_value. \n\nBut since l is divisible by g (from earlier check), then l = g * m, for some integer m. \n\nSo, new_value = (g * g * m) / current_value. \n\nSince current_value is a multiple of g, let's say current_value = g * x. \n\nThen, new_value = (g^2 * m) / (g*x) ) = (g * m) / x. \n\nFor new_value to be divisible by g, (g*m)/x must be divisible by g. \n\nWhich implies that m/x must be an integer. \n\nSo, x must divide m. \n\nBut m = l/g. \n\nSo, x must divide l/g. \n\nBut x is current_value / g. \n\nBut current_value was computed based on previous steps. \n\nSo, during the BFS traversal, when we assign current_value to a node, it must be that x (current_value/g) divides l/g for all edges connected to it. \n\nBut how to ensure that. \n\nThis seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. \n\nPerhaps the solution is to realize that during the BFS traversal, whenever we compute new_value, we must check that new_value is a multiple of the edge's GCD. \n\nSo, for the new_value, we check if it is divisible by g. \n\nIf not, then it's invalid. \n\nSo, during the BFS, for each edge, after computing new_value, we check:\n\nif new_value % g != 0 → invalid. \n\nOtherwise, proceed. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe algorithm steps are:\n\nFor each edge:\n\n   if gcd does not divide lcm → output NO.\n\nFor",
