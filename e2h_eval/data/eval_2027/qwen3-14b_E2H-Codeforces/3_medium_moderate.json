Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is a straight line from 0 to l. Each lantern can light up points within a distance d from it. So I need to find the smallest d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The key idea here is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Because the maximum gap between two adjacent lanterns would determine the required d. But wait, how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the lanterns are sorted in order. Then between each pair of consecutive lanterns, there's a certain distance. For example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (with a < b), then the middle point between them is (a + b)/2. The distance from each lantern to this middle point is (b - a)/2. So the maximum of these values across all consecutive pairs would be the minimal d required. However, there's also the case of the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is something. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nWait, right. Because the street starts at 0 and ends at l. So the first lantern might be at some position a1, and the distance from 0 to a1 is a1 - 0. But the lantern's light needs to cover that area. Similarly, the last lantern's position is an, and the distance from an to l is l - an. So those two cases need to be considered as well.\n\nSo the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the first lantern to 0. That's the first candidate for d.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to l. That's another candidate.\n4. For each consecutive pair of lanterns, compute the distance between them, divide by 2. That's another candidate for d. Because the middle point between them would require that distance.\n5. The maximum among all these candidates is the minimal required d.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if you have two lanterns, the worst case is the middle between them. For example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then the middle is 2 units away from each. So d must be at least 2. Otherwise, that middle point is not covered.\n\nBut what about the ends? Like, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to 3 is 3. So the d must be at least 3 to cover the 0 point. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Sort the array of ai.\n- Compute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n- Then for each i from 1 to n-1, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2.0, and compare with current max_d.\n- The maximum of all these is the answer.\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nBecause for the entire street to be covered, all points must be within d of some lantern. The maximum required d would be the largest of the following:\n\n- The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern, because that's the distance needed to cover the area from 0 to the first lantern's position.\n- The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n- The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two, since that's the minimal d needed to cover the gap between two adjacent lanterns.\n\nYes. Because if two lanterns are spaced by g, then the middle point between them is g/2 away from each. So the d must be at least g/2. Otherwise, that middle point isn't covered.\n\nSo the steps are correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nFirst example input: 7 15, and the lanterns are at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Let's check:\n\nThe first lantern is at 0, so the distance from 0 is 0. The last lantern is at 15, so distance from l (15) is 0. Then the consecutive gaps are:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2.5, which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nAnother sample input is 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted, they are [2,5]. The first distance is 2-0=2. The last is 5-5=0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum is 2.0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the algorithm works for these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=1. For example, n=1, l=10, and the lantern is at 5. Then the distance from 0 to 5 is 5, and from 5 to 10 is 5. So the max is 5. So d is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=1, lantern is at 0. Then the distance from 0 is 0, but the distance from l is l. So the answer is l.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are placed at 0 and l. Then the gap between them is l, so divided by 2 is l/2. But the first and last distances are 0 and 0. So the answer is l/2.\n\nSo the algorithm handles all these.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2.0, and compare to max_d.\n\nThe maximum of all these is the answer.\n\nSo now, coding this in Python.\n\nBut first, read the input. The input is given as two lines. The first line has n and l. The second line has n integers.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe first example input is given as ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'] — but perhaps that's just a way to represent two test cases. But the actual input is per test case. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then the next line. But looking at the sample input, perhaps the user provided two separate test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo for each test case, we have two lines. So in the example given, the first input is two test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the problem statement's example:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as two lines, but the output is two lines. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. The first line of the input is for the first test case, the second line is for the second test case? Or maybe the sample input is presented as two separate test cases. However, the problem's input format says that the first line is n and l, and the next line is the list of a_i. So the code should process a single test case. But in the example, the input is two separate test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code can handle multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line is n and l. The next line is the list of a_i. So the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's just the way the example is presented. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nOutput:\n\n2.5000000000\n\nThen the second input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nOutput: 2.0000000000\n\nBut the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and gives the input as two lines. But in the example, the input is two test cases. However, in the problem statement's input description, it says that the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the a_i. So perhaps the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the first test case, and the second line is the second test case. But in reality, the code should process one test case. But how to know?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should process one test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, but the problem statement didn't mention that. Or perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. This is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line and the next line. So the code should read two lines. For example, the first line is n and l. The second line is the list of a_i. So in the sample input, there are two separate test cases. But the code is supposed to read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases. However, the problem's input format does not mention that. So this is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nSo the input is two test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases. But how many? How to know?\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description does not mention that. But given that the sample input includes two test cases, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut that's not clear. However, looking at the problem's original source, perhaps it's from Codeforces or similar. For example, in Codeforces, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the a_i. So that suggests that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, which is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's note: the second sample input is 2 5 and the lanterns are 2 and 5. So the output is 2.0. Which makes sense. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, but that's perhaps because the user is showing two examples.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin, which could be multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. So the code should read two lines: first line n and l, second line the list of a_i.\n\nThus, the code should process one test case.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nRead the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the maximum d as discussed.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and l. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the first line: split into n and l.\n\nRead the second line: split into list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through the sorted list, for each pair of consecutive elements, compute (current - previous)/2.0, and compare to max_d.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? No, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo for n=1, the code would compute the max between a[0] (distance from 0) and l - a[0] (distance from end). Then since there are no consecutive pairs, the max_d is that value.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# Check first and last\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\n# Check between consecutive lanterns\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the first lantern is at 0, so a[0] is 0. The last is 15, so l - a[-1] is 0. So the initial max_d is 0. Then, the gaps between consecutive lanterns are checked. The maximum gap is 5 (between 9 and 14). Divided by 2 is 2.5, which becomes the max_d. So the output is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: input is 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. The initial max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5.0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. The initial max is max(0, 0) → 0. Then the gap is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So the answer is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 5]. Then the initial max is max(0, 10-5=5). Then the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the maximum is 5.0. Which is correct, because the end of the street is 10, and the second lantern is at 5. So the distance from 5 to 10 is 5. So d must be 5.0.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the initial max_d is set to max(a[0], l - a[-1]). But what if a[0] is 0? Then the first part is 0, but the l - a[-1] could be something else. For example, if the last lantern is at l, then l - a[-1] is 0. So that's handled.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is not at 0, but the last is at l? Then the first part is a[0], which is the distance from 0 to the first lantern, and the second part is 0. So the max is a[0].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code uses floating points. But in Python, dividing integers by 2.0 would be okay.\n\nBut in the code, the variables are stored as floats. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the output requires that the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 1e-9. So the code needs to print the value with sufficient precision. Using the format string with 10 decimal digits should suffice. For example, in the sample outputs, the numbers are printed with 10 decimal digits.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's test the code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen checking consecutive pairs:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → max_d is 2.5.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.0.\n\nThen the gap between 2 and 5 is 3 → 1.5. So the max_d remains 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Output is 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. The code would compute initial max_d as max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then the gap between 0 and 10 is 10 → 5.0. So output is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. The initial max is max(0, 0) → 0. The gaps between 0 and 5 is 5 → 2.5. Between 5 and 10 is 5 → 2.5. So max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[1, 2, 3]. Then initial max is max(1, 10-3=7) → 7. Then gaps between 1 and 2 is 1 → 0.5. Between 2 and 3 is 1 → 0.5. So the max is 7.0. Which is correct because the end of the street is 10, and the last lantern is at 3. So the distance from 3 to 10 is 7. So d must be 7.0.\n\nSo the code handles all these cases.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to ensure that an entire street is illuminated. The street is represented as a straight line from point 0 to point l, and each lantern can illuminate points within a certain radius d from its position. The goal is to find the smallest possible d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the end of the street (l) to the last lantern. These distances are potential candidates for the radius d.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by 2 will be the critical value for d, as the midpoint of the largest gap will be the farthest point from any lantern.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the distance from the start and end of the street\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of lanterns (n) and the length of the street (l). The second line contains the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Maximum Distance Calculation**: The initial maximum distance is determined by considering the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the end of the street to the last lantern.\n4. **Gap Analysis**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we calculate the gap between each consecutive pair of lanterns. The maximum gap divided by 2 gives the critical radius required to cover the midpoint of the largest gap.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required by considering both the endpoints of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns, leading to an optimal solution.",
