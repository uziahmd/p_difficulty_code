Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l. \n\nFirst, I think the approach here is to sort the lantern positions. Because if they're sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum gap. Then, the required d would be half of that maximum gap. Wait, but why?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there are two adjacent lanterns. Let's say they are at positions a and b, with a < b. The area between them that isn't covered by either lantern would be the middle part. The maximum distance from either lantern to the midpoint between them would be (b - a)/2. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d must be at least half the distance between them. Because if you have a gap between two lanterns, the worst case is the middle of that gap. So the maximum of these half-gap values would be the minimal d needed.\n\nBut wait, what about the ends? Like, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is something. Similarly for the end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the left end (0) needs to be covered. The distance from a1 to 0 is a1. So the required d must be at least a1. Similarly, if the last lantern is at position an, then the distance from an to l is l - an. So that's another candidate for the maximum d.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the first lantern to 0, and from the last lantern to l. These are initial candidates for max_d.\n3. Then iterate through consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them, divide by two, and compare to the current max_d.\n4. The maximum among all these values is the minimal required d.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for the ends, the maximum required is the distance from the end to the nearest lantern. For the middle gaps, it's half the gap between two lanterns. Because the middle point of the gap is the farthest point from both lanterns. So the maximum of all those would be the answer.\n\nSo let's think about the example given. \n\nIn the second sample input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. \n\nAfter sorting, they are [2,5]. The first lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 is 2. The last lantern is at 5, which is the end of the street (l=5), so the distance is 0. Then between the two lanterns, the distance is 3, divided by 2 gives 1.5. So the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is 7 15 with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Let's check the gaps:\n\n- First lantern is at 0. So the distance from 0 is 0. The last lantern is at 15, which is the end. So that's 0. Now the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 1.5\n5-3=2 → 1\n7-5=2 → 1\n9-7=2 → 1\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. Which is the sample output. So that works.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 is a[0], but wait: if the first lantern is at 0, then that distance is zero. So the initial max_d is max( a[0], ... )\n\nWait, no. For the first part, the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0] - 0 = a[0]. But if the first lantern is at 0, then that distance is zero. Similarly for the last lantern. So the initial max_d is max( a[0], l - a[-1] ). Then, for each consecutive pair, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2 and compare to max_d.\n\nWait, but the first lantern could be at 0. Then the distance from 0 is zero. But if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0], which would be the required d for that part. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen for i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2\n\nif current_required > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nSo the answer is max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if there is only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the max_d would be max( a[0], l - a[0] ). Which is correct. Because the lantern is at a[0], and the maximum distance from the lantern to either end is max(a[0], l - a[0]). So that's correct.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nHandle the case where n is 0? Well, according to input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen for i in 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent = gap / 2\n\nif current > max_d: update.\n\nFinally, output max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first example's sorted array is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The first lantern is 0, so the initial max_d is max(0, 15 - 15) = 0. Then between the first and second lanterns, 3-0 = 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. Which becomes the new max_d. Then between 3 and 5: 2/2=1. So no change. Then between 5 and 7: same. Then between 7 and 9: same. Then between 9 and 14: 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. Which becomes the new max_d. Then between 14 and 15: 1/2=0.5. So the final max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input. n=2, l=5, a is [2,5]. After sorting, [2,5]. Initial max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then between 2 and 5: gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d remains 2. So the answer is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then initial max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. So the answer is 5.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then initial max_d is max(0, 10-10=0). Then between them, gap is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then initial max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. Then between 0 and 5: 5/2=2.5. Between 5 and 10: 5/2=2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nBut if the lanterns are at 0, 3, 10. Then initial max_d is max(0, 10-10=0). Then between 0 and 3: 1.5. Between 3 and 10: 7/2=3.5. So answer is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nRead input: first line is n and l. Then next line is list of a_i.\n\nBut in the input examples, the first input is given as ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'] — but that's probably the way the input is structured. But for the code, we need to read from stdin. So the code will read the first line as n and l. Then the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n, l from input. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nBut in Python, the input can be read via input().split().\n\nBut for cases where the input is multiple lines, perhaps the code should read the first line, then the second line.\n\nSo for example, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the output is 2.5000000000. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the max_d is 2.5, which is exactly 2.5. So the code would print that with 10 decimal digits.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you format with .10f, it will show 10 decimal digits, even if trailing zeros. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about cases where the required d is something like 0.0?\n\nLike if all lanterns are at 0 and l is 0. But according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nWait, the input says l is between 1 and 1e9. So l is at least 1.\n\nBut for n=1, and a[0] = 0, l=1. Then the max_d is max(0, 1-0=1). So answer is 1.0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when the lanterns are not sorted. For example, the first input example has lanterns at 15,5,3, etc. So after sorting, they are in order.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=7, l=15. a is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting: [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. So the code computes the initial max_d as max(0, 15-15=0) → 0. Then between consecutive elements:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1 → no.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1 → no.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max_d.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no.\n\nSo the final max_d is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when the lanterns are all at the same position. For example, n=3, l=10, a=[2,2,2]. Then after sorting, [2,2,2]. The initial max_d is max(2, 10-2=8) → 8. Then between consecutive elements, the gaps are 0, 0. So the max_d remains 8. Which is correct. Because the lanterns are at 2. So the left end (0) is 2 units away, and the right end (10) is 8 units away. So the required d is 8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother case: when there are multiple lanterns but some overlapping. For example, n=3, l=10, a=[0, 0, 10]. Then sorted is [0,0,10]. The initial max_d is max(0, 10-10=0). Then between first and second lantern: 0-0=0 → 0. Between second and third: 10-0=10 → 5. So the max_d is 5. Which is correct. Because the middle of the gap between 0 and 10 is 5 units away from each. So d must be 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. Wait, the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as two separate inputs. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... The next line contains n integers ai...\n\nSo each test case is two lines. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. For example, the first input line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', then the next is '2 5\\n2 5'. So the code needs to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. But the sample input shows two test cases. But in the problem statement, perhaps the user is supposed to read one test case. Wait, the sample input shows two test cases, but the problem says that the input is for one test case. Or perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to read one test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But looking at the sample input, perhaps the sample input is two test cases. But in the problem's input description, it says that the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the a_i. So the code should read two lines per test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or is the sample input just showing two different examples?\n\nWait, the sample input is given as two separate inputs. For example, the first input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nand the second input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the sample output is two lines. So the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is unclear. However, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. So maybe the problem is expecting that the code can process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should read until EOF. So the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. How to handle that?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. That's possible if the sample input is for two separate test cases. But the problem's actual input is for a single test case. However, the user's code needs to read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. But the problem statement is unclear. However, looking at the problem's original source (probably Codeforces), the problem may have multiple test cases. But according to the problem's input description, the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. \n\nBut the original problem's input may be for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's because the user provided two examples. So perhaps the code should read one test case. But how to know?\n\nLooking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai ...\n\nSo the code should read two lines. Therefore, the sample input shows two separate test cases. But the code is supposed to process one test case. So perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. So the code should read two lines. But in the sample input, the user provided two test cases.

So perhaps the sample input is two test cases, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe first input line is \"7 15\" followed by \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\", then the second input line is \"2 5\" followed by \"2 5\". The output is two lines. So the code should process multiple test cases. So the code should read until EOF, processing each test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python? For example, the code can read all lines at once, split into pairs. But for the code to work, it's possible that the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn programming competition problems, sometimes the input has multiple test cases. So for example, the code should process all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem's original statement may not mention that. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input may not have that. However, the user's code needs to pass the sample input. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs. For example, read all the input as a list of lines, then process them two lines at a time.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: 7 15\n\nLine 2: 15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSecond test case:\n\nLine 3: 2 5\n\nLine 4: 2 5\n\nSo the code should process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, perhaps the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original statement says nothing about multiple test cases. However, looking at the sample input and output, it's clear that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle this in the code? Because the code needs to read from stdin. So the code can read all the input as a list of lines, then process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nFor example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    n, l = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process the test case\n\n    i += 2\n\nBut this would work for multiple test cases. However, the problem's input may have only one test case. But the code can handle both cases.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the code would process two test cases. However, in the problem's input description, it's unclear whether the code should process multiple test cases or not. However, the sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output has two outputs. So the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement, the input is for one test case. But the sample input shows two. This is confusing. However, the user's code must pass the sample input. So the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the problem's original statement, the input may be multiple test cases. For example, in Codeforces problems, sometimes the input has multiple test cases, and the code must process them all.\n\nBut the problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai ...\n\nSo it's for one test case. However, the sample input has two test cases. So perhaps the problem's input is for multiple test cases. But the problem's input description may have been written for one test case.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code should process all test cases given in the input.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nLet me think. For example, the code can read all the input lines, and process them two lines at a time.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n, l = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        # process the test case here\n\n        a.sort()\n\n        max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n            current = gap / 2\n\n            if current > max_d:\n\n                max_d = current\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut this would handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's input may not have multiple test cases. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So this code would handle that.\n\nBut in the original problem's input, perhaps the code should read only one test case. But the sample shows two. So this code would work for both.\n\nBut the problem's original input may have only one test case. However, the code would still work.\n\nBut how to know? Well, the problem's sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output shows two outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input may have only one test case. But the code can handle both.\n\nSo the code above would be correct.\n\nBut in the problem's original input, perhaps the code is supposed to process only one test case. But the sample shows two. However, the code that reads two lines and processes them would work for the sample.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich is one test case. Then the second input is another test case. So the code that reads two lines per test case would work.\n\nTherefore, the code should be written as such.\n\nBut the problem's input may have multiple test cases. Hence, the code should process them all.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, which would imply that the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's sample input may have been formatted in a way that the user provided two examples. So in practice, the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to resolve this ambiguity?\n\nWell, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code must output two lines for the two test cases. Hence, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input may have only one test case. However, the code must handle multiple test cases. Hence, the code must read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nThus, the code is written as follows.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, perhaps the code is supposed to read only one test case. But the sample input shows two. So perhaps the problem is from Codeforces, and the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut for example, in the original problem, the input may have multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut regardless, the code I wrote earlier would handle that.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nThe code would read first line as n=7, l=15. Then the next line as the a list. Then process, and output 2.5000000000. Then idx is now 2. Then the next line is '2 5' → n=2, l=5. Then next line is '2 5' → a is [2,5]. Process, output 2.0000000000. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, the lines are read as splitlines(). So the code would handle that.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in the problem's original input, perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows two. So the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nHence, the code is written as follows.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and l\n        n, l = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        a.sort()\n        max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            current = gap / 2\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the code may have an empty line. But according to the problem's input description, each test case is two lines. So the code assumes that.\n\nBut what if the input is given with multiple test cases, and the code reads them correctly?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nThe code would process two test cases, and output two lines as expected.\n\nAnother test case: when n=1, l=10, a=[5], then the output is 5.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[2,5], output is 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nWhat if the list a has zero elements? No, n >= 1.\n\nWhat if the list a has one element? The code handles that.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 10, 5]. After sorting, [0,5,10]. The initial max_d is max(0, 10-10=0). Then between 0 and 5: 5/2=2.5. Between 5 and 10: 5/2=2.5. So the max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can light up a segment of the street within a radius `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum radius required to cover the middle of this gap is half the gap's length. Track the maximum value of these gaps divided by two.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The result is the maximum value obtained from the endpoints and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        n, l = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        a.sort()\n        max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            current = gap / 2\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Endpoint Check**: The initial check ensures that the ends of the street are covered by the nearest lantern.\n- **Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we calculate the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The radius needed to cover the middle of this gap is half the gap's length.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required to illuminate the entire street, considering both the gaps between lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.",
