His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the results of two tours, but they are just lists of points without names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of first and second tour scores for participants, ensuring that there's at least one pair (for Vasya) whose sum is at least x. Then, determine the best and worst possible positions he could have.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the best possible rank for Vasya would be when his total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. Wait, no. The best rank is when he has the highest possible total, so that he is first. But since the other participants' totals can be arranged in any way, but the problem says that when there are ties, the jury can assign places. So for the best case, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he's as high as possible), and arrange others such that as many as possible have lower totals than him. But how?\n\nWait, but the actual approach is to find for the best possible scenario, what's the highest rank he can get. For that, we need to select for Vasya a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as high as possible. Then, count how many participants have a sum higher than that. But since the jury can arrange the order in case of ties, for the best case, we can assume that Vasya's sum is higher than as many others as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. Because if he has the maximum possible sum, then he can be placed first. But if there are multiple people with that same sum, he could be placed first (since the jury can choose). So the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j is maximum possible. But how do we find that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can take the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Then, the number of participants that have a sum strictly greater than this value would determine his rank. Because if someone has a higher sum, they must be ranked above him. However, if there are people with the same sum, then the jury can place him as high as possible, so in that case, his best possible rank is the number of people with sum strictly higher than his plus 1.\n\nWait, but how do we find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have? Since the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. But for the best case, we want to take the maximum possible sum. Because that would give him the best possible chance to be first.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. Then, compute how many participants have a sum greater than that. His best rank would be that count + 1.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum possible sum? Well, since the teacher has all the a's and b's. But the problem is that each participant is represented once in the first tour and once in the second. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the participants are in both tours. So each participant has a score in the first tour and a score in the second tour. However, the given lists a and b are the scores of the participants in each tour, but the problem says that the lists are given in arbitrary order. So for example, the first list is a_1 to a_n, which are the first tour scores of the participants, and the second list is b_1 to b_n, which are the second tour scores. However, the pairing between a_i and b_j is not known. So each participant has a unique a_i and a unique b_j. But the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j. So, for the purpose of calculating possible sums, we can pair the a's and b's in any way, as long as each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa. Wait, no. Because each participant has one a and one b. So the pairing is a permutation of the b's. For example, if the participants are p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, then for each p_i, their first tour score is a_i, and their second tour score is b_{sigma(i)}, where sigma is a permutation of 1..n. So the possible total scores for the participants are a_i + b_{sigma(i)} for each i. But the problem is that when considering Vasya's possible positions, we",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves calculating the maximum and minimum possible sums Vasya could have achieved and using these to determine his rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's total score. This can be done by pairing the highest scores from the first tour with the highest scores from the second tour. Once we have the maximum possible sum for Vasya, we count how many participants have a higher total score than this maximum sum. The best rank is then determined by this count plus one.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we need to minimize Vasya's total score while ensuring it meets the minimum threshold. This involves pairing the lowest scores from the first tour with the lowest scores from the second tour. We then count how many participants have a higher total score than this minimum sum and add one to get the worst possible rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort a and b\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best case: maximize Vasya's sum\n    # Pair largest a with largest b\n    max_sum = 0\n    i = n - 1\n    j = n - 1\n    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n        max_sum = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j]\n        i -= 1\n        j -= 1\n    \n    # Count how many pairs have sum > max_sum\n    # To do this, for each a_i, find the number of b_j > (max_sum - a_i)\n    # But since we want to count all possible pairs that can have sum > max_sum\n    # Wait, no. Actually, for the best case, we need to find how many pairs (a_i, b_j) have sum > max_sum.\n    # However, since we are trying to find the best rank for Vasya, which is when his sum is as high as possible,\n    # the number of people with sum > max_sum would be zero, because max_sum is the maximum possible sum.\n    # Wait, no. Because if we pair a_i with b_j in the way that gives max_sum, but other pairings may have higher sums?\n    # No. Because if we pair the largest a with largest b, the sum is the maximum possible. So any other pairing will have sum <= that.\n    # Therefore, the number of participants with sum > max_sum is zero. Hence, best rank is 1.\n    # Wait, but what if there are multiple participants with the same max_sum? Then the jury can assign the rank as 1.\n    # So the best possible rank is 1.\n    # Wait, but this is not correct. For example, if there are multiple pairs that can achieve the same max_sum, then the best possible rank is 1.\n    # So for the best case, the answer is 1.\n\n    # But wait, the problem says that Vasya's sum is at least x. So maybe the maximum possible sum is not achievable. But the problem says that it is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x.\n\n    # Wait, but for the best possible rank, we should consider the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. That is, the maximum possible sum over all possible pairings. So the way to compute that is to sort a and b in descending order and pair them. Then, the max_sum is the sum of the first elements of each sorted list. Then, for the best rank, we need to count how many participants have a sum greater than this max_sum. But since max_sum is the maximum possible sum, there can't be any such participants. Therefore, best rank is 1.\n\n    # So best_rank is 1.\n\n    # Now for the worst case: we need to find the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have, which is at least x. Then, count how many participants have sum strictly greater than that minimal sum, and add 1.\n\n    # So first, find the minimal possible sum that is >=x. How?\n\n    # To find the minimal possible sum >=x, we need to find the minimal value s such that s >=x and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = s. Then, for the worst case, we need to arrange that Vasya has this minimal s, and others have as many as possible sums greater than s.\n\n    # However, how to find this minimal s?\n\n    # Let's think about it. Since we want the minimal s >=x, such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = s. But since we can choose any pairing, but for the worst case, we need to choose the minimal possible s (so that more people can have higher sums than s).\n\n    # So to find this s, we can try to find the minimal possible sum that is >=x. How?\n\n    # We can sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order, then for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then take the minimal among these.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can find the minimal s >=x such that there exists a_i and b_j with a_i + b_j = s. But how?\n\n    # Let me think. For the worst case scenario, we want to choose for Vasya a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible but still >=x. Because then, more people can have higher sums than him.\n\n    # So to find this minimal s, we can do the following:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order. For each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then the minimal s is the minimal among all such a_i + b_j.\n\n    # However, this approach might miss some cases. Let's think again.\n\n    # For example, suppose a = [1, 2, 3], b = [4, 5, 6], x = 5. Then possible pairs are 1+5=6, 1+6=7, 2+4=6, etc. The minimal s is 6.\n\n    # So the way to find the minimal s is to find the minimal possible sum >=x that can be formed by pairing any a_i with any b_j.\n\n    # To find this, we can sort a and b, and for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal s is the minimal among all those a_i + b_j.\n\n    # So here's how to do it:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\n    # For each a_i in a, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. This can be done with binary search.\n\n    # Then, collect all such possible a_i + b_j and find the minimal one. This is the minimal possible s for Vasya.\n\n    # Once we have this s, we need to count how many pairs (a_k, b_l) have a_k + b_l > s. Because for the worst case, we assume that all those pairs are ranked higher than Vasya.\n\n    # However, since we are allowed to pair the a's and b's in any way, but for the worst case scenario, we want to maximize the number of participants with sum > s.\n\n    # Wait, but how can we compute the number of participants that can have a sum greater than s? Because the pairing is arbitrary, but we want to maximize the number of people with sum >s.\n\n    # So to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s, we need to pair a's and b's in such a way that as many pairs as possible have sum >s.\n\n    # But since we are considering the worst case for Vasya, we need to assume that the maximum number of participants have a sum greater than s. Thus, the worst possible rank for Vasya is that number + 1.\n\n    # But how to compute this maximum number of participants with sum >s?\n\n    # For a given s, the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have sum >s is equal to the maximum number of pairs we can form where a_i + b_j >s. This is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with sum greater than a certain value.\n\n    # To compute this, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then greedily pair the smallest a with the largest b that makes the sum >s. This approach is similar to the two-pointer technique.\n\n    # Let's implement this.\n\n    # So steps for the worst rank:\n    # 1. Find the minimal s >=x that can be formed by any a_i + b_j.\n    # 2. Compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have sum >s.

Thus, the worst possible rank for Vasya is that number + 1.\n\n    # But how to compute this maximum number of participants with sum >s?\n\n    # For a given s, the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have sum >s is equal to the maximum number of pairs we can form where a_i + b_j >s. This is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with sum greater than a certain value.\n\n    # To compute this, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then greedily pair the smallest a with the largest b that makes the sum >s. This approach is similar to the two-pointer technique.\n\n    # Let's implement this.\n\n    # So steps for the worst rank:\n    # 1. Find the minimal s >=x that can be formed by any a_i + b_j.\n    # 2. Compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have sum >s. This number is the maximum possible, which would give the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this.\n\n    # First, find the minimal s >=x.\n\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order.\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n\n    min_s = float('inf')\n\n    # For each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        # Use binary search on b_sorted\n        low = 0\n        high = len(b_sorted) - 1\n        found = -1\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if ai + b_sorted[mid] >= x:\n                found = mid\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        if found != -1:\n            current_sum = ai + b_sorted[found]\n            if current_sum < min_s:\n                min_s = current_sum\n\n    # Now, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > min_s.\n\n    # To maximize the number of pairs with sum > s, we can use two pointers approach.\n    # Sort a in ascending, b in descending.\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n\n    count = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a_asc[i] + b_desc[j] > min_s:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            # Try to increase the sum by moving j left (since b is descending)\n            j += 1\n\n    worst_rank = count + 1\n\n    # But wait, what if there are multiple pairs with sum == min_s? For example, if someone else has sum equal to min_s, but Vasya has sum == min_s. Then, the jury can place him after those people, so the worst rank is count + 1.\n\n    # Also, note that the problem says that Vasya's sum is at least x. So the min_s is >=x.\n\n    # However, the above code for finding min_s may not work correctly. For example, if there's no pair that can reach x, but the problem states that it's guaranteed there is at least one.\n\n    # Now, for the best rank, it's 1, because we can choose the maximum sum possible, and no one else can have a higher sum than that.\n\n    # So the output is '1 ' + str(worst_rank).\n\n    print(f\"1 {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
