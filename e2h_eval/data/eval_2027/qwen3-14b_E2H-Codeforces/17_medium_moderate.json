He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the given prefixes and suffixes. And our job is to assign P or S to each input string such that there exists some s that matches.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the correct assignments. Let's think about the possible approach.\n\nLet me think: For a string s of length n, all its prefixes of length 1 to n-1 and all suffixes of length 1 to n-1 are given. But we don't know which is which. However, the original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1, and similarly for suffixes. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input has exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. Because for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there's exactly one prefix and one suffix. So for each l, there are two strings of length l in the input. But the problem says that the input is given in arbitrary order, and we have to assign which is prefix and which is suffix.\n\nBut how can we find the correct assignment?\n\nThe key idea here is that the original string s must have a unique prefix of each length (since each prefix is unique for a given length). Similarly for suffixes. But since the input gives two strings of each length, one of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix. However, for the correct s, the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l must be such that when you combine them, they fit into s.\n\nBut how can we find s? Well, the original string s must have the property that for each l, the prefix of length l is a prefix of s, and the suffix of length l is a suffix of s. Also, the entire string s must be such that all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, perhaps the correct approach is to find the possible candidates for s. But how?\n\nWait, the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be valid, meaning that there exists at least one s that fits. So, perhaps we can find s by considering the possible candidates.\n\nFor example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be such that when combined, they form the original string. Because the original string's prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So, combining these two, the original string would be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Or wait, if the prefix of length n-1 is P and the suffix of length n-1 is S, then the original string s must be P + (last character of S) ? No, because the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], so the original string is s[0] + suffix of length n-1. But the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], which is s without the last character. So, the original string s can be constructed as the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. But how do I know which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nAlternatively, for the original string s, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must overlap in such a way that their combination gives s. So, for example, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first character of the suffix is s[1], and the last character of the prefix is s[n-2]. So the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must share the first n-2 characters. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nIf the prefix of length n-1 is P, and the suffix of length n-1 is S, then P is s[0..n-2], and S is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of S must be equal to the last n-2 characters of P. Because S starts with s[1], and the last n-2 characters of P are s[1..n-2]. So S's first n-2 characters should match the last n-2 characters of P.\n\nSo, for any pair of strings of length n-1 (since there are two such strings in the input), if one is the prefix and the other is the suffix, then they must satisfy this condition. Therefore, for each pair of strings of length n-1, we can check if one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. If so, then we can reconstruct s as P + S[-1], where P is the prefix of length n-1, and S is the suffix of length n-1. Then, once we have s, we can check for all other strings in the input whether they are prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, assign P or S accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all pairs of strings of length n-1. For each pair, assume one is the prefix (P) and the other is the suffix (S). Check if the first n-2 characters of S equals the last n-2 characters of P. If so, then construct s as P + S[-1], and then check if all other input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nOnce we find such an s, then we can assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, collect all the input strings. Then, for the strings of length n-1, there are exactly two of them. Let's call them candidates for being the prefix and suffix of length n-1.\n\nSo for each of the two possibilities (i.e., which one is prefix and which is suffix), check if they can form a valid s. Then, once we have s, check if all the other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nOnce we find such an s, then we can proceed to assign the labels.\n\nBut what if there are multiple possibilities? For example, in the third sample input, the answer can be PS or SP, but the problem allows any valid assignment.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nLoop through all possible pairs of the two length n-1 strings, trying to assign one as prefix and the other as suffix. For each such pair, check if they can form a valid s. Once a valid s is found, then proceed to assign the labels for all input strings.\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s or a suffix of s. Then, assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle the case where multiple possibilities exist? For example, in the third sample input, there are two possible s's. However, the problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be:\n\nFind all possible s candidates based on the two length n-1 strings. For each candidate s, check if all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of s. Once such an s is found, assign the labels accordingly.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead n, then read 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called 'strings'.\n\nThen, collect all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them. Let's call them s1 and s2.\n\nFor each possible assignment (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix; and s2 as prefix, s1 as suffix):\n\nCheck if the first n-2 characters of the suffix equals the last n-2 characters of the prefix.\n\nFor example, if the prefix is P and the suffix is S, then:\n\nP[:-1] should be equal to S[1:] ?\n\nWait, no. Because P is the prefix of length n-1. So P is s[0..n-2]. The suffix S of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of S are s[1..n-2], which is the same as the last n-2 characters of P (since P is s[0..n-2], so last n-2 characters are s[1..n-2]).\n\nTherefore, the first n-2 characters of S must equal the last n-2 characters of P. So:\n\nif len(P) == n-1 and len(S) == n-1:\n\nthen check if P[1:] == S[:-1] ?\n\nYes. Because P is the prefix of length n-1, so P is s[0..n-2]. The suffix S is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, S's first n-2 characters are s[1..n-2], which is the same as P's [1..n-2], i.e., P[1:] (since P has length n-1, so P[1:] is of length n-2). And S[:-1] is s[1..n-2], which is the same as P[1:]. So yes, the check is whether P[1:] == S[:-1].\n\nIf this is true, then the original string s would be P concatenated with the last character of S. Because S is the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the original string s is s[0] + S. But s[0] is the first character of P. So the original string is P[0] + S. Alternatively, since P is the prefix of length n-1, the original string s is P + s[-1], where s[-1] is the last character of S. Because the original s has length n, and P is length n-1. So yes, s = P + S[-1].\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nThe two strings of length 4 (n-1=4) are \"abab\" and \"baba\".\n\nLet's check the first possibility: P = abab (prefix), S = baba (suffix).\n\nCheck if P[1:] == S[:-1].\n\nP[1:] is \"bab\", S[:-1] is \"bab\". Yes. So this is valid. Then s would be P + S[-1] = abab + a → ababa. Which is the sample's correct answer.\n\nAnother possibility: P = baba, S = abab. Check if P[1:] == S[:-1]. P[1:] is \"aba\", S[:-1] is \"aba\". Also yes. Then s would be baba + b → babab. But does this s fit all the input strings?\n\nWait, the input strings for the first sample include \"a\", \"ba\", etc. Let's see. For example, the original s is supposed to be ababa. Let's check for the other input strings.\n\nBut if the candidate s is babab, then:\n\nCheck all input strings. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input strings (assuming n=5, so 2n-2=8 strings):\n\nThe input is:\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nSo the list is:\n\n[\"ba\", \"a\", \"abab\", \"a\", \"aba\", \"baba\", \"ab\", \"aba\"]\n\nIf s is babab, then:\n\nCheck for each of the input strings:\n\n- \"ba\": is it a prefix or suffix?\n\nprefix of length 2: \"ba\" (yes, first two letters of s are \"ba\").\n\nsuffix of length 2: last two letters are \"ab\" (no). So \"ba\" is a prefix. So that would be assigned as P.\n\nSimilarly, \"a\" is a prefix of length 1 (yes) and also a suffix of length 1 (yes). But the input has two \"a\" strings. So for the input, which is the case?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. However, for this scenario, when s is babab, perhaps the input strings are not all prefixes or suffixes. For example, the string \"abab\" is of length 4. For s = babab, the prefix of length 4 is \"baba\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"abab\". So \"abab\" would be a suffix. So in the input, the \"abab\" would be a suffix. However, the input has \"abab\" as one of the strings. So in that case, the input would have \"abab\" as a suffix. But in the original input, the two strings of length 4 are \"abab\" and \"baba\". So if \"abab\" is a suffix, then \"baba\" would be a prefix (since the prefix of length 4 is \"baba\"). So in that case, the input would be valid.\n\nBut then, in this case, the problem says that there is at least one possible s. But in the first sample, the correct s is ababa. However, the other possibility may also be valid. But perhaps in this case, the input strings are not compatible with s being babab.\n\nWait, let's check. Let's take s = babab.\n\nCheck all input strings:\n\nThe input strings are:\n\nba (length 2)\n\na (length 1)\n\nabab (length 4)\n\na (length 1)\n\naba (length 3)\n\nbaba (length 4)\n\nab (length 2)\n\naba (length 3)\n\nSo for s = babab:\n\nprefixes of length 1: 'b'\n\nprefixes of length 2: 'ba'\n\nprefixes of length 3: 'bab'\n\nprefixes of length 4: 'baba'\n\nsuffixes of length 1: 'b'\n\nsuffixes of length 2: 'ab'\n\nsuffixes of length 3: 'bab'\n\nsuffixes of length 4: 'abab'\n\nSo the input strings must be a combination of these prefixes and suffixes.\n\nLooking at the input strings:\n\n- 'ba' is a prefix of length 2. So that's okay.\n\n- 'a' is not a prefix (the prefixes are 'b', 'ba', 'bab', 'baba'). But 'a' is a suffix of length 1? No. The suffixes of length 1 is 'b'. So 'a' is not a prefix or suffix. Therefore, this would be invalid. Therefore, this s is invalid. Hence, the other possibility (s = babab) is invalid. Thus, only the first possibility (s = ababa) is valid.\n\nSo the algorithm would work in that case.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each pair of the two length n-1 strings, check if they can be a prefix and suffix. For those that pass the check, construct s and check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nOnce such an s is found, then we can assign P/S to each input string accordingly.\n\nOnce we have s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with that string) or a suffix (s ends with that string). Then, assign P or S accordingly. However, note that for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two input strings, one of which is a prefix and the other a suffix. So, for each input string, we can check whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. But how to assign the labels when there are multiple possibilities (like in the second sample where multiple answers are allowed)?\n\nBut the problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable. So, for each input string, if it is both a prefix and a suffix of s, then we can assign it as P or S as long as the counts are correct. However, for the problem's constraints, the input is such that there exists at least one s that allows for a valid assignment.\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix or a suffix. But how to ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut since the input is guaranteed to be valid, once we find s, for each length l, the two input strings of length l must be one prefix and one suffix. So, for each of the input strings, we can check if it's a prefix or suffix of s. Then, assign P or S accordingly. However, for some strings, they might be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second sample input, the string 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix of 'aaa'.\n\nIn that case, the code can choose either P or S, but we need to make sure that for each length l, exactly one is chosen as P and the other as S. So, for example, if two strings of the same length are both prefixes and suffixes of s, then we need to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that?\n\nBut since the input is valid, there must be exactly one prefix and one suffix for each length. So, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each input string, if it is a prefix of s, then it's a prefix, else it's a suffix. But how to handle cases where a string is both?\n\nBut for example, in the second sample input, the correct s is 'aaa'. The input strings are:\n\nn=3, input is a, aa, aa, a. So for length 1, there are two 'a's. Both are prefixes and suffixes. But for the correct assignment, each must be assigned as P or S. But since there are two of them, one is P and the other is S.\n\nBut how can we decide which one to assign? Well, the code can just assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S, or vice versa. But in practice, when checking for each input string, if it is a prefix, assign P, else S. But in cases where a string is both, how do we choose?\n\nBut since the input is guaranteed to be valid, there must be exactly one of the two strings for each length that is a prefix (and the other is a suffix). But in some cases, like when both are prefixes and suffixes, how can that be?\n\nWait, for example, in the case of s = 'aaa', the prefixes of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So the two input strings of length 1 are both 'a's. So for each of them, they are both a prefix and a suffix. But in this case, the code needs to assign one as P and one as S.\n\nSo, the code can process each input string and check if it is a prefix or a suffix. However, for such cases, the code may have to choose between P and S. But how to ensure that for each length, exactly one is chosen as P and the other as S.\n\nBut perhaps, once s is determined, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix. If it is, assign P. Else, assign S. However, in cases where a string is both, it could be either. But how to ensure that for each length, exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut since the input is valid, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So, for example, for the two 'a's in the second sample, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. However, since they are the same string, how can we tell which is which?\n\nAh, but in reality, for the string s = 'aaa', the two strings of length 1 are both 'a's. However, they are both a prefix and a suffix. So, in this case, the code can assign one as P and the other as S. However, how to decide which one? Well, the code can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S. But during the checking phase, the code can't know which is which. But since the problem allows any valid assignment, the code can choose arbitrarily.\n\nBut how to do this in code. For example, for each input string, check if it is a prefix. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, for the two 'a's, both are prefixes and suffixes. So, the code would assign P to both, which would be invalid. But that's impossible, since the input is valid.\n\nWait, but the input is valid. So, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So, for the two 'a's in the second sample, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. However, in reality, both are both. How can that be?\n\nWait, the original string is 'aaa'. The prefixes of length 1 is 'a'. The suffixes of length 1 is 'a'. So, the two input strings of length 1 are both 'a's. But how can that be? Because the problem says that the input has exactly two strings of each length. So, the input has two 'a's for length 1. But in reality, for the original string, there is exactly one prefix of length 1 and exactly one suffix of length 1. But both are 'a's. Therefore, the two input strings are both the same as the prefix and suffix. Therefore, for each of them, they are both a prefix and a suffix. But the problem requires that exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S. So, the code can assign one as P and the other as S, even though they are both valid.\n\nSo, the code can process the input strings, for each one, check if it is a prefix. If it is, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. However, for the two 'a's, both are prefixes. So, the code would assign P to both, which would result in two P's for length 1, but that's invalid. But how to avoid that?\n\nThis suggests that the approach of checking if the input string is a prefix or suffix may not be sufficient. Because in some cases, the same string is both a prefix and a suffix, but we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the code needs to, for each length l, find which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix, based on the s.\n\nBut how?\n\nOnce s is determined, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. So, for each l, among the two input strings of length l, exactly one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, we can collect the two strings of length l. Then, for each of them, check if it is the prefix of s (i.e., s starts with it) or the suffix (s ends with it). Then, for each l, exactly one of the two strings will be a prefix, and the other will be a suffix. Because the input is valid.\n\nWait, but in the case of s = 'aaa', for l=1, the two strings are both 'a's. So, both are prefixes and suffixes. How to decide which is which? Well, the problem allows any assignment as long as the counts are correct. So, for example, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do this in code?\n\nIn this case, for the two strings of the same length, both are prefixes and suffixes. So, we can choose one as P and the other as S. For example, for the first occurrence in the input, assign P, and the second assign S.\n\nBut how to track which is which?\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. However, for strings that are both prefix and suffix, we need to ensure that for each length l, exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Well, for each length l, collect the two strings. Then, for each of them, check if it is a prefix. If exactly one is a prefix, then assign accordingly. If both are prefixes (or both are suffixes), then assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each length l, collect the two input strings. Then, for each of the two strings, check if it is a prefix of s. Exactly one of them must be a prefix (since the original string has exactly one prefix of length l). Similarly, exactly one of them must be a suffix.\n\nWait, but in the case where the string is both a prefix and a suffix (like 'a' in the second sample), then for the two identical strings, both are prefixes and both are suffixes. However, the original string has exactly one prefix of length l and exactly one suffix of length l. But since the two input strings are the same, they can't both be the prefix (as there's only one prefix of that length). So, perhaps this is a contradiction. Wait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, perhaps in such cases, the two input strings are the same, but they are both the same as the prefix and suffix. However, since the input has exactly two strings of each length, but the actual prefix and suffix are the same string. How is that possible?\n\nAh, because for the original string, the prefix of length l is the same as the suffix of length l. For example, the string 'aaa' has prefix of length 1 as 'a', and the suffix of length 1 as 'a'. So, the input has two copies of 'a' for length 1. But in this case, both are the same as the prefix and suffix. Therefore, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that? Well, for each length l, collect the two input strings. For each of them, check if it is a prefix. If both are, then assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose which?\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, mark it as a possible P. Then, for each length l, among the two input strings, exactly one must be a prefix. If both are prefixes (like in the case of 'a's), then we can assign one as P and the other as S. However, how to detect this?\n\nAlternatively, for each length l, the two input strings must be the prefix and suffix. So, for the two strings of length l, one is the prefix, and one is the suffix. So, for each of them, check if it is the prefix. If exactly one is, then assign P to that one and S to the other. If both are, then we need to choose one as P and the other as S. However, how to know which one?\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid assignment, the code can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S. Or, for example, for the two strings, assign one as P and the other as S regardless of their actual status.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nPerhaps, after determining s, for each input string, check if it's a prefix. If it is, assign P. Else, assign S. But in cases where both are prefixes (like the two 'a's), this would assign P to both, which is invalid. However, in reality, this is impossible because the input is valid. Wait, but how can the input be valid if there are two strings of length l that are both prefixes?\n\nBecause the original string has exactly one prefix of length l. Therefore, in the input, there can be two strings of length l, but only one of them can be the prefix. However, if the two strings are the same, then both are the same as the prefix. But the input has two copies of the same string, but in reality, they are both the same as the prefix. So, how can the input be valid?\n\nAh, this is possible. For example, the original string is 'aaa', and the input has two 'a's for length 1. Both are the same as the prefix of length 1. So, the code must assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that?\n\nIn this case, the code can't rely on checking if it is a prefix, since both are prefixes. So, perhaps the code should for each length l, check which of the two strings is the actual prefix and suffix. But how?\n\nWell, for each length l, the actual prefix of s of length l is s[0...l-1], and the suffix is s[n-l ... n-1]. So, for each l, the two input strings of length l must contain exactly one of these two strings. Therefore, for each l, we can find which of the two input strings is the prefix (s[0...l-1]) and which is the suffix (s[n-l ... n-1]).\n\nSo, for each l in 1..n-1:\n\nCollect the two input strings of length l. Let's call them str1 and str2.\n\nCheck if str1 equals the prefix of s of length l. If yes, then assign it as P. The other must be the suffix, assign as S.\n\nElse, check if str2 equals the prefix of s of length l. Assign accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that for each l, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as P (the actual prefix) and the other as S (the actual suffix).\n\nYes! Because for each l, the actual prefix and suffix are known once s is determined. Therefore, for each l, the two input strings must contain exactly the actual prefix and the actual suffix. Therefore, for each of the two input strings, we can check if it matches the actual prefix of length l. If so, assign P, else assign S.\n\nThis approach would work even in the case where the two input strings are the same. For example, in the case of s = 'aaa', l=1. The actual prefix is 'a', the suffix is 'a'. The two input strings are both 'a's. So, when we check for each input string of length l, if it equals the actual prefix (which it does), then assign P. But both would be assigned as P, which is invalid.\n\nWait, but that's a problem. How to resolve this?\n\nAh, but in this case, the actual prefix and suffix are the same. So, the two input strings are both the same as the prefix and the suffix. So, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S. However, since both are the same as the prefix, how to decide which is which?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, in this case, the input has two strings of length l which are both the same as the prefix and suffix. Therefore, the code can assign one as P and the other as S, regardless of their actual status.\n\nSo, for this case, the code can assign the first input string as P and the second as S. But how to track which input strings belong to which l?\n\nSo, the code needs to group the input strings by their length. For example, for each l, collect the two input strings. Then, for each l, compare each of the two input strings with the actual prefix of s of length l and the actual suffix of s of length l.\n\nFor example, for each l:\n\nprefix_l = s[:l]\n\nsuffix_l = s[-l:]\n\nThen, the two input strings for length l must be prefix_l and suffix_l. So, for each of the two input strings, check if it's equal to prefix_l. If one of them is, then assign it as P. The other is assigned as S.\n\nBut in the case where both are equal to prefix_l (because prefix_l is equal to suffix_l), then how to decide which is which?\n\nIn this case, both are the same as prefix_l. So, for the two input strings, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So, the code can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose which one?\n\nSince the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose arbitrarily. For example, assign the first input string of length l as P and the second as S. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, group them by their length. For each length l, collect the two input strings. Then, for each of these two strings, check if they match the prefix of s of length l. If exactly one matches, assign that as P, the other as S. If both match (i.e., prefix and suffix are the same), then assign the first input string as P and the second as S.\n\nThis would ensure that for each l, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nSo, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, find s. To find s, iterate over the two strings of length n-1 and try the possible combinations.\n\nOnce s is found, then for each input string, assign P or S based on the above method.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next 2n-2 lines into a list called 'strings'.\n\nCollect all the strings of length n-1. Let's say they are stored in a list called candidates. There are exactly two elements in this list.\n\nFor each possible permutation of the two candidates (i.e., (s1, s2) and (s2, s1)):\n\nCheck if the first n-2 characters of the suffix equals the last n-2 characters of the prefix. That is, for the candidate pair (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate), check if prefix_candidate[1:] == suffix_candidate[:-1].\n\nIf this is true, then construct s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1].\n\nOnce s_candidate is constructed, check if all the input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nHow to check this:\n\nFor each string in the input list:\n\nCheck if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with it) OR a suffix of s_candidate (s_candidate ends with it). If any string is neither, then this s_candidate is invalid.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce s is determined, group the input strings by their lengths. For each length l, collect the two strings. Then, for each of these pairs, compare with the actual prefix and suffix of s of length l.\n\nFor example, for each l in 1..n-1:\n\nprefix_l = s[:l]\n\nsuffix_l = s[-l:]\n\nThen, for the two input strings of length l:\n\nif str1 == prefix_l and str2 == suffix_l:\n\nassign str1 as P, str2 as S.\n\nelif str1 == suffix_l and str2 == prefix_l:\n\nassign str1 as S, str2 as P.\n\nelse:\n\none of them is prefix_l, the other is suffix_l. So, check which is which.\n\nBut in code, for each of the two input strings of length l, check if it equals prefix_l. If one does, assign it as P, the other as S.\n\nBut in cases where both are equal to prefix_l (because prefix_l == suffix_l), then assign the first as P and the second as S.\n\nOnce all assignments are done, output the corresponding P/S sequence.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate the output string. The order of the output is based on the order of the input strings. So, for each input string, we need to determine whether it's a prefix or suffix of s, based on the grouping by length.\n\nBut how to track which input strings are which for each length l?\n\nSo, the code can create a dictionary that maps each length l to a list of the input strings of that length. For example, for the input strings, we can pre-process them into a dictionary, where keys are lengths, and values are lists of strings of that length.\n\nOnce that is done, for each length l, we can process the two strings in the order they appear in the input.\n\nBut how to map back to the original input order? Because the output depends on the original order of the input strings.\n\nSo, the code needs to process each input string in the original order, and for each, determine if it is a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string in the original order, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, this approach may not work in cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. But when the code proceeds to group by length, and for each length l, ensures that exactly one is P and one is S, this approach may not be sufficient. However, perhaps the grouping by length approach is better.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nHere's a possible plan:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, determine whether it is the prefix of s of its length or the suffix of s of its length.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor each input string, check if it is the prefix of s of length len(str). If it is, then assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut in cases where the string is both, this may not work. However, the grouping by length approach ensures that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Therefore, for each string in the input, if it is the prefix of s for its length, assign P. Else, assign S. But in cases where",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves reconstructing the original string `s` using the given input and then validating each input string against `s` to determine if it is a prefix or a suffix.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate Strings**: Extract the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. These are potential candidates for being the longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct String `s`**: Check if the two candidate strings can be combined to form a valid string `s`. This is done by ensuring that the overlap between the prefix and suffix is consistent.\n3. **Validate Input Strings**: Once a valid `s` is reconstructed, check each input string to determine if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`. This involves grouping input strings by their lengths and comparing them against the corresponding prefixes and suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Collect all strings of length n-1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == n - 1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try both permutations of the two candidates\n    for i in range(2):\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1 - i]\n        # Check if they can form a valid s\n        if prefix_candidate[1:] == suffix_candidate[:-1]:\n            s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Now check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of s_candidate\n            valid = True\n            for s in strings:\n                is_prefix = s_candidate.startswith(s)\n                is_suffix = s_candidate.endswith(s)\n                if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Found the correct s_candidate\n                s = s_candidate\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try the other permutation\n            continue\n    \n    # Now, group the input strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    length_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for idx, s in enumerate(strings):\n        length_to_strings[len(s)].append((idx, s))\n    \n    # Prepare the answer\n    answer = [''] * len(strings)\n    \n    # For each length l from 1 to n-1\n    for l in range(1, n):\n        # Get the two strings of this length\n        entries = length_to_strings[l]\n        str1_idx, str1 = entries[0]\n        str2_idx, str2 = entries[1]\n        \n        # Get the actual prefix and suffix of s of length l\n        prefix_l = s[:l]\n        suffix_l = s[-l:]\n        \n        # Determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix\n        if str1 == prefix_l:\n            answer[str1_idx] = 'P'\n            answer[str2_idx] = 'S'\n        elif str1 == suffix_l:\n            answer[str1_idx] = 'S'\n            answer[str2_idx] = 'P'\n        else:\n            # One of them must be the prefix, the other the suffix\n            if str2 == prefix_l:\n                answer[str2_idx] = 'P'\n                answer[str1_idx] = 'S'\n            else:\n                answer[str2_idx] = 'S'\n                answer[str1_idx] = 'P'\n    \n    print(''.join(answer))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of strings.\n2. **Candidate Identification**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **String Reconstruction**: By checking the overlap between the prefix and suffix candidates, we attempt to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: Each input string is validated against the reconstructed string `s` to determine if it is a prefix or suffix.\n5. **Result Construction**: Using the validated information, the result string is constructed with 'P' for prefixes and 'S' for suffixes, maintaining the order of the input strings.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify the prefixes and suffixes of the original string while adhering to the constraints provided in the problem.",
