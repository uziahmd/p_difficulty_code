He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our job is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that fits the assignments.\n\nThe output must be a string of length 2n-2 with equal numbers of P and S (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes). But the problem allows any valid assignment as long as there's at least one possible s that matches it.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the correct string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input is all the prefixes and suffixes, but we don't know which is which, we need to find a way to assign them such that there exists a string s that has exactly those prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how can I find such an assignment?\n\nLet me think about the possible approach. For each possible candidate string s, check if all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes. Then, for each input string, determine if it's a prefix or suffix of s. However, since the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., there exists at least one s), but for the code, perhaps we need to generate possible candidates and check which ones fit.\n\nBut how do I generate possible candidates? Well, considering that the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes of s, but we don't know which is which. However, the correct s must have the following properties:\n\n- The full string s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. Wait, no. The input contains all the improper prefixes and suffixes of s. So, for example, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings: one is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. But the input gives all these 2n-2 strings, but in arbitrary order.\n\nWait, but the input may have multiple possibilities. For example, in the third sample input, the input is two strings: \"a\" and \"c\". The possible s could be \"ac\" (so the prefixes are \"a\" and \"ac\" (but since n=2, the prefixes are of length 1. So the input is for n=2, the input has 2*2-2=2 strings. The two strings are \"a\" and \"c\". Then the possible s could be \"ac\" (prefixes are \"a\", suffixes are \"c\") or \"ca\" (prefixes are \"c\", suffixes are \"a\").\n\nSo the problem is to assign each input string as either a prefix or a suffix, such that there exists a string s of length n where:\n\n- All the strings marked as prefix are prefixes of s.\n\n- All the strings marked as suffix are suffixes of s.\n\nMoreover, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because for each length l, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFind a string s such that for each l from 1 to n-1, the two input strings of length l are exactly the prefix and suffix of s of length l. Then, assign each of the input strings as P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do I find such an s?\n\nWell, since the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes of s, then the full string s must be such that:\n\nFor example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) is a prefix of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is a suffix of s. Also, the full string s must be such that the concatenation of the prefix of length n-1 and the last character (which is the suffix of length 1) must be s. But perhaps that's not helpful directly.\n\nAlternatively, the correct s must be such that for each l in 1..n-1, the prefix of length l is present in the input, and the suffix of length l is present in the input. But since the input contains all of them, but the problem is to assign which is which.\n\nBut how can I find s? Well, for the correct s, the prefix of length n-1 is a string in the input. Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 is also in the input. So perhaps, for each pair of strings in the input of length n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Then, combining them, we can get possible candidates for s.\n\nFor example, suppose the input has two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. Then, the actual s must be A + last_char (which is the suffix of length 1). Or B + last_char. But the suffix of length n-1 is B, so the last character of s is the same as the last character of B. So, if A is the prefix of length n-1, then s is A + (the last character of B, since B is the suffix of length n-1). Wait, no. Because if B is the suffix of length n-1, then s ends with B. So the entire s is B's first character followed by ... etc. Wait, no. For example, if s is ababa, then the suffix of length 4 is abab. The prefix of length 4 is abab. But in that case, the full s is ababa, which is the prefix of length 4 plus the last character 'a'.\n\nSo, for the case of the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1), they must be such that their combination gives the correct s.\n\nSo, here's an idea: For the input, collect all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them. Let's call them X and Y. Then, the correct s must be X concatenated with the last character of Y (since Y is the suffix of length n-1, so s ends with Y. Therefore, the last character of Y is the last character of s. Also, X is the prefix of length n-1, so s is X plus the last character. So, the last character of s is the same as the last character of Y. Therefore, X concatenated with the last character of Y must be s. Similarly, Y concatenated with the last character of X would be another possibility. Wait, but if Y is the suffix of length n-1, then the prefix of length n-1 is X. So s is X + [last character of Y], and Y is the suffix of length n-1. So, the last character of Y is the last character of s. So, the s must be X + (Y[-1]).\n\nSimilarly, if Y is the prefix of length n-1 and X is the suffix of length n-1, then s would be Y + (X[-1]).\n\nTherefore, for each pair of strings of length n-1, we can generate two possible candidates for s. Then, check if these candidates are valid (i.e., all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s).\n\nOnce we find such an s, we can assign the input strings as P or S accordingly.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Collect all the input strings, along with their indices (to know which one is which in the output).\n\n2. Find all the strings of length n-1. There are two of them.\n\n3. For each possible pairing (each of the two strings can be the prefix of length n-1, and the other the suffix of length n-1), generate possible candidate s:\n\n   a. candidate1 = prefix_str + suffix_str[-1]\n\n   b. candidate2 = suffix_str + prefix_str[-1]\n\n   Wait, no. If the two strings of length n-1 are X and Y, then for candidate1, suppose X is the prefix of length n-1, and Y is the suffix of length n-1. Then, the full string s must be X concatenated with the last character of Y. Because the suffix of length n-1 is Y, which is the last n-1 characters of s. So, s is of length n, so the first n-1 characters are X, and the last n-1 characters are Y. Therefore, the entire string s must be X concatenated with Y[-1], because the first n-1 characters are X, and the last character is the same as the last character of Y.\n\n   Similarly, if X is the suffix of length n-1 and Y is the prefix of length n-1, then s is Y concatenated with X[-1].\n\n   So for each pair of X and Y (the two strings of length n-1), we can generate two possible candidates for s.\n\n   Then, for each candidate, check whether all the input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of it. If so, then that candidate is a possible s, and we can proceed to assign the P and S labels accordingly.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate s, then we can go through all the input strings and for each, check whether it is a prefix of s or a suffix of s. Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how do we handle cases where multiple candidates exist? Well, the problem allows any valid assignment, so once we find a valid candidate, we can proceed.\n\nBut what if there are multiple candidates? Well, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there's at least one candidate. So our code can pick the first valid candidate it finds.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For the input strings, collect all the strings of length n-1. Let's say they are X and Y.\n\n- Generate possible candidates for s: X + Y[-1], Y + X[-1].\n\n- For each candidate s_candidate:\n\n   - Check if all the input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\n   - If yes, then proceed to assign P/S.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate?\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with the string) or a suffix (s_candidate ends with the string). However, since the input strings are exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate (except the full string itself), then for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut how to verify that? Well, for each input string, check whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. If all of them are, then it's valid.\n\nOnce we have a valid s_candidate, then for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix or suffix of s_candidate, and assign accordingly. However, we need to make sure that for each length l (from 1 to n-1), exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because the input has exactly two strings of each length. So for each length l, the two strings must be one prefix and one suffix.\n\nBut when we check for each input string, it's possible that a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if the string is \"a\" and s_candidate is \"aaa\", then \"a\" is both a prefix and suffix. However, in such a case, the input has two strings of length 1. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to have exactly two strings of each length. But in that case, for the input, for length 1, there are two strings. Suppose one is \"a\" (which is both prefix and suffix) and another is also \"a\" (same thing). Then, the problem says that the input is generated from some existing string, so it's possible. But in this case, for the assignment, we need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix. But since they are same, it's allowed.\n\nBut how to ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because if both are prefixes, then that would not be possible. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there exists at least one s that satisfies the conditions. So when we check the candidate s_candidate, the input strings must be exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate. So for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings of that length is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, when checking for the candidate s_candidate, for each length l, the two input strings of that length must be one prefix and one suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut how to confirm that? Well, for each length l, check that exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. However, in practice, when we generate the candidate s_candidate, and check that all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes, then for each length l, the two input strings must be a prefix and a suffix. Because otherwise, there would be more than one prefix or suffix for that length. But since the input is guaranteed to be valid, this will hold.\n\nBut maybe not. For example, suppose that for some l, both input strings are prefixes of s_candidate. That would mean that the input is invalid, but the problem says that the input is valid. Therefore, such a case would not occur. However, in our code, when we check the candidate s_candidate, we need to make sure that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how to do that? Well, perhaps during the check of the candidate s_candidate, for each input string, we can note whether it is a prefix or suffix. Then, for each length l, among the two input strings of that length, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps the way the candidate is generated ensures that for the two strings of length n-1, one is a prefix and one is a suffix. Then, for other lengths, perhaps the rest of the input strings are automatically covered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the candidate is generated (based on the two longest strings) ensures that the rest of the input strings are covered.\n\nBut perhaps the approach is: generate the candidate s_candidate based on the two longest strings. Then, check that all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. If that is true, then proceed.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor example, take the first sample input:\n\nInput for n=5:\n\nThe input strings include 'abab' (length 4), 'baba' (length 4). So the two strings of length 4. Let's suppose that the correct s is 'ababa'. Then, the prefix of length 4 is 'abab', and the suffix of length 4 is 'baba'. So the candidate would be 'abab' + 'a' (the last character of 'baba') which is 'ababa'. Which is correct. Then, for each input string, check if it's a prefix or suffix of 'ababa'.\n\nSo, for the code steps:\n\nOnce the candidate s_candidate is generated, loop through all the input strings. For each input string, check if it's a prefix of s_candidate (s_candidate.startswith(string)) or a suffix (s_candidate.endswith(string)). If any input string is neither, then the candidate is invalid.\n\nIf all pass, then proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce that's done, for each input string, assign P if it is a prefix, else S. However, there could be cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if the string is 'a' and the candidate is 'aaa', then 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix. In such a case, we can choose either P or S. However, the problem requires that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So, for the two input strings of length l, one must be assigned as P and the other as S. So, in the case where both are the same string (like two 'a's of length 1), then both are prefix and suffix. But since they are same, the assignment can be P and S (but how? Since they are same, but the code would have to assign one as P and the other as S. However, in that case, the code needs to make sure that for each length l, the two strings are assigned as one P and one S.)\n\nBut how to handle this in code? Well, perhaps during the assignment phase, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix or suffix. But if it's both, then we can choose either. However, the code must ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, since the input is valid, there exists at least one s_candidate, and for that s_candidate, for each length l, the two input strings of that length are one prefix and one suffix. Therefore, when checking for the candidate s_candidate, for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings of that length is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Therefore, during the assignment phase, for each input string, if it is a prefix, then assign P, else assign S. However, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then it's possible that the code would assign it as P or S, but since for the same length l, the other string must be the opposite.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nWell, perhaps when generating the candidate, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate is found, for each input string, check whether it's a prefix or suffix. However, for the same length l, the two strings must be one prefix and one suffix. Therefore, when processing the input strings, for each length l, we can collect the two strings, and for each of them, determine if they are a prefix or suffix. Since the candidate is valid, exactly one of them will be a prefix and the other a suffix. Therefore, during the assignment, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix (then assign P) or else assign S. Even if it's both, but in that case, the other string of the same length must be the opposite.\n\nBut how to handle that in code? Well, perhaps during the assignment phase, for each input string, we can just check if it's a prefix (using startswith) and assign P if yes, else S. However, for the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, this could lead to assigning P, but the other string (same length) could be also assigned P (if it's also a prefix and suffix). Which would be invalid. But since the input is valid, this case should not happen. Wait, but how?\n\nFor example, consider s_candidate is 'aaa', and for length 1, there are two input strings 'a' and 'a'. Both are prefixes and suffixes. So for each of them, the code would assign P or S. However, since for each length l, exactly one of the two strings must be assigned as P and the other as S. So, even though both are prefixes and suffixes, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S. However, the code's current approach would assign both as P (since they are prefixes), leading to two P's for that length. Which is invalid.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nThis suggests that the code's approach of checking if a string is a prefix and assigning P otherwise S may not work in such cases. Therefore, the code needs to ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, the problem is that in some cases, a string can be both a prefix and suffix. For example, the string 'a' in the case of s_candidate 'aaa'.\n\nIn that case, for the two input strings (both 'a'), how to assign P and S?\n\nThe code needs to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to decide which?\n\nBut the problem allows any valid assignment. So, perhaps for each length l, collect the two input strings, and for each, check if they are a prefix or suffix. Then, for each pair, assign one as P and the other as S. However, if both are prefixes and suffixes, then we can choose arbitrarily. For example, assign the first one as P and the second as S.\n\nBut how to track this in code?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nOnce the candidate s_candidate is found, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. Then, for each length l, collect the two input strings of that length. For each pair, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. Therefore, for each pair, if one is a prefix, assign P, the other S. If both are prefixes (which is possible only if they are the same string?), then we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to detect that?\n\nBut in the case where both are prefixes and suffixes, how can we know which to assign as P and which as S?\n\nBut the problem allows any assignment as long as there exists at least one valid s. Therefore, perhaps in such cases, we can assign one as P and the other as S regardless of their status. Because the code is allowed to output any valid assignment.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nOnce the candidate s_candidate is found, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. Then, for each length l, collect the two input strings of that length. For each pair, if exactly one is a prefix, assign that as P and the other as S. If both are prefixes (which can only happen if the two strings are same), then assign one as P and the other as S. Similarly, if both are suffixes, assign one as S and the other as P. But how?\n\nBut how to know which one to assign as P and which as S?\n\nPerhaps for each pair of strings of the same length l, we can check which one is a prefix and which is a suffix. But in cases where both are prefixes (or both are suffixes), we can assign one as P and the other as S, regardless. For example, if two strings are same, and both are prefixes and suffixes, then assign the first one as P and the second as S.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nOnce the candidate s_candidate is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. Then, for each length l, collect the two input strings. For each pair, if exactly one is a prefix, assign that as P, the other as S. If both are prefixes (same string?), assign the first as P and the second as S. If both are suffixes, assign the first as S and the second as P. Wait, but how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of strings of the same length l, we can check if one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. If not, then assign one as P and the other as S, but how?\n\nBut the problem states that the input is valid, which implies that for the correct s_candidate, each pair of strings of the same length l consists of one prefix and one suffix. However, in the case where the two strings are same, then they are both a prefix and suffix. Therefore, for that case, the code can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that in code?\n\nSo, during the assignment phase, for each input string, we can first check if it is a prefix. Then, for each length l, collect the two input strings. Then, for each pair, if one is a prefix, assign that as P, the other as S. If both are prefixes (same string), assign the first as P and the second as S. Similarly, if both are suffixes, assign the first as S and the second as P. But how to know which is which?\n\nBut in code, perhaps for each pair of strings of the same length, we can process them, and for each, assign P or S based on whether they are a prefix. However, if both are prefixes, then we need to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose which?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can assign the first occurrence of the string as P and the second as S. But that depends on the order in which the code processes the input.\n\nBut the problem allows any valid assignment, so perhaps the code can process the input strings in the order given, and for each length l, collect the two strings, then for each pair, check if they are a prefix or suffix. For example:\n\nFor each length l:\n\n   collect the two strings in the input of length l.\n\n   for each of the two strings, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate.\n\n   count how many are prefixes.\n\n   if exactly one is a prefix, then assign that as P and the other as S.\n\n   if both are prefixes (same string), assign the first as P and the second as S.\n\n   if none are prefixes (both are suffixes), assign the first as S and the second as P.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce we have the s_candidate, we can create a dictionary mapping length l to the list of two strings of that length. Then, for each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   get the two strings.\n\n   for each of the two strings, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate.\n\n   count the number of prefixes.\n\n   if count == 1:\n\n       assign P to the one that is a prefix, and S to the other.\n\n   else:\n\n       if both are prefixes (count == 2):\n\n           assign P to the first, S to the second.\n\n       else (count == 0, both are suffixes):\n\n           assign S to the first, P to the second.\n\nBut wait, in the case where both are prefixes, they are also suffixes. So, the code can assign one as P and the other as S regardless.\n\nBut how to check if a string is a prefix or suffix?\n\nIn code, for a given string s_candidate and input string str, check:\n\nis_prefix = s_candidate.startswith(str)\n\nis_suffix = s_candidate.endswith(str)\n\nBut for the code to assign P or S, perhaps we need to know whether the string is a prefix or a suffix. However, the code can't just rely on being a prefix, because in the case where the string is both, we have to choose which to assign.\n\nBut according to the above logic, for each pair of strings of same length l, if both are prefixes (and thus also suffixes), then assign the first as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how does that ensure that for each length l, exactly one is P and one is S?\n\nYes. Because for each pair, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nFirst, the code reads n, then reads 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called inputs.\n\nThen, collect all the strings of length n-1. For example:\n\nstrings_of_n_minus_1 = [s for s in inputs if len(s) == n-1]\n\nThese should be exactly two strings.\n\nThen, generate the possible candidates for s_candidate:\n\nfor each pair (x, y) in the two strings:\n\n   candidate1 = x + y[-1]\n\n   candidate2 = y + x[-1]\n\n   check if candidate1 is valid (all input strings are prefix or suffix of it)\n\n   if valid, proceed.\n\n   similarly for candidate2.\n\nOnce a valid candidate is found, proceed to generate the output.\n\nNow, how to check if a candidate is valid.\n\nFor the candidate s_candidate, for each input string in inputs, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. If any input string is neither, the candidate is invalid.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\ndef is_valid_candidate(s_candidate, inputs):\n\n    for s in inputs:\n\n        if not s_candidate.startswith(s) and not s_candidate.endswith(s):\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nBut this is O(m * k), where m is 2n-2 and k is the length of the string. But since n is up to 100, it's acceptable.\n\nOnce the candidate is found, then proceed to generate the output.\n\nNow, for generating the output, we need to process each input string in the original order, and assign P or S.\n\nSo, for each input string, we need to know whether it's a prefix or suffix of the candidate, but with the consideration for same-length pairs.\n\nBut how to do that? Well, perhaps we can create a dictionary that maps each string (but considering that there may be duplicates) to their positions. However, since the same string can appear multiple times, perhaps we need to process the input strings in order, and for each length l, track which strings have been processed.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can create for each length l, a list of the two input strings. For example, for l in 1..n-1, we can have a list of two strings.\n\nThen, for each input string in the original order, we can check for its length l, and see which of the two strings in the list it is. Then, based on the processing of that pair, determine whether to assign P or S.\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nFor example, during the processing phase, for each length l, we can process the two strings of that length, and for each, decide whether to assign P or S. Then, for each input string, we can look up its length and position in the pair to determine the assignment.\n\nBut how to track for each input string which pair it belongs to and its position in the pair.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing phase, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix or suffix, but with the logic described earlier for handling same-length pairs.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach is:\n\nOnce the candidate is found, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of the candidate. Then, for each length l, collect all the input strings of that length, and for each pair, decide which is P and which is S.\n\nBut how to map back to the original input order.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way is to process the input strings in the order they were given, and for each, determine whether it is a prefix or suffix, but ensuring that for each length l, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nBut this seems challenging.\n\nAlternative idea:\n\nOnce the candidate is found, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix. Then, for each length l, we can collect all the input strings of that length. For each such pair, if exactly one is a prefix, assign P to that one and S to the other. If both are prefixes, assign the first one as P and the second as S. If none are prefixes, assign the first as S and the second as P.\n\nBut how to track which input strings are part of which pair.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- For the candidate s_candidate, create a dictionary: for each length l, store the list of input strings of that length. For example, for l in 1..n-1, we have a list of two strings.\n\n- For each input string, determine which length it belongs to, and its index in the list (0 or 1).\n\n- Then, for each length l, process the two strings in the list.\n\n- For each such pair, decide which is P and which is S based on the above logic.\n\n- Then, for each input string in the original order, determine its P/S based on its position in the pair.\n\nBut how to track which input string is which in the pair.\n\nBut during the initial processing, when building the dictionary, we can group the input strings by their length. For example, for each l, we can have a list of the two strings in the order they appear in the input.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given l, the two strings may appear in any order in the input. So, for example, in the input, for l=1, the first string may be 'a', and the second may be 'b', or vice versa.\n\nBut for the processing phase, for each l, we need to process the two strings of that length, and assign P/S based on their status as prefix/suffix. However, the order in which we process them (the order in which they appear in the input) may affect the assignment. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can process them in any order.\n\nBut how to map the original input strings to their positions in the pairs.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\nOnce the candidate is found, create a dictionary that maps each length l to a list of the two input strings of that length, in the order they appeared in the input. For example, for each l, we can collect the input strings of that length in the order they were read. Then, for each l, process these two strings.\n\nOnce that is done, for each input string in the original order, we can determine which l it belongs to, and which position (0 or 1) in the list for that l. Then, during the processing of the l's pair, we can determine whether to assign P or S to that string.\n\nBut how to track this information?\n\nPerhaps during the initial grouping phase, for each input string, we can record its length and the index in the list for that length. However, this would require for each input string, storing the length and the index (0 or 1) in the list of that length.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet's think of code steps:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s_candidate, we can create a dictionary called length_to_strings, which maps each length l to a list of the two input strings of that length, in the order they appeared in the input.\n\nFor example:\n\nlength_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor s in inputs:\n\n    l = len(s)\n\n    length_to_strings[l].append(s)\n\nThen, for each l in 1..n-1, length_to_strings[l] has two elements.\n\nThen, for each input string in the original order, we can determine which l it belongs to, and its index in the list for that l.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, for each input string, during the initial processing, we can create a list of tuples (s, l, index_in_list). But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing phase, for each input string in the original order, we can look up its length l, then find its index in length_to_strings[l]. However, since the input strings may have duplicates, this could be tricky. For example, if two strings of length l are the same, how to know which one is which?\n\nBut for the purpose of the assignment, since the code needs to assign P/S for each input string in the original order, the code must know for each input string which of the two in the pair it is. So, for example, for the original input, the first occurrence of a string of length l is index 0 in the list for that l, and the second occurrence is index 1.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nFor example, for each input string in the original order, when building the length_to_strings, we can track for each l, the order in which the strings were added. So, for the first string of length l, it's added as index 0, the next as index 1.\n\nThus, during the processing phase, for each input string in the original order, we can find its l, and then check in the list for l which index it is (0 or 1).\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nFor example, in Python:\n\nfor each input string in the original list:\n\n   l = len(s)\n\n   index_in_list = length_to_strings[l].index(s)\n\nBut this would work only if the string is present once in the list. However, if the same string appears twice in the input for the same l, then the index() method would return the first occurrence. Which may not be correct. But in that case, the code would assign the same index for both, which would be wrong.\n\nBut this is a problem. For example, suppose the input has two identical strings of the same length l. Then, when building the length_to_strings, the list for l has two entries. When processing the first occurrence, index_in_list is 0, and the second occurrence would also have index_in_list 0 (since s is the same as the first element). But that's not correct, since the second occurrence is the second element in the list.\n\nSo, this approach would not work for duplicate strings.\n\nHmm. How to handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: during the building of the length_to_strings, for each l, store the list of strings in the order they appeared in the input. Then, for each input string in the original order, we can track for each l, which index in the list it is. But how to do that?\n\nPerhaps, for each input string, during the initial processing, we can store for each string, the length and the index in the list for that length. However, this would require for each string, storing that information. But since the same string can appear multiple times, this approach may not be feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: during the processing phase, for each l, iterate through the list of strings in the order they were added. For each input string in the original order, check if it's in the list for its length, and determine its index. However, for duplicates, this can be ambiguous.\n\nThis seems like a problem. How can we track which input string corresponds to which index in the list for its length?\n\nMaybe the solution is to build, for each input string, a list of (length, index_in_list) pairs. But how?\n\nAlternatively, during the initial processing, when building the length_to_strings, for each input string, we can also create a list called 'original_positions' which for each input string, stores the length",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is not specified. Our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate Strings**: The key insight is that the longest improper prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`) can be used to generate potential candidate strings for `s`. By combining these two strings appropriately, we can form candidate strings for `s`.\n2. **Validate Candidates**: For each candidate string, check if all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of the candidate.\n3. **Assign Roles**: Once a valid candidate string is found, determine the roles (prefix or suffix) for each input string, ensuring that for each length, exactly one string is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    inputs = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n    \n    #
