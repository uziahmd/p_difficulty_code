При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an overlapping error. The overlap has to be such that the end of the first s overlaps with the beginning of the second s, and the overlapping part must be a positive number of characters but less than the length of s. Also, the case where the two s's are completely overlapping (so t is exactly s) or just concatenated normally (like s + s) should not be considered as errors. So, for example, if t is \"abcd\", it's considered as no error, same with \"abcabc\".\n\nSo the task is: given t, check if there exists some s such that t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s with some positive overlap (but not full overlap or zero). If possible, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, NO.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to find such an s.\n\nLet me think about the possible lengths of s. Since the original two messages are merged into t, the length of t must be equal to 2 * len(s) - k, where k is the overlap length. And since k must be between 1 and len(s)-1 (inclusive), then:\n\nlen(t) = 2L - k, where L is len(s), and 1 ≤ k ≤ L-1.\n\nRearranging, we get that L must be such that 2L - len(t) is between 1 and L-1. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote len(t) as n. Then for some L (the length of s), we have:\n\nn = 2L - k → k = 2L - n.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - n ≤ L - 1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities for L.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L - n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n +1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L -n ≤ L-1 → 2L -n ≤ L -1 → L ≤ n -1.\n\nSo combining, L must satisfy (n+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ n-1.\n\nBut L must also be at least 1, but since n is at least 1 (given that t is non-empty), but for L to be in that range, let's see.\n\nFor example, if n is 5, then (5+1)/2 = 3. So L must be between 3 and 4 (since n-1 is 4). So possible L values are 3 and 4.\n\nSo for each possible L in that range, we can check whether there exists a k (which would be 2L -n) such that the overlapping is valid.\n\nBut wait, since k is 2L -n, and for each L, k must be between 1 and L-1. So for each possible L in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], we can compute k and check if it's valid.\n\nBut how do I find possible L's?\n\nLet me think. For example, let's take the sample input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the first example. The output is 'abrakadabra', which has length 11. The original t is the merged string. Let's compute n here. The input string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 characters long? Let me count. Well, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. The merged string is 11 + 11 - k. For example, in the first example, the merged string is 11 + 11 - 1 = 21 (since k=1). So n is 21. So for L=11, the possible k is 2*11 - 21 = 22 -21 = 1, which is between 1 and 10 (since L-1 is 10). So yes. So that's valid.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nLoop through all possible L values in the range ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1. Wait, but since L must be integer, the possible L values are from floor((n+1)/2) up to n-1? Or perhaps (n+1)/2 is a real number, so for example, if n is even, say n=4, then (n+1)/2 is 2.5, so L must be >= 3, but n-1 is 3. So possible L is 3.\n\nSo for each L in the range from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, inclusive. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible L in the range from (n+1)//2 to n-1, inclusive. Because for example, when n is even, say 6: (n+1)/2 is 3.5, so ceil is 4. But (n+1)//2 in integer division would be (6+1)//2 = 3.5 floored to 3. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the first inequality is L ≥ (n+1)/2. Since L must be integer, the minimum L is the ceiling of (n+1)/2. For example, if n is 5, (n+1)/2 is 3. So L starts at 3. If n is 4, (n+1)/2 is 2.5, so L starts at 3.\n\nSo for each possible L in [ceil((n+1)/2), ..., n-1], we can check if 2L -n is between 1 and L-1. Wait, but since L is chosen such that 2L -n is in that range. Because earlier we derived that for L to be in that range, the k will be between 1 and L-1.\n\nWait, because for L in that range, the k=2L -n. Let me check for L being between (n+1)/2 and n-1:\n\nLet me take L_min = ceil( (n+1)/2 ), and L_max = n-1.\n\nFor example, when L is L_min, then k is 2L -n. Let's take n=5, L_min is 3. Then k is 6-5=1. Which is between 1 and 2 (since L-1 is 2). So valid.\n\nWhen L is n-1, then k is 2*(n-1) -n = 2n -2 -n = n-2. Now, since L is n-1, L-1 is n-2. So k equals L-1. Which is allowed, since the upper bound is L-1. So that's okay.\n\nSo for all L in [ceil( (n+1)/2 ), n-1], the k=2L -n is between 1 and L-1. Therefore, for each such L, we can check if the string t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s, where s is of length L, and overlapping k characters.\n\nNow, how to check that.\n\nFor a given L, the k is 2L -n. Let's compute k. Then, the overlapping requires that the last k characters of s are equal to the first k characters of s. Because when you merge two s's with k overlapping, the first s ends with the first k characters of s, and the second s starts with those same k characters. So the overlapping part is the same.\n\nSo the merged string t would be s concatenated with s[k:], i.e., the first s, then the second s with the first k characters removed. Therefore, the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n, which matches.\n\nSo for the given t, to check for a given L, we need to check if the first L characters (s_candidate) can be such that the last k characters of s_candidate equal the first k characters of s_candidate. Then, the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] which should equal t.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nLet me think. For a given L, the candidate s is the first L characters of t. Wait, no. Because the merged string t is s + s[k:]. So the entire t is of length 2L -k. But since k = 2L -n, then n = 2L -k. So substituting, 2L -k = n → k = 2L -n. Which is correct.\n\nBut for the merged string to be t, the first L characters of t must be s. Then, the next part (from position L onwards) must be s[k:]. So the entire t must be s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nBut how do I check that?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose s is 'abab', L=4. Let's say k is 2. Then the merged string would be 'abab' + 'ab' (since s[k:] is 'ab'). So the merged string is 'ababab'.\n\nSo for the given t, which is 'ababab', L is 4. Then, the first L characters are 'abab', and then the rest is 'ab', which is s[k:] (s[2:] is 'ab').\n\nSo for a given L, the candidate s is the first L characters of t. Then, we check if the last k characters of s equals the first k characters of s. Also, we need to check that when you concatenate s with s[k:], you get t.\n\nBut how?\n\nSo for the candidate s_candidate = t[0:L], then the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. We can check if this equals t.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nYes, for example, if the candidate s is s_candidate, then the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So the length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. Which is correct. So for the given t, we can check if this concatenated string equals t.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each possible L in the range [ceil( (n+1)/2 ), n-1 ]:\n\n   compute k = 2L - n\n\n   if k is between 1 and L-1 (which it should be, since we generated L in that range):\n\n      s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n      check if the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n      also check that s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t.\n\nIf any of these checks pass, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nBut why do we need both checks? Well, the first check ensures that the overlapping is possible. However, even if the overlapping is possible, the concatenated string may not be equal to t. For example, maybe the overlapping is correct, but the rest of the string doesn't match. So checking both conditions is necessary.\n\nWait, but if the overlapping is correct, then the concatenated string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So if the overlapping is correct, then the first part is s_candidate, and the second part is s_candidate[k:]. So the total is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], which should be equal to t. But how to make sure that this is the case?\n\nBut how can we know that the rest of the string is correct? Because the t is supposed to be formed by merging two s_candidates. So the entire t must be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nWell, for example, suppose s_candidate is 'abrakadabra' (length 11), and k is 1. Then the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] which is 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the first sample input. So the t must be exactly that. So for the given t, if we take the first L characters as s_candidate, then check if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] equals t.\n\nSo that's the way to check.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nCompute n = len(t).\n\nIf n is less than 2, then it's impossible. Because for two messages to be merged, the original s must have length L ≥ 1, and the merged string has length 2L -k. For example, if n is 1, then 2L -k =1. But L must be ≥ (n+1)/2 = 1. So L is 1. Then k= 2*1 -1 =1. But k must be ≤ L-1 = 0. Which is not possible. So for n=1, output is NO.\n\nSo for n < 2, output is NO.\n\nElse:\n\nfor L in possible range:\n\n   compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   if k is between 1 and L-1:\n\n      s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n      if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] and s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n\n          return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the L's work, return NO.\n\nBut wait, for the check s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t, perhaps that's redundant with checking the overlapping part?\n\nBecause if the overlapping part is correct, then the merged string would be s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:], but how do we know that the entire t is that?\n\nFor example, imagine that the overlapping is correct, but the rest of the string is not. How?\n\nLet me think of a scenario. Suppose s_candidate is 'abac', and k=2. Then the merged string should be 'abac' + 'ac' → 'abacac'. Suppose the actual t is 'abacabc'. Then the overlapping part is correct (last 2 chars of s_candidate is 'ac', first 2 of s_candidate is 'ab' — no, that's not correct. So that's not possible. So the first check (overlapping) is required.\n\nWait, in the case where overlapping is correct, then the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], which is the correct way. So if the overlapping is correct, then the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], and thus t must be equal to that. But how can that not be the case?\n\nWait, suppose that the t is longer than that. But according to the way we compute L and k, the length of the merged string is 2L -k = n. So the length of s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. Which is the same as the length of t. So if the t is exactly that string, then it's correct. But how can we be sure that the t is that string?\n\nBecause the s_candidate is the first L characters of t. So the first part of t is s_candidate. Then the rest of the t must be s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo for example, the first L characters are s_candidate, then the next part must be s_candidate[k:]. So for the entire t to be correct, the part after the first L characters must be s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo for example, let's take t as s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. Then, the entire t is that. So the code can check whether t equals that.\n\nBut since the code is generating s_candidate as the first L characters of t, then the code can check whether the rest of the string (t[L:]) is equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nWhich is equivalent to checking whether t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo perhaps, instead of checking the entire string, we can check if t[L:] equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nWhich is more efficient, perhaps.\n\nSo for a given L and k, the code can check:\n\nif t starts with s_candidate (which it does, since s_candidate is t[0:L]), and then the rest of the string (t[L:]) equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut since the code is generating s_candidate as t[0:L], then the first part is already correct. So the check is whether t[L:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 21). Let's take L=11 (so len(s_candidate)=11). Then k = 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. So check if t[11:] equals s_candidate[1:]. s_candidate is the first 11 characters, which is 'abrakadabra'. s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra'. t[11:] is 'abrakadabra' (the rest of the string). Wait, no. Wait the entire t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming that the first part is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters) and then the next part is 'abrakadabra' (but with overlapping of 1 character). So the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] which is 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is 11 + 10 = 21 characters. So t[L:] is t[11:] which is 'brakadabra' (10 letters). Which is equal to s_candidate[1:].\n\nSo the check is t[L:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\nThus, for each candidate L, the steps are:\n\ncompute k = 2L -n.\n\nif k is between 1 and L-1 (which it should be, given our selection of L):\n\n   s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n   if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] and t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n       return YES and s_candidate.\n\nBut why do we need to check both conditions? Well, the first condition ensures that the overlapping is possible (so that the two s's can be merged with that overlap). The second condition ensures that the rest of the string matches. But perhaps the second condition is redundant, because if the overlapping is correct, then the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], which would imply that the entire string is correct. However, since the s_candidate is taken from the first L characters of t, perhaps the rest of the string may not match. For example, if the overlapping is correct, but the rest of the string is not s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how can that happen? Let's think of an example. Suppose t is 'ababa', and n=5. Let's see possible L values.\n\nn=5, so possible L ranges from ceil((5+1)/2) = 3 to 4.\n\nSo L can be 3 or 4.\n\nFor L=3:\n\nk=2*3 -5 = 1.\n\nCheck if the first 3 characters (s_candidate = 'aba') has last 1 character equal to first 1 character. 'a' == 'a' → yes.\n\nThen check if t[3:] (i.e., 'ba') is equal to s_candidate[k:] → s_candidate[1:] is 'ba'. So yes. So t[3:] is 'ba' which equals 'ba'. So this would pass. So the answer would be 'aba'.\n\nBut then, the merged string would be 'aba' + 'ba' → 'ababa' which is exactly t. So it works.\n\nAnother example: Let's say t is 'aabbaa', n=6.\n\nPossible L ranges from ceil(7/2) = 4 to 5.\n\nCheck L=4:\n\nk=2*4 -6= 8-6=2.\n\ns_candidate is first 4 characters: 'aabb'.\n\nCheck if last 2 chars of s_candidate (bb) equals first 2 chars (aa)? No. So this fails.\n\nCheck L=5:\n\nk=2*5 -6= 10-6=4. Check if 4 is between 1 and 4 (yes). s_candidate is first 5 characters: 'aabba'.\n\nCheck if last 4 chars of s_candidate ( 'abba') equals first 4 chars ( 'aabb')? No. So this fails. Thus, no solution. So output is NO.\n\nBut what if the t was 'aabbaabbaa'?\n\nWait, perhaps another example. Suppose t is 'ababab', n=6.\n\nPossible L is ceil(7/2)=4 (since (6+1)/2 is 3.5, ceil is 4) to 5.\n\nFor L=4: k=2*4 -6= 2.\n\ns_candidate is 'abab'.\n\nCheck last 2 chars of s_candidate (ab) equals first 2 chars (ab) → yes.\n\nCheck t[L:] (t[4:] is 'ab') equals s_candidate[k:] (s_candidate[2:] is 'ab') → yes. So this would be valid. So the answer is 'abab'.\n\nBut then, the merged string would be 'abab' + 'ab' → 'ababab', which is correct.\n\nSo yes, the check works.\n\nBut why do we need to check both the overlapping part and the rest of the string? Because the overlapping part ensures that the two s's can be merged, but the rest of the string must be correct. However, in the case where the overlapping part is correct, but the rest of the string is not, then the check for the rest of the string would catch that.\n\nFor example, suppose t is 'ababa', but the actual merged string would be 'abab' + 'ab' (with k=2). Then, the length is 4 + 2 = 6. But that's not the case. So perhaps my example isn't correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose t is 'abaxa', n=5. Let's say L=3, k=1. s_candidate is 'aba'. Check if last 1 char (a) equals first 1 char (a) → yes. Then check if t[3:] is 'xa' equals s_candidate[k:] → s_candidate[1:] is 'ba'. So 'xa' != 'ba' → invalid. Thus, even though the overlapping is correct, the rest of the string is not. Hence, the check is needed.\n\nSo the code needs to check both conditions.\n\nBut how can the overlapping be correct and the rest of the string not match? Because the s_candidate is taken from the first L characters of t, which may not be the actual s. For example, maybe the t was formed by overlapping two s's, but the first L characters of t are not the correct s. But how?\n\nWait, the s_candidate is the first L characters of t. But in reality, the merged string is s + s[k:]. So the first L characters of t must be s. So if the code takes s_candidate as the first L characters, then that's the correct s. Therefore, if the overlapping is correct, and the rest of the string is s_candidate[k:], then the entire t is correct. But how can the rest of the string not be s_candidate[k:]?\n\nWell, if the code is checking for a possible s_candidate that is not the actual s. But in this problem, we are trying to find any possible s that could have caused the error. So if the code finds that for a given L, the first L characters of t is s_candidate, and that the overlapping is correct and the rest of the string matches, then that s_candidate is a valid solution.\n\nBut if the overlapping is correct but the rest of the string doesn't match, then that s_candidate is not a valid solution.\n\nSo the code needs to check both conditions.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over possible L values.\n\nFor each L:\n\n   compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   if k is between 1 and L-1:\n\n      s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n      check if s_candidate's last k chars == first k chars.\n\n      check if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]\n\n      if both are true, return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none found, return NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2: print NO.\n\nElse:\n\nfor L in range(ceil((n+1)/2), n):\n\nWait, but in Python, how to compute the starting value of L.\n\nLet me think about the possible L's.\n\nThe minimum L is ceil( (n +1)/2 )\n\nBut since L must be an integer, let's compute that as (n +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example, when n is 5, (n+1)/2 = 3. So ceil(3) is 3. So (5+1)/2 is 3. So for integer division, how to compute ceil((n+1)/2)?\n\nIn Python, we can compute it as (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example:\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2=3 → ceil is 3. (5+1 +1) // 2 is 7//2=3.5 → 3? Wait no, in Python, integer division is done with //. For example, (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for n=5, (n +1) is 6. Divided by 2 is 3. So ceil((n+1)/2) is 3. So for general cases, the minimum L is (n +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula for ceil(a / b) when a and b are integers can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for ceil( (n+1)/2 ), the formula would be ( (n+1) + 2 -1 ) // 2 = (n+2) // 2.\n\nYes. For example, n=5: (5+2) //2 =7//2=3. Correct.\n\nn=4: (4+2)//2=6//2=3. Which is correct, since (4+1)/2=2.5, ceil is 3.\n\nSo the starting L is (n + 2) // 2.\n\nThe maximum L is n-1.\n\nSo for L in range( (n+2)//2, n ):\n\nWait, but in Python, range is exclusive of the upper limit. So to include n-1, the upper limit should be n.\n\nSo for L in range( (n+2)//2, n ):\n\nBut wait, for example, if n is 5, then (n+2)//2 is (5+2)//2=3.5 floored to 3. So L starts at 3, and goes up to n-1=4. So the range would be from 3 to 5 (exclusive of 5) → 3 and 4. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each L in that range:\n\ncompute k = 2*L - n.\n\nCheck if 1 <= k <= L-1. Well, since we generated L based on the constraints, but perhaps due to integer division, there could be some edge cases. For example, when n is even?\n\nBut according to previous analysis, for L in the range [(n+2)//2, n-1], the k will be between 1 and L-1. Let me check for L = (n+2)//2.\n\nLet me take n=5, L=3. k=2*3 -5 = 1. Which is between 1 and 2 (L-1=2). Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6. (n+2)//2 = (6+2)/2=4. So L starts at 4. For L=4, k=8-6=2. L-1=3. 2 is between 1 and 3. Correct. For L=5 (n-1=5), k=2*5 -6=4. Which is between 1 and 4 (L-1=4). So yes.\n\nSo the code can proceed to loop through all L in that range, compute k, and then check the two conditions.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    for L in range( (n+2)//2, n ):\n\n        k = 2*L -n\n\n        if k <1 or k > L-1:\n\n            continue  # but according to previous analysis, this shouldn't happen\n\n        # else:\n\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n        # check if last k chars of s_candidate == first k chars of s_candidate\n\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n            # check if the rest of t matches s_candidate[k:]\n\n            if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n                print(s_candidate)\n\n                exit()\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where multiple L's are possible? For example, in the second sample input 'acacacaca' (output is 'acaca').\n\nLet's see. The input is 'acacacaca', which has length 9. Let's compute possible L's.\n\nn=9. (n+2)//2 is (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5. So L ranges from 5 to 8 (since n-1=8).\n\nFor each L in 5,6,7,8:\n\nCheck for each:\n\nL=5:\n\nk=2*5 -9 = 10-9=1. Check 1 <=1 <=4 (yes). s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'acaca'.\n\nCheck if last 1 char is 'a' and first 1 char is 'a' → yes. Then check t[5:] is 'caca' (since t is 'acacacaca', t[5:] is 'caca').\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'caca'. So yes. So this is valid. So output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother possible L is 6:\n\nk=2*6 -9= 12-9=3. Check if 3 <=5 (since L-1=5). Yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 letters: 'acacac'.\n\nCheck if last 3 chars of s_candidate is 'cac' and first 3 chars is 'aca'? No. So this would not pass.\n\nSo the code would find L=5 first and return.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother example: sample input 'abcabc' outputs 'NO'.\n\nLet's check. len(t)=6.\n\nPossible L is (6+2)//2=4. So L ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nFor L=4: k= 8-6=2. Check if 2 is between 1 and 3 (yes). s_candidate is 'abca'.\n\nCheck if last 2 chars of 'abca' is 'ca' and first 2 is 'ab' → no. So invalid.\n\nFor L=5: k= 2*5 -6 = 4. Check if 4 <=4 (L-1=4). Yes. s_candidate is 'abcab'.\n\nCheck last 4 chars: 'bcab' vs first 4 chars 'abca' → no. So invalid. So output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 'abababab' (input) outputs 'YES' with 'ababab'.\n\nLet me check. len(t) is 8.\n\nPossible L is (8+2)//2 = 5. So L ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nCheck L=5:\n\nk= 2*5 -8 = 2. Check 1<=2 <=4. Yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'ababa'.\n\nCheck if last 2 chars 'ba' == first 2 'ab'? No. So invalid.\n\nL=6: k= 12-8=4. Check 4 <=5 (yes).\n\ns_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck last 4 chars of s_candidate: 'baba' (positions 2-5?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). last 4 chars: positions 2 to 5 (indices 2,3,4,5?), or indices 6-4=2 to 5?\n\nYes, in Python, s_candidate[-k:] for k=4 is the last 4 characters: 'baba'.\n\nFirst 4 chars of s_candidate is 'abab'.\n\nAre they equal? No. So invalid.\n\nNext L=7:\n\nk= 2*7 -8 = 6. Check if 6 <=6 (since L-1 is 6). Yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 7 letters: 'abababa'.\n\nCheck last 6 chars of s_candidate: 'bababa' (positions 1-6). First 6 chars: 'ababab'.\n\nCompare 'bababa' vs 'ababab'? No. So invalid.\n\nHmm, but sample output says 'YES' with 'ababab'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the sample input.\n\nSample input is 'abababab' (output is 'YES\\nababab').\n\nSo len(t) is 8.\n\nThe correct s is 'ababab' (length 6). Let's see:\n\nSo for s = 'ababab', two copies merged with some overlap.\n\nThe merged string would be s + s[k:]. Let's compute k.\n\nThe length of t is 8. For s of length 6, the merged length is 2*6 -k = 8 → k= 12-8=4.\n\nSo k=4.\n\nSo the overlapping is 4 characters. The last 4 characters of s must be equal to the first 4 of s.\n\ns is 'ababab' → last 4 chars: 'abab' (positions 2-5?), or indexes 2,3,4,5: 'abab'.\n\nFirst 4 chars: 'abab' → same. So overlapping is possible.\n\nThen the merged string is s + s[4:] → 'ababab' + 'ab' → 'abababab', which is the input. So this is valid.\n\nBut according to our code, for L=6, which is in the range (n+2)//2 = (8+2)/2=5 → L ranges from 5 to 7. So L=6 is included.\n\nFor L=6, k=2*6 -8= 4. Which is between 1 and 5 (L-1=5). So yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck if last 4 chars (s_candidate[-4:] is 'abab') equals first 4 chars (s_candidate[:4] is 'abab') → yes.\n\nThen check if t[L:] (t[6:] is 'ab') equals s_candidate[k:] → s_candidate[4:] is 'ab'. So yes. So the code would return YES and 'ababab'.\n\nAh! So in my previous calculation for L=6, I must have made a mistake. Let me recheck:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). For k=4, the last 4 characters are s_candidate[-4:] → 'abab' (since the string is a b a b a b. indexes 0-5. -4 is index 2. So characters 2,3,4,5: a, b, a, b → 'abab'. The first 4 characters are a, b, a, b → 'abab'. So yes, they are equal. Then t[L:] is t[6:] which is 'ab'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[4:] → 'ab'. So yes. So the code would return this.\n\nSo why in my previous analysis for L=6, I thought that the first 4 characters were 'abab' and the last 4 were 'baba'? That was my mistake. So the code would find this case.\n\nSo the code would correctly find this.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when the same string can be formed with multiple L's? The code returns the first one found.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t from input.\n\nHandle the case when len(t) is less than 2.\n\nElse, loop L in range( (n+2)//2, n ), which in Python is from (n+2)//2 to n-1 inclusive. Because the range in Python is up to but not including the end. So for example, range(a, b) includes a, a+1,..., b-1.\n\nSo for L in range( (n+2)//2, n ):\n\nBut for example, if n is 8, then the range is from 5 to 8, which is 5,6,7. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nt = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n        k = 2 * L - n\n\n        if k < 1 or k > L - 1:\n\n            continue\n\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] and t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n            print(s_candidate)\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but for L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ), but for example, when n is 5, the range is from 3 to 5 (exclusive), so 3 and 4.\n\nBut in Python, range is up to but not including the end.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an overlapping error. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the beginning of the second message, and the overlap length must be a positive number less than the length of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string `t`.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, immediately return \"NO\" as it's impossible to form such a string from two messages.\n3. **Determine Possible Lengths**: Calculate possible lengths for the original message `s` based on the constraints of the problem. The valid lengths for `s` are derived from the formula ensuring the overlap length is between 1 and the length of `s` minus 1.\n4. **Check Validity**: For each valid length of `s`, check if the string can be split into two parts such that the end of the first part overlaps with the beginning of the second part correctly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    t = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    if n < 2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    found = False\n    # Iterate over possible lengths L of s\n    for L in range((n + 2) // 2, n):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        if k < 1 or k > L - 1:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        # Check if the overlapping part matches\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n            # Check if the rest of the string matches\n            if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is less than 2, it's impossible to form the required string, so \"NO\" is printed immediately.\n3. **Range Calculation**: The valid lengths for `s` are calculated using the formula `(n + 2) // 2` to `n - 1`. This ensures that we consider all possible lengths where the overlap conditions can be satisfied.\n4. **Overlap Check**: For each candidate length `L`, compute the overlap length `k`. Check if the last `k` characters of the candidate string `s_candidate` (first `L` characters of `t`) match the first `k` characters of `s_candidate`. Additionally, ensure that the remaining part of `t` matches the substring of `s_candidate` starting from index `k`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid configurations to determine if the given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages with an overlap.",
