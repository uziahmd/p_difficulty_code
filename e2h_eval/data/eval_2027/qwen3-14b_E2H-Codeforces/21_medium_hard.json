The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let me think about the parity here. Because the sum is odd, that means one of them is even and the other is odd. So for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. Conversely, a chest with an odd a_i needs a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach should be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Similarly, count the number of keys that are even and odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. So the total is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parities. \n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11). \n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1 (7), even_keys = 3 (others). \n\nSo the first part is min(3, 1) = 1. The second part is min(2, 3) = 2. Total 1+2=3. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSecond example input: \nChests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. So min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So odd_keys is zero. So min(1,0) is 0. And odd_chests is zero. So total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach is correct. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, how to implement this in Python?\n\nWe can read the input, process the lists. For the chests, iterate through each element and check if it's even or odd. Same for keys.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of a_i, then the list of b_j.\n\nCompute even_chest = number of elements in a that are even. Similarly for odd_chest. Then even_key and odd_key.\n\nThen compute the sum of min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes. That's the plan.\n\nNow, code.\n\nIn Python, for each list, we can loop through and count. For example:\n\neven_chest = 0\nfor num in a_list:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest +=1\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\nSame for keys.\n\nBut since n and m can be up to 1e5, this is O(n + m) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read a list of n numbers.\n\nThen read a list of m numbers.\n\nCompute even_chest, odd_chest, even_key, odd_key.\n\nThen answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_chest: 3 (14,6,2)\n\nodd_chest: 2 (9,11)\n\nkeys: [8,4,7,20]\n\neven_key: 3 (8,4,20), odd_key:1 (7)\n\nso min(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=5, m=1\n\na is [2,4,6,8,10] → even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\n\nkeys: [5] → even_key=0, odd_key=1.\n\nso min(5,1) is 1, min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Correct.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is [10] → even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\n\nkeys: [20,30,40,50] → even_key=4, odd_key=0.\n\nso min(1,0) is 0, min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where there are zero even chests or keys.\n\nLike, all chests are even, but all keys are even. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: some chests and keys.\n\nAnother case: when there are more even chests than odd keys. So the min is the number of odd keys.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, implement it in Python.\n\nRead input:\n\nThe input is read from stdin. The first line is n and m. Then the next line is n integers. Then the next line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, no, the user provided the input as a list of strings. But in the actual problem, the input is given via standard input. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead first line as n, m.\n\nThen read the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen read third line as list of integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute counts.\n\neven_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest +=1\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num %2 ==0:\n        even_key +=1\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(ans)\n\nYes.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11] → even_chest is 3.\n\nodd_chest is 2.\n\nb is [8,4,7,20] → even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7).\n\nans = min(3,1) + min(2,3) → 1+2=3. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when there are more keys than needed. Like, if there are 10 even chests and 5 odd keys. Then min(10,5) is 5. Then the rest is min(odd_chest, even_key). Suppose odd_chest is 3 and even_key is 5. Then min(3,5) is 3. Total 5+3=8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Pairs**: \n   - Even chests can be opened by odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be opened by even keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two minimum values:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest += 1\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_key += 1\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by the lists of numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We iterate through the lists of chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Calculating Possible Pairs**: Using the counts of even and odd numbers, we determine the maximum number of valid pairs by considering the constraints of even-odd sums. The result is the sum of the two possible minimum pairings as described.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, ensuring it handles the upper limits of the problem constraints effectively.",
