Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance d from their position. So the problem is to determine the smallest d that ensures full coverage.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this. The key idea is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d for those gaps. Because if there's a gap between two lanterns, the worst case is the middle of that gap. For example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b), then the distance between them is (b - a). The maximum distance from either lantern to the midpoint would be (b - a)/2. So for that gap, the required d would be half of the gap. But wait, also need to consider the ends of the street. Like, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly for the end at l.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because the order of the lanterns matters when checking the gaps between them.\n2. Check the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The required d here is (a[0] - 0), because the lantern's coverage needs to reach 0. Wait, no. Wait, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the leftmost point covered by it is a1 - d. To cover the 0 point, we need a1 - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. But if there's a gap between 0 and a1, then the maximum distance would be a1 - 0. But wait, the lantern's coverage must reach 0, so the required d for that area is a1 - 0. But if there's another lantern after that, maybe that's covered by the next lantern? No, because the first lantern's coverage is up to a1 + d. But the first part of the street is from 0 to a1. So the maximum distance from the first lantern to the left end is a1. So the required d for that part is a1. But wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then that part is zero. So that's the first check.\n\nSimilarly, for the end of the street. The last lantern's position is a_n-1. The distance from that lantern to the end l is l - a_n-1. So d needs to be at least that value.\n\nThen between two consecutive lanterns, say a[i] and a[i+1], the maximum distance between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]). The worst case is the midpoint between them. The distance from each lantern to that midpoint is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. So for that gap, the required d is half of the gap.\n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum of:\n\n- The first lantern's position (if it's not at 0)\n- The last lantern's distance from l (if it's not at l)\n- The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0]. So the required d must be at least that, because otherwise the area from 0 to a[0] - d would not be covered. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the first lantern is at position a1. The coverage of that lantern is from a1 - d to a1 + d. To cover the start of the street (position 0), we need 0 to be within that interval. So 0 >= a1 -d → d >= a1 - 0 → d >= a1. Wait, no. If a1 is 3, then for d=3, the coverage starts at 0. So yes, the required d for the start is a1 - 0. Similarly, for the end, the required d is l - a_last.\n\nBut then, between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]). The worst case is the middle of that gap. The distance from each lantern to that middle point is (gap)/2. So the required d for that gap is (gap)/2.\n\nSo the overall answer is the maximum between the first part (distance from 0 to first lantern), the last part (distance from last lantern to l), and the maximum of (gap/2) between consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance: first_lantern = a[0], so initial_dist = first_lantern - 0.0.\n- Compute the end distance: last_lantern = a[-1], end_dist = l - last_lantern.\n- Compute the max_gap between consecutive lanterns. For each i from 0 to n-2, compute a[i+1] - a[i], then take the maximum of these values.\n- The required d is the maximum among initial_dist, end_dist, and (max_gap / 2).\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the initial distance is a[0], the end distance is l - a[0], and the max_gap is zero (since there are no consecutive lanterns). So the maximum between initial and end.\n\nYes. For example, if n=1 and l=5, and the lantern is at 0. Then the initial distance is 0, end distance is 5, so d must be 5. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother example: the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, they become [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo initial distance is 0 - 0 = 0. End distance is 15 - 15 = 0. The gaps between consecutive lanterns are:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting: [2,5]. Initial distance is 2 - 0 = 2. End distance is 5 -5 = 0. The gap between them is 5-2=3 → 1.5. So the maximum is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the second sample.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nNow, handling edge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=1, l=0. Well, according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nCase 2: n=1, l=10, lantern at 0. Then initial distance is 0, end distance is 10. So d is 10.\n\nCase 3: n=2, lanterns at 0 and l. Then initial and end distances are 0, and the gap is l. So the max gap is l, divided by 2. So d is l/2.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are not sorted. So the first step is to sort the array.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial_dist = a[0] - 0.0 (but wait, if a[0] is 0, then it's zero. So the initial distance is a[0] - 0, but if the lantern is at 0, that's zero. So that's correct.)\n\nCompute end_dist = l - a[-1].\n\nCompute max_gap between consecutive lanterns. For each i in 0 to n-2, compute a[i+1] - a[i], take the maximum.\n\nThen the answer is the maximum between initial_dist, end_dist, and (max_gap / 2).\n\nBut wait, in the case where the initial_dist is zero, but the end_dist is zero, and the max_gap is zero (like n=1, l=0, but l can't be zero). So for n=1, l=5, and the lantern is at 5. Then initial_dist is 5, end_dist is 0, max_gap is zero. So the answer is 5.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n and l from input. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort the list.\n\nCompute initial_dist = a[0] (since 0 is the start). Wait, no. Wait, initial_dist is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Which is a[0] - 0. So yes, a[0]. But if the first lantern is at 0, then that's zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then the initial_dist is 0. So the d must be at least 0. But that's okay. Because the lantern's coverage starts at 0 - d. So for d=0, the coverage is just 0. But if the lantern is at 0, then the coverage is from 0 - d to 0 +d. So for d=0, it's just 0. So if the lantern is at 0, then the initial_dist is 0, and the coverage starts at 0. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nAfter sorting the list, compute initial_dist = a[0] - 0.0? Or a[0]?\n\nWait, the initial distance is the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. Which is a[0] - 0. So yes. So initial_dist = a[0]. But wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then that's 0. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, end_dist is l - a[-1].\n\nBut what if the lantern is already at l? Then end_dist is 0.\n\nSo the code:\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nThen, the candidate for d is max(initial_dist, end_dist, max_gap / 2.0)\n\nSo the answer is the maximum of these three values.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, in Python, the input is given as two lines. For example, the first example input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo, the first line is n and l. The second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort it.\n\nBut need to read from stdin. So in Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nThen compute initial_dist, end_dist, etc.\n\nBut wait, in the case when n is 0? No, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo, for n=1, the code will process correctly.\n\nSo code:\n\nThen:\n\ninitial = a[0]\n\nend = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nd = max( initial, end, max_gap / 2.0 )\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the initial is 0, end is 0, max_gap is 5 (between 9 and 14?), no. Wait the sorted list is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The gaps are 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1. So the max_gap is 5. Then 5/2 is 2.5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. initial is 2, end is 0. max_gap is 3. So max(2, 0, 3/2=1.5) → 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then initial is 5, end is 5. max_gap is 0. So the answer is max(5,5,0) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then initial is 0, end is 0. max_gap is 10. So max(0, 0, 5) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 5]. Then initial is 0, end is 5. max_gap is 5. So the max between 0,5, 2.5 → 5. So answer is 5. Which is correct, since the end is at 5, and the lantern at 5 covers up to 5 + d. So to cover the end of the street (10), d must be 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this logic seems correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, what about when the lanterns are not sorted. For example, if the input is [5, 0], then after sorting, it becomes [0,5], and the code works.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut note that the initial and end are integers, but when we compute the max, it's possible that the maximum is a float. So in Python, when we do max( ... ), it will handle it.\n\nBut in code, initial is a[0], which is an integer. end is l - a[-1], which is also integer. max_gap is an integer. So when we compute max_gap / 2.0, it's a float.\n\nBut in Python, the max between integers and floats is handled properly.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n\n    initial = a[0]\n\n    end = l - a[-1]\n\n    max_gap = 0\n\n    for i in range(n-1):\n\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n        if gap > max_gap:\n\n            max_gap = gap\n\n    d = max( initial, end, max_gap / 2.0 )\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nBut wait, what if the initial is 0? For example, the first lantern is at 0. Then initial is 0, which is correct. So the code is okay.\n\nBut what if the initial is 0 and the end is 0, and the max_gap is 0? Like n=1, l=0? But according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. So that's not possible.\n\nBut in code, when n=1, the max_gap is 0, since there are no consecutive elements. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for n=1, the for loop runs for range(n-1) → 0 times. So max_gap remains 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ninitial is 0, end is 15-15=0. max_gap is 5 (between 9 and 14). So d is max(0, 0, 5/2) → 2.5 → correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]. initial is 2, end is 5-5=0. max_gap is 3 → 3/2=1.5. So max(2, 0, 1.5) is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. initial is 5, end is 5. max_gap is 0. So d is max(5,5,0) → 5. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. initial is 0, end is 0. max_gap is 10. d is 10/2=5. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. initial is 0, end is 0. max_gap is 5. So d is 5/2=2.5. Which is correct. Because between 0 and 5, the max gap is 5. The middle is 2.5. So d needs to be 2.5.\n\nBut if the lanterns are at 0, 3, 10. Then initial is 0, end is 0. max_gap is 7 (between 3 and 10). So d is 7/2 = 3.5. Which would cover the entire street. Because the lantern at 3 covers up to 3 + 3.5 = 6.5, and the lantern at 10 covers down to 10 - 3.5 = 6.5. So the gap between 3 and 10 is 7, so the middle is 6.5. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about when the lanterns are at the same position? For example, n=3, l=10, a=[0,0,0]. Then sorted is [0,0,0]. initial is 0, end is 10-0=10. max_gap is 0. So d is max(0, 10, 0) → 10. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, l=10, a=[0,0]. initial is 0, end is 10. max_gap is 0. So d is max(0,10,0) → 10. Correct.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 2, 10]. Then initial is 0, end is 0. The gaps are 2 and 8. So max_gap is 8. So d is 8/2=4. Which covers the street. The lanterns at 0 and 2 cover up to 4 (from 0 +4) and 2+4=6. The gap between 2 and 10 is 8. The middle is at 6. So the lantern at 2 covers up to 6, and the lantern at 10 covers down to 6. So the entire street is covered. So yes, d=4 is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code formatting: the output must be printed with 10 decimal digits. So the format string is needed.\n\nBut in Python, when you use .10f, it will format the number with 10 decimal digits. However, for numbers that are integers, like 2.0, it will print 2.0000000000.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the variables initial and end are integers, but when we compute max, the max_gap / 2.0 is a float. So the max() function returns a float. So when we print, it's correct.\n\nBut in Python, when you have integers and floats, the max is correctly handled.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ninitial = 0, end = 0, max_gap = 5 → 5/2 = 2.5 → output 2.5000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]. initial is 2, end is 0. max_gap is 3 → 3/2=1.5. max(2, 0, 1.5) → 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut need to make sure that the code reads the input correctly. Also, note that in some cases, the input may have multiple lines, but for the problem, the first line is n and l, the second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n\n    initial = a[0]\n\n    end = l - a[-1]\n\n    max_gap = 0\n\n    for i in range(n-1):\n\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n        if gap > max_gap:\n\n            max_gap = gap\n\n    d = max( initial, end, max_gap / 2.0 )\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you do division with /, it returns a float. So even if max_gap is even, it's converted to a float.\n\nBut in the code, initial and end are integers. So when comparing, for example, if initial is 2, end is 0, and max_gap is 3, then max(2, 0, 1.5) is 2.0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, in the case where the max_gap is zero (n=1), then the code will compute max_gap / 2.0 as zero. So if initial is 5, end is 5, then the maximum is 5.0.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input can be multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and l. The second line contains the list of a_i. However, in the sample input, there are two examples given. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. So the code should process one test case per run.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, the sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nBut this is probably a way to represent two test cases. However, the actual code is supposed to read from standard input. So in the programming competition problem, each run is for a single test case. So the code is written to read a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct as written.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to ensure that the entire street is illuminated. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and considering the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Initial and End Distances**: Compute the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Determine Maximum Gap Between Consecutive Lanterns**: Iterate through the sorted list of lantern positions to find the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns. The worst-case scenario for coverage within this gap is at the midpoint, which requires a radius equal to half the gap.\n4. **Compute Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius required is the maximum value among the initial distance, end distance, and half of the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    initial = a[0]\n    end = l - a[-1]\n    max_gap = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i + 1] - a[i]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    \n    d = max(initial, end, max_gap / 2.0)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in easily determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Initial and End Distances**: These are calculated to ensure the start and end of the street are covered by the lanterns' illumination radius.\n- **Maximum Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted list, we find the largest gap between consecutive lanterns. The radius required to cover this gap is half of this maximum gap.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is determined as the maximum of the initial distance, end distance, and half the maximum gap, ensuring full coverage of the street.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including when there is only one lantern or when lanterns are positioned at the ends of the street.
