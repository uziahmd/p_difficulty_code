Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum radius d that the lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment around it with radius d. We need to find the minimal d such that all points on the street are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. First, the key idea is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Because the largest gap between two adjacent lanterns would determine the required radius. But wait, because each lantern's coverage is a circle of radius d. So for two adjacent lanterns, the maximum distance between them would be covered by the two lanterns. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose two lanterns are at positions a and b, with a < b. The distance between them is (b - a). The middle point between them is at (a + b)/2. The maximum distance from either lantern to this middle point is (b - a)/2. So if we have this as the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns, then the required d would be half of that gap. Because each lantern covers up to d distance. So for the two lanterns, the middle point would be the farthest point from both, so the required d for this pair is (b - a)/2.\n\nBut wait, what about the ends of the street? For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly for the end of the street. So the initial step is to sort all the lantern positions, and then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns, as well as the first lantern and 0, and the last lantern and l.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance between 0 and the first lantern. The required d here is (a[0] - 0) because the first lantern's coverage needs to reach 0. Wait, no. If the first lantern is at position a[0], then the leftmost part of the street is 0. The distance from the lantern to 0 is a[0] - 0. So the radius must be at least that, otherwise the 0 point isn't covered. But if the lantern is at 0, then that distance is zero. So for the first part, the maximum distance between 0 and the first lantern is (a[0] - 0). Similarly, for the end, the distance between the last lantern and l is (l - a[-1]).\n\nBut then, for the gaps between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]). Then, the required d for that gap is (gap / 2), since the middle point is the farthest from both lanterns.\n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's distance from 0,\n- the last lantern's distance from l,\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nFor example, in the second sample input: 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. The first lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 is 2. The last lantern is at 5, which is the end of the street. So the distance is 0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. But the answer is 2.0. Oh, wait, that's conflicting with my previous reasoning. Wait, in that example, the output is 2.0. Let me check.\n\nIn the second sample input, the lanterns are at 2 and 5. The street is of length 5. So the first lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 2. The last lantern is at 5, which is the end. So the distance from the last lantern to l is 0. The gap between the two lanterns is 5-2 =3. The middle point is at (2+5)/2= 3.5. The distance from the first lantern is 1.5, from the second lantern is 1.5. So the required d would be max(2, 0, 3/2) = 2. Which matches the sample output. So that's correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct. So the maximum of the first distance, last distance, and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance (a[0] - 0), and the last distance (l - a[-1]).\n- Then compute the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. For each i from 0 to n-2, compute a[i+1] - a[i], and take the maximum of these.\n- The required d is the maximum between the initial distance, last distance, and (max_gap / 2).\n\nSo that's the plan. Now, handling edge cases.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase 1: Only one lantern. For example, n=1, l= something. Then, the initial distance is a[0] - 0, the last distance is l - a[0]. The maximum of those two. Because the lantern's coverage must cover from 0 to l. So for example, if the lantern is at position 0, then the last distance is l -0 = l, which would be the required d. Because the lantern can cover up to d distance. So d must be l. Similarly, if the lantern is at l, then the initial distance is l, and the required d is l.\n\nAnother case: when the lanterns are already covering the entire street. For example, n=2, l=5, lanterns at 0 and 5. Then the initial distance is 0, last is 0. The gap between them is 5, so divided by 2 is 2.5. So d is 2.5. Which makes sense, because the middle is 2.5 away from each lantern.\n\nAnother example: lanterns at 0 and 5. The street is length 5. So the required d is 2.5. Which would cover the entire street.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when the lanterns are not sorted. So we need to sort them first.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial and last distances.\n\nCompute max_gap between consecutive elements.\n\nThen compute the maximum between initial, last, and max_gap / 2.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street? For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, and the street is length 5. Then the initial distance is 3. So the d has to be at least 3. Because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the initial distance is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly for the last lantern.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead input: first line is n and l. Then the next line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut the input may be given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Wait, the input given in the example is:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich is n=7, l=15, and the lanterns are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. Then after sorting, the list is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then initial distance is 0 - 0 = 0. Last distance is 15 - 15 = 0. The max gap between consecutive lanterns is 14-9=5? Let's see:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: 3-0=3.\n\n3 to 5: 2.\n\n5 to 7: 2.\n\n7 to 9: 2.\n\n9 to 14: 5.\n\n14 to 15: 1.\n\nSo the max gap is 5. Divided by 2 is 2.5, which is the sample output.\n\nYes. So the code would compute that.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them.\n\nCompute initial = a[0] - 0.0 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial distance is a[0] - 0, but if the first lantern is at 0, then that's 0. So the initial distance is a[0] - 0.0? Well, no. Wait, the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0] - 0. But if the lantern is at 0, then that's 0. So the initial distance is a[0] - 0. So the initial distance is a[0], but if the lantern is at 0, then that's 0. So that's correct.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 0. So the required d for that part is 0. But if the lantern is at 0, then the light covers from 0 -d to 0 +d. But since d is the radius, the lantern's coverage starts at 0 -d. But since the street starts at 0, the coverage from the lantern would include 0. So the initial distance is a[0] - 0. So that's the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So the required d must be at least that. Because if the lantern is at a[0], then the left end of the street (0) is a[0] units away. So the radius must be at least that. But if the lantern is at 0, then that distance is zero, so the radius can be zero. But that's only possible if the entire street is covered by other lanterns. But in that case, the code would take the max between that and other values.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nOnce the list is sorted, compute:\n\nmax_initial = a[0] - 0.0 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial distance is a[0] - 0. But if a[0] is 0, then that's 0. So the initial distance is a[0] - 0. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the last distance is l - a[-1].\n\nThen, the max_gap is the maximum of (a[i+1] - a[i]) for all i from 0 to n-2.\n\nThen, the required d is the maximum of (max_initial, max_last, max_gap / 2).\n\nSo in code:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_initial = sorted_a[0]\n\nmax_last = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i+1] - sorted_a[i]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nthen d = max( max_initial, max_last, max_gap / 2 )\n\nWait, but wait. For example, if the first lantern is at 0, then max_initial is 0. So the max_initial is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. But if the first lantern is at 0, then the distance is zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut in code, the max_initial is sorted_a[0] - 0.0? Or is it sorted_a[0] - 0?\n\nWait, sorted_a[0] is the position of the first lantern. The distance from 0 to that lantern is sorted_a[0] - 0. So yes.\n\nBut in code, in Python, if the first lantern is at 0, then sorted_a[0] is 0, so max_initial is 0.\n\nBut what about if the lantern is at 3, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 3, so the radius must be at least 3 to cover 0. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code would compute that.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nCase when n=1. For example, n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_initial is 5, max_last is 10 -5=5. The max_gap is 0 (since there are no consecutive lanterns). So the d is max(5,5, 0/2) =5. Which is correct. Because the lantern is at 5, radius 5 would cover from 0 to 10. So yes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=0. Wait, but according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the lanterns are at 0 and l. So sorted_a is [0, l]. Then the max_initial is 0, max_last is 0. The max_gap is l -0 = l. So the d is max(0, 0, l/2) = l/2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the input, the second line is the list of a_i. For example, in the first sample input, the second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0' which is split into integers. So in code:\n\nRead the first line as n and l. Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nThen sort the list.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_initial = a[0]\n\nmax_last = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nd = max( max_initial, max_last, max_gap / 2 )\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but wait. What if the list is empty? No, n is at least 1. So for n=1, the loop for i in range(n-1) is range(0), so no iterations. So max_gap remains 0. So the code is okay.\n\nTesting the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, a is [2,5]. max_initial is 2. max_last is 5-5=0. max_gap is 5-2=3. So d is max(2, 0, 3/2) = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSample output is 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when the lanterns are at 0 and 5, l=5. Then the code gives max_initial 0, max_last 0, max_gap 5. So d is 5/2 = 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_initial is 5, max_last is 5, max_gap is 0. So d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a = [0, 5, 10]. Then max_initial is 0, max_last is 0. max_gap is 5 (between 0 and 5, and between 5 and 10). So d is max(0, 0, 5/2) = 2.5. Which is correct. Because each lantern covers up to 2.5 radius. The middle between 0 and 5 is 2.5, which is covered by the first lantern. Similarly for others.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0, 3, 6, 9, l=10. Then max_initial is 0, max_last is 10-9=1. The gaps are 3,3,3,1. So max_gap is 3. So d is max(0, 1, 3/2) = 1.5. So the required d is 1.5. Which would cover the entire street.\n\nYes. Because the last lantern is at 9, so the distance from 9 to 10 is 1. So d must be at least 1. But the max_gap is 3, which requires 1.5. So the maximum is 1.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer must be printed with 10 decimal digits, and the absolute or relative error must not exceed 1e-9. So in Python, using the format string with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut when you print, for example, 2.5, it's printed as 2.5000000000. So the code uses the format string.\n\nBut in Python, when you do print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d)), it will format the number with 10 decimal digits. However, for numbers that are integers, like 2.0, it would show as 2.0000000000.\n\nBut what about floating point precision? For example, when the maximum_gap is even, then dividing by 2 would give an exact decimal. But for odd numbers, like 3, it would be 1.5, which is exactly representable. But for other cases, perhaps there's some floating point imprecision. However, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using Python's floating point arithmetic (which is double-precision) should be sufficient.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_initial is 0, max_last is 15 -15 =0.\n\nmax_gap is 14-9=5. So the max_gap is 5. So d is max(0, 0, 5/2) = 2.5. Which is correct. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother edge case: when n=1, l=0. But according to the problem statement, l is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the lanterns are at 0 and 0. For example, n=2, l=5, a=[0,0]. Then sorted a is [0,0]. The max_initial is 0, max_last is 5-0=5. The max_gap is 0. So d is max(0,5, 0) =5. Which is correct. Because the first lantern is at 0, the second is also at 0. So the coverage must reach from 0 to 5. So the radius must be 5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when the lanterns are at 0, 0, 0. Then same as above.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, l=5. Then the max_initial is 0, max_last is 0. The max_gap is 1. So d is 0.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given their positions. The key idea is to consider the maximum gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Initial and Final Distances**: Compute the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Determine Maximum Gap Between Consecutive Lanterns**: Iterate through the sorted list to find the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Compute Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius required is the maximum value among the initial distance, the final distance, and half of the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. This ensures that all parts of the street are illuminated.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_initial = a[0]\n    max_last = l - a[-1]\n    max_gap = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i + 1] - a[i]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    \n    d = max(max_initial, max_last, max_gap / 2)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Initial and Final Distances**: These distances are crucial because the lanterns must cover the very start and end of the street, which might not be covered by the nearest lantern if it's not at the edge.\n- **Maximum Gap Calculation**: The largest gap between two consecutive lanterns determines the radius needed to cover the middle point of this gap, which is the farthest point from both lanterns.\n- **Result Calculation**: The required radius is the maximum of the initial distance, the final distance, and half of the maximum gap. This ensures that all parts of the street are illuminated with the minimum possible radius.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the solution meets the precision requirements using double-precision floating-point arithmetic.",
