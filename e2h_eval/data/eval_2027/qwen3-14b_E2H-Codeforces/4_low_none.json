The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let me understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. The sequences are strings of R, S, P. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus uses B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nThe problem is to compute for each round, who wins, and count the losses for each player.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round step by step. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key here is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, and calculate how many times each possible pair of moves occurs in the entire n rounds.\n\nLet me think: the sequences A and B are cyclic. So the combined sequence of moves for both players will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so their moves will repeat.\n\nSo the idea is to find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length. Then, in each period of period_length rounds, there are some number of wins for each player. Then, we can calculate how many full periods there are in n rounds, multiply the counts by that number, and then add the counts from the remaining rounds (n mod period_length).\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it L.\n2. For each of the L rounds, determine the moves of A and B, check who wins, and count the number of times Nikephoros loses (which adds to his red spots) and Polycarpus loses (adds to his).\n3. Multiply these counts by the number of full periods (total_periods = n // L).\n4. Then, process the remaining (n % L) rounds, adding the counts again.\n5. Sum all these up.\n\nBut wait, what if L is very large? For example, if m and k are both 1000, then LCM(1000, 1000) is 1000. But if m and k are coprime, like 1000 and 999, then LCM is 999000. Which is 1e6, which is manageable. Since m and k are up to 1000, the maximum LCM would be 1000 * 1000 = 1e6. So even for n up to 2e9, the LCM is manageable. Because 1e6 is acceptable to loop through.\n\nSo the plan is feasible.\n\nSo first, compute the LCM of m and k. How to compute LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need to compute the GCD. Python's math module has gcd, but note that in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists but returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here.\n\nBut since m and k can be up to 1000, this is easy.\n\nOnce I have the LCM, let's proceed.\n\nNow, for each round in 0 to L-1, I need to find what move A and B make. Then determine the outcome.\n\nSo for each i in 0..L-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine who wins.\n\nSo for each such pair, we can check:\n\nif a_move == b_move: no one gets a spot.\n\nElse:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is increased by 1? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a spot. So Nikephoros's red spots count is the number of times he lost. Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo for each round, if Nikephoros loses, add 1 to his count. If Polycarpus loses, add 1 to his count.\n\nSo how to check who wins?\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use a more efficient approach based on identifying repeating patterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. The combined sequence of moves will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This gives the period after which both sequences repeat their moves simultaneously.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period (LCM length), determine the moves of both players and count the number of times each player loses.\n4. **Scale Up**: Calculate how many full periods fit into the total number of rounds and multiply the counts from one period by this number. Then, handle any remaining rounds after the full periods.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    b_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    lcm = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full period\n    nikephoros_loss = 0\n    polycarpus_loss = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        \n        # Determine who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n           (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n           (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            polycarpus_loss += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nikephoros_loss += 1\n    \n    total_periods = n // lcm\n    remaining_rounds = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nike = total_periods * nikephoros_loss\n    total_poly = total_periods * polycarpus_loss\n    \n    # Now process the remaining_rounds\n    for i in range(remaining_rounds):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        \n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n           (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n           (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            total_nike += 1\n    \n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the period after which the move sequences repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within the LCM period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcomes are recorded.\n4. **Scaling Results**: The number of full periods and remaining rounds are calculated. The results from one period are scaled up by the number of full periods, and the remaining rounds are processed individually to get the final counts of losses for each player.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
