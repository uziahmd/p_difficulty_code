The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly is impossible. We need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. Similarly for Polycarpus with B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find out what move each player makes. Then determine who wins, and count the losses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't iterate through all rounds. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, compute the number of times that cycle occurs, and multiply the counts accordingly.\n\nLet me think. The sequences A and B have lengths m and k. So for each round, the move for Nikephoros is A[i % m], and for Polycarpus it's B[i % k]. So for each round, the moves depend on their respective positions in their sequences.\n\nThe key is to find for all possible pairs of (a, b) where a is from A and b is from B, how many times they occur in the rounds, and then calculate the number of wins for each player.\n\nBut since the sequences are cyclic, the total number of possible (a, b) pairs is m * k. So the combined sequence of moves has a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = T. So in every T rounds, the pattern of moves between the two players repeats.\n\nSo, the idea is to compute the number of times each (a, b) pair occurs in one full cycle of T rounds, then multiply by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the counts for the remaining rounds.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute T = LCM(m, k). Since m and k can be up to 1000, T can be up to 1e6 (since LCM(1000, 1000) is 1000). Wait, no. For m=1000 and k=1000, LCM is 1000 if they are same. But if they are co-prime, like 1000 and 999, then LCM is 999000. But even so, m and k are up to 1000, so their product is up to 1e6. So T is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo for each possible pair (i, j), where i is in A and j is in B, we can compute how many times this pair occurs in a full T rounds. Then, for each such pair, determine if Nikephoros wins, loses, or draw. Then multiply the count by the number of full cycles, and then process the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the number of occurrences of each (a, b) pair in T rounds?\n\nAlternatively, for each round in the first T rounds, we can compute the moves of A and B, and then count how many times each (a, b) pair occurs. Then, since each T rounds repeat, we can calculate how many full cycles there are in n rounds, and then multiply the counts by the number of full cycles. Then, for the remaining rounds (n mod T), we can simulate them once.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Calculate T = LCM(m, k)\n- For each of the T rounds, determine the moves of A and B, and for each pair, count how many times each outcome (Nikephoros win, lose, draw) occurs in one full cycle.\n- Then, the total number of full cycles is q = n // T\n- The remaining rounds are r = n % T\n- So, the total number of wins for each player is (number of wins in one cycle) * q + (number of wins in the first r rounds of the cycle)\n\nBut how to compute the number of wins in one cycle?\n\nBut for each round in the T rounds, we can compute the outcome and accumulate the counts.\n\nSo, for example, for each of the T rounds, we can get the moves of A and B, check who wins, and increment the counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nBut how to find the moves for each round in the T rounds?\n\nFor the i-th round (starting from 0?), the move of A is A[i % m], and move of B is B[i % k]. So for each i from 0 to T-1, we can compute those.\n\nBut T can be",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over `n` rounds, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible due to the potential size of `n` (up to 2 billion). Instead, we leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to reduce computation.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Cyclic Nature**: Both players use sequences that repeat cyclically. The combined pattern of moves repeats every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences used by Nikephoros and Polycarpus respectively.\n   \n2. **Periodic Simulation**: We simulate one full cycle of length `T = LCM(m, k)`, count how many times each player wins in that cycle, and then extrapolate these counts for the total number of cycles in `n` rounds.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - For each round in the cycle, we determine the move of each player.\n   - Based on their moves, we determine the outcome of the round.\n   - We accumulate the number of losses for each player in one full cycle.\n   - We then multiply these counts by the number of full cycles in `n` rounds and add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n\n1. **Compute LCM**: Calculate the least common multiple of the lengths of the two sequences.\n2. **Simulate One Cycle**: For each round in the LCM cycle, determine the moves of both players and calculate the result.\n3. **Count Outcomes**: Maintain counts of how many times each player loses during one full cycle.\n4. **Extrapolate Results**: Multiply the counts by the number of full cycles and simulate the remaining rounds separately.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    A = data[1]\n    B = data[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Count number of wins in one full cycle\n    nik_win = 0\n    pol_win = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            nik_win += 1\n        else:\n            pol_win += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    # Total wins from full cycles\n    total_nik = nik_win * full_cycles\n    total_pol = pol_win * full_cycles\n    \n    # Add the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_nik += 1\n        else:\n            total_pol += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_pol)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity Analysis:\n\n- **LCM Calculation**: Constant time.\n- **Cycle Simulation**: O(LCM(m, k)) which is at most O(1e6), since m and k are ≤ 1000.\n- **Remainder Rounds**: O(n % T), which is at most O(1e6).\n\nThis approach ensures the solution runs efficiently even for large values of `n`.",
