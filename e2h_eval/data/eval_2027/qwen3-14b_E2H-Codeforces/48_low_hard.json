He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. Oh right, and there's some specifics about Roman numerals here. Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the second line is the number c in base a. So the plan is: convert c from base a to decimal (base 10), then convert that decimal number to base b, which could be another base or Roman numerals.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Convert the input string c (in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Convert that decimal integer to the target base, which is either a regular base (like 2, 16, etc.) or Roman numerals.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFor step 1: converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have letters? Wait, the problem says that when converting to base b, if it's not Roman, then the input c is a number in base a. Wait, but the input for c may contain letters if a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A, B (since 10 and 11). But the problem says that in the input, c is given as a non-negative integer in base a. So the input for c may have letters if a is larger than 10. So, for example, if a is 12, then the input c could have digits like 'A' or 'B'.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a string. So I need to process that string as a base-a number. So the first thing is to parse that string into a decimal value.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, how to convert the string to decimal? Well, for each character in the string, we need to get its value. For digits, it's straightforward. For letters, like A, B, etc., they represent values 10, 11, etc. So, for example, the function would process each character, convert it to its numerical value, then compute the total.\n\nBut wait, the input c may have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, '001' in base 10 is 1. So during conversion, leading zeros don't affect the value.\n\nNow, for step 2: converting the decimal number to base b. But if b is 'R', then we need to convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string, using digits 0-9 and letters A, B, etc. for bases larger than 10.\n\nSo, first, handling the case when b is R. Let's think about that. The problem says that when converting to Roman, the number is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 3000 (in decimal) and not zero. So we can safely assume that when the target is Roman, the decimal number is between 1 and 3000 inclusive.\n\nSo, the steps for converting to Roman numerals: I need to create a function that takes a decimal number and returns its Roman numeral representation.\n\nFor the Roman conversion, the standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For example, 1000 is M, 900 is CM, 500 is D, 400 is CD, etc. Then, for each value, subtract as many as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nSo for example, the code would have something like:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, while the number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nThat's the standard way. So implementing that function should be straightforward.\n\nNow, the other case is when the target base is not R. So, converting from decimal to base b. For example, converting 10 to base 2 gives 1010.\n\nBut how to handle bases larger than 10? For example, base 16 would use digits 0-9 and A",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, where the target base could be a standard numerical base or Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to decimal (base 10), and then converting it to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: Convert the given number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer. This involves processing each digit of the input number, considering both numeric and alphabetic characters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base is a numerical base or Roman numerals:\n   - For numerical bases, convert the decimal number to the target base using standard base conversion techniques. This includes handling bases greater than 10 by using letters for digits beyond 9.\n   - For Roman numerals, use a predefined list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation of the decimal number.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef to_roman(num):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while num >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            num -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.strip().split('\\n')\n        for part in parts:\n            if not part:\n                continue\n            a_b_part, c_part = part.split('\\n')\n            a_str, b_str = a_b_part.split()\n            a = int(a_str)\n            c = c_part\n            if b_str == 'R':\n                decimal = to_decimal(c, a)\n                roman = to_roman(decimal)\n                print(roman)\n            else:\n                b = int(b_str)\n                decimal = to_decimal(c, a)\n                converted = from_decimal(decimal, b)\n                print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **to_decimal Function**: Converts a string representation of a number in base `a` to a decimal integer. It handles both numeric and alphabetic characters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **from_decimal Function**: Converts a decimal integer to a string representation in the specified base `b`. It uses letters for digits greater than 9 when the base exceeds 10.\n3. **to_roman Function**: Converts a decimal integer to its Roman numeral representation using a list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring correct application of subtractive notation.\n4. **main Function**: Reads input lines, processes each line to convert the number from the given base to the target base (either a numerical base or Roman numerals), and prints the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including leading zeros and conversions to Roman numerals.",
