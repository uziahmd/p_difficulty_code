Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair. \n\nSo, first, I need to figure out how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the compatibility rules. Two specific colors are compatible if they are the same. A question mark can pair with any color, including another question mark. \n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Maybe we can first pair the specific colors that match directly. Then handle the question marks. But how?\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. Pair as many specific color matches as possible. For example, for each color c (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have c and how many right boots have c. The number of pairs here is the minimum of those counts. But we need to track which ones are used so that they aren't reused.\n\nBut wait, since the question marks can be used as wildcards, maybe we need to handle them after pairing the specific colors. Or perhaps there's a way to use the question marks to cover the leftovers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should first pair the left and right boots that have specific colors matching. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those with '?', or those whose specific colors couldn't be matched), pair them using the question marks.\n\nBut how to manage this efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: For each color (excluding '?'), we can pair left and right boots of that color. Then, the remaining question marks can be paired between left and right, but also possibly between left and right's question marks. Wait, but the question marks can be used in any way. However, the problem is that after pairing the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots may have some question marks, which can be paired with each other or with the leftover specific colors (but those would have been already processed? No, because if a specific color was not matched, then maybe the question marks can be used to pair with them.)\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose there's a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with color 'b'. They can't be paired. But if there's a left boot with 'a' and a right boot with '?', then they can be paired. Similarly, a left '?' can pair with a right 'a'.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\n- First, pair all specific colors (non '?') where left and right have the same color. For example, for each color c, pair left c's with right c's. This would be the maximum possible for those. But how to do that without overlapping?\n\nBut the problem is that if we have multiple left and right boots with the same color, how to pair them. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, we can pair 2 of them. Then, the remaining left 'a's can be paired with right '?'s or other left '?'s.\n\nSo, the plan could be:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots with specific colors that match. For each color c, take min(count_l[c], count_r[c]) pairs. But how to track which indices are used?\n\nBut maybe instead of counting, we can process the positions. For example, for each color c (not '?'), iterate through left and right boots and pair them as we go. However, for large n (up to 150,000), this needs to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy approach. For each color c (not '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, collect the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired) and process the question marks.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAnother approach is to use a dictionary to track the available left and right boots for each color. For example, for specific colors, we can pair left and right boots. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those with '?', or those with specific colors that couldn't be matched), we can pair them with '?'s.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to first process the specific color pairs, then process the '?' pairs.\n\nBut how to handle the '?'s. Let's think:\n\nAfter pairing all specific color matches, we have some left boots that are either '?' or have specific colors that couldn't be matched. Similarly for the right boots. Now, the '?' can be used to pair with any of these.\n\nSo, for example, the remaining left boots with specific colors can be paired with right '?'s, and vice versa. Also, the left '?'s can be paired with right '?'s.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: after pairing the specific color matches, how to pair the remaining left and right boots (",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be part of at most one pair, and compatibility is determined by specific colors matching exactly or the use of a wildcard (`?`) which can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: We first pair left and right boots that have the same specific color (excluding `?`). This ensures that we use up all possible direct matches efficiently.\n2. **Track Used Boots**: We maintain sets to track which indices of left and right boots have already been paired to avoid reuse.\n3. **Handle Wildcards**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots that are either wildcards or could not be paired due to lack of matching specific colors. We pair these using wildcards from both left and right boots, ensuring maximum utilization of wildcards.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # For each color, keep track of positions\n    left_pos = defaultdict(list)\n    right_pos = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_pos[l[i]].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            right_pos[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    # Pair specific colors first\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    pairs = []\n\n    for c in left_pos:\n        if c in right_pos:\n            left_list = left_pos[c]\n            right_list = right_pos[c]\n            min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(min_len):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                if left_idx not in used_left and right_idx not in used_right:\n                    pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                    used_left.add(left_idx)\n                    used_right.add(right_idx)\n\n    # Now handle the ?s\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n        if r[i] == '?':\n            right_q.append(i)\n\n    # Pair left ? with right ?\n    min_len = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        left_idx = left_q[i]\n        right_idx = right_q[i]\n        if left_idx not in used_left and right_idx not in used_right:\n            pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n            used_left.add(left_idx)\n            used_right.add(right_idx)\n\n    # Now pair remaining left ? with right non-?
