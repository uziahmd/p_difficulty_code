Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about pairing left and right boots with compatible colors. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') is compatible only with another 'a' or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'. So, the challenge is to match left and right boots optimally.\n\nThe key here is to maximize the number of pairs. How do we do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about possible steps:\n\n1. For each color, count how many left boots have that color (including '?') and similarly for the right boots. But maybe we need to process specific colors first, then handle the wildcards.\n\nWait, but since '?' can match anything, maybe we should first pair specific colors with their matches, and then use the remaining '?'s to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nBut there's a catch: if a left boot is a specific color, it can be matched with a right boot that's the same color or a '?'. Similarly for right boots. However, if we have multiple left boots of the same color, we need to pair them with right boots of that color or '?', but in a way that maximizes the total.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- First, process all specific colors (non-?) and try to pair them with the corresponding specific colors on the other side. For example, if there are 'a's on the left, pair them with 'a's on the right. Then, after that, the remaining 'a's on the left can be paired with '?' on the right, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can:\n\n- For each color c (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots with color c (left_count[c]) and the number of right boots with color c (right_count[c]). The number of pairs for color c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But wait, that's not exactly correct because those pairs would require that both are c. However, the '?'s can also be used for these.\n\nBut maybe the optimal strategy is:\n\n- For each color c (not '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right of that color. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (including '?'), pair them using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to handle the '?'s? Because they can be used as wildcards. For example, after pairing the specific colors, the remaining '?'s can be paired with any remaining boots (specific or '?').\n\nBut the problem is that the '?'s can be used in two ways: either as a left boot matching a right boot (specific or ?) or as a right boot matching a left boot.\n\nSo maybe the approach is:\n\n1. Pair all specific colors first. For each color c (not '?'), pair left c with right c. Let's say we take as many as possible. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, we pair 3 of them. Then, the left 'a's are all used up, and the right has 2 left.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which may include '?'), we need to pair them. Here, the '?' can be used to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother idea: Let's collect all the left boots that are not '?', and for each color, track how many are left. Similarly for the right boots. Then, for each color, pair as much as possible. Then, for the remaining left and right boots, which are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched with their counterparts, we can pair the '?'s with the remaining boots.\n\nWait, but perhaps the '?'s can be used to pair with any remaining boots. For example, if there are some left '?'s and some right 'a's, we can pair them. Also, if there are left '?'s and right '?'s, we can pair them. So, the total number of pairs from the '?'s would be the minimum between the number of left '?'s plus the number of right '?'s, and the sum of all remaining left and right boots (but that's not correct). Wait, no. Because after pairing the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots are those that couldn't be matched. For example, suppose after pairing the specific colors, we have:\n\nLeft boots: [ '?', '?', 'a' ]\n\nRight boots: [ 'b', '?', 'a' ]\n\nWait, but in this case, the 'a' on the left was already paired with the 'a' on the right. So the remaining left boots would be the '?', and the remaining right boots would be 'b' and '?'.\n\nBut maybe I need to think of the steps again.\n\nLet me",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots between left and right boots. Each boot can either be a specific color or an indefinite color represented by a question mark ('?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Specific Colors**: First, count the number of left and right boots for each specific color (excluding '?'). This helps in forming direct pairs between left and right boots of the same specific color.\n2. **Pair Specific Colors**: For each specific color, pair as many left boots with right boots of the same color as possible.\n3. **Handle Indefinite Colors ('?')**: After pairing specific colors, use the remaining '?'s from both left and right boots to form pairs with any remaining boots (specific or '?'). This includes pairing left '?' with right non-'?', right '?' with left non-'?', and pairing '?' with '?'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l_str = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r_str = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    l = list(l_str)\n    r = list(r_str)\n\n    left = []\n    right = []\n\n    # Separate specific colors and question marks\n    left_q = []\n    left_spec = defaultdict(list)\n    right_q = []\n    right_spec = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_spec[l[i]].append(i)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if r[i] == '?':\n            right_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            right_spec[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    # Pair specific colors\n    pairs = []\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n\n    # For each color in left_spec, try to pair with right_spec\n    for c in left_spec:\n        if c not in right_spec:\n            continue\n        left_list = left_spec[c]\n        right_list = right_spec[c]\n        cnt = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(cnt):\n            a = left_list[i]\n            b = right_list[i]\n            pairs.append((a + 1, b + 1))\n            used_left.add(a)\n            used_right.add(b)\n\n    # Now handle the remaining '?'\n    # Create lists of remaining indices\n    remaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if i not in used_left]\n    remaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if i not in used_right]\n\n    # Now pair remaining_left and remaining_right\n    # We can use the left_q and right_q, but need to check if they are still available\n    # Let's collect all remaining left and right indices, including those that were '?'\n\n    # For left, check which are not used and have '?'\n    left_available = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i not in used_left:\n            left_available.append(i)\n    # Similarly for right\n    right_available = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i not in used_right:\n            right_available.append(i)\n\n    # Now, we can pair the remaining left and right\n    # We can use the following approach: for each left_available, try to pair with right_available\n    # But since the order may affect the outcome, let's use a greedy approach\n    # We can pair left_available with right_available, using the first available\n    # However, since '?' can match anything, we can pair them in any way\n    # So we can use the following approach:\n\n    # For each left in left_available, find a right in right_available that is not used yet\n    # Since the order doesn't matter, we can just pair them in order\n    # But to avoid duplicates, we need to track used indices again\n\n    # Let's create a new list of available left and right indices\n    left_available = [i for i in range(n) if i not in used_left]\n    right_available = [i for i in range(n) if i not in used_right]\n\n    # Now, we can pair the left_available with right_available\n    # Using the same logic as before, but now any combination is allowed\n    # We can pair them in order, taking as many as possible\n\n    for i in range(min(len(left_available), len(right_available))):\n        a = left_available[i]\n        b = right_available[i]\n        pairs.append((a + 1, b + 1))\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into left and right boot color strings.\n2. **Separating Colors**: Left and right boots are separated into specific colors and question marks.\n3. **Pairing Specific Colors**: Direct pairs are formed between left and right boots of the same specific color.\n4. **Handling Question Marks**: Remaining boots (including those with '?') are paired greedily, ensuring each boot is used at most once.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs by first using specific color matches and then leveraging the flexibility of question marks to form additional pairs.",
