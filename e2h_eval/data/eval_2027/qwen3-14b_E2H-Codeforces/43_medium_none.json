He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all 'a's, and there's at least one 'a'.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's. So after this step, the string has 'a's followed by 'b's. Also, there's at least one 'b' here. So the string must have both 'a's and 'b's at this point.\n3. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of 'c's added must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before adding the 'c's. Also, it's possible that the count of 'c's equals both. But wait, the problem says that C appends the 'c's such that the count is equal to the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's in the string (before adding the 'c's). So when C adds the 'c's, the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's (which is the original count from A) or the count of 'b's (from B's addition). \n\nSo, the final string must have all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So any string that doesn't follow this order is automatically invalid. For example, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's not allowed.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is composed of a block of a's, followed by a block of b's, followed by a block of c's. If that's not the case, return NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then check the counts.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\nFirst, check the order of characters. For example, the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So, the string must not have any 'a's after the first occurrence of 'b', and no 'b's after the first occurrence of 'c'.\n\nSo, how to check that? Let's think. For the string S, we can check that the characters are in non-decreasing order according to their letters. Because 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So, for example, the string should be something like aaaabbbccc. So, each character should be >= the previous one. So, for each i from 1 to len(S)-1, S[i] should be >= S[i-1]. If this is not the case, then the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but what if there's a 'c' followed by a 'b'? That would be invalid. So checking that the string is in non-decreasing order would ensure that the order is correct.\n\nYes. So first step: check that the string is in non-decreasing order. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce that is done, then check the counts.\n\nNow, let's think about the counts. Let me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's in the string.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's in the string.\n\nBut according to the process, the count_c must be equal to either the original count_a (before adding 'c's) or the original count_b (before adding 'c's). However, the original count_a and count_b are the same as the count_a and count_b in the final string, because adding 'c's doesn't change the count of a's or b's. Because C only appends c's.\n\nSo, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original count of a's is the same as the count_a in the final string. Because B added b's, then C added c's. So the count_a in the final string is the same as the initial count from A. Similarly for count_b. So, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, there's another condition: when B added the b's, there was at least one a and one b. So, in the final string, count_a must be >=1 and count_b must be >=1. Because after B added the b's, there were at least one a and one b. Then C added the c's. So even if C added zero c's? Wait, no. Because the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c'. So the number of c's added is at least 1?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nC appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend... the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. \n\nWait, so the number of 'c's added is equal to the count of a's (before adding c's) or the count of b's (before adding c's). So, the count of c's added is equal to count_a_initial (which is count_a in the final string) or count_b_initial (which is count_b in the final string). \n\nBut since C appends some number of letters, that number must be at least 1. So, for example, if the count of a's is zero, then C can't append c's. But according to the problem statement, when B gave the string to C, there was at least one a and one b. So the count of a's and count of b's in the string before adding c's is at least 1. So the count of c's added must be equal to count_a (which is at least 1) or count_b (which is at least 1). Therefore, the count_c in the final string is equal to count_a or count_b. \n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is in non-decreasing order (so all a's first, then b's, then c's).\n\n2. The count of a's is at least 1.\n\n3. The count of b's is at least 1.\n\n4. The count of c's is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the count of c's in the final string is exactly the number of c's added by C. Because the original string before C added the c's had zero c's. So the count_c in the final string is exactly the number of c's added by C. Which must be equal to count_a (before adding c's) or count_b (before adding c's). Which is the same as count_a and count_b in the final string. Because adding c's doesn't affect the count of a's or b's.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\nCheck that the string is ordered correctly (all a's, then b's, then c's). Then check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, and count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, what about the example given?\n\nTake the first example input: aaabccc. So count_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c equals count_a (3), which is allowed. So output is YES.\n\nSecond example: bbacc. The string is 'bbacc' — but the order is not correct. Because after the first two 'b's, there's an 'a' which is before 'b' and 'c's. So the string is not in non-decreasing order. Hence, output is NO.\n\nThird example: aabc. The string is aabc — which is ordered. count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 1. count_c equals count_b (1). So it's allowed. So output is YES.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string S.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck that the string is in non-decreasing order. How? For each i from 1 to len(S)-1, check that S[i] >= S[i-1]. If any of them is not, return NO.\n\nThen, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, and count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these are true, return YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is all a's and c's? Like 'aacc'? Because in that case, the count_b is 0, which is invalid. Because after B added the b's, there must be at least one b. So in the final string, count_b must be at least 1. So in this case, the count_b is 0, so it's invalid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck the order. Then check count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead S.\n\nCheck order:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n   if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n       return NO\n\nThen count a, b, c.\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n\n   return NO\n\nif count_c != count_a and count_c != count_b:\n\n   return NO\n\nelse:\n\n   return YES\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is all a's and b's, but no c's? For example, 'aabbaa' — but the order is correct. However, C must have added some c's. Because according to the problem statement, C appends some number of c's. So the count_c must be at least 1. Because the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' — which implies that the number is at least 1.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'. He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string. B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\"\n\nSo, C must append some number of letters 'c' (so at least one). So the final string must have at least one 'c'.\n\nTherefore, in the code, count_c must be >=1. But according to the problem statement, the input string can have any number of letters, but according to the process, the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\nSo, in our code, after checking the order, we need to check:\n\ncount_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1, and count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nCheck order.\n\nThen:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in S.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's in S.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's in S.\n\nif count_a <1 or count_b <1 or count_c <1: return NO.\n\nif count_c != count_a and count_c != count_b: return NO.\n\nelse: YES.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nLet me test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → counts: a=3, b=1, c=3. So count_c is 3, which equals count_a. All conditions met. YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the order is 'b','b','a','c','c' → the third character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b' → invalid. So returns NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=1. count_c is 1, which equals count_b. All conditions met. YES.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abccc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=3. count_c is 3, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=1. count_c is 1, which equals a and b. So returns YES.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbcc' → count a=2, b=2, c=2. count_c equals a and b. So yes.\n\nWhat about 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So yes.\n\nWhat about 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → a=1, b=1, c=2. count_c is 2. Not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nAnother case: 'aacc' → order is a, a, c, c. So order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=0. So condition count_b >=1 fails. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. count_c is 1, which equals count_a. So yes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code.\n\nIn Python, read the input string. For example, input is read via input().strip().\n\nThen check the order. For that, loop through the string and check that each character is >= the previous.\n\nThen count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck the conditions.\n\nSo code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check order\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b <1 or count_c <1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'ab'? Let's see. The order is correct. count_a is 1, count_b is 1, count_c is 0. So the code checks count_c <1 → returns NO. Which is correct, because C must append some number of c's. So the string must have at least one c. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → count_c is 1. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all the cases.\n\nLet me check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts a=3, b=1, c=3. So yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order is invalid. So output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. So yes.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' → order is a, a, b, b, a, a → the third character is b, then next is b, then a. So the fifth character is a which is less than previous b. So order is invalid. So returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → order is correct, but count_c is zero. So returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 is not equal to 1 or 1. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → order is correct. count_b is zero → returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So yes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is all 'c's? For example, 'ccc' → order is correct. But count_a is 0, count_b is 0. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. The string must be composed of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's and then a block of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters. This ensures that all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Validation**: Ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Additionally, the count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is in non-decreasing order\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The loop iterates through the string to ensure each character is greater than or equal to the previous one. If any character is found out of order, the function immediately prints \"NO\".\n2. **Character Counting**: Using the `count` method, we determine the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters in the string.\n3. **Validation**: We check if there is at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If not, the answer is \"NO\". If the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are checked efficiently, adhering to the problem requirements and ensuring correctness.",
