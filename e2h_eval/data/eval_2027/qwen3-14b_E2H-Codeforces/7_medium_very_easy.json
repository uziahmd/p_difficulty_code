The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such graphs.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, each time we add new vertices by connecting them to existing ones. Let me think about how the construction works.\n\nThe initial step: one vertex. Then, we connect it to k new vertices (k>1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So for example, the first step creates a central node with k children. Then, each of those children (which are leaves) gets k new children. So after that, the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k*k. But wait, the problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake for k=4 would be 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 21? Or maybe not. Wait, the example given in the problem says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Let's check that.\n\nWait the example input includes n=13 and output is YES. Let's think: How can 13 be formed?\n\nLet me think of the structure. Let's say the snowflake is built with some steps. The construction process can be thought of as layers. The first layer is the root. The second layer is the k children. Then, each of those children adds k children. But perhaps the process can stop after any number of steps. Wait, the problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children to the root) is the first step, then the second step is adding k children to each leaf. So the minimal case is when you have two steps. Let me model the total number of nodes.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the snowflake is constructed with m levels. Let me think of the number of nodes as a function of m and k.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Level 0: 1 node (root)\n- Level 1: k nodes (connected to root)\n- Level 2: each node in level 1 has k children. So total k * k nodes.\n- Level 3: each node in level 2 has k children. So k^3 nodes.\nAnd so on.\n\nBut the construction process requires that after the initial step (level 1), the step of adding k children to leaves is done at least once. So the minimum number of levels is 2. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. For example, if k=2, then 1+2+4=7. If k=3, then 1+3+9=13. Oh, that's the example where n=13 is possible. So for that case, k=3 and m=2 levels (so the construction steps were done once after the initial step).\n\nSo the general idea is that the total number of nodes n can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >=1 (since the step must be done at least once). Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf is done once. So for the minimal case, the total is 1 + k + k^2. But what if there are more steps? Like, after adding the second level, we can do another step of adding k children to each leaf of the second level. Then the total would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that each time, every leaf (vertex with degree 1) is connected to k new vertices. So each step adds a new level. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of steps after the initial step. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, each subsequent step adds a level. So for example:\n\n- After the initial step (step 1), the number of nodes is 1 + k.\n\nBut then, the step of adding k children to each leaf (which is the initial step's leaves) must be done at least once. So that's step 2. So the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nThen, if we do another step (step 3), each leaf (those in level 2) get k children. So adding k^3 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nBut the problem says that the step should be done at least once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >=1. Wait, but the initial step is the first step. Then, the second step (adding to the leaves) is required once. So m is the number of steps after the initial step? Or maybe the number of levels?\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the total number of nodes is:\n\nn = 1 + k * (k^m - 1)/(k-1), where m is the number of steps after the initial step. Wait, let me think again. Let me model it as follows:\n\nThe first step (step 0) is the initial node. Then, step 1 adds k children to the root. So after step 1, total nodes is 1 +k. Then, step 2 adds k children to each of the k leaves. So adding k *k nodes. Total becomes 1 +k +k^2. Step 3 adds k children to each of the k^2 leaves, adding k^3 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i }, where m >=1. Because the step of adding k children to leaves is done at least once (so m >=1).\n\nSo the total n is 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1), where m >=1 and k>1.\n\nBut for the problem, we need to check if there exists a k>1 and an integer m >=1 such that n equals that sum.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be expressed in the form n = 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i for some integers k>1 and m >=1.\n\nAlternatively, since sum_{i=1}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, the sum from i=1 to m of k^i is equal to (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1). Let me check for m=1: sum is k. (k^{2} -k)/(k-1) = k(k-1)/(k-1) )=k. Correct. For m=2, sum is k +k² = k(k+1). The formula gives (k^3 -k)/(k-1) = [k(k² -1)]/(k-1) ) = k(k+1)(k-1)/(k-1) )=k(k+1). Correct. So yes.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is:\n\nn = 1 + (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1) \n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nn = [ (k^{m+1} -k) / (k-1) ] + 1 \n\nSimplify that:\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLet me write the expression:\n\nn = 1 + (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1) \n\nLet me combine terms:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ (k-1) + k^{m+1} -k ] / (k-1)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(k-1) + k^{m+1} -k = k^{m+1} -1 \n\nSo n = (k^{m+1} -1) / (k-1) \n\nWait, that's interesting. Because the sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But here, the original sum was from i=1 to m of k^i, which is (sum from 0 to m) -1. Which is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) -1. But according to our previous calculation, the total n is 1 + (sum from i=1 to m of k^i) = 1 + [ (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1) ] which equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). \n\nSo that's a key insight. Therefore, the total number of nodes is equal to the sum from i=0 to m of k^i. Because that's (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So n must be equal to this sum for some k>1 and m≥1. \n\nWait, but m in this case is the number of steps? Let me check with the example where n=13. For k=3 and m=2 (sum from 0 to 2 of 3^i is 1 +3 +9 =13. Which matches the example. So yes. So the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^{d} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and d≥2. Because d = m+1, and since m ≥1, d ≥2.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to checking if there exists integers k>1 and d≥2 such that n is equal to (k^d -1)/(k-1). \n\nSo the question becomes, given n, can we find such k and d?\n\nNow, the problem is to check for each n whether there exists k>1 and d≥2 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nSo how can we check this efficiently, especially given that n can be up to 1e18?\n\nFirst, note that (k^d -1)/(k-1) is the sum of a geometric series: 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nSo for example, for d=2, it's 1 +k. So for d=2, the equation becomes 1 +k =n →k =n-1. Since k>1, n-1 must be >1 →n>2. So for example, if n=3, then k=2, which is valid. So for d=2, possible if n-1>1 →n≥3. However, in the sample input, when n=3, the output is NO. Wait, why?\n\nWait looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample input includes n=3, output is NO. But according to this reasoning, for d=2, k=2, which gives 1+2=3. So why is the output NO?\n\nAh! Because the construction requires that the step of adding k children to the leaves is done at least once. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe snowflake is constructed as follows:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step (adding k children to each leaf) is done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do that once. Which would result in 1 +k +k^2 nodes. Which is the case for d=3 (sum from i=0 to 2 of k^i). Because the sum for d=3 is 1 +k +k^2. But earlier reasoning said that the sum for d is (k^d -1)/(k-1). So for d=3, that sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. So in the problem, the allowed values of d are ≥2? No, because in the example where d=2, the sum is 1 +k, which would correspond to the initial step (adding k children) and then not doing the step of adding k children to leaves. But according to the problem statement, that step must be done at least once. Hence, the minimal d is 3?\n\nWait, this is a critical point. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is that after the initial step, we perform that step once. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which is the sum for d=3 (since sum from 0 to 2 of k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1)). So in this case, d must be ≥3? Or is there a misunderstanding here?\n\nWait, let's re-examine the problem statement's construction steps:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the first step is adding k children to the root. Then, the second step is adding k children to each leaf. So that step is done once. So the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which is the sum for d=3 (since 1 +k +k^2 = (k^3 -1)/(k-1)).\n\nThus, the allowed d must be ≥2? Or ≥3?\n\nWait, the sum (k^d -1)/(k-1) for d=2 is 1 +k. Which would correspond to the initial step (adding k children) and then not doing the step of adding to leaves. But according to the problem statement, the step must be done at least once. Hence, that case (d=2) is not allowed. Therefore, the allowed d is ≥3?\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier example where n=13 is allowed. Let me check. For d=3 and k=3: (3^3 -1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 26/2=13. Which is correct. So the allowed d is ≥2? Or ≥3?\n\nWait, the problem says that the step (adding k children to leaves) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children to the root) is the first step. Then, the second step (adding to leaves) is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which is the sum for d=3. So for the allowed values of d, it's d ≥2? Or d ≥3?\n\nBecause for d=2, the sum is 1 +k. Which would be the case where after adding the initial k children, we do not perform the step of adding to leaves. But according to the problem statement, that step must be done at least once. Therefore, d must be ≥3? Because for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2, which implies that the step was done once. \n\nBut then, what about when d=2? How is that possible?\n\nThis suggests that the earlier conclusion that the sum is (k^d -1)/(k-1) for d≥2 is incorrect, and that in reality, the allowed values of d are ≥3. Because the problem requires that the step of adding to leaves is done at least once. \n\nSo the correct condition is that n must be expressible as (k^d -1)/(k-1) where k>1 and d ≥3. Because d=3 corresponds to the minimal case of adding the initial k children and then adding k children to each of the leaves once. \n\nBut wait, what if d=2? For example, suppose the problem allowed that. Then for n=3 (which is 1 +k for k=2), but according to the sample input, n=3 returns \"NO\". So that suggests that d must be ≥3. Therefore, the correct condition is that n must be expressible as (k^d -1)/(k-1) where k>1 and d ≥3. \n\nBut then, in that case, the sample input for n=6 (output is NO) would require checking. Let's see. For n=6, can we find k and d≥3?\n\nFor d=3: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1 = 6. So solving k^2 +k +1 =6 →k^2 +k -5=0. The discriminant is 1 +20=21. sqrt(21) is irrational. So no integer solution. \n\nFor d=2: (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. So 6 =k+1 →k=5. But d=2 is not allowed. So the answer is no. Hence, the sample input for n=6 outputs NO, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: n=13. For d=3, k^2 +k +1 =13 →k^2 +k -12=0. Discriminant 1+48=49. sqrt(49)=7. So k=(-1 ±7)/2. Positive solution is (6)/2=3. So k=3. Which is valid. Hence, output YES.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^d -1)/(k-1) where k>1 and d≥3.\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, for each test case n, we need to check whether there exists integers k>1 and d≥3 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nLet me think about possible ways to iterate through possible d and k.\n\nConstraints on d:\n\nFor a given d, the minimal value of (k^d -1)/(k-1) is when k=2. For example, for d=3, it's 1+2+4=7. For larger d, the minimal value increases. For example, for d=3, minimal is 7. For d=4, 1+2+4+8=15, etc.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible d is limited. For example, for k=2, the value (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1. So for 2^d -1 ≤1e18 →d ≤ log2(1e18+1) ≈60. So for any n, the maximum possible d is around 60. So for each n, we can iterate d from 3 up to 60 (or until the minimal value for k=2 exceeds n).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n, check all possible d from 3 up to log2(n)+1 (since for d=60, 2^60 is ~1e18, which is manageable). For each d, check if there exists a k>1 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nSo how to check for each d whether such a k exists?\n\nLet me denote f(k, d) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} =n.\n\nWe can think of this as solving for k in the equation f(k,d) =n.\n\nFor fixed d, this is a function of k. Since k>1 and d≥3, we can perform a binary search on k for each d.\n\nBut what is the possible range of k for a given d?\n\nFor a fixed d, the minimal value of f(k,d) is when k=2: f(2,d) = 2^d -1 (since (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1).\n\nThe maximum possible k is such that f(k,d) ≤n. Since f(k,d) increases with k, for each d, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given d?\n\nFor example, for d=3, f(k,3) =k^2 +k +1. We want this to be equal to n. So for a given n, k can be up to sqrt(n). Similarly, for general d, the maximum possible k is roughly n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nSo for each d, perform a binary search on k in [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound can be found as something like n^(1/(d-1)) +1.\n\nBut how to compute this upper bound?\n\nAlternatively, for each d, we can perform a binary search on k from 2 to some maximum possible value, say, n^(1/(d-1)) +1. Because for k ≥2, f(k,d) ≥ 1 +2 + 2^2 + ... +2^{d-1} = 2^d -1. So for n to be achievable, it must be ≥ 2^d -1. So for a given d, if n < 2^d -1, then no solution for that d.\n\nSo for each d starting from 3 up to max_d:\n\n- Compute the minimal possible value for k=2: min_val = 2^d -1. If n < min_val, skip this d.\n\nElse, perform a binary search on k in the range [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound could be something like n^(1/(d-1)) +1.\n\nBut how to compute upper_bound? For example, for f(k,d) =n, since each term in the sum is positive, we have k^{d-1} ≤n. So k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nThus, for binary search, the upper limit can be set to n^(1/(d-1)) +1.\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nIn Python, for a given d, we can compute the upper limit as something like int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2.\n\nOnce we have the binary search range, for each candidate k, compute f(k,d) and compare to n.\n\nBut how to compute f(k,d) efficiently? For example, for k=2 and d=60, it's 2^60 -1, which is 1e18+something. So for large d and k, this could be computationally intensive. However, since d is up to 60, and for each test case, we loop through d up to 60, and for each d, binary search on k (with log steps), this should be manageable.\n\nBut how to compute f(k,d) without overflow? Well, since n can be up to 1e18, and for k and d up to say 1e6 (but d is small), we can compute f(k,d) step by step and check if it exceeds n. For example, for a given k and d, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}. But if during the computation, s exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo the steps for each d are:\n\nCheck if n >= 2^d -1. If not, skip.\n\nElse, binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound].\n\nFor each candidate k during binary search, compute the sum s. If s ==n, return yes. If s <n, need higher k. Else, need lower k.\n\nBut how to compute s?\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute the sum as (k^d -1)/(k-1). However, for large k and d, this may cause overflow. But since n is up to 1e18, and we can compute this using integer arithmetic, but need to avoid overflows.\n\nBut in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. However, calculating k^d may be expensive for large exponents. But for d up to 60, even k=1e9, k^d would be 1e540, which is way larger than 1e18. So during the computation of s, we can compute the sum incrementally and break early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo here's an approach for computing s:\n\nInitialize s = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 to d-1:\n\n    term = k^i\n\n    s += term\n\n    if s >n: break\n\nAt the end, compare s to n.\n\nBut calculating k^i for large exponents may be time-consuming, but since d is small (up to 60), it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum using a loop, accumulating the terms and checking for overflow.\n\nLet me think of code for this.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return total\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nSo for each k and d, compute the sum. If during the loop, the total exceeds n, return early. Otherwise, return the total. Then compare to n.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo putting it all together, the algorithm for each n is:\n\nCheck if n is 1: then no (since the snowflake requires at least one step, which adds k>1 children. For n=1, the initial step hasn't been done. So output is NO. Also, for n=2, the minimal possible is 1 +k where k>1. For k=2, sum is 3. So n=2 is impossible. Hence, for n=1 or 2, output NO.\n\nElse, for each possible d from 3 up to max_d:\n\n   compute min_val = 2^d -1. If n < min_val, skip.\n\n   else, perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (like n^(1/(d-1)) + 2)\n\n   for each mid in binary search:\n\n       compute the sum s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n       if s ==n → return YES\n\n       elif s <n → search higher k\n\n       else → search lower k\n\nIf after checking all possible d, no solution found, return NO.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the maximum possible d to check?\n\nFor example, for d=60, 2^d is about 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum d is around 60.\n\nSo for each n, we can check d from 3 to 60.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nSample input:\n\nTest case n=1 → output NO.\n\nn=2 → NO.\n\nn=3 → check for d=3: min_val is 2^3-1=7. 3 <7 → no. So check d=3? No. What about d=2? But d must be ≥3. So no. Hence output NO.\n\nSample input n=6: check for d=3. min_val is 7, which is larger than 6. So no. Hence output NO.\n\nSample input n=13: check for d=3. min_val is 7. So binary search for k in 2 to ... upper bound. Let's compute upper bound for d=3. For d=3, the upper bound for k is n^(1/(d-1)) = 13^(1/2) ≈3.6. So upper bound is 4. So binary search between 2 and 4. Let's see:\n\nk=2: sum is 1+2+4=7 <13. Need higher k.\n\nk=3: sum is 1+3+9=13 → match. So return YES.\n\nHence output YES.\n\nAnother sample case: n=15. Output is YES. Let's see:\n\nPossible for d=3: check k=2 gives 7, k=3 gives 13, k=4 gives 1+4+16=21>15. So no. What about d=4?\n\nFor d=4, min_val is 2^4-1=15. So for d=4, k=2 gives sum 1+2+4+8=15. So yes. Hence output YES.\n\nAnother sample input: n=255. Output is YES. Let's see:\n\nFor example, d=3, k= 16? 1+16+256=273>255. Or k= 8: 1+8+64=73. Not enough. For d=8, k=2: 2^8-1=255. So yes. So for d=8, k=2. Hence YES.\n\nAnother sample input: 1000000000000000000 (1e18). Output is NO. Let's see why. For example, for d=3, k^2 +k +1 = 1e18. Let's approximate k^2 ~1e18 →k ~1e9. Let's check if k=1e9-1, etc. But perhaps no exact solution. Also, for other d's, perhaps there's no solution.\n\nSo the code needs to handle all these possibilities.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead t test cases. For each n:\n\nif n is 1 → NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   check for all d in 3 to max_d (say, 60):\n\n      compute min_val = 2^d -1. If n < min_val → skip.\n\n      else:\n\n         low = 2, high = something like n^(1/(d-1)) + 2.\n\n         perform binary search between low and high for k.\n\n         during binary search, compute the sum for k and d. if equals n, return YES.\n\n   after all d's checked, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute high? For example, for d=3, high can be n^(1/2) + 2. But in code, how to compute that?\n\nIn Python, we can use the exponentiation operator. However, since n can be up to 1e18, and for d up to 60, the exponent 1/(d-1) can be computed as a float. But taking the integer part and adding 2.\n\nBut for example, for d=3, high = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2.\n\nBut for very large n, even with d=3, this can be up to 1e9, which is manageable for binary search.\n\nBut for each d, the binary search is O(log(high)), which is acceptable for t=1e4 and d up to 60.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, the function compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return total\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, for large exponents, this could be slow? Well, since d is up to 60, and for each test case, this is called O(log(high)) times per d, it's manageable.\n\nNow, for each test case:\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n\n    if n == 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    max_d = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18, and for d=60, min_val is 2^60-1 which is about 1e18.\n\n    for d in range(3, max_d +1):\n\n        min_val = (2**d) -1\n\n        if n < min_val:\n\n            continue\n\n        # Now find k such that compute_sum(k, d, n) ==n.\n\n        # Find upper bound for k.\n\n        # upper_bound = int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2\n\n        # But for cases where n is 0, but n is >= min_val, which is >=7.\n\n        # So compute upper bound:\n\n        upper = int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = upper\n\n        # Binary search between low and high.\n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n            if s == n:\n\n                return True\n\n            elif s < n:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the upper bound is too low? For example, when the actual k is larger than upper. How to ensure that?\n\nFor example, suppose for some d, the actual k is larger than upper. How can that happen?\n\nThe upper bound is set to n^(1/(d-1)) +2. Because the sum for k is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} (since all terms are positive). So for this sum to be equal to n, we have k^{d-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}. So the upper bound is sufficient. Hence, the upper bound is correct.\n\nBut in code, for n ** (1/(d-1)), when d-1 is 1, i.e., d=2 (but in our code, d starts from 3). So for d=3, d-1=2. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, for example, when d=3 and n=13, the upper bound is 13^(1/2) = 3.605..., so int(3.605) is 3, adding 2 gives 5. So binary search between 2 and 5. Which includes k=3.\n\nBut for cases where the actual k is higher than the upper bound? Well, the upper bound is supposed to be sufficient. So perhaps adding 2 is not enough. Let me think: For example, if the actual k is exactly n^{1/(d-1)}, but due to floating point inaccuracies, the computed upper bound is less than that.\n\nFor example, n= (k^{d-1} ), then n^(1/(d-1)) is exactly k. But due to floating point precision, perhaps the calculated value is slightly less than k. Hence, adding 2 ensures that we cover that.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute upper as something like 2, and then keep increasing until compute_sum(upper, d, n) exceeds n. But that might be too slow. Alternatively, use a higher upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a binary search with high as n, but that would be O(log n) steps. For d up to 60, and t=1e4, this may be feasible.\n\nBut for large n (1e18), log2(n) is 60, so even with binary search up to 1e18, it's manageable.\n\nBut for example, for d=3 and n=1e18, upper bound is 1e9, which is manageable. So perhaps the initial approach is okay.\n\nBut perhaps in code, using the upper bound as n is better. Let's think: For each d, the binary search can be done between low=2 and high= n. Because for k≥2, the sum for d≥3 is at least 1 +2 + 2^2 =7, and for larger d, it's even larger. So for a given d, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} =n. Since each term is positive, k^{d-1} ≤n →k ≤n. So high can be set to n. But for n=1e18, that would make binary search up to 60 steps (log2(1e18) is about 60). So for each d, binary search is O(60) steps, and for each step, compute_sum is O(d) steps. So overall, for t=1e4, and d up to 60, it's O(1e4 * 60 * 60 * 60) operations. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps for some cases, this is overkill. However, given that the constraints are manageable, perhaps it's better to set high to n.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nfor each d in 3 to max_d:\n\n   compute min_val = 2^d -1. If n < min_val → skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      low = 2, high = n.\n\n      perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut how to avoid infinite loops?\n\nBut the compute_sum function will return early if the sum exceeds n. So for example, during binary search, for a given mid, compute_sum returns the sum. If it's larger than n, then high is adjusted down. Else, low is adjusted up.\n\nBut for large n and d, this could take longer. But given that for each test case, the maximum",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in such a way that it starts with one vertex and then adds layers of vertices according to specific rules. The key insight is to check if `n` can be expressed in the form of a geometric series sum for some integers `k > 1` and `d ≥ 3`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph can be represented as the sum of a geometric series. For a given integer `k > 1` and integer `d ≥ 3`, the number of vertices `n` can be expressed as `(k^d - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n2. **Constraints on `d`**: The value of `d` must be at least 3 because the construction process requires adding vertices to leaves at least once after the initial step.\n3. **Efficient Search**: For each possible value of `d` from 3 up to a reasonable maximum (determined by the constraints of `n`), perform a binary search on `k` to check if there exists a valid `k` such that the geometric series sum equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(d):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return total\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_d = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for d in range(3, max_d + 1):\n        min_val = (2 ** d) - 1\n        if n < min_val:\n            continue\n        low = 2\n        high = n\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        n = int(input[i])\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Validity**: For each test case, the function `is_possible` checks if `n` can be formed using the geometric series approach.\n3. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible depth `d` starting from 3 up to 60, the function performs a binary search on `k` to find if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n4. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: The helper function `compute_sum` efficiently calculates the sum of the geometric series up to `d` terms, stopping early if the sum exceeds `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible values of `k` and `d` within feasible limits, leveraging binary search and geometric series properties to handle the large constraints effectively.",
