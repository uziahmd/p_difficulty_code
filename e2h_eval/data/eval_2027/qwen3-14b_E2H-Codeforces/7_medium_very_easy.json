He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must get k new vertices connected to them. And this process must be done at least once. Wait, so the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, each of those k nodes must have k children. So the minimal snowflake for k=4 would be: the root (1), then 4 children (total 5), then each of those 4 has 4 children, adding 16. Total is 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? But the example says for n=13, it's possible. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the construction.\n\nWait the example input includes 13 as a yes. Let me think. Let's see the example given. For the minimal case with k=4, the example shows that the smallest snowflake has 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1+4+16=21. But according to the sample input, when n=13, the answer is YES. So perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait maybe the steps are different. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe snowflake is constructed as follows:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf (those that are connected to only one other node) must be done at least once. So, the minimal case is when you do this step once. Let me think:\n\nLet me take k=2. The initial step: 1 node. Then add 2 children. Now, the root has degree 2, and the two children are leaves (degree 1). Then, the step is done once: each of those leaves gets 2 new children. So total nodes is 1 + 2 + 2*2 = 1 + 2 +4 =7. So for n=7, it's possible. So the snowflake construction requires that after the initial step, we perform the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) at least once. \n\nSo the general formula for the number of nodes depends on how many times we perform this expansion step. Let's model it.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that the snowflake is built in m layers. The first layer is the root. Then, each layer adds more nodes. Let me think of the structure as a tree. Because each node added is connected to exactly one parent (since the process is adding children to existing nodes).\n\nThe root has k children. Each of those children (in the first level) has k children. But the expansion step is done at least once. So the minimum depth is 2. Let me think about the number of nodes.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as a tree where each node (except those in the last level) has exactly k children. However, the construction process requires that the expansion step is done at least once. So, the tree must have at least two levels beyond the root. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then add k children (so level 1). Then, each node in level 1 must have k children added. That's the expansion step done once. So the tree has level 0 (root), level 1 (k nodes), level 2 (k * k nodes). So total nodes is 1 + k + k^2. \n\nBut maybe the expansion can be done multiple times. For example, after adding level 2, we can again expand all leaves (those in level 2) by adding k children each. Then the total becomes 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But the expansion step must be done at least once. So the snowflake can have any number of layers as long as the expansion step is done at least once.\n\nWait, but the expansion step is: each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected to k new vertices. So, the expansion step is applied to all leaves. So, for example, if the tree has levels 0 (root), level 1 (k nodes), level 2 (k^2 nodes), then the leaves are level 2 nodes. If we perform the expansion step again, each of those leaves will get k children, leading to level 3 (k^3 nodes). So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But the expansion step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when the expansion is done once, leading to 1 + k + k^2 nodes.\n\nBut then, the problem is to check if there exists a k>1 such that n can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >= 2? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the expansion step (which must be done at least once) is adding k children to each leaf. So the expansion step is done once, which adds another level. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But if the expansion is done again, then it's 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. So the formula for the number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps plus 1? Or perhaps m is the number of layers?\n\nAlternatively, the snowflake is built in such a way that the expansion is done once or more. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k*( (k^m - 1)/(k-1) )) ?\n\nWait, the initial step is the root. Then, the first expansion (the first step) adds k children. Then, each expansion step adds k children to each existing leaf. So the number of nodes is:\n\nAfter 0 expansion steps: 1 node. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So that's not allowed.\n\nAfter 1 expansion step: the initial step (adding k children) is done, then the expansion step (adding k children to each of the k leaves). So the total is 1 + k + k*k = 1 + k + k².\n\nAfter 2 expansion steps: after adding the first expansion step (1 +k +k²), then we do another expansion step. Now, the leaves are the k² nodes. Adding k children to each of them. So the total becomes 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 2. Wait, because the expansion step is done once. Let me think:\n\nThe initial step is adding k children to the root (so that's the first expansion step?), or is that part of the initial setup?\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the expansion step (the step of adding k children to each leaf) is done at least once. So the expansion step is done once or more. So the total number of nodes is:\n\nInitial step: 1 + k nodes.\n\nThen, the expansion step is done once: adding k * k nodes. Total: 1 + k + k².\n\nIf expansion is done twice, then adding k² * k nodes. So total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the general formula is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1? Let me see:\n\nThe initial step is 1 +k (so that's 1 +k^1). Then, the expansion step is done once, adding k², making it 1 +k +k². So the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m is at least 2. Because sum from i=0 to m is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. For m=2, that's 1 +k +k². But the sum for m=1 is 1 +k. Which is not allowed because the expansion step must be done at least once. So the allowed numbers are sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m ≥ 2 and k ≥2. Wait, but for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². So for example, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². For m=3, it's 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on. So for each possible m ≥ 2, and k ≥ 2, the sum is allowed.\n\nBut the problem is to check whether there exists some k>1 and m ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nWait, but what about other possibilities? Like, maybe the expansion steps are done for some layers, but not all. For example, suppose after the initial step (adding k children to the root), then the expansion step is done once (adding k children to each of the k leaves). Then, for some of those leaves, we add more children, but others not? No, the problem says that each time the expansion step is done, all leaves are expanded. Because the expansion step is: each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., leaves) is connected to k new vertices. So every time the expansion step is done, all leaves are expanded. So the snowflake must be a full tree, where each level is fully expanded. Therefore, the total number of nodes is the sum from i=0 to m of k^i, for some m ≥ 2, and k ≥2.\n\nWait, but for example, if m is 2, then the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nYes. Because sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, it's (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k².\n\nSo our problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and m ≥ 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So m is the number of expansion steps. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k children to the root (so that's the first level). Then, the expansion step is done once: adding k children to each of the leaves (level 1). So that's m=1 expansion steps. Which gives sum up to level 2. So the sum is 1 +k +k². Which is (k^3-1)/(k-1). So m+1=3. So in terms of the formula, the total number of nodes is (k^{s} -1)/(k-1), where s is the number of levels. Since the expansion is done at least once, the number of levels s must be at least 3. Because initial level is 1 (root), then after adding level 1 (k nodes), then adding level 2 (k² nodes). So s=3 levels. So the formula is (k^s -1)/(k-1) where s ≥ 3. Wait, but that would make the sum for s=3 is 1 +k +k². Which is correct. So for s ≥3, and k ≥2.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to checking if there exists integers k ≥2 and s ≥3 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nBut also, what about other possibilities where the expansion steps are done for different numbers of layers? For example, maybe the tree is built with s levels, but not all layers are filled. But according to the construction rules, the expansion steps must be done in full. So the tree is a complete k-ary tree of s levels, with s ≥3. So the total number of nodes is indeed (k^s -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem says that n=13 is a YES. Let's see. For example, let's check for k=3, s=3: (3^3-1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Yes! So that's why n=13 is a yes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6. Let's check. Are there any k and s such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =6? Let's see. Try k=2. For s=3: (8-1)/1=7. No. s=2: (4-1)/1=3. Not allowed because s must be ≥3. For k=3, s=3: (27-1)/2=13. For k=2, s=4: (16-1)/1=15. No. What about s=3 and k=2 gives 7. So 6 can't be achieved. Hence the sample input for n=6 is NO, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for given n, if there exists integers k≥2 and s≥3 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\nNow, the challenge is to check for given n (up to 1e18) whether such k and s exist.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nConstraints:\n\nt is up to 1e4, and n is up to 1e18. So per test case, we need an efficient way.\n\nFirst, note that for each possible s (starting from 3 up to some maximum), we can check if there exists a k such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\nBut for s up to log_2(n) +1. Because for k=2, the minimal value for s is 3, and (2^s-1)/(2-1) = 2^s -1. For example, for s=3, it's 7, for s=4, 15, etc. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible s is log2(1e18) ~ 60. So for each n, we can iterate s from 3 up to 60 (say, up to 60), and for each s, check if there exists a k≥2 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck for all possible s (from 3 up to max_s, which is around 60) whether there exists a k such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nIf for any s, such a k exists, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to check for each s?\n\nLet's denote f(k,s) = (k^s -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nWe need to find if there exists k ≥2 such that f(k,s) =n.\n\nFor each s, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed s, f(k,s) increases as k increases. So for example, for s=3, f(k,3)=1 +k +k². For k=2, it's 7; for k=3, 13; etc. So for a given s, the function is strictly increasing in k. Therefore, for each s, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nWhat's the upper bound for k for a given s?\n\nSince f(k,s) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} ≤ k^{s-1} * s (since each term is at most k^{s-1} and there are s terms). But since n can be up to 1e18, for s=3, k^2 can be up to n, so k can be up to sqrt(n). For larger s, the upper bound for k is smaller. So for each s, the maximum possible k is something like n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nBut for binary search, we can set the upper bound as n. Because for k ≥2, f(k,s) ≥ 1 +2 +2^2 + ... +2^{s-1} = 2^s -1. So if n < 2^s -1, then no possible k for this s. So for each s, the minimal possible value of f(k,s) is 2^s -1. So for example, if n is less than that, we can skip this s.\n\nSo for each s, starting from 3 up to max_s, we can do:\n\nCompute the minimal value for this s, which is 2^s -1. If n < that, skip. Else, perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (like n) to see if there exists a k such that f(k,s) =n.\n\nBut how to compute f(k,s) efficiently? Well, for k and s up to 60, even for large k, the computation can be done with care to avoid overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, we need to compute f(k,s) without overflowing. Let's think about how to compute f(k,s) for given k and s.\n\nBut for example, for s=60, and k=2, f(k,s) is 2^60 -1 over 1, which is 2^60-1 ~ 1e18. So for s up to 60, and k up to 1e9, we can compute f(k,s) incrementally, and check if it exceeds n. So during the binary search, we can compute the sum step by step, and if at any point the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo here's the approach for checking a particular s:\n\nFor a given s, check if n >= 2^s -1. If not, skip. Else, perform binary search on k between 2 and upper limit (maybe n^(1/(s-1)) ), but in practice, binary search can be done between low=2 and high=some value, say, 1e6 (but for large s, the upper bound can be small).\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k? For example, for a given s, the function f(k,s) is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} = (k^s -1)/(k-1). For k ≥2, this is at least 1 +k +k^2. So for a given n, the maximum possible k for a given s is such that k^{s-1} ≤n. So k ≤n^{1/(s-1)}. Therefore, for binary search, the upper bound can be set to n^(1/(s-1)) + 1.\n\nBut calculating that might be tricky. However, since s is up to 60, and n is up to 1e18, the maximum possible k for s=3 is sqrt(n). For s=3, n can be up to 1e18, so sqrt(n) is 1e9, which is manageable for binary search. But for s=60, the upper bound is n^(1/59), which is about 1e18^(1/59) ≈ 1.5, so k can be only 2. So for higher s, the upper bound is very small.\n\nTherefore, for each s, we can perform a binary search between 2 and some upper bound (like n) and compute f(k,s) incrementally, checking for equality with n.\n\nBut how to compute f(k,s) without overflow? Let's think. For example, for k=2 and s=60, the sum is 2^60-1, which is about 1e18, which is acceptable for Python's integers. So in Python, we can compute this safely.\n\nSo the steps for each test case:\n\nFor n:\n\nIf n is 1, output NO (since the snowflake requires at least 1 +k +k², which is at least 1+2+4=7 for k=2 and s=3. Wait no, for k=2 and s=3, the sum is 1 +2 + 2² = 7. So n=1 is not possible. Similarly, for n=2, 3, etc. So the first thing is to check for n < 7, output NO. But let's see the sample input: for n=1, output is NO. For n=2, output is NO, etc.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCheck if n is 1: output NO.\n\nElse, for s in 3 to max_s:\n\n   compute min_val = 2^s - 1. If n < min_val, skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (like n) to find if there exists a k such that f(k,s) =n.\n\nBut how to compute f(k,s) for given k and s?\n\nWe can compute it as follows:\n\nsum = 1\n\ncurrent_term = 1\n\nfor i in 1 to s-1:\n\n   current_term *=k \n\n   sum += current_term \n\nif sum ==n: return True.\n\nBut during this calculation, if sum exceeds n, we can break early and return False.\n\nThis way, even for large k and s, we can compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nSo for example, for k=2, s=3: sum is 1+2+4=7.\n\nNow, for each s, the binary search for k can be done as follows:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = some upper bound (could be n, but for efficiency, perhaps we can compute it as n^(1/(s-1)) )\n\nBut for binary search, even if high is set to a large value, the steps are manageable because s is small (up to 60).\n\nSo for example, for each s:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2 (initial guess?), but better to find a high that is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, start with high = 2, and while f(high, s) <n, multiply high by 2. Once f(high,s) >=n, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis is a common approach to find the upper bound for binary search.\n\nSo the steps for a given s:\n\nCompute the minimal value for s (2^s -1). If n < that, skip.\n\nElse:\n\n   find the minimal k_low and k_high such that f(k_low, s) <=n and f(k_high, s) >=n.\n\n   perform binary search between k_low and k_high.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k?\n\nLet me think. For example, for a given s, the function f(k,s) increases with k. So for k=2, f(2,s) is 2^s -1. For larger k, it's larger. So for n, the maximum possible k is such that f(k,s) <=n. So we can find an upper bound by starting with k=2 and doubling until f(k,s) exceeds n.\n\nOnce we have that upper bound, we can perform binary search between 2 and that upper bound.\n\nSo for each s, the code could look like:\n\ndef check_s(n, s):\n\n    # Check if there exists a k >=2 such that f(k,s) =n\n\n    # Compute minimal value for s\n\n    min_val = 2**s -1\n\n    if n < min_val:\n\n        return False\n\n    # find upper bound for k\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    while compute_f(high, s) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now binary search between low and high\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        val = compute_f(mid, s)\n\n        if val ==n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif val <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut how to compute compute_f(mid, s)?\n\ndef compute_f(k, s):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, no. Because for s steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} ?\n\nYes, because for s terms. For example, s=3: 1 +k +k^2.\n\nYes. So the loop runs s times, adding current (which starts as 1, then multiplied by k each time).\n\nBut during this computation, if the total exceeds n, we can break early and return something larger than n.\n\nSo modifying compute_f to return early:\n\ndef compute_f(k, s, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return n+1 # indicates overflow\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nSo in the code, during the binary search, when we call compute_f, if it returns a value larger than n, we know that mid is too big.\n\nThis approach would work.\n\nSo putting it all together, for each test case n:\n\nif n <7: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for s in 3 to max_s:\n\n       if check_s(n, s) is True:\n\n           return YES\n\n   after checking all s, return NO.\n\nNow, what is the maximum possible value of s? Let's think for k=2. For s steps, the sum is 2^s -1. We need 2^s -1 <=n. So for n up to 1e18, 2^s -1 <=1e18 → s can be up to 60 (since 2^60 is ~1e18). So for s up to 60.\n\nSo for each test case, we loop s from 3 to 60.\n\nBut for some s, like s=60, even for k=2, the value is 2^60-1, which is 1,152,921,504,606,846,975. Which is larger than 1e18? Well, 2^60 is 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, s=60, the minimal value is 2^60-1, which is about 1.15e18, which is bigger than 1e18. So for n=1e18, s=60 would be skipped. So the maximum s to check is up to log2(n) +1. But since for each test case, looping up to 60 is manageable.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with s ranging from 3 to 60.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case n=13:\n\nCheck for s=3:\n\nmin_val = 2^3-1=7. 13 >=7.\n\nFind k such that 1 +k +k² =13 →k² +k +1=13 →k² +k -12=0 →k=( -1 ± sqrt(1 +48 )) / 2 → sqrt(49)=7 → ( -1 +7 ) /2 =3. So k=3. So returns True. Hence output YES.\n\nAnother sample input: n=255. Let's see. For s=3: 1 +k +k² =255 →k² +k -254=0 →k=(-1 + sqrt(1 + 1016))/2 → sqrt(1017) is ~31.9 → (30.9)/2 ~15.45. So trying k=15: 15² +15 +1= 225 +15 +1=241 <255. k=16: 256 +16 +1=273>255. So no solution for s=3. What about s=4? For s=4, the sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3. Let's try k=4: 1+4+16+64= 85. k=5: 1+5+25+125= 156. k=6: 1+6+36+216= 259. Close to 255. So no. What about k=5 and s=5? 1 +5 +25 +125 +625 = 781. No. Let's think for s=8, k=2: 2^8-1/(2-1) = 255. Yes! Because (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So for s=8, k=2. Hence, returns YES. So the code would find that.\n\nSo the code would check for s=8, and find that for k=2, the sum is 255. Hence, output YES.\n\nAnother sample input: n=1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why. Let's check for possible s and k.\n\nFor example, for s=3: 1 +k +k² =1e18 →k² +k +1 =1e18 →k ≈ sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. Let's compute for k=1e9: 1e18 + 1e9 +1 ≈ 1e18, but the exact value would be 1e18 + ... which is larger than 1e18. So no solution here. What about for s=2? No, because s must be ≥3. So for other s values. For example, for s=60, the minimal is 2^60-1 ~ 1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18. So no. What about for s=59, k=2? sum is (2^60 -1)/ (2-1) = 2^60 -1 ~1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18. So no. What about s=5 and k= something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is no k and s for 1e18. Hence output is NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nn=7: s=3, k=2 →1+2+4=7 → YES.\n\nn=15: check for s=3, k=3 gives 1+3+9=13 <15. s=3, k=4: 1+4+16=21>15. So no. For s=4, check if there is a k. For s=4, min is 2^4-1=15. So n=15 equals min. So k=2, s=4. 1+2+4+8=15. Yes. So output YES. Hence sample input for n=15 is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6: output is NO. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n < 7 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for s in 3 to 60:\n\n       check if there exists a k for this s.\n\n       if yes, output YES and break.\n\n   else, output NO.\n\nBut what about cases where s is larger than log2(n)+1? For example, for n=7, s=3 is okay. For s=4, the minimal value is 2^4-1=15>7. So no.\n\nSo the code loops s from 3 to 60, and for each, check.\n\nNow, implement the check_s function.\n\nBut in Python, for exponents, 2^s can be computed as 1 << s, but for s up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nBut for the check_s function, the code would be:\n\ndef check_s(n, s):\n\n    min_val = (1 << s) -1  # 2^s -1\n\n    if n < min_val:\n\n        return False\n\n    # Now find k such that sum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i =n.\n\n    # Find upper bound for k.\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    while compute_f(high, s, n) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now binary search between low and high.\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        val = compute_f(mid, s, n)\n\n        if val ==n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif val <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut compute_f is:\n\ndef compute_f(k, s, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return n+1\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, we can inline this function.\n\nNow, considering that for large s and k, compute_f may take O(s) time. But since s is up to 60, and for each test case, we loop up to 60 s's, and for each s, binary search with O(log (upper_bound)) steps, it's manageable.\n\nNow, handling the case when n=1, 2, 3, etc. For example, for n=1, output is NO. For n=7, output is YES.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut note that for n=1, the code returns NO. Also, for n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6, output is NO.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut what about the case where s is 3 and k=2, which gives 7. So for n=7, returns YES.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n < 7 → print NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   flag = False\n\n   for s in 3 to 60:\n\n       min_val = 2^s -1.\n\n       if n < min_val → continue.\n\n       else:\n\n           perform the binary search for k.\n\n           if found → flag = True, break.\n\n   if flag → YES else NO.\n\nBut how to compute min_val? For s up to 60, 2^s can be 2^60 which is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976. For n up to 1e18, which is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000. So for s=60, min_val is 1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for n=1e18, this s would be skipped.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for exponents, 2**s can be calculated. However, for s=60, 2**s is manageable.\n\nBut for the check_s function, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    \n    for n in cases:\n        if n < 7:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        for s in range(3, 61):\n            # compute min_val = 2^s -1\n            min_val = (1 << s) -1\n            if n < min_val:\n                continue\n            # Now check if there exists a k for this s\n            # Binary search for k\n            low = 2\n            high = 2\n            # find upper bound\n            while True:\n                val = 0\n                current = 1\n                for _ in range(s):\n                    val += current\n                    if val > n:\n                        break\n                    current *= high\n                if val > n:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    high *=2\n            # Now binary search between low and high\n            # But need to recompute the upper bound properly. Wait, the code above is not",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed according to specific rules. The snowflake graph is constructed in such a way that each vertex added must have exactly `k` new vertices connected to it, starting from an initial vertex. The challenge is to check if there exists a valid `k > 1` and a number of expansion steps such that the total number of vertices equals `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding `k` vertices at each step. The total number of vertices after `s` expansion steps can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: $1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{s-1}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{k^s - 1}{k - 1}$.\n\n2. **Constraints Check**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists integers `k` (where `k > 1`) and `s` (where `s ≥ 3`) such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: For each possible value of `s` (from 3 to 60), we perform a binary search on `k` to check if the sum of the geometric series for that `s` equals `n`. This approach leverages the properties of geometric series and binary search to efficiently narrow down potential values of `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    \n    for n in cases:\n        if n < 7:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        for s in range(3, 61):\n            min_val = (1 << s) - 1\n            if n < min_val:\n                continue\n            # Binary search for k\n            low = 2\n            high = 2\n            # Find upper bound for high\n            while True:\n                val = 0\n                current = 1\n                overflow = False\n                for _ in range(s):\n                    val += current\n                    if val > n:\n                        overflow = True\n                        break\n                    current *= high\n                if overflow or val > n:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    high *= 2\n            # Now perform binary search between low and high\n            left = 2\n            right = high\n            while left <= right:\n                mid = (left + right) // 2\n                total = 0\n                current = 1\n                overflow = False\n                for _ in range(s):\n                    total += current\n                    if total > n:\n                        overflow = True\n                        break\n                    current *= mid\n                if overflow:\n                    right = mid - 1\n                else:\n                    if total == n:\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                    elif total < n:\n                        left = mid + 1\n                    else:\n                        right = mid - 1\n            if found:\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: For values of `n` less than 7, immediately output \"NO\" since the smallest valid snowflake has 7 vertices.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Expansion Steps**: For each possible number of expansion steps `s` (from 3 to 60), check if the minimum possible value for `s` is less than or equal to `n`.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each valid `s`, use binary search to find a `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`. This involves checking for overflow during the sum calculation to ensure we do not exceed the limits of `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all potential configurations using geometric series properties and binary search, ensuring we handle very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$ within feasible time limits.",
