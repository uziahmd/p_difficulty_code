The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such graphs.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those leaves) are connected to k more new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So, the process is like building layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step. Let's model this.\n\nLet's consider the initial step. The first layer is just the root node. Then, the first expansion adds k children to the root. Now, the total nodes is 1 + k. But then, each of those k nodes is a leaf. So, the next step would be adding k new nodes to each of them. So, each of the k nodes adds k new nodes. So, the second expansion adds k * k nodes. The total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step of adding k new nodes to each leaf must be done at least once. So, the minimum steps would be two expansions. For example, the first expansion (adding k nodes) and then the second expansion (adding k^2 nodes). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut maybe there are more steps. Suppose we do another expansion. Each leaf from the previous step (which were added in the second expansion) would have their own k children. So, the third expansion adds k^3 nodes. The total becomes 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But this depends on how many times we perform the expansion steps.\n\nWait, but the expansion steps are applied to all leaves. So, the process is:\n\n- Start with 1 node (level 0).\n- Level 1: add k nodes. Total is 1 + k.\n- Then, for each level, all leaves (which are the nodes added in the previous step) get k children. So, each expansion adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step.\n\nBut the number of leaves after each expansion is equal to the number of nodes added in the previous step. Because each of those nodes is a leaf (since they were added in the previous expansion step and have only one edge).\n\nSo, the number of nodes added in each step is:\n\nStep 0: 1 node (root)\nStep 1: k nodes added. Total: 1 + k\nStep 2: k * k nodes added. Total: 1 + k + k²\nStep 3: k * k² = k³ nodes added. Total: 1 + k + k² + k³\n...\nStep m: k^m nodes added. Total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the expansion steps (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So, the first expansion (step 1) is required. But the second expansion (step 2) is also required? Or does the first expansion count as the initial step?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (so the leaves) is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so the initial step is adding the k children to the root. Then, the \"step\" of adding k children to each leaf must be done at least once. So that implies that the process must have at least two steps. Wait, no. Let me re-read:\n\nThe initial step is adding k new vertices (so the first expansion). Then, the next step (the \"this step should be done at least once\") is adding k new vertices to each leaf. So that step must be done once. Which implies that the snowflake must have at least two expansions. For example, the minimal case is when you do the first expansion (adding k), then do the second expansion (adding k^2). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut if you do more steps, like adding k^3, then the total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc.\n\nSo the possible n's are numbers that can be written as sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 1 (since the second step must be done at least once). Wait, because the first expansion (step 1) is required, and the second expansion (step 2) must be done once. So m must be at least 1? Or m is the number of steps after the first expansion?\n\nWait, the sum for m steps. Let's think again. The first step (adding k) is required. Then, the second step (adding k^2) is required once. So the minimal case is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i - 1? No, the sum from i=0 to m of k^i, but m must be at least 2? Because:\n\nOriginal sum is 1 (for i=0) + k (i=1) + k^2 (i=2) ?\n\nWait, the sum for m steps where m is the number of expansions. Let me think:\n\nOriginal step: 1 node.\n\nAfter first expansion (step 1): 1 + k.\n\nAfter second expansion (step 2): 1 + k + k^2.\n\nAfter third expansion (step 3): 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1), where m is the number of expansions steps. But the first expansion is required, and the second expansion must be done at least once. So, m must be ≥ 2? Because the first expansion is step 1, and the second expansion is step 2.\n\nWait, the problem says that the step of adding k children to each leaf is done at least once. So that step is the second expansion. Therefore, the minimal number of expansions is 2. So the total nodes is 1 + k + k². So for any valid snowflake, the number of nodes is S = (k^{m} - 1)/(k-1) where m ≥ 2, and k ≥ 2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is sum_{i=0}^m (k^i) = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). So for m steps, where each step adds k^i nodes. But the initial step is 1 node (i=0), then adding k (i=1), then k^2 (i=2), etc.\n\nBut the problem requires that the second expansion (adding k^2) is done once. So the minimal m is 2. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m (k^i) where m ≥ 2. But wait, for m=2, the sum is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding k children to each leaf is done at least once. Which is the second expansion. So the snowflake must have at least two expansions. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. But that's not correct. Because the first expansion is the first step (adding k nodes). Then, the second expansion is the second step (adding k^2 nodes). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. So m is the number of expansions, which is 2. So the sum is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i, but with the initial term being 1 (i=0), then adding k^1, then k^2. So yes, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k².\n\nBut for the general case, the snowflake can have more expansions. For example, after the second expansion, you can do a third expansion (adding k^3 nodes). Then the total is 1 +k +k² +k³. So the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of expansions. Wait, m is the number of expansion steps. For example, the first expansion (adding k) is step 1. Then step 2 adds k². So the number of expansion steps is m. Then the total nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i? No, because the initial node is 1, then step 1 adds k, step 2 adds k², step 3 adds k^3, etc. So the total is 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m. Which is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the step of adding k children to each leaf must be done at least once. Which is step 2. So m must be ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1?\n\nWait, the first expansion (step 1) is adding k children to the root. Then, the second expansion (step 2) is adding k children to each of the leaves (the ones added in step 1). So that step must be done at least once. Therefore, the snowflake must have at least two expansion steps. So the minimal m is 2. Thus, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. But m can be larger than 2. So for any m ≥ 2, and any k ≥ 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether the given n can be expressed as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where k ≥ 2, m ≥ 2. Wait, no. Because the formula for the sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m ≥ 2, the sum would be (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But m is the number of expansion steps. So for example, m=2 gives sum 1 +k +k². Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut for the snowflake to exist, n must be equal to that sum for some k ≥ 2 and m ≥ 2.\n\nSo our task is, given n, check if there exists integers k ≥ 2 and m ≥ 2 such that n = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k - 1).\n\nAlternatively, since m ≥ 2, m+1 ≥ 3. So the sum can be written as S = 1 + k + k² + ... +k^t, where t ≥ 2. Because m+1 is t, so t ranges from 3 upwards. Wait, no. If m is the number of expansion steps, then m ≥ 2. So t = m+1 is ≥ 3. So the sum is S = (k^t -1)/(k-1), where t ≥ 3, and k ≥ 2.\n\nBut that's equivalent to checking if n can be written as sum_{i=0}^t k^i, where t ≥ 2, and k ≥ 2. Because t is m+1. So for example, t=2 would be sum 1 +k. But that's not allowed because m must be ≥ 2. Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal sum for m expansion steps is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. m is the number of expansion steps. For m=1, that's 1 +k. But the problem requires that the second expansion (step) is done at least once. So m must be ≥ 2. So t = m+1 is m+1 ≥ 3? No, if m is the number of expansion steps, then for m=2, t is m=2? No, sorry, the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So the t here is m+1, which is 3. So the sum is for t ≥ 3, and the sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1), with k ≥ 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^t - 1)/(k-1) for integers k ≥ 2 and t ≥ 3.\n\nSo our task is for each n, check whether there exists integers k ≥ 2 and t ≥ 3 such that (k^t - 1) / (k-1) = n.\n\nBut how can we check that efficiently, given that n can be up to 1e18?\n\nFirst, note that for t ≥ 3, the expression (k^t - 1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nSo for example, for t=3, it's 1 +k +k². For t=4, it's 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check if there exists some t ≥3 and k ≥2 such that this sum equals n.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for each n, whether such k and t exist.\n\nLet's think about possible approaches.\n\nAn approach could be for each possible t (from 3 up to some maximum value), check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to find an efficient way to iterate over possible t.\n\nFor example, for t=3: the equation becomes 1 +k +k² =n. So solving k² +k +1 =n → k² +k + (1 -n) =0. The discriminant is 1 -4*(1-n) = 4n -3. So sqrt(4n-3) must be integer. And then k = [-1 ± sqrt(4n-3)]/2. Since k must be positive, we take the positive root. So for t=3, we can check if 4n-3 is a perfect square, and then compute k.\n\nSimilarly for higher t. However, for larger t, the possible k values are smaller. For example, for t=3, the minimal k is 2, which gives 1+2+4=7. For t=4, the minimal k is 2, which gives 1+2+4+8=15. For t=5, 1+2+...+16=31. So for each t, the minimal value is 2^t -1 (since sum_{i=0}^t 2^i -1 ? Wait, no. For t=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². For k=2 and t=3, the sum is 1+2+4=7. Which is 2^3 -1 =7. Yes. Similarly, for k=2 and t=4, sum is 15 = 2^4 -1. So for any t and k=2, the sum is 2^t -1. So for a given n, if it's of the form 2^t -1, then it's acceptable for t≥3.\n\nSo for example, n=7 (t=3, k=2) → YES. n=15 (t=4, k=2) → YES.\n\nBut for other k values, the sum would be larger. For example, k=3, t=3: 1+3+9=13. Which is 13. So for n=13, answer is YES.\n\nSo the approach is to check for all possible t (up to log_2(n)+1), and for each t, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to find for a given t and n, whether there exists such a k?\n\nLet's think for a fixed t. The sum S(t, k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1} = (k^t -1)/(k-1). We need to find if there exists k ≥2 such that S(t,k) =n.\n\nFor a given t, we can binary search on k. Because for fixed t, S(t,k) increases as k increases. So for each t, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there exists a k such that S(t,k)=n.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given t?\n\nWell, for S(t, k) =n. Since S(t, k) is increasing with k, the minimal possible value is when k=2, which is S(t,2) = 2^t -1. The maximal possible k is such that S(t, k) ≤n. For example, for t=3, S(t, k) =k^2 +k +1. For n, the maximum k can be up to sqrt(n), since k^2 < n → k < sqrt(n). So for a given t, the upper bound for k is something like n^(1/(t-1)).\n\nBut since t can be up to log_2(n) +1, for example, for t=3, the maximum k is O(sqrt(n)), for t=4, O(n^(1/3)), etc.\n\nSo for each possible t, we can perform a binary search on k. But how many possible t's are there?\n\nFor t ≥3, the minimal value of S(t,2) is 2^t -1. For this to be ≤n, we have 2^t -1 ≤n → t ≤ log2(n+1). So the maximum possible t is up to log2(n)+1. For n up to 1e18, log2(n) is about 60, so the maximum t is 60.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate t from 3 up to log2(n)+1 (say, up to 60), and for each t, perform a binary search on k (from 2 to some upper bound) to see if there exists a k such that S(t,k) =n.\n\nIf for any t and k, this holds, then output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBut how to compute S(t,k) efficiently? For large t and k, this can be very big. However, during the binary search, we can compute S(t,k) incrementally and check if it exceeds n. Also, since n can be up to 1e18, even for t=60 and k=2, the value is 2^60-1 which is around 1e18. So for binary search steps, we can compute the sum step by step and stop if it exceeds n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1, 2, or 3. For these, the answer is NO (since the minimal possible sum is 7 for t=3 and k=2).\n\n- For each t from 3 up to max_t (like 60):\n\n   - Compute the minimal possible sum for k=2, which is 2^t -1. If that is larger than n, break (since higher t will have even larger minimal sums).\n\n   - Else, perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (which can be found as, say, n^(1/(t-1)) + 1, since S(t, k) is roughly k^{t-1} for large k).\n\n   - For each candidate k in binary search, compute S(t, k) and check if it equals n.\n\nBut how to compute S(t, k) without overflow? Since n is up to 1e18, and t is up to 60, even for k=1e6, t=3, the sum is 1e12 + ... which is manageable with Python's big integers.\n\nBut during the computation of S(t, k), we can check for overflow early. For example, during the calculation of the sum, if at any step the sum exceeds n, we can break and return that it's too big.\n\nSo the steps for checking a given t and k:\n\nCompute sum = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}\n\nBut since t can be up to 60, and k up to say 1e6, even for t=60 and k=2, the sum is 2^60-1 which is 1e18. So for Python, handling this is feasible.\n\nSo for the binary search for a given t:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = some upper limit. Let's think: for the sum S(t, k) = (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n. Since k >=2, then S(t, k) >= 1 +k +k^2. So for k^t <= n*(k-1) +1. But perhaps for binary search, we can set high as n. Because for k >=2 and t>=3, S(t, k) is at least 1 +2 + 2^2 =7. For larger k, the sum increases. But for example, if t=3 and k is very large, the sum is k^2 +k +1 ≈k^2. So for n, the maximum possible k is about sqrt(n). So for binary search, setting high to n is safe, but may be slow. However, since t is up to 60, and for each t, the binary search steps are O(log n), which for t=60 is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a better upper bound. For example, for fixed t, the sum S(t, k) = (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n. For k >=2, the sum is less than k^t/(k-1). So k^t/(k-1) >n → k^t > n*(k-1). Since k-1 >=1, this implies k^t >n → k> n^(1/t). So for upper bound, we can set high = n^(1/(t-1)) + 1. Because for the sum S(t, k) = sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i. The largest term is k^{t-1}, so sum is at most t*k^{t-1}. So t*k^{t-1} >=n →k >= (n/t)^{1/(t-1)}.\n\nBut perhaps for binary search, using high as n is acceptable. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, for each t, binary search k between 2 and high (say, n), and compute the sum. If during the sum calculation, it exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n < 7: return NO (since the minimal sum is 7)\n\n   else:\n\n      for t in 3 to max_t:\n\n         compute min_sum = 2^t -1. If min_sum >n: break (since higher t will have larger min_sum)\n\n         else:\n\n             perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (say, n) to see if there's a k where sum_{i=0}^{t-1}k^i =n.\n\n             if found, return YES\n\n      after checking all t, return NO\n\nBut how to compute max_t? Well, for t_max, the minimal sum is 2^t -1. So for t_max, 2^t -1 <=n → t_max is up to log2(n+1). For n up to 1e18, log2(n) is about 60. So we can loop t from 3 to 60.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor t in range(3, 61):\n\n   compute min_sum = 2^t -1. If min_sum >n → break.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search for k.\n\nBut how to compute 2^t? For t up to 60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the binary search for a given t and n:\n\ndef check(t, n):\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = 2\n\n   # find upper bound for k\n\n   # find a high such that sum_{i=0}^{t-1} high^i >=n\n\n   # but perhaps just set high to n initially, and let binary search handle it.\n\n   # but for efficiency, maybe find a better upper bound.\n\n   # but for code simplicity, let's proceed with high = n.\n\n   # but for t=3, high can be sqrt(n), but in code, it's easier to use binary search with high = n.\n\n   # However, for large t, the upper bound can be small.\n\n   # Anyway, proceed with high = n.\n\n   # Now, binary search between low and high.\n\n   while True:\n\n      current_sum = compute_sum(t, k)\n\n      if current_sum ==n: return True\n\n      elif current_sum <n: low = k+1\n\n      else: high = k-1\n\n   # but how to implement this properly?\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to perform binary search between low and high, where low starts at 2, high starts at some upper bound. For example:\n\ndef check(t, n):\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = 2\n\n   # find upper bound for high:\n\n   while compute_sum(t, high) <n:\n\n       high *=2\n\n   # now, high is such that compute_sum(t, high) >=n\n\n   # perform binary search between low and high.\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) //2\n\n       s = compute_sum(t, mid)\n\n       if s ==n:\n\n           return True\n\n       elif s <n:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n   return False\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum(t, k)?\n\ndef compute_sum(t, k):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(t):\n\n        total += k**i\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n    return total\n\nBut for t up to 60 and k up to 1e18, this may be computationally expensive. However, since k^i can be very big, but we can break early when the total exceeds n. For example, for k=2 and t=60, the sum is 2^60-1 which is about 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nBut even better, we can compute the sum in a way that avoids exponentiating each time. For example, we can compute it iteratively:\n\nsum = 1 (for i=0)\n\ncurrent_term = 1\n\nfor i in 1 to t-1:\n\n   current_term *=k\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   if sum >n: break\n\nreturn sum\n\nThis is more efficient. So:\n\ndef compute_sum(t, k, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return n+1  # something larger than n\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for t steps, the loop runs t times. For example, t=3, the loop adds 1 (k^0), then k^1, then k^2.\n\nYes. So for t steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nSo in code, the compute_sum function can be implemented as follows.\n\nBut in Python, even for t=60 and k=1e6, this would be manageable.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n <7: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for t in 3 to 60:\n\n      min_sum = 2^t -1. If min_sum >n: break.\n\n      else:\n\n          perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] to see if compute_sum(t, k) ==n.\n\n          if found, return YES.\n\n   after all t, return NO.\n\nBut also, there's another case: when t=2. Wait, no. Because earlier analysis says that t must be ≥3. Because t is m+1 where m is the number of expansion steps, which must be ≥2. So m+1 ≥3.\n\nWait, no. Earlier analysis said that the sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1), where t ≥3. So the code is checking for t ≥3.\n\nBut let's think again. For example, the minimal case is when t=3, which gives sum 1 +k +k^2. But what if someone tries t=2? Then the sum would be 1 +k, which is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the second expansion must be done at least once. So the minimal number of expansions is 2. Which would correspond to t= m+1 where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, m is the number of expansion steps. For example, m=2 expansion steps: first expansion adds k, second adds k^2. The sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So t=3. So the code is correct in checking t ≥3.\n\nSo the code checks for t from 3 up to 60.\n\nNow, let's look at the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES\n\n15 → YES\n\n255 → YES\n\n10101 → YES\n\n1000000000000000000 → NO\n\nSample Output:\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nLet's take n=13. For t=3, check if there is a k such that 1 +k +k² =13 →k² +k -12=0 →k= [ -1 ± sqrt(1 +48)]/2 → sqrt(49)=7 → ( -1 +7)/2= 3. So k=3. So yes. So returns YES.\n\nFor n=15, which is 2^4 -1 =15. So t=4, k=2. So returns YES.\n\nn=255. Let's see. 255 is 2^8 -1. So for t=8, k=2. So YES. Also, 255 can be written as 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^t-1. For example, for t=3, k^2 +k +1 =255 →k² +k -254=0 → discriminant 1 + 4*254= 1017. sqrt(1017) is ~31.89. Not integer. So no. So for t=4, 1 +k +k² +k^3 =255. Let's see for k=4: 1+4+16+64= 85. For k=5: 1+5+25+125= 156. k=6: 1+6+36+216= 259>255. So no. For t=5, 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 +k^4 =255. For k=3: 1+3+9+27+81= 121. k=4: 1+4+16+64+256= 341>255. So no. So the only possibility is t=8, k=2. So returns YES.\n\nAnother example: n=255. So code would check for t=3, 4,... up to 8. For t=8, min_sum is 2^8 -1 =255. So yes. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000. The output is NO. Let's see why. For example, check if it's of the form (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some t≥3 and k≥2.\n\nSuppose t=3: then 1 +k +k² = 1e18. Solving for k: k^2 +k +1 = 1e18. The approximate solution is k ~ sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. Let's compute k^2 = 1e18 -k -1. For k=1e9, k² is 1e18. So 1e9² +1e9 +1 = 1e18 + 1e9 +1. Which is larger than 1e18. So the actual k is slightly less than 1e9. But perhaps there's no integer solution. So for t=3, no solution.\n\nFor t=4: (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =1e18. Let's see for k= 1e6: 1e18 + ... but that's way bigger. So perhaps for larger t, but even for t=3, the code would check.\n\nBut the code would check for all possible t's up to 60, and for each, check for possible k. If none found, output NO.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these possibilities.\n\nNow, considering the code in Python:\n\nBut for very large n, say 1e18, and t=3, the binary search for k would be between 2 and something like 1e9. But with binary search, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, some edge cases:\n\nn=7 → t=3, k=2 → YES.\n\nn=15 → t=4, k=2 → YES.\n\nn=31 → t=5, k=2 → YES.\n\nWhat about n=6? It's 6. The minimal sum is 7, so output is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^t-1. For example, t=3, k=2 →7. t=3, k=3 →13. t=3, k=4 →21. So for n=21, YES.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nBut first, for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n <7 → print NO.\n\nElse:\n\nloop t from 3 to 60:\n\n   compute min_sum = 2^t -1.\n\n   if min_sum >n → break.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search for k in this t.\n\n      if found, return YES.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    t_cases = int(input[0])\n\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:]))\n\n    for n in cases:\n\n        if n <7:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        found = False\n\n        for t in range(3, 61):\n\n            # compute min_sum for k=2\n\n            min_sum = (2**t) -1\n\n            if min_sum >n:\n\n                break\n\n            # Now, check if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i =n\n\n            # Binary search for k\n\n            # find upper bound for k\n\n            low = 2\n\n            high = 2\n\n            # find high such that compute_sum(t, high) >=n\n\n            while True:\n\n                s = compute_sum(t, high, n)\n\n                if s >=n:\n\n                    break\n\n                high *=2\n\n            # Now binary search between low and high\n\n            left = 2\n\n            right = high\n\n            while left <= right:\n\n                mid = (left + right) //2\n\n                s = compute_sum(t, mid, n)\n\n                if s ==n:\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                elif s <n:\n\n                    left = mid +1\n\n                else:\n\n                    right = mid -1\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if found:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut need to define compute_sum(t, k, n):\n\ndef compute_sum(t, k, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return n+1\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, functions inside functions can be tricky. So perhaps integrate it into the code.\n\nBut in the code above, the compute_sum is called inside the loop.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the 'compute_sum' is a helper function. But in the code as written, the code is part of the solve function. So perhaps the code is:\n\nBut in Python, it's easier to code this inline.\n\nBut let's think about the code structure. Let me write the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints. A snowflake graph is constructed by starting with a single vertex and repeatedly adding layers of vertices such that each vertex added in a previous layer connects to `k` new vertices, where `k > 1`. The solution involves checking if `n` can be represented as a geometric series sum for some integers `k ≥ 2` and `t ≥ 3`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph structure can be represented as a geometric series sum. For a given number of vertices `n`, we need to check if it can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with at least 3 terms (since the minimum valid snowflake requires at least two expansion steps).\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible number of terms `t` (from 3 up to 60, since 2^60 exceeds 10^18), check if there exists an integer `k ≥ 2` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each `t`, use binary search to determine if there exists a valid `k` that satisfies the geometric series sum condition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(t, k, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return n + 1\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t_cases = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n < 7:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        for t in range(3, 61):\n            min_sum = (2 ** t) - 1\n            if min_sum > n:\n                break\n            # Binary search for k\n            low = 2\n            high = 2\n            # Find upper bound for high\n            while True:\n                s = compute_sum(t, high, n)\n                if s >= n:\n                    break\n                high *= 2\n            left = 2\n            right = high\n            while left <= right:\n                mid = (left + right) // 2\n                s = compute_sum(t, mid, n)\n                if s == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                elif s < n:\n                    left = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right = mid - 1\n            if found:\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: Directly check if `n` is less than 7, which cannot form a valid snowflake as the minimum valid configuration has 7 vertices.\n3. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible number of terms `t` from 3 to 60, calculate the minimum sum for `k=2`. If this minimum exceeds `n`, further checks for higher `t` are skipped.\n4. **Binary Search for `k`**: For each valid `t`, use binary search to find if there exists an integer `k` such that the sum of the geometric series with `t` terms equals `n`. This involves expanding the series incrementally and checking against `n` to avoid overflow.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down potential values of `k` and `t` using mathematical properties of geometric series and binary search, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient even for very large values of `n`.",
