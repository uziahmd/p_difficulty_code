He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about splitting n problems into exactly k days, each day solving consecutive problems starting from the beginning. Each day's profit is the max difficulty of the problems solved that day. We need to maximize the total profit.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. Since it's a dynamic programming problem, maybe? Because for each day, the choice of where to split affects future choices, and we need to find the optimal way.\n\nLet me think about the DP approach. Let's consider dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days. Then, the transition would be: for each possible split point m (where m ranges from j-1 to i-1, since each day must have at least one problem), dp[i][j] = max(dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])).\n\nBut wait, the max from m+1 to i is needed. How can we compute that efficiently?\n\nThe problem constraints are n up to 2000 and k up to 2000. So if we do O(n^2 * k) time, with precomputing maxes, maybe it's feasible?\n\nLet me think. For each i and j, and for each possible m, we need to calculate the max of a[m+1...i]. If we precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[l][r] is the max of a[l..r], then we can get that in O(1) time. But precomputing that for all l and r would take O(n^2) time and space, which for n=2000 is 4 million entries. That's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP transitions, for each possible split, we can compute the max on the fly. But that would be O(n) per split, leading to O(n^3 * k) time, which for n=2000 would be way too slow.\n\nSo precomputing the max_range is better. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo first, precompute max_range for all intervals [l..r]. Then, the DP can be filled in.\n\nNow, the DP recurrence:\n\ndp[i][j] = max over m from j-1 to i-1 of (dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m+1][i])\n\nBase case: dp[i][1] = max_range[1][i], since all i problems are done in one day.\n\nThe answer is dp[n][k].\n\nBut how to handle the splitting into exactly k days? Also, for each i and j, we need to ensure that j <= i, since each day has at least one problem.\n\nNow, the next thing is to compute the max_range. How to precompute that?\n\nWe can precompute for each l, and for each r >= l, the maximum value. For example, for l from 1 to n, and r from l to n. We can compute it using dynamic programming as well. For each l, the max for [l..r] can be computed incrementally. For example, max_range[l][r] = max(max_range[l][r-1], a[r]).\n\nYes, that's a way. So for l in 1..n, and r in l..n:\n\nif r == l, then max_range[l][r] = a[l]\nelse max_range[l][r] = max( max_range[l][r-1], a[r] )\n\nThis will take O(n^2) time, which is acceptable for n=2000.\n\nOnce that's done, the DP can be filled.\n\nNow, the DP table. The size is (n+1) x (k+1), since i ranges from 1 to n, j from 1 to k.\n\nBut for n=2000 and k=2000, the DP table would be 2000*2000 = 4 million entries. For each entry, we might have to check up to O(n) possibilities. So O(n^2 * k) time. For n=2000 and k=2000, that's 8e10 operations. Oh no, that's way too big. Wait, that's impossible. So this approach isn't feasible for n=2000 and k=2000. Wait, but what's the actual constraints? The problem says n and k are up to 2000. So O(n^2 * k) is O(2000^3) = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python. So this approach is not going to work. Need to think of a better way.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to optimize. Let's think again. For example, when k is up to n, but perhaps for some cases, like when k is small, but in general, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each j, the number of days, and for each i, the number of problems, perhaps we can find a way to compute the transitions more efficiently.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the recurrence again. For dp[i][j], we need to find the best m (number of problems in the first j-1 days) such that m is between j-1 and i-1, and then take dp[m][j-1] + max of a[m+1 ... i].\n\nBut for each i and j, the m ranges from j-1 to i-1. So for each i and j, we have to check all possible m's in that range.\n\nBut even with that, for n=2000 and k=2000, the time complexity is O(n^2 *k), which is way too slow.\n\nWait, but maybe the constraints are not that bad. Let's see: for n=2000 and k=2000, but for each j, the i can be up to n. However, for j=2000, i must be 2000, so for j=2000, the only possible i is 2000. So maybe the actual number of operations is O(n^2 * min(k, n)) ), but even that for k=2000 and n=2000, it's O(2000^3) which is 8e10. Which is way too big.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Need to think of another way.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the problem in terms of the fact that each day must take at least one problem, and the splits are contiguous. So the problem is similar to partitioning the array into k parts, each part being a contiguous segment, and the sum of the max of each part is maximized.\n\nAnother thought: Since the max of a segment is determined by the maximum element in it. So, for each possible split, the total profit is the sum of maxes of each part.\n\nWhat's the optimal way to split? Well, the maximum elements in each part must be as large as possible. But how?\n\nFor example, if there are some very large elements, we want to have them in their own parts. But since the splits are contiguous, we can't skip elements.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the maximum elements are 5, 6, 9. So splitting into [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2], gives those maxes. The maximum elements are each in their own day. However, in the third day, the 9 is the max, but the 1 and 2 are lower. So that's better than having 9 in a group with higher numbers.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative idea: For each day, the max of the segment is the maximum in that segment. So, the optimal strategy would be to split the array into k segments such that the sum of the maximums is as large as possible.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAnother observation: For the case when k=1, the answer is the maximum of the entire array. For k=n, each day is one problem, so the sum is the sum of all elements.\n\nBut for other values of k, how?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. Suppose we have to split into k parts. The maximum sum is achieved by choosing the k largest elements, but ensuring that they are in separate parts. However, this may not be possible because of the order. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 2, 4], and k=2. The two largest elements are 4 and 3. To have them in separate parts, you need to split after 3, but then the first part is [1,3], max 3, second part [2,4], max 4. Sum is 7. Alternatively, if you split after 2, then the parts are [1,3,2], max 3, and [4], sum 3+4=7. Same. Or split after 1, then [1], [3,2,4], sum 1+4=5. So the maximum is 7. So the idea of taking the largest k elements is not directly applicable because of the order.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem is not straightforward.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming again, but try to find a way to optimize the transitions.\n\nLet me think about the DP recurrence again. For dp[i][j], the maximum profit for the first i elements split into j days. To compute this, we need to find m in [j-1, i-1], and take dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nNow, for each j, when computing dp[i][j], we can iterate m from j-1 to i-1. But for each m, we can compute the max from m+1 to i. However, if we can find a way to compute this max quickly.\n\nBut even with that, the DP approach is O(n^2 *k) time. For n=2000 and k=2000, this is O(8e10) operations, which is way too slow for Python.\n\nBut perhaps the constraints are not that tight. Let's check the sample input. For example, in the third example, n=4, k=2. The answer is 4000. So the code needs to handle that.\n\nBut for the worst case, with n=2000 and k=2000, the code would have to process 2000^3 steps. That's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe the constraints are not that bad. Let's think again. For example, when k is equal to n, then each day has exactly one problem. So the answer is the sum of all the elements. So in this case, the DP can be handled quickly.\n\nBut for other cases, perhaps the DP approach can be optimized.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible value of k? It's n. So for j up to n.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the DP[i][j] as follows. For each j, the number of days, we can compute the DP[i][j] based on previous values. However, for each i and j, the m ranges from j-1 to i-1. So for j=2, we need to split into two parts, the first part has m elements (m ranges from 1 to i-1).\n\nBut perhaps for each j, we can compute the DP[i][j] for all i in O(n^2) time. But again, for j up to k, this is O(k*n^2) time.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the problem differently. Let's try to find for each j, the minimal number of steps. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider that when we split into j days, the last day can be any length from 1 to (n - (j-1)), since the first j-1 days need to take at least j-1 problems. So for the last day, the number of problems can be from 1 to (n - (j-1)). But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, for each j and i, the DP[i][j] can be calculated as the maximum of DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) for m from j-1 to i-1. So for each j and i, the inner loop is m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nBut for each i and j, the inner loop is O(i) steps. So for all i and j, it's O(n^2 *k) steps.\n\nBut with n=2000 and k=2000, this is O(8e10) steps, which is way too slow for Python, which can handle roughly 1e8 operations per second.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Need to think of a smarter way.\n\nWait, but what if we can find a way to compute the DP[i][j] in O(1) or O(n) time per i and j?\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem for j days. For each i, the optimal split for j days would be to choose the best possible position m where the first j-1 days are split optimally, and then the j-th day is from m+1 to i. But how can we find that m quickly?\n\nAnother observation: The max of a[m+1..i] is a non-decreasing function as m decreases. Because when m decreases, the interval [m+1..i] becomes larger, so the max can't decrease. For example, if m is smaller, the interval includes more elements, so the max is at least as big as before.\n\nBut how does that help? Well, suppose that for a fixed i and j, we want to find m such that DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) is maximized.\n\nBut since max(a[m+1..i]) increases as m decreases, and DP[m][j-1] is something that could vary, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal m for each i and j.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think for a particular i and j. For example, when considering m from (j-1) to (i-1). For each m, the term is DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]). Let's denote the max as M(m).\n\nAs m decreases, M(m) increases. However, DP[m][j-1] could be increasing or decreasing. So the total could be anything. So it's unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each i and j, can we find a way to compute the best m in O(1) time?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider that for each j, the DP[i][j] can be computed using the previous j-1 layer.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: For the DP[i][j], the maximum for the j-th day is the maximum of the last segment. Since the last segment starts at m+1 and ends at i. So for a fixed i and j, when m varies, the max is the maximum of a[m+1..i]. But for the same i, if we can track the maximums for different ranges.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of for a fixed i and varying m. For each m in [j-1, i-1], the max from m+1 to i. Let's call this value as max_m. Now, for each i, we can precompute the max for ranges ending at i.\n\nFor example, for each position m, the max from m+1 to i is the same as the max from m+1 to i-1 and a[i]. So we can precompute this for all m.\n\nBut again, this seems to require O(n) time per i and j.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's try to find for each j, the DP[i][j] can be computed in O(n) time. For example, using some sliding window or other technique.\n\nBut I don't see how.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's try to think of the problem in terms of the maximums. Since each day's profit is the maximum of its segment. For the optimal solution, the maximums of the segments are as large as possible. Therefore, perhaps the optimal strategy is to make sure that the largest elements are each in their own segment.\n\nBut how to do that when there are k segments.\n\nFor example, if there are k elements that are the top k elements in the array, then splitting the array such that each of these elements is in their own segment. But the order matters.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem as follows. The total profit is the sum of the max of each segment. Since the segments are contiguous and cover the entire array, the sum is the sum of the maximums of the segments. So, for example, if there is a very large element, say, the maximum of the entire array, it's optimal to have it in its own segment. Otherwise, the maximum of the segment that includes it will be that value, but if it's split into multiple segments, the maximums would be added multiple times. Wait, no. For example, if the maximum element is in a segment by itself, then it contributes once. If it's in a segment with other elements, it still contributes once. So splitting the maximum into its own segment doesn't help. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but if there are multiple large elements, perhaps we can have each of them in their own segments. For example, if there are two large elements, and we have two days, then splitting between them would allow both to be in their own segments, contributing their maxes. Whereas if they are in the same segment, only the maximum of the two would be added once. So in this case, splitting them into separate segments gives a higher sum.\n\nAh! This suggests that the optimal way is to select the k largest elements and split the array so that each of them is in their own segment. However, this depends on their positions. For example, if the k largest elements are not in positions that allow them to be in separate segments, then this approach isn't possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting k segments such that as many of the largest elements as possible are in their own segments.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThis seems like a greedy approach, but it's not clear how to apply it. For example, if we have to split into k segments, and we want to select the positions where the largest elements are, but ensuring that they are in different segments.\n\nBut how to find those positions.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the maximum total profit is the sum of the maximums of the segments. Each segment's maximum is at least the maximum of the elements in that segment. So to maximize the sum, we want to maximize the number of times high-value elements are counted as maximums in their respective segments.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to have as many high-value elements as possible be the maximum of their own segments.\n\nSo for example, the largest element must be in a segment by itself, because if it is in a segment with other elements, it will contribute its value once. But if it's split into its own segment, it's still contributing once. So no gain. Wait, but that's not helpful. So this line of thinking is not leading anywhere.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's look for an alternative way to model the DP. Maybe for each j, we can compute the DP[i][j] in O(n) time. For example, using some properties of the max function.\n\nLet me think again about the recurrence:\n\ndp[i][j] = max_{m} ( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) )\n\nLet me denote for a fixed j and i, the max from m+1 to i as M(m). Now, for each i, when we compute dp[i][j], we can think of varying m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nNow, for the same j, when i increases by 1, how can we reuse previous computations?\n\nLet me think about for j=2. For i=3, m can be 1 or 2. For i=4, m can be 1, 2, 3. For each m, the max from m+1 to i is the max of a[m+1..i]. But when i increases, the max for a[m+1..i] is either the previous max (for i-1) or a[i].\n\nSo, for each j, and for each i, we can compute the max for ranges ending at i.\n\nBut how to integrate this into the DP.\n\nLet me think for j=2. For each i, we can compute for all m from 1 to i-1, the value dp[m][1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut dp[m][1] is the max of the first m elements. So for j=2, dp[i][2] = max over m in [1..i-1] of (max(a[1..m]) + max(a[m+1..i])).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFor example, for each i, and for each possible m, we can compute the max of the second part. But how to find the best m.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can keep track of the current maximum of the second part as we iterate m from left to right.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each j, and for each i, we can compute the DP[i][j] by iterating m from j-1 to i-1, and for each m, we can keep track of the current maximum of a[m+1..i].\n\nBut for each i, when j is fixed, and we're processing i in order, perhaps we can compute the max for ranges ending at i as we go.\n\nFor example, for j=2, and for i from 2 to n:\n\nFor each i, we can iterate m from 1 to i-1. For each m, the max from m+1 to i is max( max from m+1 to i-1, a[i] ). So, if we can track this for each m.\n\nBut for this, during the iteration of m, we can keep track of the current maximum.\n\nLet me think. For a fixed i and j, as we iterate m from j-1 to i-1, the max from m+1 to i increases as m decreases. For example, m=1: the range is 2..i. m=2: 3..i. etc. So for each i, we can compute the max for each m in reverse order.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each i and j, we can compute the max for ranges [m+1, i] for m from j-1 to i-1. As we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, we can keep track of the current maximum. For example:\n\ncurrent_max = a[i]\n\nfor m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n\n    current_max = max(current_max, a[m+1])\n\n    dp[i][j] = max( dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max )\n\nThis way, for each i and j, we can compute the max for ranges ending at i in O(n) time.\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2 *k) to O(n^2 *k), but with a better constant factor. Wait, no. The time complexity remains O(n^2 *k), but for each i and j, the inner loop is O(n) time. So the total time is still O(n^2 *k). But this is the same as before. However, perhaps with this optimization, it's manageable for n=2000 and k=2000?\n\nLet's calculate. For n=2000 and k=2000, the total operations would be 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e10. Which is way too big for Python. Even if each operation is simple, it's impossible to run in the time limit.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Need another Idea.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider that for each j, the value of j is up to k. However, for j > n, it's impossible. But since k ≤ n, it's okay. But how else?\n\nWait, what is the maximum possible value of k? It's n. So for each j from 1 to k, we need to compute the DP.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP for certain values of j.\n\nFor example, for j=1, the answer is the max of the entire array.\n\nFor j=2, the answer is the maximum over all possible splits into two parts, where the first part is m elements (from 1 to m), and the second part is from m+1 to n. The profit is max( first part ) + max( second part ). So for j=2, we can compute this in O(n) time by checking for each m from 1 to n-1.\n\nSimilarly, for j=3, the answer is the maximum over all splits into three parts. But how?\n\nBut again, for general j, this seems to lead back to the same O(n^2 *k) time.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the fact that when k is large, the number of days is close to n. So for example, if k = n, then each day has one problem, and the sum is the sum of all elements. For k = n-1, we need to split into n-1 days, which means one day has two problems and others have one. The optimal way is to merge the two smallest elements into one day, thus adding their max instead of their sum. Wait, but merging two adjacent elements into one day would replace their sum (when k = n) with the max of the two. So the difference is (sum of the two) - max of the two = min of the two. So to minimize the loss, we should merge the two elements with the smallest min, i.e., the two elements with the smallest values. But this seems like a greedy approach for k = n-1.\n\nBut how to generalize this for arbitrary k.\n\nThis suggests that for k = n - t, where t is small, we can find the optimal way by merging t times the best possible pairs. But this is not straightforward.\n\nHowever, this line of thinking may lead us to a way to compute the DP for certain values of k efficiently, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the DP recurrence again. For dp[i][j], it's the maximum over m of dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nNow, notice that the max(a[m+1..i]) can be rewritten as the maximum between the max(a[m+1..i-1]) and a[i]. So for each i, and j, we can compute this max incrementally.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nLet's think for each j, and for each i, we can compute the max for ranges ending at i. Let's say that for each j, and i, we have a variable current_max that tracks the max from m+1 to i. As we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, we can update current_max as max(current_max, a[m+1]).\n\nBut this is what I thought earlier, and it doesn't change the time complexity.\n\nAnother Idea: What if we precompute for all possible i and j, the max of a[m+1..i] for m in some range. But I don't see how.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem from the perspective of the last day. The last day has some number of problems, say l, and the rest of the days are split into j-1 days for the first i-l problems. So, for each possible l (from 1 to i - (j-1)), we can compute the max of the last l problems, and add it to dp[i-l][j-1].\n\nBut this is the same as the original recurrence. Again, leading to O(n^2 *k) time.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to implement the initial DP approach with optimizations, and see if it passes within the time constraints.\n\nBut for n=2000, the O(n^2 *k) is 8e10 operations. That's way too slow. So what's the alternative?\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to find that for j ≥ 2, the value of dp[i][j] can be computed using some properties. For example, when j increases by 1, what changes?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem for small k. For example, if k is small, like up to 10, then the O(n^2 *k) approach would be feasible. But for larger k, it's not.\n\nBut given that the problem allows for n up to 2000 and k up to 2000, this suggests that there's a better approach.\n\nLet me think about the following: since the segments are contiguous and must start from the beginning, perhaps the maximum for the j-th day is the maximum of the last segment. So for the optimal solution, the last segment's maximum is the maximum of some suffix of the array.\n\nBut how to use that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: for each day, the maximum of that day's segment must be one of the elements in the array. So, the total profit is the sum of these maxima.\n\nBut how to select the segments to maximize this sum.\n\nLet me think of it as selecting k elements, each being the maximum of their respective segment, and ensuring that the segments are contiguous and cover the entire array.\n\nBut how to choose these elements.\n\nFor example, if we select the k largest elements in the array, and arrange the segments so that each of them is the maximum of their segment, then the sum would be the sum of these k elements. But how to ensure that they are in separate segments.\n\nBut this is possible only if the k largest elements are not overlapping in their positions. For example, if the array is [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], the three largest elements are 9, 6, 5. But the 5 is in the first segment. So splitting into [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2] gives maxima 5,6,9. Which sums to 20.\n\nBut if the largest elements are in positions that allow them to be in separate segments, then this approach is optimal.\n\nBut how to find such positions.\n\nThis suggests that the optimal total profit is the sum of the k largest elements, but only if they can be arranged into separate segments. However, this may not always be possible. For example, if the array is [3, 1, 2, 4], and k=2. The two largest elements are 4 and 3. They are not in the same segment. So the optimal split is [3,1,2], [4], sum 3+4=7. Or [3], [1,2,4], sum 3+4=7. But if the array was [3, 4, 2, 1], then the two largest are 4 and 3. To split into two segments, you have to split after the first element, giving [3], [4,2,1], sum 3+4=7, or after the second element, [3,4], [2,1], sum 4+2=6. So the best is 7, which is the sum of the two largest elements.\n\nBut what if the array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and k=3. The three largest elements are 5,4,3. Can we split into [5], [4], [3,2,1], sum 5+4+3=12. Which is indeed the maximum possible.\n\nSo it seems that this approach may work. The maximum possible sum is the sum of the k largest elements in the array, provided that we can split the array into k segments such that each of those k largest elements is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to determine if this is possible.\n\nWell, the k largest elements must appear in the array in such a way that there are at least k-1 elements between them to allow splitting. For example, if the k largest elements are all in a single segment, then it's impossible to split them into separate segments. But this depends on their positions.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nThis seems complex. However, perhaps the optimal sum is indeed the sum of the k largest elements, and the way to achieve it is to split the array into segments such that each of the k largest elements is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nFor example, in the third sample input: [1, 2000, 2000, 2], k=2. The two largest elements are 2000 and 2000. Splitting into [1, 2000], [2000, 2] gives sum 2000 + 2000 = 4000, which is correct.\n\nIn this case, the two largest elements are adjacent. So the split must include them in separate segments. This is possible by splitting after the first 2000.\n\nSo the approach is to select the k largest elements, and split the array such that each of them is in its own segment. But how to do this.\n\nBut how to find this split.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be reduced to selecting the k largest elements and finding a way to split the array into k segments, each containing one of these elements.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut how to find the positions of these elements.\n\nFor example, let's say we have the array sorted in descending order. We take the first k elements. Then, we need to split the array such that each of these elements is in a separate segment.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nFor example, the positions of these elements must be such that there are enough elements between them to allow splitting. For instance, if the positions of the k largest elements are p_1, p_2, ..., p_k, then we need to split the array such that each segment contains exactly one of these positions, and the segments are ordered.\n\nSo, the first segment ends at or before p_1, the second segment starts after p_1 and ends at or before p_2, etc.\n\nBut how to choose the splits.\n\nThis sounds like a greedy approach. For example, we can select the positions of the k largest elements, and then split the array such that each of these elements is in its own segment.\n\nBut how to find these positions.\n\nLet's think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Find the positions of the k largest elements in the array. Note that there may be duplicates.\n\n- Sort these positions in increasing order.\n\n- Split the array into k segments such that each segment contains one of these positions, and the segments are contiguous.\n\nFor example, if the positions are sorted as p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_k, then the first segment ends at p_1, the second segment starts at p_1+1 and ends at p_2, and so on.\n\nThis would ensure that each of these elements is in its own segment, and thus contribute their value to the sum.\n\nBut what if there are multiple elements with the same value, like in the third example?\n\nIn the third example, the two largest elements are at positions 2 and 3 (assuming 1-based indexing). So the split would be after position 2 (first segment has 2 elements), and the second segment has the remaining 2 elements. This gives the correct result.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the k largest elements are not in distinct positions.\n\nBut this approach may not work for all cases. For example, consider the array [5, 4, 6, 3, 7], and k=2. The two largest elements are 7 and 6. Their positions are 5 and 3. So sorted positions are 3 and 5. So the first segment ends at 3 (contains 6), the second segment starts at 4 and ends at 5 (contains 7). The sum is 6 +7 =13. However, the optimal split would be [5,4,6,3,7] split into [5,4,6,3] and [7], which gives max 6 +7 =13. Or split into [5,4,6] and [3,7], which gives 6+7=13. Same result. So it works.\n\nAnother example: array [3, 1, 2, 4], k=2. The two largest elements are 4 and 3. Positions 4 and 1. Sorted positions are 1 and 4. So the first segment ends at 1, the second starts at 2 and ends at 4. The sum is 3 +4=7, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Select the k largest elements in the array.\n\n2. Find their positions.\n\n3. Split the array into k segments such that each segment contains exactly one of these elements, and the segments are contiguous.\n\nBut how to select the k largest elements when there are duplicates.\n\nFor example, if the array has multiple elements with the same value, we need to choose the ones that allow for the best splits.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWell, perhaps we can select the k largest values, and then select their positions in a way that allows for the splits.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's think of the following steps:\n\n- Create a list of the elements and their indices.\n\n- Sort this list in descending order of value, and then by index ascending (to handle duplicates).\n\n- Take the first k elements from this list. These are the k largest values.\n\n- Extract their indices, and sort them in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute `n` problems into exactly `k` days such that the total profit, defined as the sum of the maximum difficulty of problems solved each day, is maximized.
