    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. The output is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and see which ones appear more than once. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer.\n\nThe maximum possible L is floor(n/2), because if the string is of length n, then a substring longer than n/2 can't occur twice. Wait, for example, if the string is length 5, then the maximum possible L is 2, since two substrings of length 3 would require at least 3*2 -1 =5 characters (if overlapping). Wait, but maybe even longer? Like for 'aaaaa', the substring of length 3 'aaa' occurs multiple times. So for a string of length n, the maximum possible L is n-1. For example, if the string is 'aa', then the maximum L is 1. So maybe the maximum possible L is n-1. But for the problem, we need to check all possible lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over possible lengths L from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1. For each L, check all possible substrings of that length. For each substring, check if it appears at least two times. If any such substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nIf no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nSo for each L starting from the largest possible, check all substrings of length L. For each substring, check if it occurs again elsewhere in the string.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if a substring occurs at least twice?\n\nFor example, for a given L, generate all substrings of length L, and track their counts. If any count is >=2, then return L.\n\nBut for each L, the number of possible substrings is O(n) (for each starting index, up to n-L+1). For each of those, we can collect them in a dictionary and check their counts.\n\nBut since the string is up to 100 characters, even checking all possibilities for all L would be acceptable.\n\nSo let's think about the steps in code:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n\n   for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in seen:\n\n           return L as the answer.\n\n       else:\n\n           seen.add(substr)\n\n   if any substr was found, then return L.\n\nWait, but this approach would check for each L, and for each substring, if it's already been seen. So once a duplicate is found for that L, we can immediately return L as the maximum possible.\n\nBut wait, for example, if there are multiple substrings of length L, but only one of them occurs twice. Then the first occurrence of that substring would be added to the set, and the second occurrence would trigger the check.\n\nBut the code needs to check all possible substrings of length L. For example, if the first substring is unique, but the second is a duplicate of another substring. So, for each L, we need to check all possible substrings and see if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nSo perhaps for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least two times.\n\nSo for each L, we can create a frequency dictionary. Then, for each substring in that frequency dict, check if its count is >=2. If yes, return L.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the first approach (using a set) is better. Because once we find a substring that has already been seen, then we can return L immediately.\n\nWait, but for example, in the case where the same substring appears multiple times. For example, in 'aaaaa', for L=2, the first occurrence is 'aa', then the next occurrence is also 'aa', so when we check the second occurrence, we can detect that it's already in the set, and return L=2.\n\nSo for each L, the code would loop through all the substrings of that length. For each substring, check if it's already in the set. If yes, then return L. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nBut this approach would miss cases where a substring appears more than once, but not in consecutive positions. For example, if the first occurrence is at position 0, then another at position 2. But during the loop, when processing the first occurrence, it's added to the set. When processing the second occurrence, it's in the set, so we return L. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the same substring appears three times? Well, the first time it's added to the set, then the second time, it's found in the set, and returns L. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code for each L would be:\n\nfor L in range (from max possible down to 1):\n\n   create a set.\n\n   for i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in the set: return L\n\n       else add to the set.\n\n   if after checking all substrings, no duplicates found, proceed to next L.\n\nIf after checking all L, nothing found, return 0.\n\nThis seems correct. Let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\n\nCheck for L=3 (since len(s) is 4, len-1 is 3). For L=3, possible substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. None are duplicates. Then L=2: substrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. No duplicates. L=1: substrings 'a','b','c','d' — all unique. So output is 0. Which matches sample.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' — len is 5. Max L is 4. Check for L=4: substrings are 'abab' and 'baba'. No duplicates. Then L=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. When processing the third substring (i=2, substr 'aba'), check if it's in the set. The first occurrence was at i=0, so yes. So return 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' — len is 3. Max L is 2. For L=2, substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). The second occurrence is found, so return 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about overlapping occurrences?\n\nLike 'aaaaa' — for L=3, substrings are 'aaa' (positions 0-2), then 1-3, 2-4. So when processing i=1, the substring is 'aaa' which is already in the set (from i=0). So returns 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'abab' — len is 4. For L=2: substrings 'ab', 'ba', 'ab'. So when processing the third substring (i=2), 'ab' is already in the set. So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle overlapping occurrences.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nRead the input string. Let's say the input is read via input().strip().\n\nThen, n = len(s).\n\nThen, for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n\n   for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in seen:\n\n           print(L)\n\n           exit\n\n       else:\n\n           seen.add(substr)\n\nIf after checking all L, nothing is found, print 0.\n\nSo the code would look like this.\n\nNow, what about the edge cases?\n\nCase when the string is of length 1. Then, the output is 0.\n\nAnother case: string of length 2. If the two characters are same, then output is 1. Else 0.\n\nFor example, input 'aa' → output 1.\n\nYes. Because for L=1, the substrings are 'a' and 'a'. The second occurrence is found.\n\nAnother example: 'ab' → output 0.\n\nSo the code handles these.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, the example input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but the actual input is a single string. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So the input is a single string. However, in the example input, it's given as a list. But perhaps that's just part of the example formatting. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe user says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed... etc.\n\nBut in the example, the input is written as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and output as ['0', '3', '2']. Oh, perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases. Wait, but the original problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code needs to process one string per input.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is not properly formatted. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So the code should read one string from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list of strings. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the example is showing that for the inputs \"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\", the outputs are 0,3,2. So the code needs to process each input string separately.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the example is not correctly formatted, and the actual code needs to read a single string.\n\nBut the user says that the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo the code should read a single string from stdin.\n\nBut in the example input, it's given as a list of strings. But perhaps that's a mistake. For example, maybe the example is showing that for the input strings 'abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz', the outputs are 0, 3, 2. So the code should process each input string separately. But that would imply that the code reads multiple lines, but the problem says that the first input line contains the string.\n\nSo perhaps the example is wrong. But given that the user provided that example, perhaps the actual code should read a single string, and the example input is a list of test cases. However, the user says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nBut perhaps the example is not part of the actual input. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that the input is a single string. So the code should read one line from stdin, process it, and output the answer. The sample input shows that for the input 'abcd', the output is 0. For 'ababa', output is 3. For 'zzz', output is 2.\n\nBut in the example input, the input is given as a list. But perhaps that's just an example of multiple test cases. However, the actual code must read a single string. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But for the code, the code must read a single string.\n\nTherefore, the code will read the input string as input().strip().\n\nSo, the code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function is not the best way. Perhaps using return, but since it's a script, perhaps using sys.exit() or breaking out of loops.\n\nBut in code, the code can be written as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            sys.exit(0)\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut wait, for the case when the string is of length 1, n-1 is 0, and the for loop runs from 0 down to 0, but the range is range(0, 0, -1), which is empty. So the code proceeds to print 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: for 'aa', len is 2. So L starts at 1. For L=1, the substrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). When processing i=1, substr is 'a' which is in seen (added when i=0). So prints 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where a substring appears more than once, but not in the first occurrence?\n\nLike 'abba' — for L=2. The substrings are 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. So no duplicates. But for L=1, the substrings are 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'. So when processing the third substring (i=1, 'b') — already in the set (added at i=1?), no. Let me think:\n\nWait for L=1, the loop is for i in 0 to 3 (n-L+1 is 4-1+1=4? Wait n is 4, L is 1. So n - L + 1 is 4-1+1=4. So i ranges from 0 to 3 inclusive.\n\nFor i=0: substr is 'a' → added.\n\ni=1: 'b' → added.\n\ni=2: 'b' → check if in seen. 'b' is in the set (from i=1). So returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would return 1 for 'abba'.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears multiple times, but the first occurrence is not the first in the loop? Like 'aabbaa' — for L=2, the substrings are 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. So when processing the first 'aa' (i=0), added to the set. Then when processing i=4, substr 'aa' is found in the set. So returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code is as above. Now, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin, and outputting the answer.\n\nBut the code uses sys.exit, which is okay. But perhaps the code can be written with flags.\n\nBut the code as written should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → output 0.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → output 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → output 2.\n\nLet's test for 'zzz' (length 3). For L=2:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 1 (3-2+1=2). So i=0, substr 'zz'; i=1, substr 'zz'. When i=1, substr is in seen (added at i=0), so returns 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → for L=4, substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which adds complexity to the solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Constraints**: The input string can be up to 100 characters long. This allows us to use a brute-force approach efficiently.\n2. **Check Substrings of Decreasing Lengths**: Start from the longest possible substring length (which is `len(s) - 1`) and decrease down to 1. For each length, check if there exists any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n3. **Use a Set for Tracking Substrings**: For each length, iterate through all possible substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is found again, return its length immediately as the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            sys.exit(0)\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Starting from the maximum possible length (`n-1`) down to 1, we check each possible substring length.\n3. **Track Seen Substrings**: For each length, we use a set to keep track of substrings we have encountered. If a substring is found again in the set, it means it has appeared at least twice, and we immediately print the length and exit.\n4. **Edge Cases**: If no such substring is found for any length, the loop completes and we print 0, indicating no valid substrings were found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the longest valid substring efficiently by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and early termination upon finding a valid substring.",
