Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. Each takes turns, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. And we have to find the sequence of moves (H for Homer, M for Marge) that gives the maximum total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the game works. Let's think: The initial number A has 2n digits. On each turn, the current player takes the leftmost digit and appends it to their own number. Then that digit is removed from A. The players alternate turns, but the order of who goes first isn't fixed. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that before each turn, they decide who will make the next move. But the problem says that each player must make exactly n moves. So the sequence of moves is a string of 2n characters, with exactly n H's and n M's. But the order depends on their choices.\n\nThe challenge is to choose the order of H and M such that the sum of S1 and S2 is maximized. But how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the total sum. Since each digit is added to either S1 or S2, the total sum would be the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective positions in their numbers. Wait, no. Wait, the actual value of S1 and S2 depends on the order of digits. For example, if Homer takes digits in order d1, d2, ..., dn, then his number is d1 followed by d2, etc., which is d1*10^{n-1} + d2*10^{n-2} + ... + dn * 10^0. Similarly for Marge.\n\nBut adding S1 and S2 together would be the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective place values. However, since the digits are taken in order, the position in which a digit is taken affects its contribution to the total sum.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because the choice of who takes which digit affects the total sum. For example, taking a higher digit earlier gives a higher place value, which contributes more to the total.\n\nBut since both players are trying to maximize their own total, but the problem says that the total sum of both is to be maximized. Wait, but the problem states that Homer and Marge want to maximize their total prize. So the total is S1 + S2. So regardless of how they split the digits between them, the total sum is fixed? No, because the digits are in different positions. Wait, no. Wait, the total sum of S1 and S2 depends on the order of digits taken. For example, suppose A is \"12\", n=1. If Homer takes 1 first, then Marge takes 2. Then S1 is 1, S2 is 2. Sum is 3. Alternatively, if Marge takes 1 first, then Homer takes 2. Sum is 2+1=3. Same total. Wait, so maybe the total sum is fixed? Because all digits are used once, and each digit contributes to the total sum based on its position in the respective player's number. However, the place value depends on when the digit was taken. For example, if a digit is taken earlier, it contributes more to the total sum. But since each digit is in exactly one of the two numbers, and the sum of the digits' contributions is determined by their position in their respective numbers.\n\nWait, but the sum of S1 and S2 is equal to the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective place values. Let's think of it as each digit contributes to the total sum based on the position in which it was taken. For instance, the first digit taken (regardless of who takes it) contributes 10^{n-1} to the total sum. Because if it's taken by Homer, then it's part of his number's first digit (which is multiplied by 10^{n-1}), and if taken by Marge, same thing. Similarly, the second digit taken contributes 10^{n-2} to the total, etc. Because the position of the digit in the player's number depends on when it was taken. For example, the k-th digit taken (for k from 1 to 2n) contributes 10^{(2n -k)} ? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nEach player's number has exactly n digits. The first digit they take becomes the first digit (most significant) of their number. The second digit they take becomes the second digit, etc. So for a given digit, if it's the i-th digit taken by a player, then its contribution is digit * 10^{n - i} (assuming that the player's number has n digits). But the problem is that the order in which digits are taken by each player depends on the sequence of moves.\n\nBut here's the key insight: the total sum S1 + S2 is the sum over all digits of (digit * 10^{position_in_their_number} ), where position_in_their_number depends on when the digit was taken by that player. However, since the players alternate taking digits, the position in their own number depends on how many times they have taken digits before.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this. Let's think: for each digit, when it is taken, it's the m-th digit taken by the player (either Homer or Marge). The contribution of that digit to the total is digit * 10^{(n - m)}. But since the total sum is the sum over all digits, each multiplied by their respective 10^{...} based on when they were taken by their respective player.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because the choice of which player takes which digit affects the exponent. For example, taking a digit early in the game (say, first move) gives it a higher exponent (like 10^{n-1} if it's the first digit taken by that player), but if that digit is taken later, it would contribute less.\n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing the order of taking digits (H or M) such that the sum of the digits multiplied by their respective exponents is maximized.\n\nBut how to compute this? For example, for each step, when choosing whether to take H or M, we need to know how many times each has already taken digits, and thus what exponent the next digit would contribute to.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 18, the total number of steps is 36. The state space would involve the number of H's and M's taken so far, and the current position in the string A. For example, the state could be (h_count, m_count, pos), where h_count is the number of digits Homer has taken so far, m_count is for Marge, and pos is the current position in A (the remaining digits). However, since the original A is being processed, and each step removes the first digit, the pos can be tracked as the index of the current first digit.\n\nWait, but the original A is a string of 2n digits. Each time, the leftmost digit is taken. So the order of the digits is fixed. For example, if the original A is \"abcd\", then the first move takes 'a', then the next move takes 'b', etc. So the sequence of digits being taken is fixed, but the decision is which player takes which digit at each step.\n\nTherefore, the state for dynamic programming can be (h_count, m_count, pos), but since the pos is determined by the number of steps taken so far. Because the first step takes the first digit, then the second step takes the second digit, etc. So the current position is equal to the number of steps taken so far. Wait, yes. Because the initial A has 2n digits. After k steps, the next digit to take is the (k+1)-th digit of the original A. So the position is fixed as the number of steps taken so far. Therefore, the state can be represented by the number of H's and M's taken so far. Because the number of steps taken is h_count + m_count. So the next digit is the (h_count + m_count + 1)-th digit of the original A.\n\nSo the DP state can be (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken so far, and m is the number of digits Marge has taken so far. The total steps taken is h + m. The next digit to take is the (h + m + 1)th digit. At each state, we can choose to take H or M (if possible, i.e., h < n or m < n).\n\nThe key is to compute the maximum total sum that can be achieved from this state onwards. For each state (h, m), we can compute the maximum sum possible. Then, the transitions would be:\n\nIf we choose H (if h < n):\n\n- The current digit is A[h + m], because the next digit is the (h + m + 1)th (since indexes start at 0?), wait depends on how we parse the input. Let's say the input is a string A of length 2n. For example, for the first step, h=0, m=0, the next digit is A[0]. Then, after taking that, the next step is h + m = 1, so the next digit is A[1], etc. So the digit to take is A[h + m].\n\nThen, when Homer takes it, it's his (h+1)th digit. So the contribution of this digit to the total sum is digit * 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nSimilarly, if Marge takes it, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - (m+1)}.\n\nSo the DP recurrence would be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max( (digit * 10^{n - (h+1)} ) + dp[h+1][m], (digit * 10^{n - (m+1)} ) + dp[h][m+1] )\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the maximum h and m can be up to 18. So the total number of states is (18+1)*(18+1) = 361, which is manageable. And for each state, we can compute the maximum sum.\n\nBut how do we handle the memoization? Well, we can use memoization with recursion or iterative DP.\n\nMoreover, we need to track not only the maximum sum but also the path (the sequence of H and M) that leads to that sum. So for each state, we need to remember which choice (H or M) leads to the maximum sum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the digits of A as a list.\n\n- Precompute the powers of 10 up to n, since for each step, the exponent is (n - (h+1)) or (n - (m+1)).\n\nWait, for example, when Homer takes the digit for the first time (h=0), the exponent is n - 1 (since h+1 is 1). For his second digit, exponent is n - 2, etc.\n\nBut for each digit, the contribution depends on the player taking it and how many times they've taken digits before.\n\nSo for the DP approach, we can proceed as follows.\n\nWe can create a memoization table (using memoization or a 2D array) for the maximum total sum from state (h, m). Also, a separate table to track the choice made at each state (whether to take H or M).\n\nThe base case is when h == n and m == n. Then, the sum is zero (no more digits to take). But since h + m = 2n, which is the total steps. So that's the end.\n\nFor other states:\n\nIf h < n and m < n, then we can choose H or M.\n\nIf h < n but m == n, then we have to choose H.\n\nIf m < n but h == n, then we have to choose M.\n\nSo for each state (h, m), we can check the possible choices.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the maximum total sum. Once we have that, we can backtrack through the choices to build the sequence of H and M.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, precompute the digits. Let's read the input as a string, then convert into a list of integers. For example, for input '1234', digits would be [1,2,3,4].\n\nThen, precompute the powers of 10. For example, for n=2, the exponents can be 10^1, 10^0, etc. But since the maximum n is 18, we can precompute 10^i for i from 0 to 18.\n\nWait, but for a given h and m, when the current digit is taken by H, the exponent is (n - (h + 1)). Because h is the number of digits Homer has already taken. So when he takes another digit, it's his (h+1)th digit, so the exponent is (n - (h+1)).\n\nSo for example, if n is 2, and h is 0, then the exponent is 2 - 1 = 1 (so 10^1). For h=1, the exponent is 2 - 2 = 0 (so 10^0). That makes sense.\n\nSo for each state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m], and the value of that digit is digit = int(A_str[h + m]).\n\nSo, for the DP, the recurrence is:\n\nif h == n and m == n:\n    return 0\nelse:\n    if h < n and m < n:\n        option1 = digit * 10^{n - (h+1)} + dp(h+1, m)\n        option2 = digit * 10^{n - (m+1)} + dp(h, m+1)\n        choose the max between option1 and option2.\n    elif h < n:\n        must choose H, so option is digit * 10^{n - (h+1)} + dp(h+1, m)\n    else:\n        must choose M, so option is digit * 10^{n - (m+1)} + dp(h, m+1)\n\nBut for memoization, we can use memoization via a memo table.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the maximum h and m are 18, so the memo table can be a 2D array of size 19x19.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this DP with memoization, and then backtrack to find the path.\n\nBut how to handle the memoization in Python? We can use lru_cache with memoization, but since n can be up to 18, the parameters h and m are small, so it's manageable.\n\nBut for Python, using recursion with memoization may be feasible. However, for the purposes of code writing, perhaps an iterative DP approach is easier.\n\nAlternatively, we can write a memoization function with recursion.\n\nBut let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and A. Then, precompute the digits as a list.\n\nThen, we need to compute the maximum sum and the path.\n\nSo, for the DP, we can use memoization with a function that returns the maximum sum and the choice made (H or M) for each state.\n\nBut since we need to track the path, perhaps during the DP, we can track the best choice for each state, and then backtrack from (0, 0) to (n, n), building the sequence.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nImplement a DP table for maximum sum, and a choice table that for each state (h, m) tells whether to choose H or M.\n\nLet's think of the DP as a memoization table. For each (h, m), compute the maximum sum.\n\nLet's think of the code:\n\ndigits = list of integers of A.\n\nn is given.\n\nprecompute pow10 = [10**i for i in range(0, n+1)] ?\n\nWait, for exponents up to n. Because for example, when a player takes their first digit, the exponent is n-1. So for n=18, the exponents can be up to 17.\n\nBut perhaps for each h and m, when the current digit is taken by H, the exponent is (n - (h + 1)), which can be from (n - 1) down to 0.\n\nSo, for example, for a given h, the exponent is (n - (h + 1)) = (n - h - 1). So for h=0, exponent is n-1, which is 17 for n=18. So we need to compute 10^k for k from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut in code, we can compute 10 ** (n - h - 1) on the fly, but that may be slow. Alternatively, precompute a list of powers.\n\nBut for n up to 18, 10^18 is manageable as a number, even though it's big. However, in Python, that's okay.\n\nSo, proceeding.\n\nImplementing the DP:\n\nWe can use memoization with recursion. Let's think of a function that returns the maximum sum for (h, m) state.\n\nBut for memoization, perhaps using memoization via a dictionary or a 2D array.\n\nBut in code, perhaps using memoization with lru_cache.\n\nBut since the parameters h and m are integers, and n is fixed, we can proceed.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, we can use functools.lru_cache.\n\nBut for the code, let's think of writing a recursive function with memoization.\n\nBut for the code, here's the plan:\n\nRead n and A.\n\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nprecompute pow10 as needed.\n\nBut during the DP steps, for each (h, m), the current digit is digits[h + m].\n\nNow, the DP function:\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if h == n and m == n:\n        return 0\n\n    if memo[h][m] is not None:\n        return memo[h][m]\n\n    current_digit = digits[h + m]\n\n    if h < n and m < n:\n        # choose H or M\n        option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n        option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n        res = max(option_h, option_m)\n        memo[h][m] = res\n        # also track which choice was better\n        choice_table[h][m] = 'H' if option_h >= option_m else 'M'\n    elif h < n:\n        # must choose H\n        res = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n        memo[h][m] = res\n        choice_table[h][m] = 'H'\n    else:\n        # must choose M\n        res = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n        memo[h][m] = res\n        choice_table[h][m] = 'M'\n\n    return res\n\nBut then, the memo can be a 2D array. However, for Python, using memoization with lru_cache is easier.\n\nBut for the choice_table, we need to track for each (h, m) whether the optimal choice is H or M.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can have a separate 2D array for the choices.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps using memoization with recursion and then backtracking.\n\nBut for n up to 18, the maximum number of states is 19*19 = 361, which is very manageable.\n\nSo, let's proceed with implementing the DP with memoization.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, we can backtrack from (h=0, m=0) to (h=n, m=n), following the choice_table.\n\nNow, the problem is that for some states, the choice could be H or M (when both options are equal). In such cases, the problem allows any of the possible sequences. So, during the choice, we can choose either.\n\nBut how to handle that in the code? For example, when option_h equals option_m, we can choose 'H' or 'M' as per the code's logic.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate the correct sequence.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet's outline the code steps:\n\nRead n and A.\n\ndigits = list of integers of A.\n\nInitialize memo as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with -1 or None.\n\nInitialize choice_table as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with empty strings.\n\nThen perform the DP.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps using memoization via lru_cache for the DP function. However, since the choice_table is needed for backtracking, perhaps the DP function can be written recursively with memoization, and during the DP computation, the choice_table is filled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nImplement a memoization-based DP function that returns the maximum sum for (h, m), and during the process, fill the choice_table.\n\nBut how to do that? Maybe the code can have a helper function that returns the maximum sum, and during that calculation, the choice_table is filled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can compute the DP using memoization, and then backtrack using the choice_table.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps using memoization with lru_cache for the DP function, and then a separate backtracking step.\n\nBut in that case, the choice_table can't be generated. So perhaps the DP function must also track the choice made for each state.\n\nAlternatively, during the backtracking phase, for each state (h, m), we can determine which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum, and then proceed accordingly.\n\nBut for that, we need to recompute the options for each state. Which would be O(1) per state, but during backtracking, which is O(2n) steps.\n\nSo, during backtracking, for each state (h, m), we can compute the current digit, and compare the options of choosing H or M (if possible), and choose the one that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for each option? Well, the DP function would have already computed the maximum sum for each state. So during backtracking, for a given (h, m), the choice is determined by comparing the value of choosing H and M.\n\nBut how to compute the value of choosing H and M? Because for each choice, the sum is current_digit * ... plus the DP value of the next state.\n\nBut during backtracking, the DP values are already known. So for each (h, m), the current digit is known. The value of choosing H is current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp(h+1, m). Similarly for M.\n\nSo during backtracking, for each (h, m), we can compute these two options and choose the one that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut since the DP table is filled, this is possible.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCompute the DP table using memoization, then backtrack from (0, 0) to (n, n), choosing at each step the optimal choice.\n\nBut how to compute the DP table?\n\nIn Python, for memoization, perhaps using a memoization decorator.\n\nLet me try to outline the code.\n\nFirst, read input:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\n\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nThen, memoize the DP function.\n\nBut since Python functions can't have mutable default parameters, perhaps using memoization with lru_cache.\n\nBut for that, the function can be written as:\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h == n and m == n:\n        return 0\n    current_pos = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n    if h < n and m < n:\n        option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n        option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n        return max(option_h, option_m)\n    elif h < n:\n        return current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n    else:\n        return current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\nBut wait, this is a recursive function. However, for large exponents, like 10^17, it's possible that the numbers are very big. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's acceptable.\n\nBut for n=18, 10^17 is manageable.\n\nBut then, once the DP is computed, how to backtrack the path?\n\nThe problem is that the DP function returns the maximum sum, but we need to know the path. So during backtracking, for each state (h, m), we have to decide whether to choose H or M.\n\nSo, during backtracking, starting from (0, 0), we can check for each possible choice (H or M, if allowed) and see which one gives the maximum sum. But since the DP function has already computed the maximum sum for each state, we can compare the options.\n\nSo for backtracking:\n\nresult = []\nh = 0\nm = 0\nwhile h + m < 2*n:\n    current_pos = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n    if h < n and m < n:\n        option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n        option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n        if option_h >= option_m:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    elif h < n:\n        result.append('H')\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        result.append('M')\n        m += 1\n\nOnce this loop completes, the result list contains the sequence of H and M.\n\nBut this approach requires that during backtracking, we re-calculate the options, which may be computationally feasible since it's O(2n) steps and for each step, the calculation is O(1).\n\nBut wait, the DP function is already memoized, so the calls to dp(h+1, m) and dp(h, m+1) during backtracking would be computed quickly.\n\nBut in this code, during backtracking, the code is recomputing the option_h and option_m, which is redundant with the DP function. However, since the DP function has already computed all possible states, this should be okay.\n\nBut this approach may work. Let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234\n\ndigits = [1,2,3,4]\n\nLet's see what the code would do.\n\nThe DP function for (0, 0) would compute the max between:\n\noption_h: 1 * 10^(2-0-1) + dp(1,0) → 1 * 10^1 + dp(1,0) = 10 + ... ?\n\nBut let's not compute manually. Let's think about the sample output.\n\nSample Output for first input is 'HHMM'.\n\nWhich means the sequence is H, H, M, M.\n\nSo the digits taken are:\n\nH takes 1 (first digit), then H takes 2 (second digit), then M takes 3 (third), then M takes 4 (fourth).\n\nS1 is 12, S2 is 34. Total sum is 12 + 34 = 46.\n\nAnother possible sequence is HMHM. Let's see:\n\nH takes 1, then M takes 2, then H takes 3, then M takes 4. S1 is 13, S2 is 24. Sum is 37, which is less than 46. So the first option is better.\n\nSo the code should choose the option that gives the maximum sum.\n\nNow, during backtracking, for each step, the code chooses the option that gives the maximum sum.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case where two options give the same sum? For example, when option_h equals option_m. The code would choose H in that case.\n\nNow, the problem says that if there are multiple solutions, output any of them. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for backtracking would generate the correct sequence.\n\nBut the code for backtracking is part of the Python script. However, the problem is that in Python, the DP function is memoized, but when we call dp(h, m) during backtracking, it's already computed. So the code for backtracking is okay.\n\nBut let's think about the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code for backtracking would need to call the dp function again. However, during the backtracking phase, the dp function is already memoized, so the calls are quick.\n\nBut the problem is that the code for backtracking is not part of the DP function. So, the code for backtracking would be written as follows.\n\nOnce the DP function is defined, then:\n\nh = 0\nm = 0\nres = []\nwhile h + m < 2 * n:\n    current_pos = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n    if h < n and m < n:\n        option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h+1, m)\n        option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m+1)\n        if option_h >= option_m:\n            res.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            res.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    elif h < n:\n        res.append('H')\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        res.append('M')\n        m += 1\n\nThen, the res is the sequence.\n\nBut what about the order of the steps? For example, the first step is h=0, m=0. The code appends 'H' or 'M' to res, and increments h or m accordingly.\n\nOnce the loop ends, the res has 2n characters, which is the required sequence.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. However, there's a problem with the way the exponents are calculated. Let's check:\n\nIn the code, for option_h, the exponent is (n - h -1). For example, when h is 0, the exponent is n - 0 -1 = n-1. Which is correct. For the first digit taken by Homer, which is his first digit, contributing 10^{n-1}.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when h is 1, and n is 2. Then, the exponent is 2 - 1 -1 = 0. Which is correct (second digit for Homer, contributing 10^0).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\ndigits = [1,2,3,4]\n\nThe code would compute dp(0,0) as the maximum sum.\n\nBut during backtracking, for (0,0):\n\ncurrent_pos is 0, current_digit is 1.\n\noption_h is 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10 + dp(1, 0).\n\noption_m is 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = same as above? Wait, no. For option_m, m is 0, so the exponent is (n - m -1) = 2 - 0 -1 = 1. So same as option_h. So for the first step, the code compares option_h and option_m, which are both 10 + dp(1, 0) and 10 + dp(0, 1). But what is dp(1,0) and dp(0,1)?\n\nWell, the code would compute those recursively. But perhaps for this case, choosing H gives a better path.\n\nBut the sample output shows that the first two steps are H and H.\n\nBut the code would choose between the two options based on which gives a higher sum.\n\nBut in the sample, the maximum sum is achieved by taking H first, then H again.\n\nBut how does that compare to taking H then M?\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly select the optimal path.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. For n=18, the maximum number of steps is 36. The DP function will be called for (h, m) pairs, which are 19*19 = 361 possible states. Each state's calculation is O(1), so the DP is very efficient.\n\nBut what about the exponent calculations? For example, 10 ** (n - h - 1). For n=18, this can be 10^17, which is a big number, but Python handles it.\n\nBut for memoization, the function dp is called with h and m, and returns the maximum sum. The memoization will cache these results.\n\nNow, the code for the problem is as follows:\n\nRead n and A, then compute the digits, then compute the DP, then backtrack to get the sequence.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut note that for the DP function, the digits are accessed as digits[h + m], which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the code must be written with the correct handling of the input.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h == n and m == n:\n        return 0\n    current_pos = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n    if h < n and m < n:\n        option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n        option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n        return max(option_h, option_m)\n    elif h < n:\n        return current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n    else:\n        return current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\nh = 0\nm = 0\nres = []\nwhile h + m < 2 * n:\n    current_pos = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n    if h < n and m < n:\n        option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n        option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n        if option_h >= option_m:\n            res.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            res.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    elif h < n:\n        res.append('H')\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        res.append('M')\n        m += 1\n\nprint(''.join(res))\n\nWait, but this code may have a problem. For example, when the DP is called during backtracking, the code may recalculate the same states again, but since the DP is memoized, it's okay.\n\nBut let's test this code with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\nThe code would generate the sequence as follows.\n\nLet me simulate the backtracking steps:\n\nInitially h=0, m=0.\n\ncurrent_pos is 0, current_digit is 1.\n\noption_h = 1 * 10^(2-0-1) + dp(1, 0) → 1 * 10^1 + dp(1,0) = 10 + dp(1,0).\n\noption_m = same as option_h? Or no?\n\nWait, for option_m, the exponent is (n - m -1) = 2 - 0 -1 = 1. So same as option_h. So option_h and option_m are 10 + dp(1,0) and 10 + dp(0,1).\n\nWhich one is larger? It depends on dp(1,0) and dp(0,1).\n\nLet's see what dp(1,0) and dp(0,1) would be.\n\nBut since the code is recursive, perhaps it's better to think that in the optimal path, choosing H first leads to the maximum sum.\n\nBut for the sample input, the correct sequence is HHMM. So during backtracking, the code would choose H first.\n\nBut how to confirm that?\n\nWell, the code would calculate for each state, and during backtracking, choose the option that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps the code would generate the correct sequence.\n\nBut the code may work.\n\nAnother possible issue is that the code may have a problem with the exponents when the current digit is taken by the player. But according to the problem statement, the exponents are correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a number A, alternating turns, with each player making exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by Homer (S1) and Marge (S2).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a recursive DP approach with memoization to efficiently compute the maximum possible total prize money from any given state. The state is defined by the number of moves Homer (h) and Marge (m) have made so far.\n2. **Backtracking**: After computing the maximum possible prize using DP, we backtrack from the initial state (0 moves for both players) to determine the sequence of moves that leads to this maximum prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return 0\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n        if h < n and m < n:\n            option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n            option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n            return max(option_h, option_m)\n        elif h < n:\n            return current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n        else:\n            return current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n    h = 0\n    m = 0\n    res = []\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[current_pos]\n        if h < n and m < n:\n            option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n            option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n            if option_h >= option_m:\n                res.append('H')\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                res.append('M')\n                m += 1\n        elif h < n:\n            res.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            res.append('M')\n            m += 1\n\n    print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`.\n2. **Digit Conversion**: Convert the string `A` into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Memoized DP Function**: The `dp` function computes the maximum total prize starting from the state where Homer has made `h` moves and Marge has made `m` moves. It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n4. **Backtracking**: After computing the DP values, we backtrack from the initial state (0 moves for both players) to determine the sequence of moves (either 'H' or 'M') that leads to the maximum total prize. At each step, we compare the potential contributions of choosing Homer or Marge next and select the optimal choice.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal sequence of moves using dynamic programming and backtracking, leveraging memoization to handle overlapping subproblems effectively.",
