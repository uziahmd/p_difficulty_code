The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly isn't feasible. So we need an efficient way to compute the results without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The key here is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can calculate the number of losses in each full cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the sequences work. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], and Polycarpus uses B[i % k]. So for each round, we can determine the moves of both players based on their respective sequences.\n\nThe challenge is to compute for each round from 0 to n-1, which player loses, but with n being up to 2e9, we can't do this for each round individually. So we need to find the number of times each player loses in a full cycle of the combined sequences and then compute how many full cycles there are and the remainder.\n\nBut what's the length of a full cycle? The combined sequences repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So for example, if m=3 and k=2, LCM(3,2)=6. So every 6 rounds, the sequence of moves between the two players repeats.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n2. For each round in 0 to cycle_length-1, determine who wins, and count the number of times each player loses in this cycle.\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n4. The remaining rounds are remainder = n % cycle_length.\n5. The total losses for each player would be (losses_in_cycle * total_cycles) + losses_in_remainder_rounds.\n\nBut how do I compute the losses_in_cycle and losses_in_remainder_rounds?\n\nYes. So first, compute for each round in the cycle (from 0 to cycle_length-1), what the moves are, determine the outcome, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut since m and k can be up to 1000, the LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000 and 1000 have LCM 1e6). So for each cycle_length up to 1e6, we can simulate all those rounds once, which is manageable.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Calculate the LCM of m and k. How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So need to compute GCD first.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, then:\n\n- For each round in 0 to cycle_length-1, compute the moves for A and B. For that round, the index for A is (i % m), for B is (i % k).\n\nThen for each such pair of moves, determine who wins. For each round, increment the count for the loser (Nikephoros or Polycarpus).\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, multiply by the number of full cycles. Then, for the remaining rounds (remainder), simulate them as well.\n\nSo for example, if n is 7, and the cycle_length is 6, then total_cycles is 1 (7//6=1), remainder is 1. So the first 6 rounds contribute (counts per cycle) * 1, and then the next 1 round is handled separately.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the LCM and GCD. Let's think about Python's math module. There's a gcd function in Python 3.5+ (math.gcd), but note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, no problem. However, to compute LCM, we can do:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle the case where a or b is zero? Well, in the problem statement, m and k are at least 1, so no problem.\n\nSo first, compute the LCM of m and k.\n\nOnce that's done, simulate the cycle_length rounds once, and compute the number of losses for each player in that cycle.\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\nThe remainder is rem = n % cycle_length.\n\nThen, for the full cycles, multiply the per-cycle counts by total_cycles.\n\nFor the remainder, simulate the first 'rem' rounds of the cycle (",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, where each player follows a cyclic strategy. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use a more efficient approach based on cycles and modular arithmetic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Cycle Detection**: Both players follow cyclic sequences. The combined sequence of moves will repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their individual sequences. This LCM value determines the length of the cycle after which both sequences realign.\n2. **Cycle Simulation**: Simulate one full cycle of the combined sequences to count the number of losses for each player within that cycle.\n3. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately. This allows us to efficiently compute the total number of losses using the results from the cycle simulation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    lcm = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one cycle\n    nikephoros_loss = 0\n    polycarpus_loss = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        # Check who wins\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            polycarpus_loss += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nikephoros_loss += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    # Calculate total losses from full cycles\n    total_nik = nikephoros_loss * total_cycles\n    total_pol = polycarpus_loss * total_cycles\n    \n    # Now process the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            polycarpus_loss += 1\n        else:\n            nikephoros_loss += 1\n    \n    total_nik += nikephoros_loss\n    total_pol += polycarpus_loss\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_pol}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the sequences for each player.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the length of the repeating cycle.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in one cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcomes are recorded to count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Handling Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles is calculated, and the losses from these cycles are multiplied by the number of cycles. The remaining rounds are simulated individually to account for any leftover rounds after the full cycles.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging cycle detection and modular arithmetic, ensuring the solution is both optimal and correct.",
