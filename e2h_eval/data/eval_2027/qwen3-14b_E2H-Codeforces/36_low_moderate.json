The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers so that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for such a configuration to exist. \n\nFirst, the signal coverage. For each town i (from 1 to n), exactly one tower must cover it. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower. \n\nLet me think about how the towers can be arranged. For example, if there's a tower at position i, its signal power p must be such that it covers some towns, but not 0 or n+1. So for a tower at position i, the maximum possible p is min(i, n+1 - i). Because if p is larger than that, then the signal would reach beyond the allowed regions. Wait, but the problem says that the signal power can be set to any integer from 1 to n. However, the constraints require that town 0 and n+1 are not covered. So for any tower, the signal power must be such that it doesn't reach town 0 or n+1. \n\nSo, for a tower at position i, the maximum possible p is min(i, n+1 - i). But when setting p, we need to make sure that the coverage of each tower doesn't include 0 or n+1. \n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the arrangement of towers must allow for a partitioning of the towns 1..n into ranges where each range is covered by exactly one tower. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that the towers must form a certain structure. For example, each tower must cover a contiguous segment of towns, and these segments must not overlap, and cover all towns 1..n. Also, the coverage of each tower must not reach town 0 or n+1. \n\nAlternatively, think about the following: For each tower, the signal power p must be chosen such that it covers some towns. However, the way the towers are placed must allow for a way to assign these p's so that each town is covered exactly once. \n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe the problem reduces to certain conditions on the positions of the towers. Let's think of the valid configurations of towers. \n\nFor example, in the first sample input where n=2. The only valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then, each can have power 1. That covers town 1 (from 1) and town 2 (from 2). Town 0 is not covered by 1's signal (since p=1, |0-1| <1? No, because 0-1 is -1, absolute value is 1. Which is not less than p=1. So the signal does not reach town 0. Similarly, town 3 (n+1=3) is not covered by tower 2's signal (p=1, |3-2|=1, which is not less than 1. So that's okay. \n\nAnother example: if there's a single tower in position 2 (for n=2). Then, can we set p=2? Then, the coverage is towns where |c -2| < 2. So c can be 0,1,2,3. But town 0 and 3 are not allowed. So this would not be acceptable. Hence, even though the tower is present, it's impossible to assign p. Hence, that configuration is invalid. \n\nSo, the problem becomes finding the number of subsets of towers (each subset is a possible selection of towers) that allow for such a configuration, multiplied by (1/2)^n (since each tower is built with probability 1/2). Then, the answer is (number of valid subsets) / 2^n. \n\nThe main challenge is to compute the number of valid subsets. \n\nSo how can we model the valid subsets? \n\nLet me think about the necessary and sufficient conditions for a subset of towers to be valid. \n\nEach tower must be part of a structure where they can cover non-overlapping regions, covering all towns 1..n, and not covering 0 or n+1. \n\nThis seems similar to tiling or interval covering. Perhaps the valid subsets are those where the towers form a structure where each tower is responsible for covering a certain range, and these ranges are non-overlapping and cover all towns. \n\nAnother thought: For each tower, the range it covers must be such that it starts at some position and ends at another, and adjacent towers' ranges don't overlap. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a valid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building radio towers in towns 1 through n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: A valid configuration of towers must allow for non-overlapping coverage of all towns from 1 to n, without covering towns 0 or n+1. This can be modeled using dynamic programming (DP) where we track valid configurations up to each position.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation considers whether a tower is placed at position `i` or not, ensuring that coverage constraints are met.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid ways for the first i towns\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]\n        \n        # Case 2: tower at i, and it covers from i - k to i + k (but need to ensure that the previous is handled)\n        # However, the actual recurrence is more complex. Let's think differently.\n        # We need to consider that if there is a tower at position i, then the previous tower must be at some j < i-1\n        # So, for the tower at i, the coverage must start at i, and the previous tower must end before i-1\n        # So, the recurrence is dp[i] += dp[i-1] (no tower) + dp[i-1 - 1] (tower at i-1?) No, perhaps another approach.\n        # Wait, looking for a pattern similar to tiling problems.\n        # The correct recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n        # Because, either we don't place a tower at i, so dp[i-1], or we place a tower at i and it covers i and i-1 (so the previous part ends at i-2)\n        # Wait, but this seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, in the sample input n=2, the answer is 1/4, which is 1/(2^2). The number of valid subsets is 1. According to the recurrence dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0]. dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = dp[0] = 1. Then dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2? But according to the example, the valid subsets count is 1.

Which would give 2/4 = 1/2, which is wrong. So this approach is incorrect.\n        # So what's the correct way to model the DP?\n        # Another approach: For the configuration to be valid, the towers must form a structure where each tower covers a range that doesn't overlap with others, and covers exactly the towns between two consecutive towers.\n        # This resembles the problem of placing dominoes or tiling with certain conditions.\n        # Let's think recursively: the valid configurations for the first i towns can be formed by either:\n        # 1.
