Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, so the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. For example, for items of weight 1, I can take as many as possible (sorted by cost descending). Same for weight 2 and 3. But how do I combine them optimally?\n\nWait, but there's a possibility that taking some combination of different weights gives a better total. Like, maybe taking one item of weight 3 is better than two items of weight 2, depending on their costs.\n\nSo here's an idea: group all items by their weight. Then, for each weight group, sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, precompute the prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from that group, we can quickly compute the total cost.\n\nOnce I have these prefix sums, the problem becomes selecting how many items to take from each weight group such that the total weight is <= m, and the sum of costs is maximized.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find the optimal combination of counts for each weight?\n\nLet me think. Let's say I have:\n\n- For weight 1: sorted list, with prefix sums s1[0], s1[1], ..., s1[k1], where k1 is the number of items with weight 1.\n- Similarly for weight 2: s2, and weight 3: s3.\n\nThe total weight would be (a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 3) ≤ m, where a is the number of items taken from weight 1, etc. And we want to maximize (s1[a] + s2[b] + s3[c]).\n\nBut how do I iterate through all possible combinations of a, b, c? That seems computationally expensive if done naively.\n\nAlternative approach: since the weights are small (1, 2, 3), maybe we can fix the number of items taken from one group and compute the optimal for the others.\n\nFor example, let's consider all possible numbers of weight 3 items. For each possible count of weight 3 items (say, c), we can compute the remaining weight, and then decide how to best fill it with weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut even this approach might not be efficient enough. Let me think about the maximum possible counts for each weight.\n\nFor weight 3 items, the maximum possible count is floor(m / 3). But m can be up to 3e5, which is manageable. However, if I loop over all possible c (from 0 to max_c), and for each c, compute the best way to use the remaining weight for 1 and 2 items, that might be feasible.\n\nSimilarly, for each possible c, the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*c. Then, I need to find the best combination of a and b such that a*1 + b*2 ≤ rem. How to compute that?\n\nFor the a and b part, perhaps I can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2, and then for each possible b (number of weight 2 items), compute the maximum a possible (which is rem - 2*b). But again, looping through all possible b for each c could be expensive.\n\nAlternatively, for the case of combining weight 1 and 2 items, there's a way to find the optimal selection quickly. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I have a total available weight of W. How to select a combination of weight 1 and 2 items to maximize the sum?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each possible number of weight 2 items (b), take as many as possible of weight 1 items. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the first b items of weight 2 and then the first (W - 2*b) items of weight 1. But since the number of weight 2 items can be up to floor(W/2), which could be up to 1.5e5 for W=3e5, and if we loop through each possible b for each c, that might be O( (m/3) * (m/2) )) which is O( (3e5)^2 ) in worst case. Which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So I need a better way.\n\nAnother idea: for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, given a total weight W, the optimal selection can be found by considering that for each possible number of weight 2 items (b), the maximum possible is min(k2, b_max), where b_max is floor( (W - a) / 2 ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a trick: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and weight 2. Then, for a given W, the optimal way is to choose some number of weight 2 items (say, up to min(k2, floor(W/2))), and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (W - 2*b). But since we can't check all possible b for each W, perhaps we can find the optimal b quickly.\n\nWait, but for each possible W, how do we find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet me think of the following: For weight 2 items, since they are sorted, taking the top b items. For each possible b, the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken is (W - 2*b). But since we can't take more than the total available in weight 1 (say, a_max = len(s1)), then the actual a is min( (W - 2*b), a_max ). But how to find the best b?\n\nThis seems like for each W, the optimal b is in the range [max(0, floor( (W - a_max) / 2 )) ] to floor(W / 2). But how to find the best b quickly?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, the best is to take as many as possible of the higher value ones. But when combining with weight 1 items, there's a trade-off between taking more weight 2 items (which might have higher value per unit weight) and taking more weight 1 items.\n\nBut perhaps for a given W, the optimal is to take some number of weight 2 items, and then fill the rest with weight 1 items. However, how to find that optimal number?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, for a given W, we can try all possible b in the range of 0 to min( floor(W/2), len(s2) ), and for each b, compute the corresponding a = min( W - 2*b, len(s1) ), and then calculate the sum s2[b] + s1[a]. But doing this for every possible W would be O(W) time, which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for weight 1 and 2 items, for all possible total weight up to m. But that might not be feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum possible sum. Then, for a given W, we can iterate over the possible number of weight 2 items (b) such that 2*b ≤ W, and compute the maximum of (s2[b] + s1[W - 2*b]). However, since W can be up to 3e5, and for each W, this could take O( (W/2) ) steps, which is again too slow.\n\nHmm. So perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think again. Since the weight is up to 3, perhaps we can model this problem by grouping the items by their weight and using a dynamic programming approach optimized for small weights.\n\nBut the original problem is similar to the unbounded knapsack, but here the items are unique (each can be taken once). Wait no, each item can be taken once. So it's the 0-1 knapsack problem, but with weights constrained to 1, 2, 3. However, for n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, the standard DP approach is O(nm) which is 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that's not going to work.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weights are small (1,2,3), we can process each group separately. Let me think about how to combine the groups.\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost. Then, compute the prefix sums for each group. For example, for group 1, prefix_sums_1[i] is the sum of the first i items (so prefix_sums_1[0] = 0, prefix_sums_1[1] = cost of first item, etc.)\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, for each group, we can quickly compute the maximum sum for taking a certain number of items.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose a number of items from each group (a, b, c) such that a*1 + b*2 + c*3 ≤ m, and the total sum is maximized.\n\nBut how to find a, b, c efficiently?\n\nLet me think of trying all possible c (number of items from group 3). For each possible c, the maximum possible is up to min( (m // 3), len(group3) ). For each c, the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*c. Now, we need to find the best a and b such that a + 2b ≤ rem.\n\nThen, for each c, compute the maximum sum of group3's first c items plus the maximum sum from group1 and group2 for rem weight.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving the subproblem of group1 and group2 for a given rem.\n\nHow to solve that subproblem?\n\nLet me focus on this subproblem: given a weight limit W (rem), find the maximum sum of taking some items from group1 (weight 1) and group2 (weight 2), with total weight ≤ W.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this quickly.\n\nFor this subproblem, let's denote:\n\ngroup1 has prefix sums s1, where s1[i] is sum of first i items.\n\ngroup2 has prefix sums s2, where s2[j] is sum of first j items.\n\nWe need to find i and j such that i + 2j ≤ W, and s1[i] + s2[j] is maximized.\n\nHow to find this efficiently?\n\nLet me think that for each possible j (number of items from group2), the maximum i is min( W - 2j, len(s1) ). So for each j, we can compute i = min( W - 2j, len(s1) ), and then take s1[i] + s2[j].\n\nBut since j can be up to min( len(s2), W//2 ), which for W up to 3e5, this could be up to 1.5e5. If we do this for each possible c (up to 1e5?), then the total time would be O( (n/3) * (n/2) )) which is O( (1e5)^2 ) = 1e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So we need a better approach for this subproblem.\n\nAlternative idea: For the group1 and group2, precompute for each possible weight W, the maximum sum possible. But how?\n\nWait, but for the group1 and group2, the maximum possible weight is up to m, which is 3e5. So for each W from 0 to m, we can compute the maximum sum. How?\n\nLet me think of this as a dynamic programming problem. Let dp[w] be the maximum sum for weight w. Then, for each item in group1 and group2, we can update the dp array. But since group1 and group2 are sorted, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 are already sorted. For group1, the best is to take as many as possible (since they are sorted in descending order). Similarly for group2. But combining them is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible j (number of group2 items), the maximum possible j is up to min( len(s2), W//2 ). Then, for each j, the maximum i is min( W - 2*j, len(s1) ). So the sum is s2[j] + s1[ min( W - 2*j, len(s1) ) ].\n\nSo, for a given W, the optimal j is the one that maximizes this value. How can we find this j quickly?\n\nSince group2 is sorted in descending order, the s2[j] increases with j. However, the term W - 2j decreases as j increases, so the s1 term may decrease. So there's a trade-off here.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal j is around (W - x)/2, where x is some value. However, how to find it?\n\nAnother observation: For group2, taking more items may give higher s2[j], but taking fewer items allows taking more group1 items. So the optimal j is somewhere in the range of 0 to min(len(s2), W//2).\n\nBut how to find this j quickly?\n\nHere's an idea: For each possible W, the optimal j is in the vicinity of (W - k)/2, where k is the maximum number of group1 items we can take. However, without knowing k, it's hard to find.\n\nAlternative approach: For a given W, the optimal j can be found by checking all possible j in the range [max(0, j_min), j_max], where j_min is something like max(0, (W - len(s1)) // 2 ), and j_max is min( len(s2), W//2 ). Because if we take more than j_max, the 2j exceeds W, and if j is less than j_min, then even taking all group1 items (len(s1)) would require W - 2j ≥ len(s1). So j must be ≥ (W - len(s1)) / 2. So the possible j's are in that range.\n\nBut how big is this range? For example, if len(s1) is 1e5, and W is 3e5, then (W - len(s1)) / 2 is (3e5 - 1e5)/2 = 1e5. So j_min is 1e5, and j_max is 1.5e5. The range is 5e4, which is still too large for each W.\n\nBut perhaps for the subproblem of group1 and group2, we can precompute for each possible j, the maximum i for which i = min( W - 2j, len(s1) ). Then, for a given W, we can loop through j in a certain range and find the maximum.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally expensive unless we can find a way to limit the number of j's we check.\n\nAnother observation: For group2, since the items are sorted in descending order, taking the first j items gives the maximum possible sum for j items. Similarly for group1. So for a given j, the best possible i is the maximum possible given the remaining weight.\n\nSo for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible j (from 0 to j_max) of s2[j] + s1[ min( W - 2j, len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each W, the optimal j is either the maximum possible j (i.e., j_max) or the j that allows taking as many group1 items as possible. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the group1 and group2 are sorted, perhaps the optimal j is around the point where the marginal gain of adding another group2 item is balanced by the loss of group1 items.\n\nBut I don't know how to compute that.\n\nAnother idea: Since for group1, the sum is s1[i], which increases with i, and for group2, the sum is s2[j], which also increases with j. But when you increase j by 1, you lose 2 weight, allowing i to increase by 2 (if possible). So the trade-off is between adding a group2 item (costing 2 weight) and adding two group1 items (costing 2 weight).\n\nSo for each j, the difference between adding a group2 item and two group1 items is s2[j+1] - s2[j] vs s1[i+2] - s1[i].\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, the optimal j is either the maximum possible j, or the j that allows taking all possible group1 items. So perhaps we can check a few candidates around those points.\n\nFor example, for a given W, the maximum j is j_max = min( len(s2), W // 2 )\n\nThen, the j that allows taking all group1 items is j = (W - len(s1)) // 2, but only if that is non-negative. So we can check j around j_max and j_candidate.\n\nBut how many candidates do we need to check? Maybe just a few values, like j_max, j_max -1, j_candidate, etc. Since the optimal j is likely near these points.\n\nThis seems like a heuristic approach, but perhaps it's sufficient. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose W is 5, group1 has 3 items with values [10, 9, 8], group2 has 2 items with values [20, 15].\n\nFor j=0: i=5 → sum is 10+9+8 = 27.\n\nj=1: 2*1=2 → i=3 → sum is 20 + 27 = 47.\n\nj=2: 2*2=4 → i=1 → sum is 35 + 10 = 45.\n\nSo the maximum is at j=1.\n\nIf we check j_max (which is 2) and j_candidate (W - len(s1) = 5-3=2 → j_candidate is 1), then we check j=1 and j=2, which gives the correct answer.\n\nAnother example: suppose group2 has items with high value, but taking j=2 gives a higher sum than j=1.\n\nSo if we check j_max and j_max-1, perhaps we can find the optimal.\n\nBut how many possibilities do we need to check?\n\nMaybe for each W, we can check all j in the range [max(0, j_max - K), j_max], where K is a small number like 200. Then, for each W, this would take O(K) time. If K is 200, then for each c (which can be up to 1e5), the total time would be O(1e5 * 200) = 2e7, which is acceptable.\n\nBut what's the value of K? Well, since the group2 items are sorted, the optimal j is either near j_max or near the j where adding more group2 items would not be worth it.\n\nBut how to determine K? Well, perhaps K can be up to the number of group2 items, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since the group2 items are sorted, the best j is the one where the next item (j+1) would not be worth taking, considering the loss of group1 items. However, without knowing the exact values, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, we can check all possible j in the range [max(0, j_max - 200), j_max], and also check the j that allows taking all group1 items. This is a heuristic, but in practice, for the problem's test cases, this might work.\n\nBut how to ensure correctness?\n\nWell, perhaps for the given constraints, the optimal j is within a small range of j_max. Because group2 items are sorted, and adding more group2 items gives higher s2[j], but reduces the available weight for group1 items. However, if the group2 items are very valuable, then taking more of them is better. If the group1 items are very valuable, then taking more of them is better.\n\nBut how to find the optimal j?\n\nAnother idea: for each W, the optimal j is either the one that uses as many group2 items as possible, or the one that uses as many group1 items as possible, or some j in between. So for each W, we can check all possible j in the range [max(0, j_max - 100), j_max], and also check the j that uses all group1 items. This would take O(100) time per W.\n\nBut how to choose the number of checks (like 100) to ensure that we don't miss the optimal j?\n\nAlternatively, for each W, we can check all possible j in the range [max(0, j_max - 1000), j_max], which would be manageable for the problem's constraints.\n\nBut what if the optimal j is outside this range? For example, in a case where the group2 items are not very valuable, but group1 items are extremely valuable. Then, the optimal j would be small, but if the range is set to j_max - 1000, then for large j_max, this could miss the optimal j.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to compute the optimal j for the group1 and group2 combination.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For the group1 and group2 subproblem, given W, the maximum sum is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many group2 items as possible (j_max), and then filling with group1 items.\n\n- Taking as many group1 items as possible (i_max = W), and then filling with group2 items (but that would be zero, since i_max is already W).\n\nWait, no. If you take i_max = W group1 items, then the weight is exactly W, so no room for group2 items.\n\nAlternatively, for the group1 and group2 case, the optimal j is either:\n\n- j = floor( (W - x) / 2 ), where x is the number of group1 items taken, but this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, since group1 and group2 are sorted, the best way to take group1 and group2 items is to take the top items. So for a given W, the optimal is to take as many group2 items as possible, then fill with group1, or take as many group1 items as possible, then fill with group2.\n\nBut how to compare these two options?\n\nFor example, take j_max = min( len(s2), W // 2 ), then the remaining weight is W - 2*j_max. Take as many group1 items as possible.\n\nAlternatively, take j = 0, and take as many group1 items as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal j is somewhere in between.\n\nBut how to find it?\n\nAnother idea: For the group1 and group2 case, the maximum sum can be computed as follows. Let me precompute for group1 and group2 the best combination for each possible weight up to m. But how?\n\nBut this brings us back to the original problem of O(m) time. Let me think. For each weight w from 0 to m, we can compute the maximum sum for group1 and group2. How?\n\nWe can think of it as a knapsack problem where items are grouped into weight 1 and 2. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can compute this efficiently.\n\nFor example, for group1, since all items are weight 1 and sorted in descending order, the best way to take a certain number of items is to take the top ones. Similarly for group2.\n\nSo for the group1 and group2 subproblem, the maximum sum for weight W is the maximum of:\n\nfor j in 0 to min( len(s2), W//2 ):\n\nsum = s2[j] + s1[ min( W - 2*j, len(s1) ) ]\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following: for each W, the optimal j is the one that maximizes s2[j] + s1[ min( W - 2*j, len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut how to compute this for all W up to m?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For group2, for each j, we can compute the maximum weight that can be used for group1 as W - 2j. So for each j, the contribution to weight W is s2[j] + s1[ min( W - 2j, len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut how to precompute this for all W?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible j in group2, we can iterate through all possible W that are >= 2j, and for those W, we can update the maximum sum for W as the maximum between its current value and s2[j] + s1[ min( W - 2j, len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut this would be O( len(s2) * m ), which is again not feasible for m up to 3e5 and len(s2) up to 1e5.\n\nHmm. This seems challenging.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Let's assume that for the group1 and group2 subproblem, the optimal is to take all possible group2 items, and then fill with group1 items. Or take some other combination. But how to find the best between those options?\n\nWait, for each W, the optimal j is either the floor(W/2) or floor(W/2) - 1, etc. Let's say we try all possible j in the range of floor(W/2) - K to floor(W/2), where K is a small number like 200. For each W, this would take O(K) time. If K is 200, then for all W up to m, this would be O(m*K) time, which for m=3e5 is 6e7 operations. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut why would this work? Because the optimal j is likely to be near the maximum possible j (floor(W/2)), since taking more group2 items may give higher value. But if the group1 items are very valuable, then taking fewer group2 items and more group1 items may be better. However, if the group1 items are sorted, then taking as many as possible is the best option.\n\nSo, for example, if group1 is very valuable, then taking j=0 (all group1 items) is better than taking any j>0. But if group2 items are very valuable, then taking j_max is better.\n\nThus, for each W, checking j in the range [max(0, j_max - 200), j_max], where j_max = min( len(s2), W//2 ), would cover both possibilities.\n\nSo, for the group1 and group2 subproblem, for a given W, we can iterate j from max(0, j_max - 200) to j_max, compute for each j the corresponding i = min( W - 2j, len(s1) ), and keep track of the maximum sum.\n\nThis seems like a feasible approach. The question is, what value of K (200) is sufficient to cover all possible cases. Well, in the worst case, it may not be sufficient, but given the problem's time constraints, this might be the only way to proceed.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe overall plan is:\n\n1. Group the items by their weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute the prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. Iterate over all possible c (number of group3 items), from 0 to min( len(group3), m//3 ).\n\n   For each c:\n\n   a. Compute the remaining weight rem = m - 3*c.\n\n   b. Compute the maximum sum from group1 and group2 for weight rem.\n\n   c. Add the sum from group3's prefix sum for c items.\n\n   d. Keep track of the maximum total sum.\n\nThe key part is step 4b. For this, we can implement the approach of checking j in a limited range.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines of wi and ci. Group them into lists for w=1, 2, 3.\n\nSort each group in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group. For example, for group1, prefix_sums_1[0] = 0, prefix_sums_1[1] = group1[0], prefix_sums_1[2] = group1[0] + group1[1], etc.\n\nOnce that is done, for each possible c in 0 to max_c:\n\n   rem = m - 3*c\n\n   if rem < 0: skip\n\n   compute max_sum_1_2 = max possible sum from group1 and group2 with weight rem.\n\n   total = prefix_sums_3[c] + max_sum_1_2\n\n   update the global maximum.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute max_sum_1_2.\n\nImplementing the approach of checking j in the range [max(0, j_max - K), j_max], where K is a fixed number like 200.\n\nLet me write a helper function for this.\n\ndef compute_max_1_2(W):\n\n    max_sum = 0\n\n    j_max = min( len(s2), W // 2 )\n\n    # Check j from max(0, j_max - K) to j_max\n\n    K = 200\n\n    start_j = max(0, j_max - K)\n\n    for j in range(start_j, j_max + 1):\n\n        remaining_weight = W - 2 * j\n\n        i = min(remaining_weight, len(s1))\n\n        current_sum = s2[j] + s1[i]\n\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n\n            max_sum = current_sum\n\n    return max_sum\n\nBut what about cases where j is smaller than start_j? For example, if the optimal j is much smaller than j_max - K. In that case, this code would miss it. However, given the problem's time constraints, perhaps this is the best we can do.\n\nBut what value of K is sufficient? Well, if the group2 items are sorted in descending order, then for j_max - K to j_max, the s2[j] increases as j increases. However, the s1[i] decreases as j increases. So, the optimal j is somewhere in this range. But how to choose K?\n\nAlternatively, K can be set to the length of group2. But that would be O(len(s2)) per call, which may be expensive.\n\nBut given that for each c, we call this function once, and for each c, the K is 200, then for the worst case, with n=1e5 and m=3e5, the total operations would be:\n\nnumber of c's is up to m//3 (approx 1e5) * 200 = 2e7 operations. Which should be manageable.\n\nBut what if the optimal j is outside this range? Let's think of a case where group2 has a very low value per item, but group1 has very high value. For example:\n\ngroup1 has 1e5 items of cost 1e9 each (so taking as many as possible is best).\n\ngroup2 has 1e5 items of cost 1 each.\n\nFor W = 3e5, the optimal j is 0, since taking 3e5 group1 items (cost 3e5 * 1e9) is better than any j>0. But j_max for W=3e5 is 1.5e5. So start_j = 1.5e5 - 200. The code would check j from 1.5e5 - 200 to 1.5e5. But the optimal j is 0, which is not checked. Hence, the code would fail.\n\nAh, this is a problem. So the approach of checking j near j_max would miss cases where the optimal j is far away.\n\nSo this suggests that the approach is not correct.\n\nAlternative idea: For the group1 and group2 subproblem, we can also check the case where we take as many group1 items as possible (i.e., j=0), and also check j=0, j=1, etc., up to some small number. But again, how to balance this?\n\nAnother observation: For the group1 and group2 subproblem, the maximum sum is the same as the maximum between two scenarios:\n\n1. Take as many group2 items as possible, then fill with group1 items.\n\n2. Take as many group1 items as possible, then fill with group2 items.\n\nBut this is not necessarily the case. For example, taking some group2 items and some group1 items may be better than either of these extremes.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purposes of this problem, checking these two scenarios plus a few others would suffice.\n\nLet me think. For scenario 1: j = j_max = min( len(s2), W // 2 ), and i = min( W - 2*j_max, len(s1) )\n\nScenario 2: i = min( W, len(s1) ), and j = 0.\n\nAdditionally, we can check scenario 3: take as many group2 items as possible such that the remaining weight allows for taking some group1 items. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, for the group1 and group2 subproblem, the optimal solution is to take all possible group2 items, or all possible group1 items, or take some combination that balances the two. But how to find that combination?\n\nAnother idea: since the group1 items are sorted, the best way to fill the remaining weight after taking j group2 items is to take the maximum possible group1 items. So for a given j, the contribution is s2[j] + s1[ min( W - 2j, len(s1) ) ].\n\nNow, for the function f(j) = s2[j] + s1[ min( W - 2j, len(s1) ) ], we can find the j that maximizes this function.\n\nBut since s2[j] is increasing and the term min(...) is decreasing as j increases, the function f(j) may have a single peak. So it's unimodal, and we can perform ternary search on j.\n\nYes! This is promising.\n\nIf the function f(j) is unimodal, then ternary search can find the maximum in O(log n) time.\n\nBut is the function unimodal?\n\nLet me think. As j increases, s2[j] increases. However, the term min( W - 2j, len(s1) ) decreases, so s1[...] decreases. So the function f(j) is the sum of an increasing function and a decreasing function. It's possible that the function has a single peak, making it unimodal.\n\nIf this is true, then we can perform ternary search on j in the range [0, j_max], and find the maximum.\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity for each W from O(K) to O(log j_max), which is much better.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the group1 and group2 subproblem, given W:\n\n- Perform ternary search on j in [0, j_max], to find the j that maximizes f(j) = s2[j] + s1[ min(W - 2j, len(s1)) ].\n\nBut how to verify that the function is indeed unimodal?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose group1 has items [10, 9, 8], group2 has items [20, 15]. W = 5.\n\nj ranges from 0 to 2 (since 5//2=2).\n\nf(0) = 0 + 27 = 27.\n\nf(1) = 20 + 10 = 30.\n\nf(2) = 35 + 8 = 43.\n\nWait, but this is increasing. So the maximum is at j=2. But earlier calculation said that for j=1, it's 47. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, no. Wait, for j=1, the remaining weight is 5 - 2*1 = 3. group1 has 3 items, so i=3. s1[3] is 10+9+8 = 27. So f(1) = s2[1] + s1[3] = 20 + 27 = 47. For j=2, remaining weight is 5 - 4 = 1. i=1. s1[1] = 10. So f(2) = 35 + 10 = 45. So the function increases from j=0 to j=1, then decreases at j=2. So it's unimodal.\n\nAnother example: if the group2 items are very valuable, and group1 items are not. For example, group2 items are [100, 90], group1 items are [1, 1]. W=3.\n\nj can be 0, 1 (since 3//2=1).\n\nf(0) = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nf(1) = 1",
