The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The frog starts at 0, and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't step outside [0, x] during any of its jumps. For each x from 0 to m, we need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct positions reachable under these constraints. Then sum all those f(x) values.\n\nFirst, let's think about what positions the frog can reach. Without any constraints, the frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a's and subtracting b's. But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x during any jump, this complicates things.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the frog can reach a position if there's some path that gets there without stepping outside [0, x]. So even if during the journey, the frog steps beyond x, but in the end reaches the position, but that's not allowed. Wait no, the problem states that the frog never jumps on an integer outside [0, x]. So every step of the way must be within that interval. So when considering f(x), the frog can only make jumps that keep it within [0, x].\n\nSo for a given x, the frog can reach certain positions. How do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the possible positions. Let's consider the positions reachable by the frog when allowed to jump as per the rules. Let's imagine that the frog can move forward by a steps or backward by b steps, but can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut for each x, the reachable positions might be different. However, for large x, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an O(1) or O(some small function of a and b) approach per test case, otherwise it's impossible to compute for large m.\n\nLet me first think about the case where a and b are coprime. Or maybe not. Let's think about the general case.\n\nThe key observation here is that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod gcd(a, b). Because each jump adds a or subtracts b. So the total displacement is a linear combination of a and -b. Therefore, the positions reachable (without considering the boundaries) are all numbers congruent to 0 modulo d, where d is gcd(a, b).\n\nWait, but the frog starts at 0. So the positions reachable are all numbers that can be written as k*a - l*b for non-negative integers k and l. But since the frog can also jump back and forth, perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d, where d = gcd(a, b). But I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe set of all positions reachable without any constraints (i.e., allowing the frog to go anywhere) would be all numbers of the form (k*a - l*b) where k and l are non-negative integers. But this is equivalent to the set of all integers that are multiples of d = gcd(a, b), provided that they are reachable via such steps. However, the problem is that the frog can't go beyond x, so for each x, the reachable positions are a subset of the positions that are multiples of d, and within [0, x], but also reachable via paths that don't go out of bounds.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this. Let me think about the minimal conditions for a position to be reachable.\n\nLet me take the example given in the first sample input: m=7, a=5, b=3. The output for f(5) is 3. Let's see: when x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and maybe others? Wait, the frog can jump from 0 to 5 (since 0+5=5 is within [0,5]). Then from 5, can it jump back to 5-3=2? Yes. So 2 is reachable. From 2, can it jump to 2+5=7, but that's outside of x=5. So can't. Or jump back to 2-3=-1, which is invalid. So 2 can't jump further. So for x=5, the positions are 0, 5, 2. So f(5)=3. Which matches the note.\n\nBut how do we find all such positions for arbitrary x?\n\nAnother example: when a and b are 1 and 2. Let's say x is 100. Then the frog can reach any position from 0 to 100, because with a=1, the frog can reach any position by adding 1s. But wait, but the frog can also subtract 2. However, since the frog can't go below zero, perhaps the positions are all numbers that are reachable via adding 1s, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, if a=1 and b=2, then the frog can reach any number that is congruent to 0 mod 1 (which is all integers), but with the constraints of the jumps. But since a=1, the frog can reach any position >=0 by adding 1s. Because starting at 0, adding 1 once gives 1, then 2, etc. So for x >=0, f(x) = x+1. Which matches the second example in the problem statement where the sum is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2. Which for m=1e9 is a huge number, but manageable with the formula.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is straightforward. So the key is to find for each x, the number of positions reachable under the constraints, which depends on whether the frog can reach all positions in some range, or some subset.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. The frog can jump forward by a or backward by b. However, during any jump, it cannot leave [0, x]. So for a given x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached through a sequence of jumps that never go out of [0, x].\n\nBut how to find all such positions?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = gcd(a,b), and that is reachable via some path that stays within [0, x].\n\nBut even that may not be sufficient. For example, if x is small, the frog may not have enough space to reach certain positions.\n\nSo perhaps for x sufficiently large, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], but for smaller x, it can't.\n\nSo the idea is to find for each x:\n\nIf x is large enough, then f(x) = floor(x / d) + 1 (since all multiples of d up to x are reachable). But for x smaller than some threshold, f(x) is less.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of reachable positions, which is:\n\nIf x is larger than some value, then it's floor(x/d) + 1. Otherwise, it's something else.\n\nBut how to find that threshold?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x required for the frog to reach all multiples of d up to x is when the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0, x].\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think about the case where d = gcd(a, b). Let me denote g = d, and a' = a/g, b' = b/g. Then, since a and b are multiples of g, the problem reduces to the case where a' and b' are coprime.\n\nBecause the positions reachable are multiples of g. So the problem can be transformed into considering the positions divided by g. Let me think: the original positions are k * g, where k is an integer. So the problem becomes, for the transformed variables a' and b', which are coprime, how many positions can be reached in the transformed space.\n\nSo, for example, in the original problem, the positions are multiples of g. So the transformed problem is: the frog starts at 0, and can jump +a' or -b'. Now, the transformed positions are integers (since a' and b' are coprime). The question is, for a transformed x (original x divided by g?), what is the number of reachable positions?\n\nBut perhaps this transformation helps. Let's proceed with that.\n\nLet me define g = gcd(a, b). Let a' = a/g, b' = b/g. Since a' and b' are coprime.\n\nIn the transformed problem, the frog can reach any position that is reachable by adding a' or subtracting b', but ensuring that during jumps, the position remains between 0 and x/g (original x divided by g? No, because the original x is the maximum allowed. So in the transformed problem, the positions must be in [0, x/g] ?\n\nWait, no. The original x is the upper bound. The original positions are multiples of g. So, for a position k*g to be within [0, x], we need k*g ≤ x → k ≤ x/g. So in the transformed problem, the positions are integers in [0, floor(x/g)]. So the transformed x is floor(x/g). Wait, but perhaps x/g is not integer, but the original positions must be multiples of g. So the transformed problem's maximum allowed position is floor(x/g). So the transformed problem is: given x', find the number of integers reachable by the frog in [0, x'], where the frog can jump +a' or -b', and during all jumps, the position remains in [0, x'].\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, what's the condition for a position to be reachable?\n\nIn the transformed problem, the frog can reach any integer that is reachable via the steps of +a' and -b', and that is within [0, x'].\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, the set of reachable positions (without considering the boundaries) is all integers. Because any integer can be expressed as a linear combination of a' and b' (since they are coprime). However, the frog starts at 0, and the steps are adding a' or subtracting b'.\n\nBut the problem is that the frog can't go below 0 or above x' during any jump. So even if a position is reachable in theory, if the path to reach it requires going outside [0, x'], it can't be counted.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the transformed problem. For the transformed problem, the frog can reach any position that is ≥0 and can be reached via a sequence of steps that never go negative or exceed x'.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, perhaps for x' ≥ some value, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x'].\n\nBut what's that value?\n\nFor example, in the case where a'=1 and b'=2 (coprime), then for any x', the frog can reach all positions in [0, x'] because it can add 1s. For example, to reach position 3, you can do 0+1+1+1. So even if you have to subtract 2, but since you can't go negative, you can just add 1s.\n\nWait, but in the transformed problem, the frog can jump forward by a'=1 or backward by b'=2. So to reach 1, you can just jump forward once. To reach 2, you can jump forward twice. To reach 3, same. To reach 4, etc. But what about positions that are less than a'? For example, if a'=3 and b'=2. Then, can the frog reach 1?\n\nWell, starting from 0, the frog can jump forward by 3 (to 3), then subtract 2 (to 1). So yes. So even though the frog can't jump directly to 1, it can reach it via a sequence of steps.\n\nSo in general, when a' and b' are coprime, the frog can reach any position ≥ (some value). But what is that value?\n\nThis seems similar to the coin problem. The largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a' and b' is a'*b' - a' - b'. But that applies when you can use any combination of positive coefficients. However, in our problem, the frog can use any combination of adding a' and subtracting b', but with the constraint that during the process, the positions are non-negative and not exceeding x'.\n\nBut this is a different problem. However, perhaps for x' ≥ (a' + b') - 1, the frog can reach all positions ≥0. Because once you can reach positions up to that value, you can generate all higher positions by adding a's.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's take an example. Let a'=3, b'=2. Then, the largest unattainable number is 3*2 -3 -2 = 1. Which is indeed unattainable if you can only add coins. But in our problem, the frog can subtract. So for example, 1 can be reached by 3-2=1. So in this case, all numbers ≥0 are reachable.\n\nWait, but in the coin problem, you can't have negative coins. But here, the frog can subtract steps. So perhaps for any two coprime a' and b', the frog can reach any integer ≥0. Because for any integer k ≥0, you can find integers x and y such that x*a' - y*b' = k. But since a' and b' are coprime, there are solutions. However, the frog's path must not go out of bounds. So even if such a solution exists, the path to reach it may require stepping out of [0, x'].\n\nBut when x' is large enough, perhaps all positions can be reached.\n\nSo, for the transformed problem, if x' is large enough, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x']. So the question is, what is the minimal x' such that for all positions in [0, x'], the frog can reach them.\n\nOnce that is known, for x' ≥ that minimal value, f(x) is x' + 1. And for x' less than that, it's some other value.\n\nBut how to find that minimal x'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x' is (a' - 1) * (b' - 1) - 1. Or something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it this way: once the frog can reach positions up to some value, then it can reach all higher positions by adding a's. For example, suppose the frog can reach position k. Then, by adding a' steps, it can reach k + a', k + 2a', etc. So if the frog can reach all positions from some value up to a certain point, then it can reach all positions beyond that.\n\nSo the key is to find the minimal x' such that all positions from x' - (a' - 1) up to x' can be reached. Then, for any x' larger than that, all positions can be reached.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: for the transformed problem, the frog can reach any position that is reachable via some sequence of steps, and for that, the position must be ≥0 and ≤x'.\n\nBut for the frog to reach a position k, there must be some way to get there without stepping outside [0, x'].\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think of the transformed problem again. Since a' and b' are coprime, then for any position k ≥0, there exists integers x and y ≥0 such that x*a' - y*b' = k. But this is not necessarily true. For example, k=1, a'=3, b'=2: x=1, y=1 gives 3-2=1. So x and y can be positive. But for k=2, x=0, y=1 gives -2, which is not allowed. But the frog can reach 2 by jumping forward twice (since a'=3, but that would take it to 3, then subtract 1? No, wait, the frog can only subtract b'=2. So to reach 2, the frog can't do that. Wait, but earlier example said that the frog can reach 1 by jumping forward once and then subtracting once. But how to reach 2?\n\nWait, the frog starts at 0. It can jump forward by a'=3 to reach 3. Then from 3, it can subtract b'=2 to reach 1. Then from 1, can it jump forward again to reach 1+3=4? Yes. But how to reach 2?\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a way. Let's think: can the frog reach 2? Suppose the frog starts at 0. Then jumps forward by 3 (to 3), then subtracts 2 (to 1). Then jumps forward again to 4. Subtract 2 to get 2. So yes, that's possible. So the path is 0 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 2. Each of these steps is within the allowed range if x' is ≥4. So if x' is 4 or higher, then the frog can reach 2.\n\nSo for x' ≥4, the frog can reach 2.\n\nBut if x' is less than 4, say x'=3, then the frog can't reach 2. Because to get to 2, the frog has to go to 4 first, which is beyond x'=3. Hence, in that case, 2 is not reachable.\n\nSo, the minimal x' required to reach all positions depends on the maximum of some values. For example, in this case, to reach 2, you need x' ≥4.\n\nSo for the transformed problem, the minimal x' where all positions in [0, x'] can be reached is (a' - 1) * (b' - 1). Wait, that's the classic Frobenius number. But for two coprime numbers, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination with non-negative coefficients is (a*b -a -b). But that's for the case where you can only add coins. In our case, the frog can subtract steps, but the path must not go out of bounds.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal x' required for the frog to reach all positions in [0, x'] is (a' - 1) * (b' - 1). Let's check with the previous example: a'=3, b'=2. (3-1)*(2-1) = 2*1=2. But in that case, when x'=2, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nAt x'=2, positions 0, 1, 2. Can the frog reach 1 and 2?\n\nFor 1: yes, as before. For 2: to reach 2, the frog would need to go to 3 (but x'=2, so that's not allowed). So the frog can't reach 2 when x'=2. Hence, the minimal x' must be higher than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x' is (a' + b') -1. For a'=3, b'=2, that's 4. Which matches the previous example where x'=4 allows reaching 2.\n\nSo perhaps for the transformed problem, once x' is ≥ (a' + b') -1, then all positions can be reached. Let's see.\n\nIn the example where a'=3, b'=2. For x'=4, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nYes:\n\n0: start.\n\n1: 0+3-2=1.\n\n2: 0+3-2+3-2= 2 (path 0→3→1→4→2).\n\n3: jump once.\n\n4: jump once, then jump again (but that would be 3+3=6, but for x'=4, that's not allowed. Wait, how to reach 4? From 0, jump to 3 (allowed), then jump to 3+3=6 which is beyond x'=4. Not allowed. So how else?\n\nAlternatively, from 0, jump forward once to 3. Then subtract b'=2 to get to 1. Then jump forward again to 4. That's allowed, since 4 is within x'=4. So yes, the path 0→3→1→4. So 4 is reachable.\n\nSimilarly, for position 2, as discussed.\n\nThus, for x'=4, all positions 0-4 are reachable.\n\nWhat about for x'=3? Then, 4 is not allowed, but the frog can't reach 2. So the minimal x' is 4.\n\nWhich is (a' + b') - 1 = 3+2-1=4.\n\nAnother example: a'=2, b'=3. Then (2+3-1)=4. Let's see for x'=4, can we reach all positions 0-4?\n\nYes:\n\n0: start.\n\n1: 0+2-3= -1 (invalid), but another path? Like 0+2=2, then 2-3=-1 (invalid). Or maybe another way. Wait, how to reach 1?\n\nAh, here's the problem. If a'=2, b'=3, then the frog can jump forward by 2 or backward by 3. Starting at 0, can it reach 1?\n\nLet me think. Let's try to find a sequence of jumps that leads to 1.\n\nStart at 0. Jump forward to 2. From there, can we jump back by 3? That would be -1, which is invalid. So no. What about other steps?\n\nIs there any way to reach 1?\n\nAlternatively, can the frog reach 1 by adding and subtracting steps? Let's see: 2* x - 3*y = 1. Possible solutions are x=2, y=1: 2*2 -3*1 = 1. So that's possible. So the path would be 0 → 2 → 4 → 1 (by subtracting 3). But for x'=4, that's allowed. So yes, the path is valid. Thus, 1 can be reached.\n\nSo for x'=4, all positions can be reached.\n\nBut for x'=3, can the frog reach 1? Let's see. The path would be 0→2→4 (but 4 exceeds x'=3). So no. So the frog can't reach 1 in that case.\n\nSo the minimal x' is (a'+b')-1 = 4. Thus, for x' ≥ (a'+b')-1, all positions can be reached.\n\nSo this suggests that for the transformed problem, once x' ≥ (a' + b') - 1, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x'].\n\nTherefore, for the transformed problem, the number of reachable positions is:\n\nif x' < (a' + b') - 1: some value depending on x'\n\nelse: x' + 1.\n\nSo the problem now becomes, for each x, compute the number of reachable positions in the original problem, which depends on the transformed x' = floor(x/g), where g = gcd(a, b).\n\nBut how to compute the number of reachable positions for x' < (a' + b') - 1?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, since a' and b' are up to 1e5/g (since a and b are up to 1e5), and given that for each test case, the maximum possible (a' + b') is up to 2e5, perhaps we can precompute for all possible x' up to (a' + b') - 1, the number of reachable positions. Then, for x' larger than that, it's x' + 1.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, and for each test case, the a and b can vary, we need to find for each x in [0, m], the value of f(x), which depends on x'.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor a given m, a, b:\n\nCompute g = gcd(a, b).\n\nCompute a' = a/g, b' = b/g.\n\nIf a' and b' are not coprime, which they are not because we divided by their gcd. Wait, no. Since a and b were divided by their gcd, a' and b' are coprime.\n\nSo the transformed problem is with a' and b' coprime.\n\nNow, for each x in [0, m], compute x' = floor(x / g). Then, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions in the transformed problem that are reachable up to x', multiplied by 1 (since each corresponds to a multiple of g in the original problem). Wait, no. Because the original problem's positions are multiples of g. So for the transformed problem, the count is the number of positions in [0, x'] that are reachable, and each corresponds to a unique position in the original problem (k * g). So the number of reachable positions in the original problem is the same as the count in the transformed problem.\n\nTherefore, for the original problem, f(x) is equal to the number of reachable positions in the transformed problem for x' = floor(x/g).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each x in 0..m, compute x' = floor(x/g). Then compute the number of reachable positions in the transformed problem for x', which is:\n\nif x' >= (a' + b' - 1): x' + 1\n\nelse: some value that we need to compute.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. Compute for the transformed problem, for x' up to (a' + b' - 1), the number of reachable positions.\n\nOnce we have that, for each x in 0..m, we can compute x' = floor(x/g), and determine whether it's in the \"large\" region (x' >= threshold) or not.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute for each x', the number of reachable positions in the transformed problem when x' is less than the threshold.\n\nHow to compute this?\n\nWe can model this as a BFS problem. For each x' up to the threshold (which is up to 2e5), we can precompute the reachable positions.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, and for each test case, the threshold is up to 2e5, this seems feasible.\n\nSo for each test case, we can:\n\n- Compute the threshold T = a' + b' - 1.\n\n- Precompute for all x' from 0 to T, the number of reachable positions, say, reachable[x'].\n\nOnce we have that, then for any x' in the original problem, if x' >= T, the count is x' + 1. Otherwise, it's reachable[x'].\n\nBut how to compute reachable[x']?\n\nWe can model it as a BFS or dynamic programming approach. Let's think of it as a graph where nodes are positions, and edges represent the possible jumps. The frog can jump from position k to k + a' or k - b', provided that the new position is in [0, x'].\n\nBut since x' varies, perhaps for each x', we need to compute reachable positions. However, that would be O(T^2) time for each test case, which is not feasible if T is 2e5.\n\nAlternative approach: for each x', the reachable positions are the same as those reachable for x' + 1, except possibly some positions that are now out of bounds. But this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, for all x' up to T, we can precompute for each position whether it is reachable. But how?\n\nAnother idea: For the transformed problem, the reachable positions for any x' can be determined by the set of positions that are reachable without stepping outside [0, x'] during any jump.\n\nBut this seems like a problem that can be modeled with BFS for each x', but that would be too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps for all x' up to T, the reachable positions are the same as the ones that are reachable for x'=T. Because once x' reaches T, all positions up to T are reachable. So for any x' < T, the reachable positions are a subset of the reachable positions for x'=T. So perhaps we can precompute all reachable positions for x'=T, and then for any x' < T, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions in [0, x'] that are reachable in the full set.\n\nBut how to find which positions are reachable in the full set?\n\nIf we can precompute all positions up to T that are reachable, then for any x', the number of reachable positions is the count of those positions that are <=x'.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- For the transformed problem, perform a BFS or dynamic programming to find all positions up to T that are reachable.\n\nThen, for any x', the number of reachable positions is the number of positions in the reachable set that are <= min(x', T).\n\nBut how to compute the reachable set for the transformed problem up to T?\n\nYes. Let's think of the transformed problem with a' and b' coprime. We can model this as a graph where each node is a position, and edges are adding a' or subtracting b', but ensuring that the new position is within [0, T]. Then, we can perform BFS from 0 to find all reachable positions.\n\nBut T can be up to 2e5 (since a' and b' are up to 1e5 each), and for each test case, this is feasible.\n\nOnce we have the list of reachable positions up to T, then for any x', the count is the number of reachable positions that are <=x'.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all x'?\n\nWe can precompute a prefix sum array. For example, after finding all reachable positions up to T, we sort them, then for each x', the count is the number of elements in the sorted list that are <=x'.\n\nSo the steps for a test case would be:\n\nGiven a, b, m:\n\nCompute g = gcd(a, b)\n\na' = a/g, b' = b/g\n\nCompute T = a' + b' - 1\n\nIf a' == 0 or b' == 0? Well, since a and b are positive integers, and g is their gcd, a' and b' are positive integers.\n\nThen, perform BFS/DFS to find all positions up to T that are reachable in the transformed problem.\n\nOnce we have this list, we sort it and create a prefix array.\n\nThen, for each x in 0..m:\n\nCompute x' = floor(x/g)\n\nif x' >= T: then the count is x' + 1\n\nelse: the count is the number of elements in the sorted list that are <= x'\n\nOnce we have this, we can compute the sum over all x from 0 to m of f(x), which is the count for x'.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nBecause m can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to calculate the sum.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nThe sum is sum_{x=0}^m [f(x)] = sum_{x=0}^m [count(x')], where x' = floor(x/g).\n\nBut x' can be rewritten as x' = k, where k is floor(x/g). For each k, the number of x's that have floor(x/g) = k is:\n\nFor k=0: x ranges from 0 to g-1 → count is g.\n\nFor k >=1: x ranges from k*g to min((k+1)*g -1, m). So the count is (min((k+1)*g -1, m) - k*g + 1) = min(g, m -k*g +1).\n\nBut perhaps we can find for each k, the number of x's that map to it, and multiply by the count for that k.\n\nBut first, we need to find all possible k's for which x' =k is in the range of 0 to floor(m/g).\n\nLet me denote max_k = floor(m/g).\n\nSo the sum can be broken into two parts:\n\nFor k in 0 to max_k:\n\nif k >= T: then the contribution to the sum is (number of x's with x'=k) * (k+1)\n\nelse: contribution is (number of x's with x'=k) * (number of reachable positions <=k in transformed problem)\n\nSo the problem now is to compute for each k in 0..max_k, the contribution.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me first handle the case when k >= T. For those k, the contribution is (number of x's with x'=k) * (k+1).\n\nFor k < T, it's (number of x's with x'=k) * (number of reachable positions in transformed problem up to k).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the sorted list of reachable positions in the transformed problem up to T, and create a prefix array that for any k gives the count of reachable positions <=k.\n\nLet me call this function cnt_reachable(k) = number of positions in the reachable list <=k.\n\nOnce we have that, then for each k, the contribution can be computed.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for all k from 0 to max_k:\n\nsum += (number of x's with x'=k) * (cnt_reachable(k) if k < T else k+1)\n\nBut how to compute the number of x's for each k?\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor a given k, the x's that satisfy floor(x/g) =k are those x in [k*g, (k+1)*g -1], but not exceeding m.\n\nSo the lower bound is L = k*g, upper bound is U = min( (k+1)*g -1, m )\n\nThe count of x's is max(0, U - L + 1 )\n\nSo for each k, we can compute that.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this for all k up to max_k = floor(m/g).\n\nBut for large m (up to 1e9), and max_k up to 1e9/g, which could be up to 1e9 (if g is 1), this would be O(1e9) operations, which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but for the case when k >= T, which is up to (a' + b' -1) which is up to 2e5, then for k >= T, we can compute the contribution for all those k's in a range.\n\nBut for k >= T, the contribution is (number of x's for k) * (k+1).\n\nSo the sum for k >= T can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet K_start = max( T, 0 )\n\nK_end = max_k\n\nFor these K_start to K_end:\n\nsum += (number of x's for k) * (k+1)\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the number of x's for k:\n\nFor k in [K_start, K_end], the number of x's is:\n\nIf (k+1)*g -1 <= m → then it's g.\n\nElse, it's m - k*g +1.\n\nSo the sum for k >= T can be split into two parts:\n\nCase 1: (k+1)*g -1 <= m → which means k <= floor( (m +1)/g ) -1 → which is k <= floor( (m)/g )\n\nBut since K_start is T and K_end is floor(m/g), which is max_k, this is always the case.\n\nWait, no. For example, when k is the max_k, which is floor(m/g). Then, (k+1)*g -1 = (floor(m/g)+1)*g -1. Which could be larger than m. So the number of x's for k = max_k is m - k*g +1.\n\nSo for the k >= T part, the sum can be calculated as:\n\nsum_{k = K_start}^{K_end} (number of x's for k) * (k+1)\n\nBut how to compute this sum quickly?\n\nLet me think of it as follows:\n\nLet me denote for k in [A, B], where A = max(T, 0), B = max_k.\n\nThe number of x's for k is:\n\nif k < B: it's g, since (k+1)*g -1 = k*g +g -1. For k < B, since B = floor(m/g), then k+1 <= B+1. But for k < B, (k+1)*g -1 <= B*g +g -1. But m is between B*g and (B+1)*g -1.\n\nSo for k < B, (k+1)*g -1 is <= m only if k+1 <= floor( (m +1)/g ). Which is true for k < B.\n\nBut for k = B, the upper bound is m.\n\nSo the sum can be split into two parts:\n\nsum_part1: for k from A to B-1, each contributes g*(k+1)\n\nsum_part2: for k = B, contributes (m - B*g +1) * (B +1)\n\nSo sum_part1 = g * sum_{k=A}^{B-1} (k+1) = g * sum_{i=A+1}^{B} i = g * [ (B*(B+1)/2) - (A*(A+1)/2) ) ]\n\nsum_part2 = (m - B*g +1) * (B+1)\n\nBut how to compute B?\n\nB = floor(m/g).\n\nSo this can be done in O(1) time.\n\nThus, the sum for k >= T can be computed quickly.\n\nNow, for the k < T part, we need to compute for each k in 0 to min(T-1, max_k):\n\ncontribution = (number of x's for k) * cnt_reachable",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to a given maximum value `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either `a` steps forward or `b` steps backward. The key insight is that the reachable positions are determined by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. This allows us to reduce the problem to a simpler form using integer division.\n\n2. **Transformed Problem**: By dividing `a` and `b` by their gcd, we transform the problem into one where `a'` and `b'` are coprime. This simplifies the analysis of reachable positions.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For small values of `x`, we use BFS to determine all reachable positions up to a threshold determined by the sum of `a'` and `b'`.\n\n4. **Efficient Summation**: For larger values of `x`, we use mathematical formulas to compute contributions efficiently, leveraging the properties of arithmetic sequences and prefix sums.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        m = int(input[idx])\n        a = int(input[idx+1])\n        b = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        g = math.gcd(a, b)\n        a_prime = a // g\n        b_prime = b // g\n        \n        T = a_prime + b_prime - 1\n        \n        # Precompute reachable positions in transformed problem up to T\n        max_x_prime = T\n        visited = [False] * (max_x_prime + 1)\n        q = deque()\n        q.append(0)\n        visited[0] = True\n        \n        while q:\n            current = q.popleft()\n            # Try adding a_prime\n            next_add = current + a_prime\n            if next_add <= max_x_prime and not visited[next_add]:\n                visited[next_add] = True\n                q.append(next_add)\n            # Try subtracting b_prime\n            next_sub = current - b_prime\n            if next_sub >= 0 and not visited[next_sub]:\n                visited[next_sub] = True\n                q.append(next_sub)\n        \n        # Collect all reachable positions\n        reachable = []\n        for i in range(max_x_prime + 1):\n            if visited[i]:\n                reachable.append(i)\n        reachable.sort()\n        \n        # Precompute prefix counts for reachable positions\n        # For a given k, how many elements in reachable are <=k?\n        # We can use binary search for each k\n        def cnt_reachable(k):\n            # binary search in reachable\n            left, right = 0, len(reachable)\n            while left < right:\n                mid = (left + right) // 2\n                if reachable[mid] <= k:\n                    left = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right = mid\n            return left\n        \n        # Compute max_k = floor(m / g)\n        max_k = m // g\n        \n        total = 0\n        \n        # Handle k < T\n        for k in range(0, min(T, max_k) + 1):\n            # Compute number of x's with floor(x/g) = k\n            L = k * g\n            U = min((k + 1) * g - 1, m)\n            count_x = U - L + 1\n            if count_x < 0:\n                continue\n            # get cnt_reachable(k)\n            cr = cnt_reachable(k)\n            total += count_x * cr\n        \n        # Handle k >= T\n        A = T\n        B = max_k\n        if A <= B:\n            # Compute sum_part1: k from A to B-1\n            sum_part1 = 0\n            if B - 1 >= A:\n                # sum_{i=A+1}^B i\n                sum_i_B = B * (B + 1) // 2\n                sum_i_A = (A) * (A + 1) // 2\n                sum_part1 = (sum_i_B - sum_i_A) * g\n            # Compute sum_part2: k = B\n            if B <= max_k:\n                L = B * g\n                U = m\n                count_x = U - L + 1\n                if count_x > 0:\n                    sum_part2 = count_x * (B + 1)\n                    total += sum_part1 + sum_part2\n                else:\n                    total += sum_part1\n            else:\n                total += sum_part1\n        \n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the required variables.\n2. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is computed to transform the problem into a simplified form.\n3. **BFS for Reachable Positions**: Using BFS, we determine all reachable positions up to a threshold derived from `a'` and `b'`.\n4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: For each possible value of `x`, we calculate the number of reachable positions using binary search.\n5. **Efficient Summation**: Contributions from both small and large ranges of `x` are calculated using arithmetic series and prefix sums to ensure efficiency even for large values of `m`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle both small and large values efficiently, leveraging mathematical insights and BFS for accurate results.",
