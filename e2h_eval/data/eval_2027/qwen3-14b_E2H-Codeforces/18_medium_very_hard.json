The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$.

The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints. We need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(x) represents. The frog starts at 0. From any position k, it can jump to k+a or k-b. But the frog can't jump outside [0, x]. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, perhaps the positions are determined by some linear combinations. However, since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, this complicates things.\n\nWait, but the frog can make multiple jumps. Let's think about the reachable positions in general (without the x constraint). The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b), right? Because the steps are adding a or subtracting b. So the reachable positions would be all numbers that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients, but since the frog starts at 0, the reachable positions are multiples of d, where d is the gcd of a and b.\n\nBut wait, maybe not exactly. Because the frog can only move forward by a or backward by b. So the movement is a bit different. For example, if the frog can move +a or -b, then the set of reachable positions would be all positions that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. Wait, but that's not necessarily the same as the linear combinations. Because the frog can go back and forth. But maybe the key here is that the reachable positions must be congruent to 0 mod d, where d = gcd(a,b).\n\nSo, for the general case (without the x constraint), the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d. But with the x constraint, the frog can't go beyond x or below 0. So for each x, the reachable positions are the multiples of d that are between 0 and x, but also considering that the frog can reach them through some sequence of jumps.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not entirely accurate. For example, suppose a=5, b=3. Then d=1. So all positions are reachable? But in the first example, when x=5, f(5)=3. Which suggests that for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and maybe another position? Wait, the example says f(5)=3. Let me check that example again.\n\nIn the first example, the input is 7 5 3. The note says that f(5) is 3. Let's think: the frog starts at 0. It can jump to 0+5=5. From 5, it can jump to 5+5=10 (but if x is 5, then 10 is outside, so not allowed). Or jump to 5-3=2. So 2 is reachable. From 2, can it jump further? From 2, adding 5 gives 7 (if x is 5, no). Subtracting 3 gives -1 (invalid). So 2 is reachable. Then, from 0, can you reach other positions?\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Let's see. How do you get to 2? From 0, you can't jump to 0-3 = -3 (invalid). So the first jump is to 5. Then from 5, you can jump back to 2. Then from 2, you can't jump forward (since 2+5=7>5). So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 5, 2. That's three positions, hence f(5)=3.\n\nSo even though the gcd is 1 (since 5 and 3 are coprime), the reachable positions for x=5 are not all numbers between 0 and 5. So my earlier thought was wrong. So the problem is more complex than just considering multiples of d.\n\nSo perhaps the reachable positions depend on the ability to reach them through some combination of jumps, but also considering that the frog can't go beyond x. So how can we model this?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. The frog can make any number of jumps, but each jump must land within [0, x]. So the frog can reach positions that are reachable via some combination of adding a and subtracting b, but ensuring that during the entire journey, all positions are within [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are those that are congruent to 0 mod d (where d is gcd(a, b)), and also can be expressed as some linear combination with coefficients such that the path never goes out of bounds. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent jumps. Then, for each x, f(x) is the number of nodes reachable from 0 in this graph, where all nodes are in [0, x]. However, for large x (up to 1e9), we can't compute this for each x. So we need a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me consider the case where a and b are coprime. Let's say d=1. Then, the frog can reach any position that is reachable through a series of steps, but constrained by the x limit.\n\nBut how? For example, in the first example, a=5, b=3. So the frog can reach positions that are multiples of 1 (all integers), but only up to x, but how?\n\nWait, but in that example, when x is large enough, say x >= 5 + 3 = 8, then the frog can reach any position. Because once you can reach positions up to some value, you can use the steps to reach others. For example, if you can reach 5 and 2, then from 5 you can go to 5-3=2, then from 2 you can add 5 to reach 7, etc.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where all positions are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and for which there exists some k and l such that k*a - l*b = pos, and during the process of building up to that position, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the positions that the frog can reach when x is sufficiently large. For example, if x is large enough that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (gcd(a,b)) and is non-negative. Then, for x >= some threshold, f(x) would be floor(x/d) + 1 (since all multiples of d up to x are reachable). However, for smaller x, the frog might not be able to reach all multiples of d, because the path to reach them would require going beyond x.\n\nBut how to determine for a given x, which multiples of d are reachable?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. The frog can move forward by a or backward by b. So the positions are determined by the steps taken. However, the frog can't go below 0 or above x. So the problem is similar to a BFS traversal, but again, for large x, we can't simulate this.\n\nBut given that a and b are up to 1e5, maybe we can find some pattern or formula based on the properties of a and b.\n\nLet me first consider the case when a and b are coprime (d=1). Then, the frog can reach any integer that is reachable through some combination of adding a and subtracting b. However, for the frog to reach a position, it must be possible to reach it through a sequence of steps that don't go out of bounds. \n\nBut for example, if x is large enough, then the frog can reach any position. Let's think about the minimal x required for that. For example, in the case where a=5 and b=3. Once the frog can reach positions up to a certain point, it can use the steps to reach higher positions. For example, once the frog can reach 2, then from 2 it can add a to reach 7, then subtract b to reach 4, then add a to reach 9, subtract b to reach 6, etc. So for x >= 2, the frog can reach all positions >= 2 that are congruent to 2 mod 1 (i.e., all integers) up to x. But that's not possible, because for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. But 3 and 4 are not reachable yet. Wait, but maybe they can be reached with more steps?\n\nWait, how to reach 3? Let's think. Starting from 0, jump to 5. From 5, subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, add 5 to get 7 (but if x is 5, it's invalid). So no. If x is larger, say x=8. Then from 2, you can add 5 to get 7. From 7, subtract 3 to get 4. From 4, add 5 to get 9 (if x is 8, invalid). So 4 is reachable. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. Then from 1, can't jump forward (1+5=6, which is allowed if x >=6). So if x is 8, then from 1, you can add 5 to reach 6. From 6, subtract 3 to reach 3. So finally, 3 is reachable. So for x >= 6, the frog can reach 3. But for x=5, it can't.\n\nSo for larger x, the frog can reach more positions. The question is, for a given x, how many positions are reachable?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe we need to find for each x, the number of positions that are reachable, which depends on whether x is large enough to allow certain steps.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let d = gcd(a, b). Then, the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of d. So, for any x, the positions reachable are multiples of d in [0, x], but only those that can be reached through some sequence of steps without going out of bounds. \n\nBut even then, for some positions that are multiples of d, the frog may not be able to reach them if x is too small. For example, in the first example, d=1. The positions 0, 2, 5 are reachable for x=5, but 3, 4, etc., are not until x is larger.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding, for each x, the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are reachable under the constraints of the jumps. Let's denote that number as f(x). Then, the answer is the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps required to reach each multiple of d. But again, for large x, this seems impractical.\n\nAlternative idea: The frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are greater than or equal to some value, say s. For example, once x is larger than a certain threshold, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Then, for x less than that threshold, some positions are missing.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be divided into two parts:\n\n1. For x less than some critical value, compute f(x) manually (using BFS or some method).\n2. For x greater than or equal to that critical value, f(x) is (x//d + 1) minus some correction term, but maybe it's simply (x//d + 1) minus the number of positions that are not reachable even though they are multiples of d.\n\nBut how to find that critical value and the correction terms?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a variation of the coin problem. For example, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b (with non-negative coefficients) is known, but here the situation is different because the frog can subtract b as well. However, perhaps this is related to the concept of the Frobenius number, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any multiple of d that is at least (some value) and can be formed by a combination of steps. For example, if the frog can reach some position, then by adding a's and subtracting b's, it can reach other positions.\n\nBut again, the constraints of staying within [0, x] complicate things.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the frog's movement as being able to reach any position that is a multiple of d and can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the process of reaching that position, the frog never leaves [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are in [0, x] and are ≥ (some value) that depends on a and b. For example, once the frog can reach a certain position, it can generate all higher positions by adding a's. But how to find that value?\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime (d=1). Suppose the frog can reach position s. Then, by adding a's, it can reach s + a, s + 2a, etc. However, to reach s + a, the frog must have a way to get there without leaving the interval [0, x]. But if x is large enough, then this is possible. So, if the frog can reach s, and x is large enough, then it can reach all positions ≥ s.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the minimal number that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, since the frog can subtract b, the problem is different. For example, the frog can reach positions that are lower than a certain value by subtracting b steps.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal value that can be reached is 0, and the maximal is unbounded. But again, the constraints of x limit the reachable positions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the maximum distance the frog can reach. For example, the frog can reach any multiple of d that is in [0, x] and can be formed by some combination of steps. But this is still vague.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem for the case when a and b are coprime. Let's assume d=1. Then, the frog can reach any position that is reachable via a series of steps. However, for x being large enough, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x]. But for smaller x, some positions are not reachable.\n\nBut how to find for each x, the number of reachable positions?\n\nAnother idea: The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d and is in the interval [0, x], provided that x is large enough. Let's say that after a certain value of x, all multiples of d in [0, x] are reachable. Let's call this value X. Then, for x ≥ X, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1. For x < X, f(x) is less than that.\n\nSo the problem becomes determining X and computing the sum accordingly. But how to find X?\n\nAlternatively, think about the minimal x such that all multiples of d in [0, x] are reachable. Once that x is found, for any larger x, the count is straightforward.\n\nBut how to find that x?\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. For example, a=5, b=3. Then, the minimal x where all positions up to x are reachable is... Well, in the first example, when x=7, f(7)=8. Which implies that for x=7, all positions 0, 2, 5, 7, 4 (from 7-3=4?), etc. Let me see:\n\nAt x=7, the frog can reach:\n\n0 → 5 → 2 → 7 (by adding a from 2). From 7, subtract 3 to get 4. From 4, add 5 to get 9 (invalid). Subtract 3 to get 1. From 1, add 5 to get 6. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. From 3, add 5 to get 8 (invalid). Subtract 3 to get 0. So the positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions. So all positions from 0 to 7 are covered. Hence, for x >= 7, the frog can reach all positions. Thus, for x >=7, f(x) = x+1 (since d=1). \n\nSo for the first example, the sum from 0 to 7 is 19. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo in this case, the critical x is 7. Once x reaches that, all positions are reachable. How to find this critical x for general a and b?\n\nThis seems related to the Frobenius number, which for two coprime numbers a and b is (a*b -a -b). But in our case, the frog can subtract b, so maybe the critical x is something else.\n\nWait, for the case where a and b are coprime, the Frobenius number is (a*b -a -b). But that's the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, in our case, the frog can subtract b, so it's a different scenario. \n\nBut in our example with a=5 and b=3, the Frobenius number is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. Which is exactly the critical x we saw earlier. So when x is equal to the Frobenius number, the frog can reach all positions beyond that. Wait, but in the example, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions up to 7. Which is exactly the Frobenius number. Interesting. So perhaps the critical x is the Frobenius number. \n\nIf that's the case, then for a and b coprime, once x is >= Frobenius number, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. For x < Frobenius number, some positions are not reachable. \n\nSo for the general case where d = gcd(a, b), the problem reduces to:\n\nLet d = gcd(a, b). Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Then, a' and b' are coprime. The Frobenius number for a' and b' is a'*b' - a' - b'. Let's call this F. Then, the critical x for the original problem (with a and b) would be F*d. Because multiplying by d scales the Frobenius number.\n\nWait, let me think. For example, if a=5, b=3, d=1. Then F is 5*3 -5 -3 =7. So the critical x is 7. Which matches the example. Another example: if a=2, b=2, then d=2. a'=1, b'=1. Frobenius number is 1*1 -1 -1 = -1. Which is negative. So for this case, the critical x is zero. Which makes sense since the frog can only reach even numbers. \n\nSo for general a and b, the critical x is F*d, where F is the Frobenius number for a' and b', where a' = a/d, b' = b/d. However, if a' and b' are not coprime, then the Frobenius number is undefined. But since we have already divided by d, a' and b' are coprime.\n\nSo the Frobenius number for a' and b' is (a'*b' - a' - b'), which is valid when they are coprime. \n\nThus, the critical x is (a'*b' - a' - b') * d = (a*b/d - a - b) * d = a*b - a*d - b*d. Wait, let me compute:\n\nOriginal a and b are a = a' * d, b = b' * d. Then, the Frobenius number for a' and b' is a'*b' - a' - b'. Multiply by d to get the critical x in terms of original a and b: (a'*b' -a' -b') * d = ( (a/d)*(b/d) ) *d - (a' + b') *d = (ab)/(d) - (a + b) *d /d ? No:\n\nWait, (a'*b' -a' -b') *d = ( (a/d)*(b/d) - a/d - b/d ) *d = (ab/(d^2) - (a + b)/d ) *d = ab/d - a - b. \n\nYes. So the critical x is ab/d - a - b. \n\nBut wait, when a and b are coprime, d=1, so critical x is ab -a -b. Which matches the Frobenius number. So this seems to fit.\n\nNow, the idea is that for any x >= critical_x, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. For x < critical_x, it can't reach all multiples. \n\nSo for the sum, we need to compute:\n\nFor each x from 0 to m:\n\nif x < critical_x: compute f(x) as the number of reachable multiples of d up to x.\n\nelse: f(x) = (x // d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for x < critical_x?\n\nBut what if critical_x is negative? For example, when a and b are such that a'*b' - a' -b' is negative. For instance, when a'=1, b'=1. Then Frobenius number is -1, so critical_x is -1*d. Which is -d. Since x is >=0, for all x >=0, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. \n\nSo, for cases where critical_x is negative, the critical_x is less than zero, which means that for all x >=0, f(x) = (x//d) + 1.\n\nSo the first step is to compute d = gcd(a, b), and then compute critical_x = (a*b)/d -a -b. \n\nWait, but (a*b)/d is equal to a' * b * d /d = a' * b. Wait, no:\n\nWait, a = a' *d, b = b'*d. So a*b = a'*d * b'*d = a'*b'*d². Then (a*b)/d = a'*b'*d. \n\nThen critical_x is (a*b)/d - a -b = a'*b'*d - a' d - b' d = d (a'*b' -a' -b'). Which is the same as the Frobenius number multiplied by d.\n\nSo, for example, when a and b are coprime, then critical_x is (a*b) -a -b.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n- Compute a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n- Compute F = a'*b' -a' -b'\n- critical_x = F *d\n- If critical_x is negative, then for all x >=0, f(x) = (x//d) +1\n- Else, for x >= critical_x, f(x) = (x//d)+1\n- For x < critical_x, need to find the number of reachable multiples of d in [0, x]\n\nBut how to compute the sum of f(x) for x from 0 to m?\n\nThe sum can be split into two parts:\n\nsum_{x=0}^{min(m, critical_x -1)} f(x) + sum_{x= max(0, critical_x)}^{m} (x//d +1)\n\nBut how to compute the first part?\n\nThe problem is that for x < critical_x, f(x) is not simply (x//d +1), but something less. However, computing this for all x up to critical_x is not feasible if critical_x is large. For example, if a=1 and b=2, then d=1, a'=1, b'=2. F= 1*2 -1 -2 = -1. So critical_x is -1, which is negative. Hence, all x >=0 are in the second part. Hence, sum is sum_{x=0}^m (x+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2.\n\nBut if critical_x is positive, then for x up to critical_x -1, we need to compute f(x). However, critical_x can be as high as (a*b/d -a -b). For example, if a and b are large, say a=1e5, b=1e5, then d=1e5, a'=1, b'=1. Then F = 1*1 -1 -1 = -1, critical_x is -d = -1e5. So again, all x >=0 are in the second part.\n\nBut if a and b are coprime, and large, then critical_x = ab -a -b. For example, if a=1e5 and b=1e5+1, then critical_x is 1e5*(1e5+1) - 1e5 - (1e5+1) = ... which is O(1e10). For m up to 1e9, this could be larger than m, so the first part is not needed. \n\nBut for cases where critical_x is less than m, we need to compute the sum for x from 0 to critical_x -1. However, if critical_x is up to 1e10, then even for m=1e9, this part is manageable (since 1e9 is less than 1e10). But if critical_x is larger than m, then the first part is sum from x=0 to m of f(x), but how to compute that?\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for x < critical_x?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think again about what f(x) represents for x < critical_x. It's the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are reachable by the frog under the constraints.\n\nBut how to find that count?\n\nAn alternative idea: For x < critical_x, the frog can't reach all multiples of d. However, the reachable positions are exactly those multiples of d that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the process of reaching them, the frog never leaves [0, x]. But this seems hard to model.\n\nBut perhaps, for x < critical_x, the reachable positions are the same as those that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the value is between 0 and x. \n\nBut even this seems difficult to compute. However, considering that the critical_x is the Frobenius number multiplied by d, and for x < critical_x, the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients (since the Frobenius number is the largest number that cannot be expressed as such). But wait, no. Because the frog can also subtract b, which allows it to reach lower numbers.\n\nWait, but in the case where x is less than the critical_x, the frog can reach certain positions. For example, in the first example with a=5 and b=3, critical_x is 7. For x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. These are the positions that can be expressed as 0*5 - 0*3 =0, 1*5 - 0*3=5, 1*5 -1*3=2. So they are combinations of adding a and subtracting b. But how to count all such positions up to x?\n\nThis seems like the classic problem of counting the number of numbers that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But wait, in this case, the frog can also subtract b, so the positions are not just those that can be expressed as ka + lb where k and l are non-negative. For example, in the first example, 2 is 5 - 3 (so k=1, l=1). But that's a combination of adding a once and subtracting b once. So the frog can reach positions that are linear combinations of a and b with any integer coefficients (positive and negative) as long as the path doesn't go out of bounds. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother observation: Since the frog starts at 0 and can jump forward by a or backward by b, the set of reachable positions is the same as the set of positions that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients, but with the additional condition that the path to reach them doesn't go out of [0, x]. \n\nBut how to find this set? This seems like a very complex problem.\n\nPerhaps we can model this with BFS for small values of critical_x. For example, if critical_x is small (say, up to 1e5), then we can precompute for each x up to critical_x the value of f(x). But if critical_x is large, this is not feasible.\n\nBut given that a and b are up to 1e5, what is the maximum possible value of critical_x?\n\ncritical_x = (a*b)/d - a -b. Since d is the gcd of a and b, the maximum value occurs when a and b are coprime. Then, critical_x = a*b -a -b. For a and b up to 1e5, this could be as large as (1e5)^2 - 2*1e5 = 1e10 - 2e5, which is about 1e10. If m is up to 1e9, then for cases where critical_x is larger than m, we don't need to compute the first part. However, if critical_x is less than m, then we need to compute the first part up to critical_x.\n\nBut if critical_x is up to 1e10, then even for m=1e9, it's not feasible to compute for each x up to critical_x.\n\nSo, this suggests that the first part (x < critical_x) is only needed when critical_x is <= m. But if critical_x is large (like 1e10), and m is 1e9, then the first part is not needed. So, the problem is to find a way to compute the first part when critical_x is small enough.\n\nBut how to determine whether critical_x is small enough to compute via BFS?\n\nWell, for the given constraints of m up to 1e9, if critical_x is larger than m, then we can ignore the first part. Otherwise, we need to compute the first part for x up to critical_x.\n\nBut what if critical_x is up to 1e10, and m is up to 1e9? Then, the first part is up to m, which is 1e9. But even for that, doing a BFS for each x up to 1e9 is not feasible.\n\nSo this suggests that there's a smarter way to compute the first part. Perhaps the reachable positions for x < critical_x are exactly those that can be expressed as ka - lb, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the result is between 0 and x. \n\nBut how to count this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the set of positions reachable by the frog without any constraints (except that the path doesn't go out of bounds). For x < critical_x, the frog can't reach all multiples of d. But what is the set of reachable multiples of d?\n\nLet me think of the reachable positions as the set of multiples of d that are >=0 and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients (possibly negative), but such that during the process of reaching them, the frog never leaves [0, x]. \n\nBut again, this seems too abstract.\n\nAnother idea: Since the frog can move forward by a or backward by b, the set of reachable positions is the same as the set of positions that are reachable in the graph where each node is connected to node +a and node -b. However, the frog cannot go below 0 or above x. \n\nBut for x < critical_x, the reachable positions are limited. However, for x >= critical_x, all multiples of d are reachable. \n\nSo, for the first part, the sum of f(x) from x=0 to min(m, critical_x-1) can be computed using BFS for each x. However, this is not feasible for large critical_x.\n\nBut given that a and b are up to 1e5, and m up to 1e9, perhaps we can precompute for all x up to some limit (like 1e5 or 1e6) and find a pattern. However, this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, notice that for x < critical_x, the frog can reach the same set of positions as those that are reachable in the unconstrained case (without the x limit), but limited to [0, x]. So, the reachable positions for x are the intersection of the unconstrained reachable positions and [0, x].\n\nBut what is the unconstrained reachable positions? They are all multiples of d. Because the frog can move forward and backward, and since the gcd is d, any multiple of d can be reached eventually. However, this is only true if the frog can reach it through some sequence of steps. But for x < critical_x, it's possible that the frog can't reach certain multiples of d because the path to reach them requires going beyond x.\n\nBut this brings us back to square one.\n\nLet me think of the unconstrained case. The frog can reach any multiple of d. However, to reach a particular multiple of d, say s, the frog needs to have a way to get there. For example, s = k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. So, the question becomes: for a given s (multiple of d), what is the minimal x needed to reach it? And for x >= that minimal x, the frog can reach s.\n\nBut how to find this minimal x for each s?\n\nAlternatively, for each s that is a multiple of d, the minimal x needed to reach it is the maximum of the positions visited along the path from 0 to s. For example, to reach s, the frog might need to go through some intermediate positions that are larger than s. Hence, for x to be at least that maximum, the frog can reach s.\n\nBut this seems too complex to compute for all possible s.\n\nBut given that for x < critical_x, the frog can't reach all multiples of d, and for x >= critical_x, it can reach all of them, perhaps the sum for x < critical_x can be computed as follows:\n\nFor each x in [0, critical_x-1], the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are <= critical_x. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, for x < critical_x, the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d that are reachable in the unconstrained case and are <= x. But how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the unconstrained case. The frog can reach any multiple of d. So, for x >= the minimal required to reach that multiple, it can be counted. But how to find for each multiple of d, the minimal x needed to reach it.\n\nBut this seems like a problem of finding the minimal x for each multiple of d. However, this seems computationally intensive.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find for all multiples of d up to critical_x, the minimal x needed to reach them. Then, for each x, the count of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d up to x whose minimal x is <= x.\n\nBut again, this seems challenging.\n\nAnother observation: For the unconstrained case, the frog can reach any multiple of d. But the minimal x required to reach a particular multiple s is the minimal value such that there exists a way to reach s without exceeding x. For example, to reach s=2 in the first example (a=5, b=3), the minimal x is 5 (since the frog has to go from 0 to 5 to then subtract 3 to get 2). So for x=5, it's possible. For x=4, it's not possible.\n\nSo for s=2, the minimal x is 5. Hence, for x >=5, it is counted in f(x).\n\nSimilarly, for s=5, the minimal x is 5.\n\nFor s=0, minimal x is 0.\n\nFor s=3, the minimal x is 6 (as per earlier example), since the frog reaches 3 via 0→5→2→7 (x=7) →4→1→6→3. So for x=6, it's not possible to reach 3, but for x=7, it is.\n\nSo, the minimal x for s=3 is 7.\n\nBut how to find this for all multiples of d up to critical",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to m. The solution involves understanding the mathematical properties of the frog's movement and efficiently computing the required values using number theory concepts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The positions it can reach are determined by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, denoted as `d`. Only multiples of `d` can be reached.\n2. **Critical Value Calculation**: Using the Frobenius number concept for two coprime integers, we calculate a critical value beyond which all multiples of `d` within the range [0, x] are reachable.\n3. **Summation Strategy**: We split the problem into two parts:\n   - For values below the critical value, we use a breadth-first search (BFS) to compute reachable positions.\n   - For values above or equal to the critical value, we use a direct formula based on the number of multiples of `d`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_prime = a // d\n    b_prime = b // d\n    F = a_prime * b_prime - a_prime - b_prime\n    critical_x = F * d\n\n    # Compute sum for x >= critical_x\n    def sum_above_critical(m, d):\n        if m < 0:\n            return 0\n        total = 0\n        max_val = m // d\n        # Sum_{k=0}^{max_val} (k + 1) = (max_val + 1)(max_val + 2) // 2\n        total = (max_val + 1) * (max_val + 2) // 2\n        return total\n\n    # Compute sum for x < critical_x\n    def sum_below_critical(m, critical_x, a, b, d):\n        if m < 0:\n            return 0\n        max_x = min(m, critical_x - 1)\n        if max_x < 0:\n            return 0\n\n        # Use BFS to find reachable positions up to max_x\n        visited = set()\n        q = deque()\n        q.append(0)\n        visited.add(0)\n\n        # Precompute all reachable positions up to max_x\n        reachable = set()\n        while q:\n            pos = q.popleft()\n            reachable.add(pos)\n            if pos + a <= max_x:\n                if (pos + a) not in visited:\n                    visited.add(pos + a)\n                    q.append(pos + a)\n            if pos - b >= 0:\n                if (pos - b) not in visited:\n                    visited.add(pos - b)\n                    q.append(pos - b)\n\n        # Now, for each x from 0 to max_x, count the number of reachable positions <=x\n        # To do this efficiently, precompute the sorted list of reachable positions\n        sorted_reach = sorted(reachable)\n        res = 0\n        for x in range(0, max_x + 1):\n            # binary search for the number of elements <= x\n            left, right = 0, len(sorted_reach)\n            while left < right:\n                mid = (left + right) // 2\n                if sorted_reach[mid] <= x:\n                    left = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right = mid\n            cnt = left\n            res += cnt\n        return res\n\n    if critical_x < 0:\n        total = sum_above_critical(m, d)\n    else:\n        sum_above = sum_above_critical(m, d)\n        sum_below = sum_below_critical(m, critical_x, a, b, d)\n        total = sum_below + sum_above\n\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` determines the step size for reachable positions.\n2. **Critical Value**: The critical value is derived using the Frobenius number concept, which helps determine when all positions become reachable.\n3. **BFS for Small Values**: For values below the critical value, a BFS is used to explore all reachable positions up to the maximum required value.\n4. **Efficient Summation**: For values above the critical value, a direct mathematical formula is used to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle both small and large ranges efficiently, leveraging mathematical insights and BFS for accurate results.",
