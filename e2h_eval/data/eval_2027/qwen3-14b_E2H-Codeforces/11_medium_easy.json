A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each can make, given the resources they have.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires each friend to have nl ml of drink. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs those things. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. Because each friend uses nl for their toast. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for one toast, each friend requires these. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. Total lime slices needed is n slices. Total salt is n * np grams.\n\nSo the resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nSo the number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute, and then take the minimum of those.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor the drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast takes n * nl ml. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, if the division isn't exact, we take the floor, since you can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast needs n slices. So max_toasts_lime = total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast needs n * np grams. So max_toasts_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? Wait, no. Wait nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation. Then the drink allows 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices (n=3). 80 / 3 is 26.666..., floor is 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, what's the problem here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why? Because each toast requires a slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices. So for the first sample, n=3. So per toast, 3 slices. So total slices is 10*8=80. So 80 / 3 is 26.666, which would be 26 toasts. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh wait, no, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that seems conflicting. Let me check the sample explanation again.\n\nIn the first sample, the explanation says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 ml of drink. Enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Wait, why 20/3? Because each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? Wait no. Wait the drink per toast is n * nl. For the first sample, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would be 2. But the sample explanation says 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's going on here?\n\nOh wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nAh! Oh right! Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But in the sample explanation, they have 20 ml, and they say that it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait 20 / 3 is 6.666... but why?\n\nWait that suggests that per toast, each friend needs 1 ml? Because 3 friends per toast would need 3 * 1 = 3 ml. 20 / 3 is 6.666, which would be 6 toasts. But according to the input parameters for the first sample, nl is 3. So why is the sample explanation dividing by 3?\n\nWait the first sample input is: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait that would be 20 divided by 3, but that would be per toast per friend? Or perhaps I got the calculation wrong.\n\nWait the total drink is 4 * 5 = 20 ml. For each toast, each friend needs nl=3 ml. So for one toast, all friends together need 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait why is the drink calculation 20 / 3? That suggests that per toast, the total drink required is 3 ml. Which would be per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. But according to the input, nl is 3. So what's happening here?\n\nAh! Oh wait, maybe the problem says that each toast requires per friend nl ml. So for each toast, each friend has one toast. So the total per toast is n * nl. But the sample explanation says that the drink is 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which implies that the total per toast is 3 ml. So for 20 ml, 6 toasts would require 6 * 3 = 18 ml. Which leaves 2 ml. So that suggests that per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 1. But in the input, nl is 3. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait this indicates that perhaps I have misread the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs those. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So in the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 ml would allow 2 toasts (2 * 9 = 18 ml), leaving 2 ml. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 6 * 3 = 18 ml. Which suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 1, not 3. So why is the sample explanation using 3?\n\nThis indicates that I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for one toast, the total is n * nl ml. But the sample explanation says that the drink is 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total is 3 ml. So for 20 ml, 6 toasts would require 6 * 3 = 18 ml. So that would mean that per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be n * nl = 3. So if n is 3, then nl would be 1. But in the first sample input, nl is 3. So this is a contradiction.\n\nSo there must be some misunderstanding here. Let me look at the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSample Output: 2.\n\nSample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the problem is that the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. Therefore, for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But the sample explanation says that the total drink is 20, and that it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would suggest that per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be n * nl = 3. Since n is 3, that would mean nl is 1. But in the input, nl is 3. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, but the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the problem is that the sample explanation is considering the total number of toasts that can be made, and then dividing by the number of friends. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided that all drink the same amount. So each friend makes the same number of toasts. Let's say that each friend makes t toasts. Then, the total drink required is t * n * nl. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts, and each toast requires nl ml per friend. So total drink is t * n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, the total lime slices required is t * n (each toast per friend requires a slice, so per toast, n slices, multiplied by t toasts). And total salt is t * n * np.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nt * n * nl <= total_drink (k*l)\n\nt * n <= total_slices (c*d)\n\nt * n * np <= total_salt (p)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of:\n\nfloor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ), \n\nfloor( (c*d) / n ), \n\nfloor( p / (n * np) )\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink = 4 *5 = 20.\n\nn * nl = 3 * 3 = 9. So 20//9 = 2.\n\ntotal_slices = 10 * 8 = 80. n is 3. 80//3 = 26.\n\nsalt: p is 100, n * np is 3 * 1 = 3. 100//3 is 33.\n\nSo the min of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. So why does the sample explanation say that the drink allows 6 toasts?\n\nAh, the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me re-read the sample explanation.\n\nSample explanation says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\n\nWait, this suggests that the sample explanation is considering the drink as allowing 6 toasts, then dividing by 3 friends. But according to our previous calculation, the drink allows 2 toasts. How does that happen?\n\nAh! Oh! Oh my god, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the sample explanation is not correct, but the actual correct answer is as per our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is considering that the total number of toasts is the number of toasts per friend multiplied by the number of friends. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf each friend makes t toasts, then total toasts made is t * n. But that's not the case. Each toast is made by all friends. For example, if they make one toast, each of the n friends has one toast. So the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts is t, not multiplied by n.\n\nWait, the problem says \"make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\" So each friend makes the same number of toasts. So if each makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is t. Because each toast is a single event where all friends participate. So for example, one toast is made, and each friend has one toast. So the number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nDrink: t * n * nl <= total_drink.\n\nLimes: t * n <= total_slices.\n\nSalt: t * n * np <= total_salt.\n\nTherefore, the maximum t is the minimum of:\n\ntotal_drink // (n * nl),\n\ntotal_slices // n,\n\ntotal_salt // (n * np).\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink is 20. n * nl is 3 *3 =9. 20//9 is 2.\n\ntotal_slices is 80. 80//3 is 26.\n\ntotal_salt is 100. 100// (3*1) = 33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. Which is the correct answer. But the sample explanation says that the drink allows 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that they are calculating total_drink divided by nl, not by n * nl. Which would be 20 / 3 = 6.666, which is 6. Then they take min(6, 80, 100) which is 6, then divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2. Which matches the final answer.\n\nBut why is that? Why is the sample explanation considering that the drink allows 6 toasts, then divides by 3 friends?\n\nAh! Oh! Oh! Because the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is thinking of the total number of toasts (per person) as t, but in their calculation, they are considering that for each toast, the total drink is nl per person. So for example, if each person makes t toasts, then the total drink is t * nl * n. So the sample explanation says that the drink is 20 ml, and that the total required for t toasts is t * nl * n. So 20 = t * 3 * 3 → t = 20/(9) = 2.222. So floor to 2. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that the total required is t * 3 (nl is 3?), but that would be if the total drink is t * nl. Which would be if per toast, the total is nl, not per person. So perhaps the sample explanation is wrong, or there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is considering the total number of toasts (across all friends) as t, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is incorrect. But the sample output is 2, which matches our calculation. So perhaps the sample explanation is just wrong, but the correct approach is to compute the three values as I mentioned.\n\nSo, given that, I can proceed with the code.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l.\n\ntotal_slices = c * d.\n\ntotal_salt = p.\n\nThen:\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nThen output result.\n\nYes, that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's test this with the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20.\n\nn * nl = 3 * 3 =9. 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_slices =10*8=80. 80//3=26.\n\nsalt_toasts: p=100, n * np=3*1=3. 100//3=33. So min is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSample output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink = 100*10=1000.\n\nnl is 4. So n * nl =5 *4=20. 1000//20=50.\n\ntotal_slices: c=1, d=19 → 1*19=19. 19//5=3 (since 5*3=15, 5*4=20>19).\n\nsalt: p=90. n * np =5 *3=15. 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) → 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1e6.\n\nnl is 50. n * nl =10*50=500. 1e6 // 500 = 2000.\n\ntotal_slices: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. divided by n=10 → 575//10=57.\n\nsalt: p=1. n * np=10 *1=10. 1//10=0. So min(2000, 57, 0) is 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be written to compute these three values and take their minimum.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers. The input is a single line with 9 integers.\n\nSo, for each test case, read the line, split into the 9 variables.\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut need to handle integer division correctly. Since in Python, integer division with // is floor division, but since all numbers are positive, it's okay.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers. For example, for the first sample input line:\n\n['3', '4', '5', '10', '8', '100', '3', '1']\n\nWait, but the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line with the numbers. So the code should read from stdin, split into parts, and process.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read a single line from stdin.\n\nWait, the user says that the input is given as a single line with the numbers. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\".\n\nSo the code will read the line, split into parts, and convert to integers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ndrink_toasts = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9=2.\n\nlime_toasts: 10*8=80 // 3 → 26.\n\nsalt_toasts: 100 // (3*1) = 33. min(2,26,33) → 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → n=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink=1000. n * nl =5*4=20. 1000//20=50. total_slices=1*19=19. 19//5=3. salt: 90//(5*3)=90//15=6. min is 3.\n\nThird sample: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → total_drink = 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. n * nl = 10 *50=500. 1e6 // 500 = 2000. total_slices =25 *23=575. 575//10=57. salt: 1 // (10*1) = 0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for samples.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if any of the denominators is zero? But the problem says that all inputs are >=1. So no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when the division is exact. For example, if total_drink is exactly divisible by n * nl.\n\nAnother case: when one of the resources is zero. But the problem says all inputs are positive integers.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Constraints**: Calculate the total amount of each resource available.\n   - **Soft Drink**: Total milliliters from all bottles.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total slices from all limes.\n   - **Salt**: Total grams available.\n\n2. **Determine Toast Limits for Each Resource**:\n   - **Soft Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering each toast requires a specific amount per friend.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total slices available, considering each toast requires a slice per friend.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available, considering each toast requires a specific amount per friend.\n\n3. **Determine the Minimum Limit**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is determined by taking the minimum of the limits calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: We calculate the total available resources by multiplying the respective quantities (e.g., total drink from bottles, total lime slices from limes).\n- **Toast Limits Calculation**: For each resource, we determine how many toasts can be made by dividing the total resource by the amount needed per toast, considering all friends. This involves integer division to ensure we only consider whole toasts.\n- **Result Determination**: The final result is the minimum of the three limits calculated, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource constraint.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by focusing on the constraints of each resource and ensuring we take the limiting factor into account, providing an optimal solution in constant time.",
