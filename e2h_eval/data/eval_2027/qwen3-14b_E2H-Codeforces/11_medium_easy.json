A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\nSo, the input gives me several numbers: n (number of friends), k (bottles of drink), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend). \n\nWait, right. For each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends are making a toast. So for one toast, the total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the problem is to compute how many toasts can be made, considering all constraints. The answer is the minimum between the possible toasts based on each resource.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\n1. Drink: total available is k * l. Each toast requires n * nl. So the number of toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, since if there's any remainder, we can't do another toast. So integer division here.\n\n2. Lime slices: total available is c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So possible toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\n3. Salt: total available is p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So possible toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the first case:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3*3=9 ml? Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. For 3 friends, per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. But sample says limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, wait no. Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 10 *8=80 toasts. Oh, but wait, each toast requires n slices. So for each toast, n slices. So the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n. For the first sample, c*d is 10*8=80. Divided by n=3, which is 80//3=26. So why does the sample explanation say that limes are enough for 80 toasts? Wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. Oh! Wait, the problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So per toast, each friend has one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So the total number of slices needed for t toasts is t * n. Therefore, the maximum t possible from the limes is (c*d) // n. So in the first sample, 80//3 is 26. But according to the sample explanation, it's 80 toasts. That's conflicting. Wait, what's the sample explanation saying?\n\nIn the first sample explanation, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to my calculation, it's 80 slices. So for each toast, you need 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80/3 = 26.666, so 26 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that's a contradiction. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n*t slices. So the total available slices is c*d. So t_max is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut in the first sample, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check the numbers. The first sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So c=10 limes, each cut into d=8 slices. So total slices is 10*8=80. So for each toast, 3 slices. So 80 /3 is 26.666, so 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait the sample explanation says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the numbers, that would be 80 toasts, each requiring 3 slices. That would require 240 slices. But 10*8=80 slices. So that's impossible. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the sample explanation must have a mistake? Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". Which suggests that each toast requires one slice. But that would be if each toast requires one slice regardless of the number of friends. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait the problem says: \"each friend needs a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs one. So per toast, n slices. So the sample explanation must be wrong? Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend. So for example, for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices. So the sample explanation must have made a mistake. But according to the sample input, the output is 2. Let's see.\n\nIn the sample input, the drink allows for 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts. The salt allows for 100/(3*1) = 33.333, so 33. The limes are 80 slices. If each toast requires n slices (3), then 80//3 is 26. So the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that's a discrepancy. How?\n\nWait the sample explanation says: \"the limes are enough for 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, what? Wait the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nOriginal sample input: 3 friends, 4 bottles of 5ml each. So total drink is 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires per friend 3ml. So per toast, 3*3=9ml. 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nWait that suggests that the sample explanation is considering per toast per friend, but perhaps the problem statement is different. Oh wait, maybe I have the problem statement wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, the total drink required is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl ml. So for the first sample, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222. So 2 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, each friend requires nl ml, but the total per toast is nl, not multiplied by n. That would be a mistake. But that's what the sample explanation says.\n\nWait the sample explanation says: \"Overall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts.\" So that's 20 divided by 3, which is 6.666, so 6 toasts. But why? Why is that the case?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Maybe the 'nl' is the amount per toast per friend, but the total per toast is nl. Like, each friend makes one toast, and for that toast, they need nl ml. So for example, if there are 3 friends, and they each make t toasts, then total drink needed is 3 * t * nl. But that's not how the problem is phrased.\n\nWait the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend drinks t * nl ml. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. So the total drink available is k*l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, they have 20ml, and they are dividing by 3 to get 6 toasts. Which implies that the total drink needed is t * 3, not t*3*3. So that suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, but that's impossible. So where is the mistake here?\n\nLet me recheck the sample input and explanation. The first input line is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSample explanation says:\n\nTotal drink is 4*5=20ml. It's enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So that suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml, not 3*3. Which would mean that per toast, all friends together need nl ml. Which contradicts the problem statement. But according to the sample explanation, that's the case.\n\nSo this implies that I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So if each friend makes one toast, then for that toast, they need nl ml. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. Thus, for all friends, total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the total drink is 20ml, and they calculate 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which implies that the total drink per toast is 3 ml. Which would be if each toast requires nl ml in total, not per person. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend must have their own nl ml. So for example, if there are 3 friends and they make 2 toasts, then each friend drinks 2 * nl ml. So total drink is 3 * 2 * nl.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, they have 20ml, and they can make 6 toasts. So 6 toasts would require 3 * 6 * 3 = 54 ml. But the total available is 20ml. Which is impossible. So there's a contradiction here. Which suggests that the sample explanation is incorrect, or that I have a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is wrong, but that's unlikely. Let me think again.\n\nWait the sample explanation says: \"the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2\". So min(6, 80, 100) is 6, divided by 3 is 2. Which is the correct answer. So how did they get 6?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the sample explanation is calculating the total number of toasts possible for each resource, not per friend. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that each toast requires for all friends: nl ml per friend. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, the total drink is t * n * nl. So for the first sample, the total drink available is 4 *5 =20. So t * 3 *3 = t *9 <= 20. So t can be 2 (since 2*9=18 <=20, 3*9=27>20). So the maximum possible t is 2. But according to the sample explanation, the drink allows for 6 toasts. How?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that 20 /3 =6. So that suggests that per toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml. Which would be if for each toast, all friends together need 3 ml. Which would be nl =3, but divided by n. So this seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is that each toast requires nl ml per friend. But the number of toasts is the same for each friend. So for example, each friend can make t toasts. So for each friend, the total drink is t * nl. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that the total drink is 20, and the total required per toast is 3. So 20 /3 is 6. So that would be if the total per toast is 3 ml. Which would be if per toast, all friends together need 3 ml. Which would be nl =3 /n. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nSo what's the correct way to interpret the problem? The sample explanation indicates that the drink is calculated as total_drink / nl, which would be (k*l) / nl. Which would be the number of toasts possible if each toast requires nl ml in total. But that contradicts the problem statement. But the sample explanation is part of the problem statement, so I must trust that.\n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. But the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink required is n * t * nl. But in the sample explanation, they have 20ml, and 20 /3 is 6. So that would be t = 6. Then 3*6*3 = 54, which is larger than 20. Which doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the number of toasts is t, and each friend makes one toast. So the total drink is n * nl. So the number of toasts is limited by how many times you can do this. But then, the number of toasts would be the same as the number of times you can do this, but the problem says that they want to make as many toasts as possible, with each friend making the same amount. So perhaps the number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend has to have their own drink, etc. So for t toasts, each friend has t toasts, so the total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that for the first sample, the drink is sufficient for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would suggest that t is 6, and total drink is 3 *6 *3 =54, which is more than 20. So this is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the total number of toasts is t, and each toast is made by all friends. So for each toast, each friend takes nl ml. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. Which is what I thought earlier. But then in the sample explanation, they have 20ml, and t * n * nl = t *3*3 =9t. 9t <=20 → t=2. So why does the sample explanation say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me look at the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → Output is 2.\n\nSample explanation says:\n\ndrink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. So that's 20 divided by 3. Which is 6.666, so 6. Then, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Salt is enough for 100 toasts. Then the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3 equals 2.\n\nWait, why divided by 3? Because there are 3 friends. But why?\n\nAh! Oh! Maybe the sample explanation is wrong in its wording. Perhaps the actual calculation is that the maximum number of toasts possible is the minimum of (total_drink / (n * nl), total_slices /n, total_salt/(n * np)), and then that's the answer. But in the sample explanation, they are taking the min of 6, 80, 100, and then dividing by 3. Which is not matching with the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sample explanation is wrong. Let me think of the correct approach.\n\nLet me try to think of the sample input and see what the correct answer should be.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=3 friends.\n\nk=4 bottles, l=5ml → total drink is 4*5=20ml.\n\nEach toast requires for each friend: nl=3ml, so for one toast, each friend uses 3ml. For all friends, 3 *3 =9 ml per toast. So total toasts possible from drink is 20 // 9 = 2. So 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 slices per lime → total slices is 10*8=80. Each toast requires n=3 slices. So 80//3 =26 toasts.\n\nSalt: p=100 grams. Each toast requires np=1 gram per friend. So per toast, 3*1=3 grams. 100//3 =33 toasts.\n\nThe minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. So the sample explanation is wrong. But why does the sample explanation say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nBecause in the sample explanation, they have 20 /3 =6. Which is 20 divided by nl, not by n * nl. So perhaps the sample explanation is wrong, but the correct approach is what I thought earlier.\n\nBut then, why is the sample explanation written that way? Maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement. But regardless, the correct code should follow the logic of the problem statement, not the sample explanation.\n\nBut how to resolve this?\n\nWell, let's look at the note in the problem statement. It says:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, this is the sample explanation. According to this, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. But according to the correct calculation, it's 20/(3*3) = 2.222. So why is the sample explanation saying 20/3 =6?\n\nAh! Oh! Oh! I think I see now. The sample explanation is calculating the total number of toasts that can be made if each toast requires nl ml per person. But the number of toasts is t, and each person makes t toasts. So the total drink needed is n * t * nl. But the sample explanation is calculating the total drink divided by nl, which is (k*l)/nl, which gives the maximum number of toasts per person. But since all friends must make the same number of toasts, the total number of toasts per person is t. So the total drink is n * t * nl. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). However, the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for (k*l)/nl toasts, which would be t_total = (k*l)/nl. But then, since there are n friends, each making t_total toasts, the total drink would be n * t_total * nl = n * (k*l / nl) * nl = n *k*l. Which is way more than available. So this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, but the actual correct approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum number of toasts possible, and take the minimum of those.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is considered to allow for 6 toasts. Then, since there are 3 friends, the answer is 6 / 3 = 2. So perhaps the sample explanation is thinking that the drink allows for 6 toasts per person, and then dividing by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per person. Which would be wrong.\n\nBut this suggests that the actual calculation for the drink is (k*l) / nl, which is the number of toasts per person. But then, the total drink required for t toasts per person is n * t * nl. So t can be up to (k*l) // (n * nl). Which is the same as (k*l // nl) //n ?\n\nNo, for example, in the sample input:\n\nk*l =20, nl=3. 20//3 is 6. Then, divided by n=3, 6//3=2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAh! So perhaps the sample explanation is calculating (k*l)//nl, then dividing by n. Which would give the correct answer.\n\nSo the sample explanation says that drink allows for 6 toasts (which is (20//3)=6), then divides by 3 (number of friends), giving 2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nBut why is that the case? Let me think.\n\nIf the total number of toasts per person is t, then the total drink required is n * t * nl. So:\n\nn * t * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nWhich is the same as t ≤ ((k*l) / nl) / n → t ≤ (k*l // nl) // n ?\n\nNo, because (k*l) / nl is not necessarily an integer. But when you take floor division, it's possible that (k*l // nl) //n is the same as (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nFor example, in the first sample:\n\nk*l=20, nl=3 → 20//3=6. n=3. 6//3=2. Which is the same as 20/(3*3) = 2.222, floor is 2.\n\nYes. So in this case, both approaches give the same result.\n\nAnother example: suppose k*l= 10, nl=3, n=2. Then:\n\n(k*l) // (n * nl) = 10 // (2*3) = 10//6=1.\n\nAlternatively, (k*l // nl) //n = (10//3) //2 = 3//2=1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: k*l= 7, nl=3, n=2. 7// (2*3) = 7//6=1. (7//3) is 2, divided by 2 is 1. Same.\n\nSo in general, (k*l) // (n * nl) is equal to ((k*l) // nl) //n ?\n\nIs that always true? Let me see.\n\nLet me suppose that k*l = a * nl + b, where 0 ≤b < nl.\n\nThen (k*l) // nl =a.\n\nSo ((k*l) // nl) //n = a //n.\n\nOn the other hand, (k*l) // (n * nl) = floor( (a * nl +b) / (n * nl )) = floor( a/n + b/(n * nl )) = floor(a/n) since b/(n * nl) is less than 1/(n).\n\nSo floor(a/n) is equal to a//n. So yes, the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nThus, the sample explanation is correct in that the drink can provide (k*l) // nl toasts per person, but then divided by n to get the number of toasts per person. But why is that the case?\n\nBecause the total number of toasts per person is t. So for each person, t toasts. Total drink is n * t * nl. So solving for t, t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl). Which is the same as t ≤ floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ). Which is the same as floor( (k*l // nl) /n ), since (k*l) // nl is floor(k*l / nl) = a. So floor(a /n) is the same as floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ).\n\nSo the sample explanation's approach is correct, but they explain it in a way that may be confusing.\n\nSo this suggests that the correct way to calculate the maximum number of toasts per person is:\n\nFor each resource, calculate how much it can contribute, then take the minimum of those.\n\nFor the drink:\n\nmax_toast_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nFor the limes:\n\nmax_toast_lime = (c*d) // n\n\nFor the salt:\n\nmax_toast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo that's the correct approach.\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\ndrink: (4*5) // (3 *3) = 20//9 = 2.\n\nlimes: (10*8) //3 = 80//3 =26.\n\nsalt: 100 // (3*1) = 33.\n\nminimum is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code needs to calculate these three values and take the minimum.\n\nSo the steps for the code are:\n\nRead the input numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l.\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d.\n\nmax_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p.\n\nmax_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nPrint result.\n\nYes. That's the correct approach.\n\nNow, let's check the second sample input.\n\nSample input 2: ['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\nnl=4. So max_drink is 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20 =50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → total slices 19. max_lime = 19//5 =3.\n\nsalt: p=90. np=3. n*np=5*3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink is 1,000,000.\n\nnl=50. So max_drink = 1e6 / (10 *50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\nlimes: c=25, d=23 → total slices 25*23=575. max_lime = 575 //10 =57.\n\nsalt: p=1. np=1. n*np=10*1=10. 1//10=0. So min(2000, 57, 0) → 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nThe code needs to read the input line as integers. The input is given as a single line with 8 integers.\n\nWait, the input is given as a single line with positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo the code will read a line, split into parts, and convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the three values as above.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nmax_lime = total_lime // n\n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nInput line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n * nl =3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_lime=10*8=80 → 80//3=26.\n\nmax_salt: 100/(3*1)= 33.333 → 33. So min(2, 26, 33) → 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, handle edge cases.\n\nWhat if any of the denominators is zero? No, the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. So n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np are all ≥1. So no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when the division results in zero. Like the third sample.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when one of the resources is zero. But since all inputs are ≥1, that's not possible.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices available, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Constraints**: For each resource, determine how many toasts can be made based on the constraints:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available drink considering each friend needs a certain amount per toast.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available lime slices considering each friend needs one slice per toast.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available salt considering each friend needs a certain amount per toast.\n3. **Determine the Minimum**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Therefore, take the minimum value from the constraints calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntotal_lime = c * d\nmax_lime = total_lime // n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers which are read and parsed into variables representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. The maximum number of toasts based on drink is determined by dividing this total by the product of the number of friends and the milliliters needed per toast per friend.\n3. **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. The maximum number of toasts based on lime slices is determined by dividing this total by the number of friends.\n4. **Salt Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts based on salt is determined by dividing the total grams of salt by the product of the number of friends and the grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value among the maximum toasts possible from each resource, ensuring all friends can make the same number of toasts without any resource running out.",
