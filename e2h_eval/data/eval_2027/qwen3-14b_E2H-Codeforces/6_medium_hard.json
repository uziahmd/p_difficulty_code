Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Leha wanting to choose two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x days, and they don't overlap. And we need to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. The vouchers are given with li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. The two vouchers must not intersect, meaning one ends before the other starts. So for two vouchers i and j, either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\nThe approach here is to find pairs of vouchers where the sum of their durations is exactly x, and they are non-overlapping. Then find the minimum cost among all such pairs.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check all possible pairs? Because n can be up to 2e5, checking all O(n²) pairs is impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. For each voucher, we can consider it as the first part of the pair, and look for another voucher that starts after the first ends, and has duration equal to (x - duration of first). Similarly, we can also consider the second voucher being the first part, and the first being the second part.\n\nWait, but how to structure this?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, calculate their durations. For each voucher, store li, ri, cost, duration.\n\n2. For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher that starts after this one ends, and has duration equal to (x - current duration). Also, check if there exists another voucher that ends before this one starts, and has duration equal to (x - current duration). But how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher with duration d, we can look for vouchers with duration (x - d) that are non-overlapping with it.\n\nBut even this seems challenging. Let's think about grouping vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time (or start time?), so that we can query quickly.\n\nBut then, for each voucher i with duration d, we need to find vouchers with duration (x - d) that end before li (so that they are before the current voucher), or start after ri (so that they are after the current voucher). So for each voucher, we can check two possibilities: find a voucher with duration (x - d) that ends before li, and find a voucher with duration (x - d) that starts after ri.\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost for those cases?\n\nLet me think about the data structures. Suppose for each duration k, we have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time (ri), so that for a given li, we can find all vouchers with duration k that end before li. Since we need the minimal cost, perhaps we can precompute for each duration k, a prefix min array, so that when we query for vouchers ending before a certain time, we can get the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers with duration k, sorted by start time (li), and for a given ri, find the minimal cost of vouchers that start after ri.\n\nWait, maybe for each duration k, we can have two structures:\n\n- A list sorted by end time (ri), and for each position in the list, store the minimum cost up to that point. So when we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration k that end before a certain time, we can perform a binary search on the sorted list of end times to find the largest end time <= target (li-1), and then take the min cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers with duration k sorted by start time (li), and for a given ri, find the first voucher in the list where li > ri. Then, the minimal cost in the suffix of the list from that index onwards.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into groups based on their duration. For each duration, we have two sorted lists:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time (ri), and for each position, have a prefix minimum of cost. This allows us to find the minimal cost of vouchers with that duration that end before a certain time.\n\n   b. Sorted by start time (li), and for each position, have a suffix minimum of cost. This allows us to find the minimal cost of vouchers with that duration that start after a certain time.\n\nThen, for each voucher i with duration d, we check if x - d is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our groups). For each such case, we need to find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration (x - d) that end before li (so that they don't overlap with voucher i) or start after ri (so that they don't overlap with voucher i).\n\nSo for each voucher i:\n\nCompute target_duration = x - d_i.\n\nIf target_duration is not present in our duration groups, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Find a voucher j with duration target_duration that ends before li (so j's ri < li). Then, the pair (j, i) is non-overlapping.\n\nCase 2: Find a voucher j with duration target_duration that starts after ri (so j's li > ri). Then, the pair (i, j) is non-overlapping.\n\nFor both cases, we need to find the minimal cost of such j vouchers.\n\nSo for each voucher i, we can compute the minimal cost for case 1 and case 2, and keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement these two cases efficiently.\n\nFor case 1: For vouchers of target_duration, sorted by end time, we can find the maximum end time that is less than li. Then, the minimal cost among all vouchers up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: For vouchers of target_duration, sorted by start time, find the first voucher with start time greater than ri. Then, the minimal cost from that index onwards.\n\nSo for each duration, we need to have:\n\n- A list sorted by end time, along with a prefix min array.\n\n- A list sorted by start time, along with a suffix min array.\n\nLet me think about how to construct these.\n\nFor example, for duration k:\n\nWe collect all vouchers with duration k.\n\nSort them by end time (ri), and create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in the sorted list.\n\nSimilarly, sort them by start time (li), and create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i-th element to the end.\n\nOnce these are built, for any query, we can perform binary search.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, say duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are the lists of vouchers with that duration.\n\nFor each duration k in duration_dict:\n\n   a. Sort the list of vouchers by ri (end time) and create a prefix_min array.\n\n   b. Sort the list of vouchers by li (start time) and create a suffix_min array.\n\nBut wait, for the same duration, the vouchers may be in different orders. So for each duration, we need two separate sorted lists.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher i:\n\n   d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\n   target = x - d_i.\n\n   if target is not in duration_dict, continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      For case 1: find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration target that end before li.\n\n         To do this, look into the sorted list (by end time) of target duration. For each voucher in that list, their end time is ri. We need to find the largest ri that is < li. Once found, the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\n      For case 2: find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration target that start after ri.\n\n         Look into the sorted list (by start time) of target duration. Find the first li that is > ri. All vouchers from that index onwards have start time > ri. The suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we can check both cases and accumulate the minimal total cost.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement these steps correctly and efficiently.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures for each duration.\n\nFor example, for a given duration k, the list sorted by end time (ri):\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers with duration k, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nprefix_min array is built as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0].cost\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for the sorted_by_start list, which is sorted by li:\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers with duration k, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\nsuffix_min array:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1].cost\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n   suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i].cost)\n\nOnce these are built, for each query, we can perform a binary search.\n\nNow, for case 1:\n\nWe have to find the maximum ri in the sorted_by_end list that is < li. Let's say the list is sorted in ascending order of ri.\n\nWe can perform a binary search to find the rightmost ri that is less than li. If found, then the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nFor example, using bisect_left or bisect_right. Let me think: suppose we have a list of end times, sorted. We can use bisect_left to find the insertion point of li. The index before that insertion point would be the last element less than li.\n\nFor example, in Python, the bisect module's bisect_left function returns the first index where the element can be inserted. So, if we have a list A sorted, and we want to find the largest element less than x, then the insertion index is pos, and the elements before pos are <= x. Wait, no: bisect_left returns the first position where x can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. So, for elements less than x, they are before the insertion point. So, if we have a list of end times, sorted, then the largest end time less than li is at index pos-1, where pos is the bisect_left of li in the list.\n\nBut if pos is 0, then there are no elements less than li. So, in that case, case 1 is not possible.\n\nOnce we find that pos, if pos >0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min[pos-1].\n\nSimilarly for case 2:\n\nIn the sorted_by_start list (sorted by li), we need to find the first voucher whose li is > ri. Let's say the list is sorted in ascending order of li. So, we can use bisect_right to find the first element greater than ri. For example, the insertion point for ri in the list (using bisect_right) gives the index where elements after that are larger than ri. So, the minimal cost would be the suffix_min starting at that index.\n\nBut how to handle that. For example, if the list is [1,3,5,7], and we want to find elements > 4. The bisect_right of 4 is 2 (since 3 is the last element <=4). So elements from index 2 onwards are 5 and 7, which are >4.\n\nSo, for the suffix_min array, if the index is idx, then the minimal cost is suffix_min[idx] (if idx is within the array length). If idx is beyond the array length, then there are no such elements.\n\nSo, putting this together, for each voucher i:\n\nCompute target = x - d_i.\n\nIf target is not in duration_dict, skip.\n\nElse:\n\n   For case 1:\n\n      Get the sorted_by_end list for target.\n\n      Get the list of end times (say, ends = [v.ri for v in sorted_by_end]).\n\n      Use bisect_left to find pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, li).\n\n      if pos >0:\n\n          current_min = prefix_min[pos-1]\n\n          total_cost = current_min + voucher_i.cost\n\n          update the global minimum.\n\n   For case 2:\n\n      Get the sorted_by_start list for target.\n\n      Get the list of starts (starts = [v.li for v in sorted_by_start]).\n\n      Use bisect.bisect_right(starts, ri) to find idx.\n\n      if idx < len(starts):\n\n          current_min = suffix_min[idx]\n\n          total_cost = current_min + voucher_i.cost\n\n          update the global minimum.\n\nBut wait, for case 2, the voucher j must start after ri. So, j's li > ri. So, in the starts list (sorted), find the first element > ri. The bisect_right returns the insertion point after all elements <= ri. So, elements from idx onwards are > ri.\n\nThus, the suffix_min from idx gives the minimal cost in that range.\n\nSo, this approach should work.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nFor example, when x is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, no: the problem says x is given as per input. Wait, the input constraints say 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105). So x is at least 2. So, the sum of durations must be exactly x. So, for each voucher, its duration d_i must be between 1 and x-1 (since the other voucher must have duration x - d_i ≥ 1).\n\nSo, during processing, for each voucher, we can check if x - d_i is ≥ 1. Otherwise, we can skip. But since x is at least 2, and d_i is at least 1, then x -d_i can be 0 (if d_i =x). But then, we need to find a voucher with duration 0, which is impossible. So, in that case, we can skip.\n\nSo during processing, for each voucher, we compute target = x -d_i. If target < 1, we can skip.\n\nBut in the code, when we check if target is in the duration_dict, that would automatically take care of that, since duration_dict only contains durations that are present in the vouchers.\n\nSo, for example, if target is zero, then since no voucher has duration zero, the code will not process it.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers, each with li, ri, cost. Compute duration for each as ri - li + 1.\n\nNow, build the duration_dict. For each duration, collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, process the two sorted lists and their prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through each voucher in the original list, and for each, check the two cases.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nImplementing the duration_dict:\n\nWe can use a defaultdict, where the keys are durations, and the values are lists of vouchers. Each voucher can be represented as a tuple (li, ri, cost).\n\nOnce we have that, for each duration in the duration_dict, we need to:\n\nSort the vouchers by ri, and create the prefix_min array.\n\nSort the vouchers by li, and create the suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to store these sorted lists and their min arrays?\n\nPerhaps, for each duration, we can have two entries in the duration_dict:\n\n- sorted_by_end: list of vouchers sorted by ri, and a prefix_min array.\n\n- sorted_by_start: list of vouchers sorted by li, and a suffix_min array.\n\nBut perhaps, for each duration, we can pre-process these and store them.\n\nSo, for example, in Python:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_data = defaultdict(lambda: {'end_sorted': [], 'start_sorted': []})\n\nBut perhaps, better to process each duration once, and for each, generate the sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nOnce that's done, during the processing of each voucher, we can check for target durations.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = list()\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = r - l + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n\nThen, build duration_dict:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n\n    duration_dict[dur].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, we process the sorted lists and min arrays.\n\nBut how to store them? Maybe create another dictionary, say, for each duration, a tuple (end_sorted_list, prefix_min), (start_sorted_list, suffix_min).\n\nBut perhaps, for each duration, we can precompute:\n\nFor end_sorted:\n\nsorted by ri, then compute prefix min.\n\nSimilarly for start_sorted sorted by li, compute suffix min.\n\nSo, for each duration k in duration_dict:\n\nend_sorted = sorted( duration_dict[k], key=lambda x: x[1] )  # sorted by ri\n\nprefix_min = [ ... ]\n\nSimilarly, start_sorted = sorted( duration_dict[k], key=lambda x: x[0] )  # sorted by li\n\nsuffix_min = [ ... ]\n\nWe can store these in another structure, say:\n\npreprocessed = defaultdict( lambda: ( [], [], [], [] ) )\n\nBut perhaps, for each duration, we can store:\n\nend_sorted, prefix_min, start_sorted, suffix_min.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor dur in duration_dict:\n\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n\n    end_list = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n\n    # create prefix min array\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(end_list)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = end_list[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(end_list)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], end_list[i][2] )\n\n    # process start_sorted and suffix_min\n\n    start_list = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(start_list)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = start_list[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(start_list)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], start_list[i][2] )\n\n    # store in preprocessed\n\n    preprocessed[dur] = (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min )\n\nWait, but the end_list is sorted by ri, and the start_list is sorted by li. Then, for each dur, preprocessed[dur] holds these four elements.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, we can process as follows:\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nfor l_i, r_i, cost_i, dur_i in vouchers:\n\n    target = x - dur_i\n\n    if target < 1:\n\n        continue\n\n    if target not in preprocessed:\n\n        continue\n\n    # process case 1: find vouchers with target duration that end before l_i\n\n    end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min = preprocessed[target]\n\n    # get the list of end times for end_list\n\n    ends = [v[1] for v in end_list]\n\n    # find the largest end time < l_i\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, l_i)\n\n    if pos > 0:\n\n        min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n\n        total = min_cost_case1 + cost_i\n\n        if total < current_min:\n\n            current_min = total\n\n    # process case 2: find vouchers with target duration that start after r_i\n\n    starts = [v[0] for v in start_list]\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(starts, r_i)\n\n    if idx < len(starts):\n\n        min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[idx]\n\n        total = min_cost_case2 + cost_i\n\n        if total < current_min:\n\n            current_min = total\n\nAfter checking all vouchers, if the current_min is still infinity, output -1, else output current_min.\n\nWait, but there's a problem here. For each voucher, we are considering it as the first voucher (the one that is paired with another voucher). However, in case 1, the voucher j (with target duration) is before voucher i. So, voucher j's end is before l_i. So, the pair is (j, i). But the voucher i's duration is dur_i, and j's duration is target. So their sum is x. Similarly for case 2, the pair is (i, j), where j is after i.\n\nBut what about the case where voucher j is the same as voucher i? Well, since the problem says i != j, but in the code, when we process voucher i, we are looking for any voucher j (including those with same duration, but different indices). However, the code as written may include voucher i itself if it's in the target duration. But how?\n\nBecause, for example, if a voucher i has duration d, and target = x -d. Suppose target is d, and x = 2d. Then, the code would look for vouchers with duration d. But if voucher i is in that list, then during case 1, when looking for vouchers with end before l_i, it's possible that voucher i is in the list. However, since the voucher i's end time is r_i, which is >= l_i (since l_i <= r_i). So, in case 1, the voucher i's end time is r_i, which is >= l_i. So, during the bisect_left, the pos would be the insertion point for l_i in the ends list. For example, if voucher i's end time is r_i, which is >= l_i, then the pos would be such that ends[pos] is the first element >= l_i. So, if voucher i is in the list, then during case 1, the code would not select it (since pos is the insertion point, and pos-1 would be elements < l_i. But voucher i's end time is r_i, which is >= l_i. So, if voucher i is in the list, then during case 1, it's not considered. Similarly, for case 2, the voucher i's start time is l_i, which is <= r_i. So, when looking for vouchers with start time > r_i, the voucher i's l_i is not > r_i, so it's not considered. Thus, the code would not select the same voucher twice.\n\nBut what if there are two vouchers with the same duration and same l and r? For example, two vouchers with same l, r, cost. Then, during processing, when voucher i is processed, the code would find voucher j (another voucher) with same parameters, and thus, the code would include it. So the code handles that.\n\nThus, the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3 (3-1+1=3)\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2 (6-5+1=2)\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nSo x is 5. So for each voucher:\n\nTake the first voucher (dur 3). target is 5-3=2. So look for vouchers with duration 2.\n\npreprocessed for duration 2:\n\nend_list is sorted by ri. The vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: l=1, r=2, cost 5 → ri=2.\n\nvoucher 4: l=1, r=2, cost 4 → ri=2.\n\nvoucher 3: l=5, r=6, cost 1 → ri=6.\n\nSo sorted by ri, end_list would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? Or wait, the vouchers are stored as (l, r, cost). So when sorted by r, the order would be:\n\nvoucher 2 (r=2), voucher 4 (r=2), voucher 3 (r=6). So the end_list is sorted by r, so the ends list would be [2, 2, 6].\n\nprefix_min would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4, 1)=1].\n\nSo for case 1: voucher i is (1,3,4), l_i is 1. So looking for vouchers with duration 2 that end before l_i (which is 1). The ends list is [2, 2, 6]. bisect_left(ends, 1) would return 0, since 1 is inserted before the first element. So pos is 0, which is not >0. So case 1 is not possible.\n\nFor case 2: looking for vouchers with duration 2 that start after r_i (3). The start_list for duration 2 is sorted by l. The vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: l=1, voucher 4: l=1, voucher 3: l=5. So sorted by l, the start_list is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. The starts list is [1,1,5]. Now, for r_i=3. We want to find the first start >3. Using bisect_right on [1,1,5], looking for 3. bisect_right returns 2 (since 3 is inserted after the two 1s). idx is 2, which is less than len(starts) (3). So suffix_min[2] is 1. So case 2 gives 1 + 4 = 5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo during the processing of the first voucher, this case is found.\n\nAnother voucher that contributes to the answer is the third voucher (5,6,1) with duration 2. Its target is 5-2=3. So looking for vouchers with duration 3. Which is the first voucher (duration 3). So for case 1: check if there's a voucher with duration 3 that ends before l_i (5). The voucher with duration 3 is (1,3,4). Its ri is 3 <5. So during case 1, for this voucher (third voucher), target is 3. So for the duration 3, the end_list is sorted by ri. The end_list is [(1,3,4)], ends = [3]. So bisect_left(ends, 5) returns 1. pos is 1>0. So prefix_min[0] is 4. So case 1 gives 4 + 1 =5. Which is the same as before. So the code would capture this.\n\nThus, the code would find the correct answer.\n\nNow, for the code, the problem is to implement all this correctly.\n\nBut let's think about the possible issues.\n\nFirst, the preprocessed data structure. How to store for each duration the end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min.\n\nIn Python, perhaps:\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor dur in duration_dict:\n\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n\n    end_list = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n\n    # create prefix_min array\n\n    prefix_min = []\n\n    if end_list:\n\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(end_list)\n\n        prefix_min[0] = end_list[0][2]\n\n        for i in range(1, len(end_list)):\n\n            prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], end_list[i][2] )\n\n    else:\n\n        prefix_min = []\n\n    # process start_sorted and suffix_min\n\n    start_list = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\n    suffix_min = []\n\n    if start_list:\n\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(start_list)\n\n        suffix_min[-1] = start_list[-1][2]\n\n        for i in range(len(start_list)-2, -1, -1):\n\n            suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], start_list[i][2] )\n\n    else:\n\n        suffix_min = []\n\n    preprocessed[dur] = (end_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min )\n\nBut in code, during the processing of each voucher, when target is checked, we need to check if target is in preprocessed. Because for some durations, the duration_dict may have entries, but during preprocessing, if there are no vouchers (but that's not possible since duration_dict is built from vouchers). Wait, no. The duration_dict is built from vouchers. So for each dur in duration_dict, there is at least one voucher. Thus, the preprocessed will have entries for all durations present in duration_dict.\n\nNow, during the processing of each voucher, for case 1 and case 2, the code may need to access the end_list and start_list. For example, if target is in preprocessed, then end_list is available.\n\nBut during the case 1, when we get the end_list, we need to generate the list of ends (the ri's) for binary search.\n\nBut in code, for each voucher, during case 1:\n\nend_list, prefix_min, start_list, suffix_min = preprocessed[target]\n\nends = [v[1] for v in end_list]\n\nBut this is O(k) time for each case. However, since this is done for each voucher, and for each target duration, this could be O(n) time in total. But with n up to 2e5, this could be O(n^2) time in worst case.\n\nWait, that's a problem. For example, if all vouchers have the same duration, then for each voucher, during case 1 and case 2, we generate ends and starts lists. Which would be O(n) per voucher, leading to O(n^2) time.\n\nThis is not acceptable for n=2e5. So this approach is not efficient enough.\n\nAh! Here's a mistake. For each target duration, during preprocessing, we can store the list of ri's (for end_list) and the list of li's (for start_list). So that during the binary search steps, we don't have to recompute them each time.\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration, we can store:\n\nend_list (sorted by ri), and a list ends = [v[1] for v in end_list].\n\nSimilarly, start_list (sorted by li), and a list starts = [v[0] for v in start_list].\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration, we can precompute these lists and store them.\n\nThus, during the voucher processing steps, for case 1, we can get the ends list directly from the preprocessed data, instead of recomputing it each time.\n\nSo modifying the preprocessing:\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor dur in duration_dict:\n\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n\n    end_list = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n\n    ends = [v[1] for v in end_list]\n\n    # create prefix_min array\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(end_list)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = end_list[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(end_list)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], end_list[i][2] )\n\n    # process start_sorted and suffix_min\n\n    start_list = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\n    starts = [v[0] for v in start_list]\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(start_list)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = start_list[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(start_list)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], start_list[i][2] )\n\n    preprocessed[dur] = (ends, prefix_min, starts, suffix_min )\n\nWait, no. The preprocessed for each dur should store the ends list, prefix_min, starts list, suffix_min. So during the voucher processing, for case 1, we can get ends from preprocessed[target][0], and prefix_min from preprocessed[target][1].\n\nSo during preprocessing, the code for each duration would be:\n\npreprocessed[dur] = (ends, prefix_min, starts, suffix_min )\n\nThus, during voucher processing, for case 1:\n\nends = preprocessed[target][0]\n\nprefix_min = preprocessed[target][1]\n\nSimilarly for case 2:\n\nstarts = preprocessed[target][2]\n\nsuffix_min = preprocessed[target][3]\n\nThis way, the ends and starts lists are precomputed once, and not generated each time during voucher processing.\n\nThis reduces the time complexity.\n\nSo now, the code for voucher processing becomes:\n\nfor l_i, r_i, cost_i, dur_i in vouchers:\n\n    target = x - dur_i\n\n    if target < 1:\n\n        continue\n\n    if target not in preprocessed:\n\n        continue\n\n    # case 1: find vouchers with target duration that end before l_i\n\n    ends, prefix_min, starts, suffix_min = preprocessed[target]\n\n    # find pos in ends\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, l_i)\n\n    if pos > 0:\n\n        min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n\n        total = min_cost_case1 + cost_i\n\n        if total < current_min:\n\n            current_min = total\n\n    # case 2: find vouchers with target duration that start after r_i\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(starts, r_i)\n\n    if idx < len(starts):\n\n        min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[idx]\n\n        total = min_cost_case2 + cost_i\n\n        if total < current_min:\n\n            current_min = total\n\nThis is O(1) per case for each voucher, except for the binary search steps.\n\nNow, the preprocessing is O(n log n) for each duration, since for each duration, we sort the vouchers. But overall, the total time for preprocessing is O(n log n), since all vouchers are processed once.\n\nNow, the code should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, let's think about the code in Python.\n\nBut first, the initial steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, each with l, r, cost.\n\nCompute duration as r - l + 1.\n\nStore all vouchers in a list.\n\nThen, build duration_dict as a defaultdict(list) where for each duration, we append (l, r, cost).\n\nThen, preprocess each duration in duration_dict into preprocessed, which stores ends, prefix_min, starts, suffix_min.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through all vouchers and check for possible pairs.\n\nNow, in Python, the bisect module can be used for binary search.\n\nBut for case 1, the ends list is sorted, and we want to find the insertion point of l_i.\n\nSimilarly for case 2, the starts list is sorted, and we want to find the insertion point of r_i using bisect_right.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo duration_dict:\n\n3: [(1,3,4)]\n\n2: [(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)]\n\npreprocessing for duration 2:\n\nend_list is sorted by ri. The vouchers are:\n\n(1,2,5) ri=2; (1,2,4) ri=2; (5,6,1) ri=6. So ends is [2,2,6]. prefix_min is [5,4,1].\n\nstart_list is sorted by li. The vouchers are (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1). starts is [1,1,5]. suffix_min is [1,1,1].\n\nWait:\n\nsuffix_min is computed as follows:\n\nstart_list is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]\n\nsuffix_min for index 2 is 1.\n\nindex 1: min(4, suffix_min[2]=1) → 1.\n\nindex 0: min(5, suffix_min[1]=1) → 1.\n\nSo suffix_min is [1,1,1].\n\nSo for case 2, when voucher is (1,3,4) (dur 3, target 2), starts is [1,1,5], r_i is 3.\n\nbisect_right([1,1,5], 3) → returns 2. idx=2 <3. suffix_min[2] is 1. So total is 1+4=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, for the third voucher (5,6,1) with duration 2, target is 5-2=3. preprocessed for duration 3:\n\nends is [3], prefix_min is [4]. starts is [1], suffix_min is [4].\n\nSo during case 1, for this voucher, l_i is 5. ends is [3]. bisect_left(ends, 5) returns 1. pos is 1>0. prefix_min[0] is 4. total is 4+1=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code would find this.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImport necessary modules:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read the vouchers.\n\nThen build the duration_dict.\n\nThen preprocess.\n\nThen for each voucher, check cases.\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nFinally, if answer is still infinity, output -1, else output the answer.\n\nNow,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, x, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing Vouchers by Duration**: Group vouchers by their durations. This allows us to efficiently search for vouchers with specific durations later.\n2. **Sorting and Minimization Arrays**: For each duration, sort vouchers by their end times and start times. Additionally, create prefix minimum arrays for end-sorted vouchers and suffix minimum arrays for start-sorted vouchers. These arrays help quickly determine the minimum cost of valid vouchers.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with the required complementary duration that starts after or ends before the current voucher. Use binary search to efficiently find these valid vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost, duration))\n    \n    # Build duration_dict\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[dur].append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess each duration\n    preprocessed = {}\n    for dur in duration_dict:\n        # Process end_sorted and prefix_min\n        end_list = sorted(duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ends = [v[1] for v in end_list]\n        prefix_min = []\n        if end_list:\n            prefix_min = [0] * len(end_list)\n            prefix_min[0] = end_list[0][2]\n            for i in range(1, len(end_list)):\n                prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_list[i][2])\n        \n        # Process start_sorted and suffix_min\n        start_list = sorted(duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts = [v[0] for v in start_list]\n        suffix_min = []\n        if start_list:\n            suffix_min = [0] * len(start_list)\n            suffix_min[-1] = start_list[-1][2]\n            for i in range(len(start_list)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], start_list[i][2])\n        \n        preprocessed[dur] = (ends, prefix_min, starts, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for l_i, r_i, cost_i, dur_i in vouchers:\n        target = x - dur_i\n        if target < 1:\n            continue\n        if target not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        \n        ends, prefix_min, starts, suffix_min = preprocessed[target]\n        \n        # Case 1: find vouchers with target duration that end before l_i\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, l_i)\n        if pos > 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[pos-1]\n            total = current_min + cost_i\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n        \n        # Case 2: find vouchers with target duration that start after r_i\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(starts, r_i)\n        if idx < len(starts):\n            current_min = suffix_min[idx]\n            total = current_min + cost_i\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each represented by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their durations using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end times and start times.
