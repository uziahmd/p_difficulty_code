Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the task is to find two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the sum of their costs is as small as possible. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the duration is. Oh right, the duration is ri - li + 1. So for each voucher, we can calculate that. Then, for two vouchers i and j, their durations should sum to x. Also, they must not overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nSo the approach here is to find pairs of vouchers where one has duration d, the other has duration x - d, and they don't overlap. And find the minimum cost among all such pairs.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently? Because n can be up to 2e5, so O(n^2) is impossible. So we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think. For each voucher, if we can find another voucher that has a duration of (x - duration_i), and that doesn't overlap with it. But how?\n\nMaybe we can pre-process vouchers grouped by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time (or start time?), and also track the minimum cost for certain ranges.\n\nWait, but for each voucher with duration d, we need to find a voucher with duration (x - d) that starts after this voucher ends, or ends before this voucher starts.\n\nSo for each voucher i with duration d, we can look for vouchers with duration (x - d). Let's say x - d is k. So for each voucher i with duration d, we need to check if there exists a voucher j with duration k that does not overlap with i. And then take the minimal cost for those j's.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the minimal cost of such j's?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. So, for each duration d, we have a list of vouchers. For each such list, perhaps we can sort them by their end time (ri), and also for each voucher, keep track of the minimum cost up to that point. Or maybe for each duration, we have a sorted list of start and end times, along with their costs.\n\nBut how to find for a given voucher i (with duration d), the minimal cost of vouchers j with duration k = x - d that end before li (so that j ends before i starts) or start after ri (so that i ends before j starts). Wait, but for each voucher i, we need to find vouchers j that are either completely before i or completely after i.\n\nSo for each voucher i with duration d, and k = x -d:\n\n- We need to find vouchers j with duration k that end before li (so that j ends before i starts). So for these j's, they are before i.\n\n- Or find vouchers j with duration k that start after ri (so that i ends before j starts). These j's are after i.\n\nFor each case, we need the minimal cost of such j's.\n\nIf we can find the minimal cost for both cases, then for voucher i, the minimal possible pair is the minimum between the two possibilities (if any).\n\nSo, how can we precompute this?\n\nLet's think about grouping vouchers by their duration. For each duration, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time (ri), and for each position, we can have the minimum cost up to that point. This would help in finding the minimal cost of vouchers that end before a certain time.\n\n- Another sorted by start time (li), and for each position, have the minimum cost from that point onwards. This would help in finding the minimal cost of vouchers that start after a certain time.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration, we can sort the vouchers by their end time, and for each voucher in that list, keep track of the minimum cost so far. Then, for a given li, we can binary search in the sorted list to find all vouchers with end time <= li-1, and take the minimum cost among them.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case, if we sort vouchers by their start time, and for each voucher, have the minimum cost from that start time onward. Then, for a given ri, we can binary search for the earliest start time that is >= ri+1, and take the minimum cost from that point onwards.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, say duration_map, where each key is a duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. For each duration, we will process two sorted structures:\n\n   a) A sorted list of vouchers by their end time (ri), and for each position, the minimum cost up to that index. So when you sort the vouchers by end time, you can create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in the sorted list. This allows us to quickly find the minimum cost for vouchers that end before a certain time.\n\n   b) A sorted list of vouchers by their start time (li), and for each position, the suffix_min array. So suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from index i to the end of the list. This allows us to find the minimum cost for vouchers that start after a certain time.\n\nWait, but for the first case (vouchers ending before li), we can sort the vouchers for duration k by their end time, then for a given li, find all vouchers with end time <= li-1, and take the minimum cost among them. Similarly, for the second case (vouchers starting after ri), we can sort the vouchers for duration k by their start time, and for a given ri, find all vouchers with start time >= ri+1, and take the minimum cost among them.\n\nBut how to compute these minima efficiently?\n\nLet me think for part a: For a given duration k, suppose we have a list of vouchers sorted by end time. For each voucher in this list, we can compute a prefix minimum array. So for example, if the list is sorted by end time, and the prefix_min array is built, then when we want to find the minimum cost of all vouchers with end time <= T, we can perform a binary search on the end times to find the largest end time <= T, and then take the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for part b: For the same duration k, we have a list of vouchers sorted by start time. Then, we can compute a suffix_min array. For a given T, we can binary search the earliest start time >= T, and then take the suffix_min from that index.\n\nSo for each duration, we need to pre-process two sorted lists with their respective prefix/suffix minima.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFirst, for all vouchers, compute their duration. Then group them by duration into duration_map. For each duration in duration_map, we process:\n\n- Sort the vouchers by end time (ri), and build a prefix_min array. This helps in finding the minimal cost of vouchers that end before a certain time.\n\n- Sort the vouchers by start time (li), and build a suffix_min array. This helps in finding the minimal cost of vouchers that start after a certain time.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i with duration d, we can check if x - d is present in the duration_map. If it is, then we can proceed.\n\nLet's say the current voucher has duration d, and we need to find vouchers with duration k = x - d. So for each voucher i, we check if k is present in the duration_map.\n\nIf yes, then:\n\nCase 1: Find vouchers with duration k that end before li (i.e., their ri < li). For this, we look into the sorted list of vouchers with duration k, sorted by end time. We can perform a binary search to find the maximum end time that is <= li - 1. If such vouchers exist, take the prefix_min for that index.\n\nCase 2: Find vouchers with duration k that start after ri (i.e., their li > ri). For this, we look into the sorted list of vouchers with duration k, sorted by start time. We perform a binary search to find the first start time >= ri + 1. Then, take the suffix_min from that index.\n\nFor each voucher i, the minimal cost for case 1 and case 2 (if applicable) would contribute to the overall answer.\n\nWe need to compute this for all vouchers and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps to implement this.\n\nFirst, read all vouchers, compute their durations. Then, group them by duration. For each duration, process the two sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nNow, for each voucher i in the original list, we check if (x - duration_i) exists in duration_map. If it does, then proceed.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases. For example, if x is even, and there are two vouchers of duration x/2 that don't overlap. But they need to be different vouchers.\n\nAlso, when x is 0? Well, according to input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, no. Wait, the input says x is between 2 and 2e5. Wait, the first line says n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5). So x can be as low as 2. So for each voucher, duration_i can be from 1 to ... up to 2e5. So for example, if a voucher has duration d, then x -d must be positive. So for x -d to be positive, d must be less than x. So during the loop over each voucher, we can check if (x -d) is positive. Otherwise, it's not possible to have two vouchers adding up to x.\n\nSo for each voucher i with duration d, if x -d is not positive, then skip. Also, if x -d is not present in the duration_map, skip.\n\nNow, for each voucher i, we check if k = x -d exists in the duration_map. If yes, then proceed to check for case 1 and case 2.\n\nNow, for case 1: find vouchers with duration k that end before li. How to do that?\n\nFor the vouchers with duration k, sorted by end time. Let's call this list sorted_by_end. The end times are in increasing order. So for the current voucher's li, we want the latest end time that is <= li -1. Let's say that is found at index m. Then, the prefix_min[m] is the minimal cost among all vouchers in sorted_by_end[0..m]. If m is valid (i.e., exists), then that's a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: find vouchers with duration k that start after ri. For that, we have the sorted_by_start list, which is sorted by li. So we need to find the first voucher in this list with start time >= ri + 1. All vouchers from that index onwards in the list are candidates. The suffix_min array for this list gives the minimum cost from that index onwards.\n\nSo, for each case, we can get a possible minimal cost, and then take the minimum between the two (if available) and update the global answer.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary searches?\n\nFor case 1, in the sorted_by_end list, we can collect all end times, and perform a binary search for li -1. Let's say the list is sorted in ascending order. So for example, using bisect_right to find the insertion point of li-1, then the index is insertion_point -1. If that index is >=0, then we can take the prefix_min at that index.\n\nFor case 2, in the sorted_by_start list, we can collect all start times, and perform a bisect_left to find the first start time >= ri +1. Then, if the index is within the list, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nNow, the question is, how to pre-process these sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nLet's take an example. For a duration k, suppose the vouchers are:\n\nvoucher1: l=1, r=3, cost=4\n\nvoucher2: l=2, r=4, cost=5\n\nsorted_by_end would be sorted by r. So voucher1 (r=3) comes first, then voucher2 (r=4). The prefix_min array would be [4, min(4,5)=4].\n\nsorted_by_start would be sorted by l. So voucher1 (l=1) first, then voucher2 (l=2). The suffix_min array would be [min(4,5)=4, 5].\n\nSo for case 1, if we need to find vouchers ending before li-1, say li is 4, then li-1 is 3. The insertion point for 3 in the sorted end times [3,4] is 1 (bisect_right returns 1?), so index is 0. Then prefix_min[0] is 4.\n\nFor case 2, if ri is 3, then we want start time >= 4. The sorted start times are [1,2]. The first start time >=4 is none. So no such vouchers.\n\nNow, for each duration in duration_map, we need to pre-process these sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers. For each, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup them into duration_map, which is a dictionary mapping duration to a list of vouchers. Each voucher is a tuple (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_map, we process:\n\n- For sorted_by_end: sort the vouchers by ri. Then create a prefix_min array. For example, for each i in 0..len(sorted_by_end)-1, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i].cost).\n\n- For sorted_by_start: sort the vouchers by li. Then create a suffix_min array. For example, for each i in 0..len(sorted_by_start)-1, suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i].cost). But to compute this, we can iterate from the end to the start.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original list, we check if x - duration_i is a valid duration (i.e., exists in duration_map, and x - duration_i is positive). If yes, then proceed.\n\nNow, for each such voucher i, we get the k = x - duration_i.\n\nThen, for the k duration, we look into the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists.\n\nFor case 1: find if there are any vouchers with duration k that end before li of voucher i. So for that, we take the sorted_by_end list for k, and find the maximum end time <= li -1.\n\nIf such exists, then take the prefix_min for that index.\n\nFor case 2: find if there are any vouchers with duration k that start after ri of voucher i. So for that, we take the sorted_by_start list for k, find the first start time >= ri + 1. Then, take the suffix_min from that index.\n\nNow, the problem is that for each voucher, we have to check both cases, and collect the minimal possible cost.\n\nOnce we have the minimal cost for each voucher, we can track the global minimum.\n\nNow, how to handle the case where there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and overlapping times?\n\nBut the preprocessing handles that by finding the minimal cost in the possible ranges.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search?\n\nIn Python, we can use the bisect module.\n\nFor case 1:\n\nsorted_by_end is sorted by ri. So we can extract a list of end_times = [voucher[1] for voucher in sorted_by_end].\n\nThen, for a target T = li -1, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point. The number of elements <= T is insertion_point. So the index is insertion_point -1. If insertion_point is 0, then there are no such elements.\n\nFor example, if the end_times are [3,4], and T is 3, bisect_right returns 1. insertion_point -1 is 0, which is valid.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nsorted_by_start is sorted by li. So we can extract a list of start_times = [voucher[0] for voucher in sorted_by_start].\n\nFor a target T = ri +1, we can use bisect_left to find the first index where start_time >= T. If that index is within the list, then the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing the preprocessing:\n\nFor each duration in duration_map:\n\n   sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[1])\n\n   end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\n   prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_end)\n\n   prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n\n   for i in 1 to len(sorted_by_end)-1:\n\n       prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2])\n\n   store this sorted_by_end and prefix_min in the duration_map for that duration.\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_by_start:\n\n   sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[0])\n\n   start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n\n   suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n\n   for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n       suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2])\n\n   store sorted_by_start and suffix_min in the duration_map for that duration.\n\nWait, but for each duration, we need to store both the sorted_by_end and its prefix_min, and sorted_by_start and its suffix_min. So perhaps for each duration, we have a structure that contains:\n\n- sorted_by_end list, and end_times list, and prefix_min list.\n\n- sorted_by_start list, and start_times list, and suffix_min list.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can store for each duration in duration_map, a tuple of (sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min).\n\nBut that might be memory intensive, but given that n is 2e5, and per duration, it's O(n) storage, but overall O(n) total.\n\nNow, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d = duration_i\n\n   k = x - d\n\n   if k <=0 or not in duration_map: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      process case 1 and case 2.\n\nNow, for case 1:\n\n   get the sorted_by_end list and prefix_min for k.\n\n   T = li -1\n\n   using bisect.bisect_right(end_times, T) gives insertion_point.\n\n   if insertion_point > 0:\n\n       min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[insertion_point -1]\n\n   else:\n\n       no such voucher.\n\nFor case 2:\n\n   get the sorted_by_start list and suffix_min for k.\n\n   T = ri + 1\n\n   using bisect.bisect_left(start_times, T) gives index.\n\n   if index < len(start_times):\n\n       min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[index]\n\n   else:\n\n       no such voucher.\n\nThen, for both cases, if any of them is possible, take the min between them and the current global minimum.\n\nBut we have to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i. Wait, because the problem says i != j. So for example, if the voucher i is in the duration d, and the voucher j is in duration k, but if k == d, and the voucher j is the same as voucher i, then we need to avoid that.\n\nWait, but in the case when k = d, then x = 2d. So, for example, if x is 2d, and voucher i has duration d, then we need to find another voucher with duration d that does not overlap with i.\n\nBut when we process the vouchers for k = d, the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists may include voucher i itself. However, when checking for case 1 and case 2, the code may pick voucher i as a possible j, which is invalid.\n\nSo how to avoid that?\n\nThis is a problem. For example, if voucher i is in the list of vouchers with duration d, and we are looking for another voucher with duration k = d. Then, when checking case 1 (end before li), if voucher i is in the list, but ends before li (which is not possible since voucher i's end time is ri, and li is the start time of voucher i. So ri >= li. So for case 1, which requires end time <= li -1, which is less than li. Since voucher i's end time is ri >= li, so voucher i cannot be in the case 1. Similarly, for case 2, which requires start time >= ri +1. Voucher i's start time is li, which is <= ri. So ri +1 is larger than li. So voucher i cannot be in case 2. Therefore, when processing voucher i, even if k is equal to d, the code would not select voucher i itself. Because the code is looking for vouchers in the k duration that are before or after voucher i. Since voucher i's own end time is ri, which is >= li, and the case 1 is looking for end time <= li-1. Which is not possible for voucher i. Similarly, case 2 is looking for start time >= ri +1, which is not possible for voucher i. Therefore, the code does not select voucher i itself. Thus, the i and j are different.\n\nTherefore, no need to worry about the same voucher being selected twice. Because when k is d, the code checks for vouchers that are either before or after the current voucher. Since the current voucher can't be in either of those groups, the code is safe.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed without checking for duplicates.\n\nNow, the next step is to code this.\n\nBut first, handling the grouping. Let's think about the data structures.\n\nImplementing the duration_map:\n\nIn Python, perhaps using a defaultdict, where for each duration, we store the sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min.\n\nBut for each duration, during preprocessing, we need to generate these.\n\nLet me think about code steps.\n\nSample code:\n\nfrom bisect import bisect_right, bisect_left\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, cost = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    duration = r - l + 1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n\nduration_map = defaultdict(list)\nfor l, r, cost, d in vouchers:\n    duration_map[d].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n# Preprocess for each duration in duration_map\nprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min)\nfor d in duration_map:\n    # Process sorted_by_end and prefix_min\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(duration_map[d], key=lambda v: v[1])\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n    prefix_min = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for v in sorted_by_end:\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n        prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n    # Process sorted_by_start and suffix_min\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(duration_map[d], key=lambda v: v[0])\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2] )\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n    # Store in processed\n    processed[d] = (sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min)\n\n# Now, for each voucher, check if possible to find another voucher\nmin_total = float('inf')\nfor l_i, r_i, cost_i, d_i in vouchers:\n    k = x - d_i\n    if k <= 0:\n        continue\n    if k not in processed:\n        continue\n    # Now, check case 1 and case 2\n    # Case 1: find vouchers with duration k that end before l_i\n    # Get the data for k\n    sorted_by_end_k, end_times_k, prefix_min_k, sorted_by_start_k, start_times_k, suffix_min_k = processed[k]\n    # Case 1: end before l_i\n    T1 = l_i - 1\n    idx = bisect_right(end_times_k, T1)\n    if idx > 0:\n        min_case1 = prefix_min_k[idx-1]\n        if min_case1 + cost_i < min_total:\n            min_total = min_case1 + cost_i\n    # Case 2: start after r_i\n    T2 = r_i + 1\n    idx = bisect_left(start_times_k, T2)\n    if idx < len(start_times_k):\n        min_case2 = suffix_min_k[idx]\n        if min_case2 + cost_i < min_total:\n            min_total = min_case2 + cost_i\n\nif min_total == float('inf'):\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(min_total)\n\nWait, but this code has a problem. For example, when k is the same as d_i, but during the processing of the voucher, the code may have multiple vouchers with the same duration. But the code seems to handle that correctly.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo the vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 0: l=1, r=3, cost=4, duration 3\n\nvoucher 1: l=1, r=2, cost=5, duration 2\n\nvoucher 2: l=5, r=6, cost=1, duration 2\n\nvoucher 3: l=1, r=2, cost=4, duration 2\n\nThe duration_map will have entries for 3 and 2.\n\nFor duration 3, the list is [(1,3,4)].\n\nFor duration 2, the list is [(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)] ?\n\nWait, when we process duration_map[d], for d=2, the vouchers are the three vouchers with duration 2. Then sorted_by_end is sorted by their r. The three vouchers have r=2, 6, 2. So when sorted by r, the order would be (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1). Because their r values are 2, 2, 6. So sorted by r, they are ordered as first two with r=2, then the third with r=6.\n\nBut when sorted by r, the end_times would be [2,2,6].\n\nprefix_min for sorted_by_end would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1].\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start would be sorted by l. The l values are 1, 1, 5. So sorted_by_start would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. start_times are [1,1,5].\n\nsuffix_min for this would be:\n\nstart from the end:\n\nfor index 2: min is 1\n\nindex 1: min between 4 and 1 is 1\n\nindex 0: min between 5 and 1 is 1.\n\nSo suffix_min is [1, 1, 1].\n\nNow, when processing voucher 0 (d_i=3, k=5-3=2). So k=2 exists.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers with duration 2 that end before l_i=1. T1 = 1-1 =0. end_times_k is [2, 2, 6]. bisect_right finds insertion point for 0 in [2,2,6] is 0. So idx=0, which is not >0. So no case 1.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers with duration 2 that start after r_i=3. T2=3+1=4. start_times_k is [1,1,5]. bisect_left finds the first element >=4. The start_times are 1,1,5. So bisect_left returns 2. idx=2 is less than 3. suffix_min[2] is 1. So case 2 contributes 1 + 4 =5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nOther vouchers may contribute. For example, voucher 2 (l=5, r=6, cost=1, duration 2). x is 5, so k=5-2=3. Check if duration 3 exists. Yes. So for case 1 and 2.\n\nFor voucher 2, d_i=2, k=3. So check duration 3.\n\nsorted_by_end for duration 3 is [(1,3,4)], end_times is [3]. T1 is l_i -1 =5-1=4. bisect_right([3],4) returns 1. idx>0 is 1>0, so take prefix_min[0] =4. So case 1: 4 + 1=5. Which is same as before.\n\nSo in this case, the code would find 5 as the minimum.\n\nSo the code works for the first sample.\n\nAnother sample is the second input:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 → duration 3\n\n2 4 1 → duration 3\n\n3 5 4 → duration 3\n\nSo x is 2. For each voucher, duration is 3. So k = 2-3 = -1. So no possible. Hence output -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and overlapping?\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=4. vouchers: voucher1 (1-2, cost 1, duration 2), voucher2 (3-4, cost 1, duration 2). So x=4, so d_i=2, k=2. For voucher1, case 1: check vouchers with duration 2 that end before l_i=1. T1=0. No. case 2: start after r_i=2. T2=3. start_times for duration 2 are [1,3]. bisect_left finds index 1. suffix_min is [min(1,1) =1, 1]. So case2 gives 1. So total cost is 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code would find that.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat if there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and some are before and after?\n\nAnother possible problem is when the same voucher is considered multiple times. But as discussed earlier, it's not possible.\n\nNow, what about when x is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2, so no.\n\nNow, code-wise, what about when k is present but no vouchers meet the criteria? For example, when there are vouchers with duration k, but none end before l_i, and none start after r_i. Then, no contribution.\n\nNow, the code initializes min_total as infinity. After processing all vouchers, if min_total is still infinity, output -1.\n\nNow, what about when the same pair is considered twice? Like, voucher i and voucher j are considered once when processing i and once when processing j. But since we take the minimum, it's okay. Because when processing i, we check for j, and when processing j, check for i. However, in that case, the code would find both possibilities. But since the code is taking the minimum, it's okay.\n\nNow, for the code to be efficient, the preprocessing steps are O(n log n) per duration. But overall, since all vouchers are processed once, the total time is O(n log n).\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, possible optimizations. For example, for each duration, during preprocessing, the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start can be stored once. Also, the code uses a lot of variables, but in Python, it's manageable.\n\nNow, possible errors in code:\n\nIn the code above, during preprocessing, the processed dictionary is built. For each duration d in duration_map, the code processes the vouchers in duration_map[d]. However, in the code, the 'processed' dictionary is built with keys as d. But during the initial loop, the code uses 'processed[k]' where k is x -d_i.\n\nBut in the code, the 'processed' is built for each d in duration_map. However, during the initial loop, the code uses 'processed[k]' where k is x -d_i. But the 'processed' is built for all durations present in duration_map. So if k is present in duration_map, then it's in processed.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible error: when building the processed data, for the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start, the code uses the vouchers in duration_map[d], which is a list of (l, r, cost) tuples. But in the initial code, the vouchers are stored as (l, r, cost, duration). But in the duration_map, the code appends (l, r, cost) for each voucher. So that's correct.\n\nAnother possible error: when building the prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nIn the code:\n\nFor prefix_min:\n\nsorted_by_end is sorted by v[1] (r). For each v in sorted_by_end, we take v[2] (cost). Then, min_so_far is updated and added to prefix_min.\n\nYes.\n\nFor suffix_min:\n\nsorted_by_start is sorted by v[0] (l). For each i from len-1 downto 0, min_so_far is min between current min_so_far and sorted_by_start[i][2], then stored in suffix_min[i].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the code, during the processing of each voucher, the code uses the 'processed' data for k. For example, for the case 1, the code uses the end_times_k and prefix_min_k. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code uses the 'processed' dictionary, which is built for each duration in duration_map. However, the duration_map is built from the original vouchers. So, for example, if two vouchers have the same duration, they are grouped into the same list in duration_map.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the sample input again.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nAfter processing, for duration 2, the sorted_by_start is sorted by l. The three vouchers have l=1, 1, 5. So sorted_by_start is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)].\n\nstart_times is [1,1,5]. suffix_min for this is [1,1,1]. So when processing voucher 0 (l=1, r=3, cost=4, duration 3). k=5-3=2. So for case 2, T2 = r_i +1 =3+1=4. start_times_k is [1,1,5]. bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) returns 2. suffix_min[2] is 1. So case 2 gives 1 + 4 =5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: voucher 2 (l=5, r=6, cost=1, duration 2). x is 5, so k=5-2=3. Check if duration 3 exists. Yes. For case 1, T1 is l_i -1 =5-1=4. The end_times for duration 3 is [3]. bisect_right([3],4) is 1. idx=1>0. prefix_min[0] is 4. So case 1 gives 4+1=5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple options for case 1 and case 2?\n\nThe code takes the minimum of all possibilities.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut note that in the code, the 'processed' is built for each duration in duration_map. However, in Python, the defaultdict is used. But during the initial loop, the code loops through all durations in duration_map, which is a defaultdict.\n\nBut in the code, the 'processed' is a regular dictionary. So for each duration d in duration_map, we process and store in processed[d].\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when a voucher's duration is x? For example, x=5, and a voucher has duration 5. Then k=x-d_i =0, which is skipped. So no.\n\nBut if x is 5, and two vouchers have durations 2 and 3. Then, they can be paired.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where x is exactly 2, and two vouchers with duration 1 each. They must not overlap.\n\nAnother case: n=2, vouchers (1-1, cost 1), (2-2, cost 1). x=2. So durations are 1 and 1. So k=1. For each voucher, check for k=1.\n\nFor voucher 1: case 1: find vouchers with duration 1 ending before l_i=1. T1=0.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers from a list such that their combined duration exactly matches a given value `x` and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently searching for vouchers of specific durations later.\n2. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, preprocess the vouchers to create sorted lists by their end times and start times. Additionally, compute prefix minimum cost arrays for the end-sorted lists and suffix minimum cost arrays for the start-sorted lists. These arrays help in quickly finding the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with a complementary duration such that their combined duration equals `x`. Use binary search on the preprocessed sorted lists to efficiently determine valid non-overlapping vouchers and their minimum costs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom bisect import bisect_right, bisect_left\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l, r, cost = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost, duration))\n    \n    duration_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost, d in vouchers:\n        duration_map[d].append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    processed = dict()\n    for d in duration_map:\n        # Process sorted_by_end and prefix_min\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(duration_map[d], key=lambda v: v[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_by_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # Process sorted_by_start and suffix_min\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(duration_map[d], key=lambda v: v[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        # Store in processed\n        processed[d] = (sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for l_i, r_i, cost_i, d_i in vouchers:\n        k = x - d_i\n        if k <= 0:\n            continue\n        if k not in processed:\n            continue\n        # Get data for k\n        sorted_by_end_k, end_times_k, prefix_min_k, sorted_by_start_k, start_times_k, suffix_min_k = processed[k]\n        # Case 1: end before l_i\n        T1 = l_i - 1\n        idx = bisect_right(end_times_k, T1)\n        if idx > 0:\n            min_case1 = prefix_min_k[idx-1]\n            if min_case1 + cost_i < min_total:\n                min_total = min_case1 + cost_i\n        # Case 2: start after r_i\n        T2 = r_i + 1\n        idx = bisect_left(start_times_k, T2)\n        if idx < len(start_times_k):\n            min_case2 = suffix_min_k[idx]\n            if min_case2 + cost_i < min_total:\n                min_total = min_case2 + cost_i\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate efficient lookups when checking for complementary durations.\n2. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end times and start times.
