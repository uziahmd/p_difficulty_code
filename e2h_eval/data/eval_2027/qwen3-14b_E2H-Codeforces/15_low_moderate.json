They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can be the champion of a playoff tournament given certain rules for each phase. \n\nSo, the tournament has 2^n teams, and each phase reduces the number of teams by half. For each phase, depending on whether the character in the string s is 0 or 1, the winner of each match is determined by lower or higher skill level. The task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the tournament works. Let's take the example given. For n=3, s=101. The phases are 3 phases. Let me think:\n\nPhase 1 (i=1) has 2^(3-1) = 4 games. Since s[0] is '1', in each match, the higher skill level wins. Then phase 2 (i=2) has 2^(3-2) = 2 games. s[1] is '0', so lower skill wins. Phase 3 (i=3) has 1 game, s[2] is '1', higher skill wins.\n\nThe output is 4 5 6 7. So for those x values, there's a permutation where they can win.\n\nNow, how do I model this? The key is to simulate the tournament structure and determine for each possible x, whether it's possible to arrange the permutation such that x ends up as the champion.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the total number of teams is 2^18 which is 262,144. However, trying all permutations is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each round, the winner of each match depends on the current phase's rule. The tournament is structured as a binary tree. Each team must pass through each phase, and in each phase, the way they win depends on the rules.\n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1 to 2^n, the problem is to find for each x, whether there's a way to arrange the other teams such that x can reach the final by winning each of the matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we can model the possible ranges of values that can reach each round. For example, in the first phase, if the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), then for a team to win their first match, they need to have a higher skill than their opponent. But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the opponents in such a way that x can win.\n\nWait, but how do we model the structure of the tournament? Because the initial bracket is fixed. For example, the first round pairs 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. But the actual teams in those positions can be any permutation. Wait no, the permutation p determines the skill levels of the teams. But the bracket structure is fixed based on their positions. For example, the initial bracket is fixed: team 1 plays against team 2, etc. But when the permutation is chosen, the actual skill levels of the teams in these positions vary.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the permutation p is such that the team with skill x is the one that wins. So, the permutation is chosen in such a way that the team with skill x is placed in the bracket in a way that allows them to win all their matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like for each x, we need to check if there's a way to assign the other teams into the bracket such that x can win all rounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each round, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible values that can reach that round. For example, in the first round, if the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), then in order for x to win its first match, it must be that x is higher than the opponent. But since the opponent can be any value except x, perhaps we can choose the opponent to be lower than x. But since the permutation is arbitrary, the arrangement of the bracket is under our control. Wait, no. The bracket structure is fixed. For example, the initial bracket is fixed as pairs (1,2), (3,4), etc. But when you choose the permutation p, you are assigning the skill levels to the teams. So, the team that is in position 1 could be any of the numbers, as long as all are unique.\n\nWait, the problem says that the permutation p is given. But the question is, for which x is there a permutation p where x is the champion. So, the permutation p can be arranged in any way as long as it's a permutation. Therefore, the arrangement of the bracket (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion of a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure and rules are such that each phase reduces the number of teams by half, and the winner of each match is determined by either the higher or lower skill level depending on the phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree where each round halves the number of teams. For each phase, the winner is determined by either higher or lower skill levels as specified by the input string.\n2. **Range Calculation**: For each phase, we calculate the range of possible values that can win the tournament from that phase. This is done recursively, considering the constraints of each phase.\n3. **Recursive Function**: We use a recursive function to determine the valid ranges of skill levels that can reach each subsequent phase. Starting from the final phase, we work backwards to determine the valid ranges for each preceding phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    def get_winning_range(phase):\n        # phase starts from 0 (first phase) to n-1 (last phase)\n        if phase == n - 1:\n            # last phase, only one game\n            if s[phase] == '1':\n                # higher wins, so the range is [1, 2^n]\n                return (1, 2**n)\n            else:\n                # lower wins, same as higher since only one team\n                return (1, 2**n)\n        else:\n            next_low, next_high = get_winning_range(phase + 1)\n            if s[phase] == '1':\n                # higher wins in this phase\n                # to get to the next phase, the team must be higher than its opponent\n                # the opponent can be any value in [1, 2^n], but we need to find the minimal and maximal x\n                # that can be higher than some value in the next range\n                # the minimal x is next_low, because x can be next_low and have an opponent less than it\n                # the maximal x is 2^n, since it can beat any opponent\n                # but the opponent must be in the range that can reach the next phase\n                # So, the current range is [next_low, 2^n]\n                return (next_low, 2**n)\n            else:\n                # lower wins in this phase\n                # to get to the next phase, the team must be lower than its opponent\n                # the opponent must be in the range that can reach the next phase\n                # the minimal x is 1, and the maximal x is next_high\n                # because x can be as high as next_high, and have an opponent higher than it\n                return (1, next_high)\n    \n    total_teams = 2 ** n\n    low, high = get_winning_range(0)\n    result = []\n    for x in range(low, high + 1):\n        result.append(str(x))\n    print(' '.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` which dictates the rules for each phase of the tournament.\n2. **Recursive Range Calculation**: The function `get_winning_range` recursively calculates the valid range of skill levels that can win the tournament starting from each phase. This is done by considering whether the current phase favors higher or lower skill levels.\n3. **Determine Winning Ranges**: Starting from the last phase (final match), the valid range is calculated based on the rules. For each preceding phase, the valid range is adjusted based on whether higher or lower skill levels win, ensuring that the team can progress through each phase to become the champion.\n4. **Output Result**: The valid skill levels are collected and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the valid skill levels by leveraging recursive range calculations, ensuring that the solution handles the constraints effectively even for large values of `n`.",
