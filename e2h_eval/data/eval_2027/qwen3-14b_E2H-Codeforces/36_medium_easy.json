The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers so that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for such a configuration to exist. Because the signal power can be set, maybe there's a certain structure required in the tower positions.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For n=2, the valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then setting their power to 1. That way, town 1 covers itself (since |c-i| < p: 1-1=0 <1, so yes. Town 2's signal covers itself. But town 0 is not covered by any. Town 3 (n+1=3) isn't covered either. So that works.\n\nAnother example for n=3: when towers are built in 1,2,3. Then each can have power 1. Or if only tower 2 is built, then power 2. Then it covers towns 1,2,3. But wait, how does that work? Because town 0 is not covered. The tower at 2 has power 2: |0-2| = 2 which is not less than 2, so no. So that's okay.\n\nSo, the key seems to be that the towers must be arranged in such a way that they can \"cover\" the towns 1..n without overlapping coverage, and also not covering 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but how to model this? Because the signal power can be chosen. So perhaps the problem reduces to finding some kind of valid arrangement where each town is covered by exactly one tower, and the towers are placed in such a way that this is possible.\n\nLet me think about the necessary conditions for the tower placements.\n\nFor any tower configuration, we need to assign ranges such that:\n\n- Each town 1..n is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any.\n\nNow, considering that the signal power can be set. So for each tower, the signal power can be adjusted to cover certain towns.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think about the coverage. Suppose that for a tower at position i, the maximum reach is p. Then the coverage is from i-p+1 to i+p-1, because |c -i| < p → c ∈ (i-p, i+p). Since c is integer, this is equivalent to c ∈ [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. Wait, no. For example, if p=2, then |c - i| < 2 → c can be i-1, i, i+1. So the range is from i-1 to i+1, which is length 3. So the signal power p defines a range of length 2p-1. But since the tower is at i, the maximum distance is p-1. So for the tower to not cover town 0, we need that the leftmost town covered by it is >=1. Similarly, for town n+1, the rightmost town covered by it must be <=n.\n\nBut how can we arrange the towers such that their coverage areas exactly partition the towns 1..n?\n\nThis feels similar to interval partitioning. Maybe the towers must form a certain structure where each tower's coverage area is non-overlapping and covers exactly some subset of towns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into a condition on the tower positions. For example, if there's a way to select towers such that they form a set where each tower is responsible for a certain segment of towns, and the segments don't overlap.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For the coverage to be possible, the towers must be arranged in a way that allows them to form a partition of the towns 1..n. Each tower must be responsible for a contiguous block of towns. Moreover, for each tower, the block it covers must be such that the tower is in the middle of the block, and the power is set to cover exactly that block.\n\nWait, for example, suppose a tower is at position i, and it is responsible for towns from a to b. Then the power needs to be set such that a is covered (so |a -i| < p) and b is covered (|b -i| < p). Also, the next tower's coverage must start after b. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the coverage as intervals. Each tower's coverage interval must be such that the intervals are non-overlapping, cover all towns 1..n, and do not include 0 or n+1.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose that the towers are arranged in such a way that there's a tower at position i, and it covers from some left to some right. Then, the left part (from 1 to i-1) must be covered by towers to the left, and the right part (from i+1 to n) must be covered by towers to the right.\n\nBut this seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's consider dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the towers must be arranged in a way that allows for such a partitioning. For example, for the entire sequence of towns 1..n, there must be a tower at some position i, which covers a certain range, and the left and right parts are also valid.\n\nWait, this seems familiar. It's similar to the problem of tiling or partitioning. For example, the classic problem of counting the number of ways to tile a board with dominoes or something else. So maybe the recurrence relation is similar.\n\nLet me think about the possible valid configurations. For the entire n towns, there must be at least one tower. And for that tower, there's a certain way to split the problem into left and right parts.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the following: For the entire range [1, n], there must be a tower at position k, which is responsible for covering a certain interval. For that tower to be able to cover some interval, say [a, b], then the tower at k must have a signal power p such that a is in the range of the tower, and b is in the range. Also, the tower's coverage should not reach beyond the boundaries.\n\nBut since the signal power can be adjusted, the minimal requirement is that the tower at k can cover a range that includes some interval. However, for the purposes of partitioning, perhaps the tower at k must be the only one covering the towns in its range. How can that be ensured?\n\nLet me think of the following scenario. Suppose that the tower at position k is responsible for covering the towns from k - l to k + r. But to ensure that no other tower covers these towns, the towers must be placed in such a way that there are no towers in the range [k - l + 1, k + r - 1], except for the one at k. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for the tower at position k to be the sole provider of coverage for its region, the regions to the left and right must be handled by other towers. So maybe the valid configurations are those where the towers form a set such that between any two adjacent towers, there is a certain relationship.\n\nWait, here's another thought. For the coverage to be possible, the towers must be placed in such a way that there's no two adjacent towers. Because if two towers are adjacent, say at positions i and i+1, then their signal powers could be set to 1, which would cover their own towns. But then, town i+1 is covered by both towers? No, wait. If a tower is at i with power 1, it covers towns i-1, i, i+1. But town i+1 is covered by the tower at i. Similarly, the tower at i+1 with power 1 would cover i, i+1, i+2. So town i+1 is covered by both towers. Which violates the requirement that each town is covered by exactly one tower. Therefore, this configuration would not be valid. Hence, having two adjacent towers is invalid unless they are arranged in a way that their coverage doesn't overlap. But that's impossible if they are adjacent. Because the tower at i with power 1 covers up to i+1. The tower at i+1 with power 1 covers down to i. So overlapping. Thus, adjacent towers cannot be allowed.\n\nWait, but in the first example, n=2, and the towers are built at 1 and 2. Then, the signal power is set to 1 for each. Then, town 1 is covered by tower 1 (since |1-1| <1? No, 0 <1 is true. So yes. Town 2 is covered by tower 2. But what about town 1 being covered by tower 2? |1-2|=1, which is not less than 1. So no. So in this case, the coverage is okay. Oh right! Because the signal power is set to 1. The tower at 1 covers towns 1 (since |1-1| <1 is 0 <1 → yes. And town 2 is |2-1|=1 which is not less than 1. So no. Similarly for the tower at 2. So they don't overlap. So this configuration is allowed. So adjacent towers are allowed, as long as their signal powers are set to 1. So that's okay.\n\nSo the previous idea was wrong. Adjacent towers can be allowed if their signal power is set properly. So how to model this?\n\nHmm. Let's think again. For the entire configuration to be valid, there must be a way to assign the signal powers such that:\n\n- Each town is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any.\n\nSo perhaps the key is that the towers must be placed in such a way that they form a partition of the towns into intervals, where each interval is covered by exactly one tower. And for each such interval, the tower is located in a position that allows it to cover the entire interval, and not extend beyond.\n\nFor example, for an interval [a, b], the tower must be located somewhere in that interval. Let's say the tower is at position i. Then, the signal power must be set to at least max(i - a + 1, b - i + 1). Because the tower's signal needs to reach the farthest ends of the interval. For example, if the interval is [a, b], and the tower is at i, then the power needs to be at least (i - a + 1) (to reach a) and (b - i + 1) (to reach b). The maximum of these two values. However, the signal power can be set to this value, ensuring that the entire interval is covered. But then, the signal would also reach beyond the interval? Wait, no. Because if the power is set to p = max(i - a + 1, b - i + 1), then the coverage of the tower is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Let's see:\n\nIf p = i - a + 1, then i - p + 1 = a. And i + p - 1 = i + (i - a + 1) -1 = 2i -a. But this may be larger than b. Wait, but in that case, the tower's coverage would go beyond the interval [a, b]. Which would cause overlapping with other intervals. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tower must be placed in the middle of the interval. For example, for an interval [a, b], the tower must be placed at position k such that the signal power can be set to (b - a + 1)/2, but that depends on the length of the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the interval [a, b] must be covered by a single tower located at position k, such that the tower's coverage includes all towns in [a, b], and does not include a-1 or b+1. Because otherwise, if the tower's coverage includes a-1, that's town 0 (if a is 1) or another town that's supposed to be covered by another tower.\n\nSo for the tower at position k, the coverage must be exactly [a, b]. To achieve this, the signal power p must be set so that:\n\na >= k - p + 1\n\nb <= k + p - 1\n\nand also:\n\na - 1 < k - p + 1 → because town a-1 is not covered.\n\nSimilarly, b + 1 > k + p - 1 → town b+1 is not covered.\n\nWait, but the first condition is that the tower's coverage starts at or before a, and ends at or after b. But the second condition is that the coverage does not extend beyond a-1 or b+1. So:\n\nThe coverage of the tower is [k - p + 1, k + p - 1]. We want this interval to be exactly [a, b]. Therefore:\n\nk - p + 1 = a\n\nk + p - 1 = b\n\nSolving these equations:\n\nAdding both equations:\n\n2k - 2 + 2p = a + b → ?\n\nWait, solving for p:\n\nFrom the first equation, p = k - a + 1.\n\nFrom the second equation, p = b - k + 1.\n\nSo setting them equal: k - a + 1 = b - k + 1 → 2k = a + b → k = (a + b)/2.\n\nThus, for the interval [a, b] to be covered exactly by a tower at position k, the length of the interval must be even? Or no, wait. If a and b are such that a + b is even, then k is an integer. Otherwise, it's not possible. But the tower must be located at an integer position. So this suggests that the interval [a, b] must have length (b - a + 1) which is odd, and the tower is placed exactly in the middle.\n\nWait, for example, if [a, b] is length 3 (like 1-3), then the middle is 2. So the tower is at 2, and p is 2. The coverage is 2-2+1=1 to 2+2-1=3. Exactly [1,3]. Perfect.\n\nIf the interval is [1,2], then a + b = 3, which is odd. So k would be 1.5, which is not possible. Thus, this suggests that such an interval can't be covered by exactly one tower. But earlier example for n=2, where the towers are at 1 and 2, and each has p=1. Then, each covers their own town. So the interval [1,1] is covered by tower 1, and [2,2] by tower 2. So those are intervals of length 1. For each, a = b. Then, k = (a + b)/2 = a. So p is (k -a +1) = 1. Which works.\n\nSo for intervals of length 1, it's possible. For intervals of length 2, like [1,2], can we find a tower that covers exactly that interval? Let's see. Suppose the tower is at position 1. Then, the signal power must be set to 2. Because then the coverage is 1 - 2 + 1 = 0 to 1 + 2 -1 = 2. But that includes town 0, which is not allowed. So that's invalid. Alternatively, if the tower is at position 2, same problem. So the coverage would include town 0 or 3 (n+1). So that's invalid. Hence, the interval [1,2] cannot be covered by exactly one tower. Which suggests that such a configuration is not allowed. But earlier example for n=2, the towers are at 1 and 2. Then, each covers their own town. So the intervals [1,1] and [2,2], which are allowed. So the overall configuration is allowed.\n\nSo this suggests that the valid tower configurations are those that can be partitioned into intervals of length 1 or more, where each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and the tower is placed in the middle of the interval (so that the coverage is exactly that interval and nothing more).\n\nBut how to model this for the entire problem?\n\nThis seems like a recursive structure. For the entire range 1..n, there must be some tower that splits the range into left and right parts. For example, suppose there's a tower at position k, which is responsible for covering the interval [a, b]. Then, the left part [1, a-1] must be covered by some configuration, and the right part [b+1, n] must be covered by another configuration.\n\nBut what is the possible [a, b] for the tower at k?\n\nIn order for the tower at k to cover [a, b], the interval must be such that a = k - p + 1 and b = k + p - 1. Also, since the tower is at k, and the coverage is exactly [a,b], then the length of the interval is 2p-1. Which means that the length of [a, b] is 2p-1. Also, since the tower is at k, which is the midpoint of the interval.\n\nTherefore, for the interval [a, b], the length must be 2p-1. Which implies that the length is odd. For example, length 1 (p=1), length 3 (p=2), etc.\n\nBut for the entire range [1, n], the tower must be placed in such a way that the interval [a, b] is covered by it, and the rest of the range is handled recursively.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of towers that can be partitioned into such intervals. Each interval is covered by exactly one tower, which is in the middle of the interval. And the intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (towns 1..i). Then, the answer for the problem is dp[n], divided by 2^n (since each of the n towns has a 50% chance of being selected).\n\nBut how to compute dp[i]?\n\nFor dp[i], we can consider that the last interval ends at i. So for each possible k (the position of the tower), such that the interval [a, b] ends at i. Since the tower is at k, and the interval is [k - p + 1, k + p - 1] = [a, b], which ends at i. So k + p - 1 = i. Also, since the length of the interval is 2p-1, and the tower is at k, which is the midpoint. So the length is 2p-1, and the interval is from k - p + 1 to k + p - 1. So the length is (k + p -1) - (k - p + 1) + 1 = 2p-1.\n\nBut since the interval ends at i, then k + p - 1 = i. Also, since the tower is at k, which is the midpoint, then the start of the interval is k - p + 1 = i - (2p -1) + 1 ? Not sure. Alternatively, since the length of the interval is 2p-1, and the end is i, then the start is i - (2p-1) + 1 = i - 2p + 2. But since the tower is at k, which is the midpoint, then k = (start + end)/2 = (i - 2p + 2 + i)/2 = (2i - 2p + 2)/2 = i - p + 1. But from earlier, k + p -1 = i → k = i - p + 1. Which matches. So substituting p = (i - k + 1). Because from k + p -1 = i → p = i -k +1.\n\nBut since the length of the interval is 2p-1 = 2(i -k +1) -1 = 2i - 2k + 2 -1 = 2i - 2k +1. Also, the start of the interval is k - p + 1 = k - (i -k +1) +1 = 2k - i.\n\nSo for the interval to start at some position s = 2k - i, and end at i. And since the start must be >=1, then 2k -i >=1 → k >= (i + 1)/2. Also, since the tower is at position k, which must be in the range [s, i], and s = 2k -i. Let me think for a specific example.\n\nSuppose i is 3. Then possible k's are:\n\nFor the interval ending at i=3. Let's see:\n\nIf the tower is at k=2, then p = i -k +1 = 3 -2 +1 = 2. So the interval is from 2 - 2 +1 = 1 to 3. So [1,3], which is valid. Then, the start is 1.\n\nIf the tower is at k=3, then p = 3-3 +1 = 1. The interval is 3-1+1=3 to 3+1-1=3 → [3,3]. Valid.\n\nSo for dp[3], we can take the cases where the last interval is [1,3] (tower at 2) or [3,3] (tower at 3).\n\nIn the first case, the left part is [1, 1-1] = [1, 0], which is empty. So the dp[0] is 1 (base case). Then, the total for this case is dp[0] * ... ?\n\nWait, the recurrence would be: dp[i] = sum over all possible k (positions of the tower for the last interval ending at i) of dp[s-1], where s is the start of the interval. Because the left part is from 1 to s-1, which must be valid, and the current interval is handled by the tower at k.\n\nSo for the example above, when i=3 and the last interval starts at s=1 (k=2), then dp[3] += dp[0] * 1 (since the tower at k is present, and the rest is handled by dp[0]).\n\nBut what about the presence of the tower? Because the tower must be present. So for each such case, the tower at k must be present. Also, the towns in the interval [s, i] must have towers only at k. Because otherwise, there could be other towers in the interval, which would interfere.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. How do we ensure that there are no other towers in the interval [s, i], except for the one at k?\n\nBecause the way the problem is structured, the entire configuration must be such that the intervals are non-overlapping and each is covered by exactly one tower. So for the interval [s, i], which is covered by the tower at k, there must be no other towers in this interval. Because otherwise, those towers would have to be part of other intervals, leading to overlapping coverage.\n\nSo this implies that in the subset of towers, for the interval [s, i], there is exactly one tower (at k), and no others. Therefore, the DP approach must account for the fact that in the interval [s, i], the tower at k is present, and all other positions in [s, i] are not present.\n\nBut how can we model this in the DP?\n\nThis seems challenging. Because the DP[i] counts the number of valid subsets for towns 1..i, but the way of adding new intervals requires that the new interval's positions (except for the tower) are not present in the subset.\n\nWait, but the DP approach would need to count the number of valid tower configurations that satisfy the conditions. So for each possible way to split the problem into left and right parts, we have to multiply the possibilities for the left part and the possibilities for the right part, multiplied by the possibilities for the current interval.\n\nBut the current interval requires that there's exactly one tower (at k) and no others. So the number of ways to choose the towers in the current interval is 1 (since the tower is present, and others are absent). But how does that fit into the DP?\n\nAh! The DP[i] represents the number of valid subsets of towers for towns 1..i. For each possible way to split into left and current interval, the left part is handled by dp[s-1], and the current interval is handled by having exactly one tower (at k) and no others in [s, i]. So the number of ways for the current interval is 1 (since the tower is present and others are not). Therefore, the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k} (dp[s-1] * 1) * (ways to choose the rest of the towers?)\n\nWait, no. Because the entire subset is determined by the left part (which is handled by dp[s-1]) and the current interval (which has exactly one tower at k). So the total number of valid subsets for the current case is dp[s-1] multiplied by 1 (since the current interval's tower is fixed as present, and the rest of the interval's towns are not present).\n\nBut how does this account for the selection of towers in the left and right parts?\n\nWait, the DP[i] counts the number of valid subsets for towns 1..i. So for each possible way to split into a left part (up to s-1) and a current interval [s, i], the number of valid subsets is dp[s-1] multiplied by the number of valid ways to have the current interval. Which is 1 (the tower at k is present, others in [s, i] are not present). Therefore, the recurrence becomes:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{possible s} (dp[s-1] * 1) )\n\nBut how to find the possible s for each i?\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can look for all possible k (positions of the tower) such that the interval [s, i] is covered by the tower at k. Then, s = 2k - i. And since s must be ≥1, and the interval [s, i] must not contain any other towers. But since the DP approach ensures that the left part (up to s-1) is valid, and the current interval has exactly one tower, then the total is correct.\n\nBut how to find the valid k's for each i?\n\nFor a given i, the possible k's are those positions where the tower at k can be the center of an interval ending at i. As discussed earlier, for the interval ending at i, the tower is at k, and the start of the interval is s = 2k - i. Also, since the start must be ≥1, 2k -i ≥1 → k ≥ (i+1)/2. Also, since the tower is at k, which is in the interval [s, i], which is s ≤ k ≤ i. Substituting s = 2k -i, we get 2k -i ≤k → k ≤i. Which is always true since k ≤i.\n\nSo for each i, the valid k's are those integers between ceil( (i+1)/2 ) and i.\n\nBut how to find the corresponding s for each k?\n\nOnce we find the valid k's, then for each k, the start is s = 2k -i. And the interval [s, i] must be covered by the tower at k, and no other towers in that interval. So the recurrence for dp[i] is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k} dp[s-1], where s = 2k -i, and k ranges from ceil( (i+1)/2 ) to i.\n\nBut wait, for example, when i=3 and k=2, s=2*2 -3 = 1. So dp[0] is added. When k=3, s=2*3 -3 =3. So dp[2] is added. So dp[3] = dp[0] + dp[2].\n\nWhat is dp[0]? Well, it's the base case. For 0 towns, there's one valid configuration (no towers). So dp[0] = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, the possible k's are ceil( (1+1)/2 ) = 1. So k=1, s=2*1 -1=1. Then dp[0] is added. So dp[1] = dp[0] = 1.\n\nFor i=2, possible k's are ceil( (2+1)/2 ) = 2 (since (3/2) is 1.5, ceil is 2). So k ranges from 2 to 2. For k=2, s=2*2 -2 = 2. So dp[1] is added. So dp[2] = dp[1] = 1. But according to the first example, when n=2, the valid configurations is 1 (both towers present). But according to this DP approach, dp[2] is 1. Which would imply that the total number of valid subsets is 1. However, the total possible subsets is 2^2=4. So the probability is 1/4, which matches the first example. So this seems correct.\n\nFor i=3, dp[3] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2. What does this mean? The valid subsets for i=3 are:\n\nCase 1: the entire interval [1,3] is covered by the tower at 2. So the tower at 2 is present, and no others. So subset {2}.\n\nCase 2: the interval [3,3] is covered by tower 3, and the left part (up to 2) is valid. For the left part (up to 2), dp[2] is 1, which corresponds to the subset {1, 2} (since dp[2] is 1). Wait, no. Wait dp[2] is 1, which represents the number of valid subsets for towns 1-2. Which is the case where both are present. So in this case, the entire subset is {1,2,3}? No, because the left part is up to s-1 = 3-1 = 2 (since s=3). Wait, when k=3, s=3. So the left part is s-1 = 2. So dp[2] is 1, which represents the valid subsets for towns 1-2. Then, the current interval is [3,3], which requires that tower 3 is present and no other towers in [3,3]. So the total subset is the subset for towns 1-2 (which is {1,2}) plus {3}. So the subset {1,2,3} is valid? But according to the note for n=3, the valid configurations include when towers are built in 1,2,3 (probability 1/8) and when only tower 2 is built (probability 1/8). So total 2 valid subsets. Which would give 2/8 = 1/4, which matches the note's answer. But according to dp[3] = 2, which would be the number of valid subsets. So for n=3, the answer is 2 / 2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4, which matches the note. So this seems correct.\n\nSo the DP recurrence seems to be working.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute dp[n], and then divide by 2^n, modulo 998244353.\n\nBut how to compute dp[i] efficiently for large n (up to 2e5)?\n\nThe recurrence is dp[i] = sum_{k} dp[s-1], where s = 2k - i, and k ranges from ceil((i+1)/2) to i.\n\nBut for each i, the range of k is from m to i, where m = ceil( (i+1)/2 ). Let's find s in terms of k.\n\ns = 2k -i. So for each k in [m, i], s is 2k -i. But since k ranges from m to i, what is the range of s?\n\nFor example, when k = m, s is 2m -i. And when k = i, s is 2i -i = i.\n\nBut what is m?\n\nm = ceil( (i+1)/2 )\n\nLet me compute m for various i:\n\ni=1: (1+1)/2 = 1 → ceil(1) = 1.\n\ni=2: (2+1)/2 = 1.5 → ceil is 2.\n\ni=3: (3+1)/2 = 2 → ceil is 2.\n\ni=4: (4+1)/2 = 2.5 → ceil is 3.\n\nSo m is floor( (i+1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, for even i:\n\ni=2: (i+1)/2 = 1.5 → ceil is 2. Which is (i/2) + 1 ?\n\nYes. For even i=2k, m = ceil( (2k +1)/2 ) = k + 0.5 → ceil is k+1.\n\nFor odd i=2k-1: (i+1)/2 = (2k)/2 =k → ceil is k.\n\nSo m is floor( (i+1)/2 ) ?\n\nNot sure, but regardless, for each i, the range of k is from m to i, and for each k, s = 2k -i. Let's see what s is for each k in that range.\n\nFor example, when i=3, k ranges from 2 to 3.\n\nk=2: s=4-3=1.\n\nk=3: s=6-3=3.\n\nSo for each k, s increases as k increases.\n\nBut how to find the sum for dp[i]?\n\nThe sum is over all k in [m, i], and for each k, we add dp[s-1], where s=2k -i.\n\nBut s-1 = 2k -i -1.\n\nLet me substitute variables. Let's denote j = s-1 = 2k -i -1. Then, solving for k: k = (j + i +1)/2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to express the sum in terms of j. However, for the purpose of computing the DP, perhaps we can find that for each i, the sum is over a range of j's.\n\nBut for now, let's think about how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nIf we can find for each i, the sum of dp[j] for certain j's, then we can compute dp[i] quickly.\n\nLet me see for i:\n\nEach term in the sum is dp[2k -i -1], where k ranges from m to i.\n\nLet me compute 2k -i -1 for k in [m, i].\n\nLet me denote for each k, j = 2k -i -1.\n\nWe can rewrite this as j = 2k - (i + 1).\n\nLet me find for k = m to i, what is the range of j.\n\nWhen k = m: j = 2m - (i + 1).\n\nWhen k = i: j = 2i - (i + 1) = i -1.\n\nSo the sum becomes sum_{j = a}^{i-1} dp[j], where a is 2m - (i+1).\n\nBut what is m?\n\nAs earlier, m = ceil( (i+1)/2 )\n\nLet me compute a for m = ceil( (i+1)/2 ):\n\nLet me consider two cases: i is even or odd.\n\nCase 1: i is even → i = 2t.\n\nThen, (i+1)/2 = (2t +1)/2 = t + 0.5 → m = t+1.\n\nSo a = 2*(t+1) - (2t + 1) = 2t + 2 - 2t -1 = 1.\n\nSo for even i=2t, the sum is from j=1 to j=i-1 = 2t -1.\n\nBut wait, when k ranges from m = t+1 to i=2t, then j ranges from 1 to i-1 = 2t-1. So the sum is sum_{j=1}^{2t-1} dp[j} ?\n\nBut that seems like a lot. For example, when i=2 (t=1), sum from j=1 to 1 (i-1=1). Which is dp[1], which is 1. Which matches dp[2] = dp[1] = 1.\n\nBut for i=4 (t=2), m=3. The sum would be for k=3,4:\n\nFor k=3: j = 2*3 - (4+1) = 6-5=1.\n\nFor k=4: j= 2*4 -5= 8-5=3.\n\nSo the sum is dp[1] + dp[3} ?\n\nBut according to the formula",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 through n (each with a 50% chance), we can set their signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently count valid configurations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns (from 1 to i).\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each `i`, consider all possible positions `k` where a tower can be placed such that it covers an interval ending at `i`. This leads to a recurrence relation where `dp[i]` is derived from previous values of `dp`.\n3. **Efficient Summation**: Use prefix sums to efficiently compute the required sums for the DP transitions, reducing the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    max_n = n\n    dp = [0] * (max_n + 1)\n    prefix = [0] * (max_n + 2)  # prefix[i] = sum(dp[0..i-1])\n    \n    dp[0] = 1\n    prefix[1] = dp[0]\n    \n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        m = (i + 1 + 1) // 2  # ceil((i+1)/2)\n        # For k in [m, i], s = 2k - i\n        # j = s - 1 = 2k - i - 1\n        # So j ranges from 2m - i - 1 to 2i - i - 1 = i - 1\n        a = 2 * m - i - 1\n        b = i - 1\n        \n        if a < 0:\n            a = 0\n        if b < 0:\n            dp[i] = 0\n        else:\n            if a > b:\n                dp[i] = 0\n            else:\n                # sum dp[a] ... dp[b]\n                dp[i] = (prefix[b + 1] - prefix[a]) % MOD\n        \n        # Update prefix\n        prefix[i + 1] = (prefix[i] + dp[i]) % MOD\n    \n    # The answer is dp[n] / 2^n mod MOD\n    inv_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_2n = pow(inv_2n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    ans = (dp[n] * inv_2n) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: `dp[i]` keeps track of the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array (`prefix`)**: This helps in efficiently computing the sum of previous DP values, which is crucial for optimizing the solution to linear time complexity.\n3. **Recurrence Calculation**: For each `i`, determine valid positions `k` where a tower can be placed such that it covers an interval ending at `i`. Using the prefix sum array, quickly compute the required sums for these positions.\n4. **Modular Inverse**: Since the result needs to be in the form of a fraction modulo 998244353, we use modular inverse to compute `1/(2^n)` efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid configurations using dynamic programming and prefix sums, leading to an optimal solution for large values of `n` up to 200,000.",
