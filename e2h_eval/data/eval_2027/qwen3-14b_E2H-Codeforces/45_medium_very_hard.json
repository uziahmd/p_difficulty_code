There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key constraint here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a perfect binary tree. But here, the structure isn't fixed, and we need to maximize the number of games for the winner under the given rule. \n\nWait, the example given for n=3 gives output 2. Let's see: the winner plays two games. How does that work? Let's say players 1, 2, 3. First, player 1 plays against 2. Suppose he wins. Then he plays against 3. But according to the rule, when he plays against 3, he has already played 1 game, and 3 has played 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the maximum is 2.\n\nBut for n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because in a normal knockout, you need 3 games for the winner (since 4 players: first round two matches, then final). But according to the note, the answer is 2. Oh because the structure has to follow that rule. So maybe the way the tournament is arranged is different. For example, if the winner plays two games. How?\n\nThe note says that for n=4, the organizers make pairs (1,2) and (3,4), then the winners play. So the winner plays two games. So the maximum is 2. But why can't they arrange it so that the winner plays three games? Well, maybe because the rules prevent that. Let's think: for the winner to play three games, he would have to play in each round. But for that, each time he plays, the opponent must have a number of games played differing by at most one. \n\nLet me think of the structure. Let's say the winner plays three games. That would require that in each round, the opponent has played either the same number or one less. Let's imagine:\n\nFirst game: the winner (player 1) plays against player 2. He wins. Now he has 1 game. Then he plays against someone who has 0 or 1 games. Suppose he plays against player 3. Then after that, he has 2 games. Then he needs to play again. The next opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But how would that happen? Let's see. Suppose there's another player, say player 4. But for the third game, the opponent would have to have played 1 or 2 games. But if the winner has already played two games, then the opponent would need to have played 1 or 2. But how would that opponent get to that?\n\nMaybe the structure requires that each time the winner plays, the opponent is someone who has played as many games as possible. But perhaps for n=4, the maximum is 2. So how do we model this?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to find the maximum number of games possible for the winner, given the constraints. Let's think recursively. Let's say f(n) is the maximum number of games the winner can play. How can we find f(n)?\n\nLet's think about the structure of the tournament. For the winner to play as many games as possible, each time he plays, he must face an opponent who has played as many games as possible. Because the rule allows for the difference of at most one. So, to maximize the number of games, the winner would need to face opponents that have played as many games as possible.\n\nSo, suppose the winner plays k games. Then, in each of those games, he must have faced opponents that have played either k-1, k-2, etc. But how does this relate to the number of players?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a binary tree where each node represents a game. The winner's path through the tree would be the number of games he plays. But the constraints on the matches may affect how this tree is structured.\n\nAnother approach: For the winner to play m games, he must have defeated m opponents. Each time he plays, the opponent must have a number of games played that's within one of his current count. Let's think about the process:\n\n- The first game, he has 0 games played. The opponent also has 0. So they play. After that, the winner has 1 game.\n\n- For the second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. Let's say the opponent has played 0. Then the winner plays against someone who hasn't played before. But that's allowed. However, this would require that the opponent has not played any games yet. But how can that be? Because the opponent must have won all their previous games. So for the second game, the opponent could be someone who has played once (if they had a prior match), but that depends on the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum number of games is determined by the largest m such that the sum of the first m Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n. Wait, that might be a stretch. Let's think about some examples.\n\nFor example, when the winner plays m games, the number of players required is something like the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number minus 1. Or something similar. Let's think recursively. Suppose that to have a winner play m games, the number of players needed is f(m). How to find f(m)?\n\nLet me think. For the winner to play m games, he must have played m-1 games before the last one. Let's consider that each time he plays a game, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let's think of the first game: the winner plays against someone (needs 1 player). For the second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. To maximize the number of games, the opponent should have played 1 game. So that requires that there was another player who had played 1 game. Which would require that there were enough players to generate that.\n\nSo, for the winner to play m games, the total number of players required is the sum of the number of players required for each of his opponents. For example, for the first game, the opponent is 1 player. For the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game. Which requires that there's a subtree where that opponent has played 1 game. So, the number of players required for the winner to play m games would be the sum of the players required for each of the previous steps.\n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me think:\n\nLet's define f(m) as the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play m games. Then:\n\n- To have the winner play 1 game, you need 2 players (f(1) = 2).\n\n- To have the winner play 2 games, he needs to have an opponent in the second game who has played 1 game. That requires that there are f(1) players (since that opponent must have played 1 game, which requires f(1) players). So the total players is f(1) + 1 (the winner plus the opponent's subtree). Wait, but the winner is part of both subtrees? Maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe winner's first game is against one player. Then, for the second game, he must play against someone who has played 1 game. That someone must have come from a subtree where they played 1 game. So the total number of players required is 1 (from the first game) + f(1) (from the second game's opponent's subtree). But since the winner is part of the first game and the second game, maybe the formula is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2). Because for the winner to play m games, he must have played m-1 games before, and his opponent in the m-th game must have played m-1 games (so that the difference is zero) or m-2 games (difference of 1). But to maximize the number of games, the opponent would have played m-1 games. But that would require that the opponent's subtree has a winner who has played m-1 games. But that would imply that the number of players is f(m-1) + f(m-2). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, for the winner to have m games, the first m-1 games must have been played against opponents that allow for that. The last game is against someone who has played either m-1 or m-2 games. But to maximize the number of games, the opponent should have played as many as possible. So, the opponent must have played m-1 games. But that would require that the opponent's subtree is such that the winner of that subtree has played m-1 games. Therefore, the total number of players required is f(m-1) + f(m-2). Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the example:\n\nFor m=2, the winner plays two games. The first game requires 2 players (f(1)=2). The second game requires that the opponent has played 1 game, which requires f(1) players. But since the winner is part of the first game's subtree, perhaps the total is f(1) + f(1) - 1? Or maybe f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2). Let me check with known values.\n\nFor m=1: f(1)=2 (two players).\n\nFor m=2: the winner's first game requires 1 opponent. Then, the second game requires an opponent who has played 1 game. To get that opponent, you need f(1) players. So total players is 1 (from the first game's opponent) + f(1) (for the second game's opponent's subtree) = 1 + 2 = 3. But for n=3, the answer is 2 games. Which aligns with this. So f(2) = 3.\n\nThen for m=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3+2=5. So for n=5, the maximum number of games is 3. Let's see. If there are 5 players, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nLet me think. The first game: 1 vs 2. Winner is 1. Second game: 1 vs someone who has played once. Let's say 3 vs 4, winner is 3. Then 1 plays 3. Now, 1 has played 2 games, 3 has played 1. Difference is 1, allowed. Then, for the third game, 1 needs to play against someone who has played 2 or 1 games. Let's say there's a player 5. But how to get that? Well, the third game would be against someone who has played 2 games. Let's see. Suppose in the third round, the opponent is someone who has played 2 games. How can that happen? For example, maybe the opponent is the winner of a subtree that required 2 games. So, the initial structure would be:\n\nFirst, 1 vs 2 (winner 1). Then 3 vs 4 (winner 3). Then 1 vs 3 (winner 1). Then, the next opponent must be someone who has played 2 games. But there's player 5. How can he have played 2 games? Well, maybe he has to play two games before facing the winner. But with only 5 players, perhaps it's possible. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct, and for n=5, the answer is 3. So for n=5, the maximum is 3.\n\nBut what about for n=4? According to the formula, f(2)=3, f(3)=5. So for n=4, which is between f(2)=3 and f(3)=5, the maximum m is 2. Which matches the sample input where n=4 gives output 2.\n\nSo the idea is that the maximum number of games m is the largest integer such that f(m) ≤ n, where f(m) is the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number minus something? Wait, let's look at the values:\n\nLet me compute f(m) for m=1,2,3, etc.\n\nm | f(m)\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 5\n4 | 8\n5 | 13\n...\n\nYes, this looks like the Fibonacci sequence. Let me check:\n\nf(1) = 2\nf(2) = 3 = 2 + 1?\nWait, the recurrence seems to be f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2). Because for m=2, f(2) = f(1) + f(0). But what is f(0)? Well, maybe f(0) is 1 (the case where the winner has played zero games, which requires one player). Let's see:\n\nIf f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2, f(2)= f(1)+f(0) = 3, f(3)=f(2)+f(1)=5, f(4)=f(3)+f(2)=8, etc. So yes, this follows the Fibonacci sequence starting with f(0)=1, f(1)=2. So the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. So for each m, the minimal number of players needed to have the winner play m games is f(m) = Fib(m+2), where Fib is the standard Fibonacci sequence starting with Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nLet's compute the standard Fibonacci numbers:\n\nFib(0) = 0\n\nFib(1) = 1\n\nFib(2) = 1\n\nFib(3) = 2\n\nFib(4) = 3\n\nFib(5) = 5\n\nFib(6) = 8\n\nFib(7) = 13\n\nSo for our f(m):\n\nf(0) = 1 = Fib(2) + 1? Not sure. Let me think again.\n\nBut our f(m) sequence is 1 (for m=0?), 2 (m=1), 3 (m=2), 5 (m=3), etc. So for m, the value is Fib(m+2) ?\n\nFor m=1, Fib(3) is 2. Yes. For m=2, Fib(4)=3. Yes. m=3, Fib(5)=5. Yes. So f(m) = Fib(m+2). But Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, etc.\n\nSo, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play m games is Fib(m+2). So given n players, the maximum m is the largest integer such that Fib(m+2) ≤ n.\n\nWait, but for example, when n=3, Fib(4)=3. So m+2=4 → m=2. Which matches the sample input where n=3 gives output 2. For n=4, Fib(5)=5>4. So the largest m where Fib(m+2) ≤4 is m=2 (since Fib(4)=3 ≤4). Hence output is 2. Which matches the sample. For n=2, Fib(3)=2, so m=1. Which matches the sample. For n=10, Fib(6)=8 ≤10, Fib(7)=13>10. So m=4, since m+2=6 → m=4. Which matches the sample input where n=10 gives output 4. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum m such that Fib(m+2) ≤n. But how do we compute this efficiently given that n can be up to 1e18?\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the maximum m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nBut wait, what if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, n=4. Fib(5)=5>4, Fib(4)=3<=4. So m=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Let's compute them.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence starts with Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4) = 3, Fib(5) = 5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, Fib(8)=21, ..., Fib(k) up to 1e18.\n\nOnce we have this list, for a given n, we find the largest k such that Fib(k) ≤n. Then, m = k-2. Because Fib(k) = Fib(m+2). So m = k-2.\n\nWait, for example, when n=3, Fib(4)=3. So k=4. m=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=10. The Fib numbers are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,... So the largest Fib(k) <=10 is 8, which is Fib(6). So k=6. m=6-2=4. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the maximum k such that Fib(k) ≤n, then subtract 2 from k to get the answer.\n\nBut what about cases where n is not a Fibonacci number? Like n=4, which is between Fib(4)=3 and Fib(5)=5. So the maximum is Fib(4)=3, which gives k=4, m=2. Correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute the list of Fib numbers up to 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the largest Fib number less than or equal to n. Let's call this Fib(k). Then the answer is k-2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, n starts at 2. So no need to handle that.\n\nBut let's think about the Fib sequence. Let's generate the Fib numbers:\n\nLet me generate them step by step:\n\nWe can start with Fib[0] = 0, Fib[1] = 1, Fib[2] = 1, Fib[3] = 2, Fib[4]=3, Fib[5]=5, Fib[6]=8, Fib[7]=13, Fib[8]=21, Fib[9]=34, Fib[10]=55, Fib[11]=89, Fib[12]=144, Fib[13]=233, Fib[14]=377, Fib[15]=610, Fib[16]=987, Fib[17]=1597, Fib[18]=2584, Fib[19]=4181, Fib[20]=6765, Fib[21]=10946, Fib[22]=17711, Fib[23]=28657, Fib[24]=46368, Fib[25]=75025, Fib[26]=121393, Fib[27]=196418, Fib[28]=317811, Fib[29]=514229, Fib[30]=832040, Fib[31]=1,346,269, Fib[32]=2,178,309, Fib[33]=3,524,578, Fib[34]=5,702,887, Fib[35]=9,227,465, Fib[36]=14,930,352, Fib[37]=24,157,817, Fib[38]=39,088,169, Fib[39]=63,245,986, Fib[40]=102,334,155, Fib[41]=165,580,141, Fib[42]=267,914,296, Fib[43]=433,494,437, Fib[44]=701,408,733, Fib[45]=1,134,903,170, Fib[46]=1,836,311,903, Fib[47]=2,971,215,073, Fib[48]=4,807,526,976, Fib[49]=7,778,742,049, Fib[50]=12,586,269,025, Fib[51]=20,365,011,074, Fib[52]=32,951,280,099, Fib[53]=53,316,291,173, Fib[54]=86,267,571,272, Fib[55]=139,583,862,445, Fib[56]=225,851,433,717, Fib[57]=365,435,296,162, Fib[58]=591,286,729,879, Fib[59]=956,722,026,041, Fib[60]=1,548,008,755,920, Fib[61]=2,504,730,781,961, Fib[62]=4,052,739,537,881, Fib[63]=6,557,470,319,842, Fib[64]=10,610,209,857,723, Fib[65]=17,167,680,177,565, Fib[66]=27,777,890,035,288, Fib[67]=44,945,570,212,853, Fib[68]=72,723,460,248,141, Fib[69]=117,669,030,460,994, Fib[70]=190,392,490,709,135, Fib[71]=308,061,521,170,129, Fib[72]=498,454,011,879,264, Fib[73]=806,515,533,049,393, Fib[74]=1,304,969,544,928,657, Fib[75]=2,111,485,077,978,050, Fib[76]=3,416,454,622,906,707, Fib[77]=5,527,939,700,884,757, Fib[78]=8,944,394,323,791,464, Fib[79]=14,472,334,024,676,221, Fib[80]=23,416,728,348,467,685, Fib[81]=37,889,062,373,143,906, Fib[82]=61,305,790,721,611,591, Fib[83]=99,194,853,094,755,497, Fib[84]=160,500,643,816,367,088, Fib[85]=259,695,496,911,122,585, Fib[86]=420,196,140,727,489,673, Fib[87]=679,891,637,638,612,258, Fib[88]=1,100,087,778,366,101,931, Fib[89]=1,779,979,416,004,714,189, Fib[90]=2,880,067,194,370,816,120, Fib[91]=4,660,046,610,375,530,309, Fib[92]=7,540,113,804,746,346,429, Fib[93]=12,200,160,415,121,876,738, Fib[94]=19,740,274,219,868,223,167, Fib[95]=31,940,434,634,990,099,905, Fib[96]=51,680,708,854,858,323,072, Fib[97]=83,621,143,489,848,422,977, Fib[98]=135,301,852,344,706,746,049, Fib[99]=218,922,995,834,555,169,026, Fib[100]=354,224,848,179,261,915,075, Fib[101]=573,147,844,013,817,084,101, Fib[102]=927,372,692,193,078,999,176, Fib[103]=1,500,520,536,206,896,083,277, Fib[104]=2,427,893,228,4, ... and so on. \n\nBut for n up to 1e18, we can precompute all these numbers until they exceed 1e18. Let's compute them in code.\n\nOnce we have the list of Fib numbers, for a given n, we can perform a binary search to find the maximum k where Fib[k] <=n. Then the answer is k-2.\n\nBut wait, for example, when n=2, Fib[3]=2. So k=3. Then answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. Fib[4]=3. answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4. Fib[4]=3 is the largest <=4. answer is 2.\n\nn=5. Fib[5]=5. answer 5-2=3. So for n=5, the answer is 3.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the Fib numbers until they exceed 1e18.\n\n- For input n, find the largest Fib number <=n. Let's call it Fib[k].\n\n- The answer is k-2.\n\nBut how to handle the Fib numbers?\n\nLet me think about generating them. We can generate them in a list, starting from Fib[0] = 0, Fib[1]=1, Fib[2]=1, etc. Then, for each n, we can binary search through this list.\n\nBut for the problem, the Fib numbers that are relevant are those where Fib[k] is up to 1e18. Let's generate them in code.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nGenerate a list of Fibonacci numbers, starting with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc., until the next number exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce we have that list, for a given n, we can find the largest Fib number <=n. Then subtract 2 from the index.\n\nBut how to handle the indexes? Let's think:\n\nSuppose the list is called fibs. For example:\n\nfibs = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... ]\n\nFor n=2, the largest Fib number is 2, which is at index 3. Then answer is 3-2=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nFind the largest k such that fibs[k] <=n.\n\nanswer = k-2.\n\nBut what if n is less than 2? Well, the problem says n >=2.\n\nBut for example, n=2: fibs[3]=2. answer is 3-2=1.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, generate the list of Fib numbers.\n\nIn Python:\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next)\n\nBut wait, the initial list is [0,1], then next is 0+1=1. Then append 1. Then next is 1+1=2. Append. Then 1+2=3, etc. So the list will be [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,...].\n\nBut the indexes for Fib numbers:\n\nfib[0] = 0\n\nfib[1] = 1\n\nfib[2] = 1\n\nfib[3] = 2\n\nfib[4] = 3\n\nfib[5] = 5\n\nfib[6] = 8\n\nand so on.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to find the maximum index k where fib[k] <=n.\n\nOnce found, answer is k-2.\n\nBut what if n is less than the first Fib number that is >=2? For example, n=2, which is exactly fib[3]=2.\n\nBut let's test for n=2.\n\nBut what about for n=1? Well, the problem says n starts from 2.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nGenerate the list of Fib numbers as described.\n\nFind the maximum k such that fib[k] <=n.\n\nThen answer is k-2.\n\nBut how to find k? We can use binary search.\n\nBut for the list, since it's sorted, we can perform a binary search.\n\nBut in Python, for a list, we can use bisect module.\n\nFor example, using bisect_right.\n\nFor example, for a given n, the index is bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) -1.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nFor example, if n is 2, fibs is [0,1,1,2,3,...]. bisect_right returns the insertion point after the existing entries of 2. So for [0,1,1,2,3], bisect_right(fibs, 2) returns 4. Subtract 1 gives 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. bisect_right returns 5 (since the list is [0,1,1,2,3,5...], and 3 is at index 4. bisect_right returns 5, subtract 1 gives 4. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code can be:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nn = int(input())\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n\nans = index - 2\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but what if the index is 0 or 1? For example, if n=0, but n is >=2. So for n=2, index is 3. ans is 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nBut let's check for n=3, index is 4. ans=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nn=5, index is 5 (since fibs[5]=5). ans=5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nWhat about n=4? The largest Fib number <=4 is 3, which is at index 4. ans=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is exactly a Fib number?\n\nYes, that's handled correctly.\n\nBut what about when n is larger than the last Fib number in the list? For example, if the list stops at Fib[k], and n is larger than Fib[k], then the code would return index as len(fibs)-1, which is the last element. But the loop in generating the Fib numbers stops when next_fib exceeds 1e18. So the list contains all Fib numbers up to the first one exceeding 1e18. So for example, if n is 1e18, and the last Fib number is less than or equal to 1e18, then it's included.\n\nBut how to generate the list correctly?\n\nLet me think about generating the list:\n\nInitially, fibs = [0, 1]\n\nThen, while True:\n\nnext_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\nif next_fib > 1e18: break\n\nappend next_fib.\n\nSo, for example, the list will include all Fib numbers up to the maximum that is <= 1e18.\n\nBut for example, if the next_fib is exactly 1e18, it will be added. If it's larger, it's not.\n\nSo the list is correct.\n\nNow, let's test for n=10.\n\nThe Fib numbers up to 10 are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13. So the list would have 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13. The bisect_right for 10 is 7 (since 13 is larger than 10, and the insertion point is after 8, which is at index 6. So bisect_right returns 7, minus 1 is 6. So ans is 6-2=4. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut note that for very large numbers, the Fib numbers can be generated as integers. Python can handle big integers.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut first, generate the list of Fib numbers.\n\nBut the initial code:\n\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    # generate Fib list\n\n    fibs = [0, 1]\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n        if next_fib > 1e18:\n\n            break\n\n        fibs.append(next_fib)\n\n    # Now find the index\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) -1\n\n    print(idx -2)\n\nBut wait, for example, when n=2, the fibs list is [0,1,1,2,3, ... ].\n\nBut let's check for the first few steps.\n\nBut the code may have a problem with the initial fibs list. Let's think:\n\nInitially, fibs = [0, 1]\n\nnext_fib = 0+1=1. Which is <= 1e18. So append. Now fibs is [0,1,1].\n\nThen next_fib is 1+1=2. append.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific constraint on the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves leveraging the properties of Fibonacci numbers to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraint**: The key constraint is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This leads us to consider the structure of the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a game.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The problem can be reduced to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players `n`. This is because the maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the position in the Fibonacci sequence.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible value (10^18) and use binary search to quickly find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    fibs = [0, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_fib > 10**18:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_fib)\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n    print(idx - 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum value of `10^18` since the input constraints allow `n` to be as large as `10^18`.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: Using the `bisect` module, we find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`. This helps in determining the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n3. **Index Adjustment**: The index of the found Fibonacci number in the list is adjusted by subtracting 2 to get the required result, based on the derived relationship between Fibonacci indices and the maximum number of games.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of `n` using precomputed Fibonacci numbers and binary search, resulting in an optimal solution.",
