Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize (S1 + S2) is maximized. Both have to make exactly n moves each, and the order of taking digits from A matters a lot.\n\nHmm, the key here is that each turn, the players decide who takes the next digit. But since they want to maximize the total, we need to choose at each step whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit, considering the future steps.\n\nBut how do we model this? Since n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. So for a brute force approach, considering all possibilities would be 2^36, which is way too big. That's not feasible. So we need a dynamic programming approach here.\n\nLet me think about the state. The state depends on how many digits have been taken so far by each player. Let's say that after some steps, Homer has taken h moves and Marge has taken m moves. Since each move takes one digit, the total digits taken so far is h + m. And since each player must take exactly n steps, the state can be represented by (h, m). But since h + m = k (the current step), maybe we can represent the state as (h, m) where h is the number of moves Homer has made, and m is the number of moves Marge has made. At each step, the next move can be either H or M, provided that h < n or m < n respectively.\n\nBut how do we track the maximum total value? Because the choice of taking a digit now affects the future choices. However, the problem requires us to maximize the sum of S1 and S2. But since S1 is the digits Homer took, and S2 is the digits Marge took, the total is just the sum of all digits taken by both players. Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Because when you take a digit, it's added to your own number. But the total prize is S1 + S2. However, S1 and S2 are numbers formed by the digits taken. For example, if Homer takes digits 1 and 2, his number is 12, and Marge takes 3 and 4, her number is 34. The total is 12 + 34 = 46. But the sum of the digits is 1+2+3+4=10. Which is way smaller. So the total prize isn't just the sum of the digits, but the actual numeric values of the numbers formed by the digits.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the first player gets S1 dollars and the second gets S2. So the total is S1 + S2. So the goal is to maximize this sum. But how does that relate to the order in which the digits are taken?\n\nFor example, taking a higher digit earlier gives more weight to that digit. For instance, if Homer takes a digit d as the first digit of his number, that contributes d * 10^{n-1} to his total. Whereas if he takes it later, it contributes less. Similarly for Marge. So the problem is about choosing which player takes which digits in order to maximize the sum of their numbers.\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we model this? Because the value of each digit depends on the position in which it's taken by the respective player.\n\nLet me think. For each digit, when it is taken by a player, its contribution to the total depends on the position in the player's number. For example, the first digit taken by Homer is the most significant digit of his number. So, the first time Homer takes a digit, it's multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc. Similarly for Marge.\n\nSo the problem becomes selecting for each digit, which player takes it, and in which position (i.e., how many times they have already taken digits). The challenge is to choose the order of taking digits so that the sum of the numbers is maximized.\n\nBut how can we model this with dynamic programming?\n\nThe state needs to capture how many digits each player has taken so far. Let's define dp[h][m] as the maximum total value achievable when Homer has taken h digits and Marge has taken m digits. Then, the current state is h and m, and the next step is to take the next digit (which is the (h + m)th digit in the original A string). Because each step, the players take the leftmost digit of A. So the order in which digits are taken is fixed, but the choice of who takes it varies.\n\nWait, the digits are taken from the front. So, for example, the first digit taken is the first digit of A, then the next is the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize (the sum of their numbers formed by the digits they take) is maximized. Each player must make exactly `n` moves, and the order in which they take digits from the given number `A` significantly affects the total prize.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where the state is defined by the number of digits each player has taken so far (Homer's count `h` and Marge's count `m`). The transition between states involves deciding whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit.\n2. **Memoization**: We memoize the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.\n3. **Greedy Choice with DP**: At each step, we consider both possible choices (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and choose the one that leads to the maximum total prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    \n    # Precompute the digits as integers\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n    \n    # Memoization function\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        # Current position is h + m\n        pos = h + m\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return 0, ''\n        # Determine who can take the next move\n        max_total = -1\n        best_move = ''\n        # Try Homer's move if possible\n        if h < n:\n            # Compute the contribution of this digit to Homer's number\n            # Homer's current count is h, so this digit will be at position h (0-based), contributing digit * 10^(n - h - 1)\n            power = n - h - 1\n            contrib = digits[pos] * (10 ** power)\n            next_total, next_seq = dp(h + 1, m)\n            total = contrib + next_total\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'H' + next_seq\n        # Try Marge's move if possible\n        if m < n:\n            # Compute the contribution of this digit to Marge's number\n            power = n - m - 1\n            contrib = digits[pos] * (10 ** power)\n            next_total, next_seq = dp(h, m + 1)\n            total = contrib + next_total\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'M' + next_seq\n        return max_total, best_move\n    \n    _, result = dp(0, 0)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number `n` and the string `A`.\n2. **Digit Conversion**: The digits of `A` are converted into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store results of subproblems. It takes the current counts of moves made by Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`) and returns the maximum total prize and the corresponding sequence of moves.\n4. **Contribution Calculation**: For each move, the contribution of the current digit to the respective player's number is calculated based on its position (most significant to least significant).\n5. **Recursive Decision Making**: At each step, both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) are considered, and the one leading to the higher total prize is chosen.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences efficiently using dynamic programming and memoization, leading to an optimal solution.",
