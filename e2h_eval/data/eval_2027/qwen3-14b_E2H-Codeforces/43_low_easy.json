He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is: A has a string of only 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, maybe the count of 'c's equals both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must have all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters must be all a's, followed by all b's, followed by all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. For example, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's impossible.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So the characters must be grouped in that order. So any occurrence of a 'b' after a 'c' is invalid, or an 'a' after a 'b', etc.\n\nSo first step: Check the order of characters. Let's think about how to do that. For example, the string should not have any 'a's after 'b's or 'c's. Similarly, no 'b's after 'c's.\n\nSo, for the string S, we can check the order by looking at the transitions between characters. Let's iterate through the string and ensure that once a 'b' is encountered, there are no more 'a's. Once a 'c' is encountered, there are no more 'a's or 'b's.\n\nAlternatively, the string can be divided into three parts: all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So the string should be composed of a block of a's, followed by a block of b's, followed by a block of c's. So, for example, \"aaabbbcc\" is okay, but \"aabbaaccc\" is not because after the b's, there's an a again.\n\nSo the first check is that the string is in this format. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts. Let me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\nAfter A and B's steps, the string is (some a's) + (some b's). Then C adds c's equal to either count_a or count_b (from that point). Wait, when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's is the same as in the string before adding the c's. Because the c's are added after.\n\nSo the original string before adding c's is (count_a) a's and (count_b) b's. Then, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. But since the original string (before adding c's) has count_a and count_b, and after adding c's, the count_c is added. So the final count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the count of c's in the final string is exactly the number added by C. Because the original string before C's step had no c's. So the count_c in the final string is equal to the number of c's added by C. So the condition is that count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original).\n\nBut wait, the original count_a and count_b are the ones from the string before adding the c's. Which is the same as the count_a and count_b in the final string. Because adding c's doesn't affect the count of a's and b's.\n\nSo for the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. But also, the original string (before C added the c's) must have at least one a and one b. Because B made sure that after appending the b's, there is at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1. Because the c's are added after that.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is in the form a*b*c* (i.e., all a's first, then all b's, then all c's).\n\n2. count_a >= 1, count_b >= 1.\n\n3. count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where count_c equals both count_a and count_b? Like if count_a = count_b = count_c. Then that's allowed.\n\nSo",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by appending 'b's and then 'c's to a string of 'a's, following specific rules. The string must be composed of a block of 'a's, followed by a block of 'b's, and then a block of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before the 'c's were added.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order of Characters**: Ensure that the string is in the form `a*b*c*`, meaning all 'a's come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's.\n2. **Count Characters**: Calculate the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Validate Conditions**: Check if there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' (since B ensures this), and if the number of 'c's equals either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check the order of characters: all a's, then b's, then c's\n    in_a = True\n    in_b = True\n    in_c = True\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if not in_a:\n                return False\n            in_b = False\n            in_c = False\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if not in_b:\n                return False\n            in_a = False\n            in_c = False\n        elif char == 'c':\n            if not in_c:\n                return False\n            in_a = False\n            in_b = False\n    # Now check counts\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1:\n        return False\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    if is_valid_string(input_str):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The function `is_valid_string` first checks if the characters are in the correct order by iterating through the string and ensuring that once a character changes from 'a' to 'b' or 'c', it does not revert back to a previous character type.\n2. **Count Validation**: After confirming the order, the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are checked. The string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b', and the number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently validate the string structure and conditions in linear time, making it suitable for the given input constraints.",
