Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (which is 1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I need to think about the approach here. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe there's a way to handle each weight category separately and then combine them optimally. Because with knapsack problems, when the weights are small, there might be some optimizations.\n\nThe classic unbounded knapsack approach won't work here because n is too big. But since each item is unique (it's 0-1 knapsack), but with the weights limited to 1-3, maybe we can process each weight group and find the best selection.\n\nLet me think. For each weight (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight category, we can precompute the prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from that category, we can quickly calculate the total cost.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, if we take k items, the total weight is k*1, and the cost is the sum of the top k items. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce we have these sorted lists and prefix sums, the problem becomes selecting how many items to take from each weight group such that the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut how do we combine these choices? Let's think about it.\n\nLet's say we have:\n\n- For weight 1: sorted list of costs, prefix sum array s1, where s1[k] is the sum of the first k items.\n- For weight 2: sorted list of costs, prefix sum array s2.\n- For weight 3: sorted list of costs, prefix sum array s3.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 1 items (say, a), and weight 2 items (b), and weight 3 items (c), we need to check if a*1 + b*2 + c*3 <= m. But trying all combinations would be O(n^3) which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter way. Maybe for each possible number of weight 3 items, we can compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items. Or maybe for each possible number of weight 1 and 2 items, and then compute how many weight 3 items can fit.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small (1, 2, 3), maybe we can loop through all possible numbers of weight 3 items, and then for the remaining capacity, solve the problem for weight 1 and 2.\n\nWait, let's think about this. Let's suppose we take x items of weight 3. Then, the total weight used by them is 3x. The remaining capacity is m - 3x. Then, for this remaining capacity, we need to choose the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items. How can we compute that efficiently?\n\nFor the remaining capacity, let's say it's rem = m - 3x. Then, the problem reduces to solving a knapsack with capacity rem, where items can be weight 1 or 2. But since the items are already sorted, perhaps we can find the optimal selection for any rem in O(rem) time. However, since rem can be up to m (3e5), and x can be up to m//3 (around 1e5), this would be O(m^2), which is not feasible for m=3e5.\n\nHmm, that's not going to work. Need another approach.\n\nWait, but for the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value possible using only those items. Then, for each x (number of weight 3 items), we can compute the max value as s3[x] + dp[rem], where dp[rem] is the max value for capacity rem using weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute dp? For the weight 1 and 2 items, since they are sorted, perhaps we can compute for each possible capacity, the optimal selection.\n\nBut again, with m up to 3e5, and n up to 1e5, how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that for weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value. Let's denote this as dp[w]. How to compute this?\n\nThe standard knapsack approach for 0-1 knapsack is O(nm), which would be 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nBut here, the items are grouped by their weight. For example, all weight 1 items are sorted in descending order of cost. Similarly for weight 2.\n\nSo, for each weight group, we can take as many as possible. But since it's 0-1, each item can be taken once.\n\nWait, but for weight 1 items, the optimal way to take them is to take the top k items (since they are sorted in descending order). Similarly for weight 2. So, for a given capacity, how to choose between taking some number of weight 1 and weight 2 items?\n\nLet me think. For example, if I have capacity W, and I have a list of weight 1 items (sorted) and weight 2 items (sorted), what is the maximum value I can get?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each possible number of weight 2 items, we can compute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can fit into the remaining capacity.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose we have a capacity W. Let's say we take y items of weight 2. Then, the total weight used by them is 2y. The remaining capacity is W - 2y, which allows us to take min( (W - 2y), len(weight1) ) items of weight 1. But since the weight1 items are sorted, taking as many as possible gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to find the optimal y?\n\nThe idea is that for each possible y (number of weight 2 items taken), we can compute the maximum possible value as s2[y] + s1[ min( (W - 2y), len1 ) ].\n\nBut since y can range from 0 to min( len2, W//2 ), which could be up to 1.5e5 (if W is 3e5), and for each x (number of weight 3 items), this would take O(W) time, which would be O(3e5) per x, and x can be up to 1e5. That's again O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm. Not feasible. So we need a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: Precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value achievable using weight 1 and 2 items. How can we do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the weight 1 and 2 items. Let's say we have sorted lists for weight 1 and 2.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- For weight 1: list a, sorted descending. Prefix sum array A, where A[k] is the sum of the first k items. The maximum number of items we can take is len_a = len(a).\n\n- For weight 2: list b, sorted descending. Prefix sum array B, where B[k] is the sum of the first k items. The maximum number of items we can take is len_b = len(b).\n\nNow, for a given capacity W, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible combinations of k and l such that k*1 + l*2 ≤ W, of A[k] + B[l].\n\nHow can we compute this efficiently?\n\nFor each possible l (number of weight 2 items), the maximum k is min( (W - 2*l), len_a ). So for each l, we can compute the corresponding k, and take the sum A[k] + B[l]. Then, the maximum of all these values is the answer for capacity W.\n\nBut how to find the optimal l for each W?\n\nBut for each W, the possible l ranges from 0 to min( len_b, W//2 ). For each l, the k is min( W - 2*l, len_a ). So for each W, we can iterate over l and compute the value. However, this would be O(W) per W, which is O(m^2) for all possible W. Which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute for all W in O(m) time.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each possible l (number of weight 2 items taken), we can compute the maximum possible k for that l, and then for the total weight 2l +k, and update the dp accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think again. Let's imagine that we have to compute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value using weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2 items. Then, for each possible capacity W, we can find the best possible combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach is to note that for each capacity W, the optimal choice is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the rest with weight 1 items. But that's not necessarily true. For example, if taking one less weight 2 item allows taking more weight 1 items, which may give a higher total.\n\nSo, perhaps for each W, we can try all possible numbers of weight 2 items up to min(len_b, W//2), and for each such l, take the maximum possible k (number of weight 1 items) as min( W - 2*l, len_a ), and take the sum A[k] + B[l]. The maximum among all these possibilities is the maximum value for capacity W.\n\nBut even with this approach, for each W, it would take O(len_b) time, which again is O(m * len_b) time. Which is not feasible.\n\nBut maybe we can find that for each W, the optimal l is around W//2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for a given W, the maximum possible l is floor(W/2). But even so, how can we find the best l quickly?\n\nLet me think of the following. For each W, the optimal l is between max(0, floor( (W - len_a)/2 )) ) and floor(W/2). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, for each possible l, the B[l] increases as l increases. However, taking more weight 2 items may allow less weight 1 items, which may decrease the sum A[k].\n\nSo, for a fixed W, the function f(l) = B[l] + A[ min( W - 2*l, len_a ) ] may have a single peak, which can be found via ternary search. But since l is an integer, perhaps we can find the optimal l in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted, for a given W, we can try all possible l in a certain range. However, the number of possible l's for each W is up to min( len_b, W//2 ), which can be up to O(1.5e5) for W=3e5. But for all W up to 3e5, this would be O(3e5 * 1.5e5) = 4.5e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible. Need a better way.\n\nLet me think again. Since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming, but optimized for the small weights.\n\nWait, here's another idea. For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, and then for each possible capacity, compute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be added.\n\nBut how to model this in a DP way.\n\nLet me think of the following. Let's create a DP array for the weight 1 and 2 items. The DP array will be of size m+1, where dp[w] is the maximum value achievable with capacity w using only weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0. Then, for each item in the combined list of weight 1 and 2 items, we can perform the standard 0-1 knapsack update. However, since n can be up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, this would take O(nm) time, which is 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nBut wait, the items are grouped by their weights. For example, for weight 1 items, they are sorted. Similarly for weight 2. So perhaps we can process each group in a way that allows us to compute the DP in O(m) time per group.\n\nYes! For example, for weight 1 items, since they are sorted, we can process them in a way that for each possible capacity, we take the maximum number of them. But how?\n\nWait, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted in descending order, taking the first k items (for k up to the number of available items) gives the maximum value. So for the DP, perhaps we can process all weight 1 items first, then all weight 2 items.\n\nBut how to process them efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following. For the weight 1 items, the maximum number of items we can take for a capacity w is min(w, len_a). So for the DP, after processing all weight 1 items, dp[w] = max(dp[w], A[k] where k is min(w, len_a)).\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the DP needs to track the maximum value for each capacity. For example, if we have multiple items, but the DP is built incrementally.\n\nAlternatively, since all weight 1 items are processed, and we want to take as many as possible of them, perhaps the optimal way is to take the first k items for each capacity.\n\nSo for the DP, for each capacity from 1 to m, the maximum value would be the maximum between the previous value and adding the next weight 1 item. But since the items are sorted, taking the first k items is optimal.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted, the best way to take them is to take as many as possible. So for any capacity w, the maximum value contributed by weight 1 items is A[min(w, len_a)].\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 items, the best is to take as many as possible. But combining them is tricky.\n\nWait, but what if we process the weight 1 and 2 items in a way that allows us to compute for each capacity, the maximum value.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity, the maximum value by considering the following:\n\nFor each capacity w, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking the best possible combination of weight 1 and 2 items that sum to w.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: since weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can use the following method. For each possible capacity w, the maximum value can be found by trying to take some number of weight 2 items and then filling the rest with weight 1 items. But how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following. For each possible capacity w, we can compute the maximum possible value as follows:\n\nmax_val = 0\n\nfor l in 0 to min(len_b, w//2):\n\n    remaining = w - 2*l\n\n    k = min(remaining, len_a)\n\n    current_val = B[l] + A[k]\n\n    if current_val > max_val:\n\n        max_val = current_val\n\nreturn max_val\n\nBut for each w, this is O(len_b) time. If len_b is up to 1e5, and w up to 3e5, this is O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to optimize this for all possible w. Let's think about the maximum number of weight 2 items that can be taken. For example, for all possible l, and for all w >= 2*l, we can add the value B[l] + A[ min(w - 2*l, len_a) ].\n\nBut how to compute this for all w efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each l (number of weight 2 items), we can compute for all possible w >= 2*l, the contribution of B[l] + A[ min(w - 2*l, len_a) ].\n\nBut how to find for each w the maximum of these contributions.\n\nLet me think of this as follows. For each l, the contribution to w is B[l] + A[ min(w - 2*l, len_a) ]. So for each l, this is a function that for each w >= 2*l, adds a certain value. The maximum over all l for each w is the desired value.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the A array. For any w, the term min(w - 2*l, len_a) is equal to the minimum between (w - 2*l) and the number of weight 1 items. So for each l, the contribution is B[l] + A[ min( (w - 2*l), len_a ) ].\n\nBut for a fixed l, when w increases, the value of (w - 2*l) increases, so the term min(...) increases until it reaches len_a. After that, it's fixed as A[len_a].\n\nSo for each l, the contribution is a function that increases up to w = 2*l + len_a, and then remains constant.\n\nSo for all w >= 2*l + len_a, the contribution is B[l] + A[len_a].\n\nSo for each l, we can compute two ranges:\n\n- For w in [2*l, 2*l + len_a], the contribution is B[l] + A[w - 2*l].\n\n- For w >= 2*l + len_a, the contribution is B[l] + A[len_a].\n\nSo, if we can precompute for each l, these ranges and update the maximum for each w, then perhaps we can find the maximum value for all w in O(len_b + m) time.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems like a possible approach. Let's think of the following steps:\n\n1. Precompute prefix sums A and B for weight 1 and 2 items.\n\n2. Initialize a dp array of size m+1 with zeros.\n\n3. For each l in 0 to len_b:\n\n   a. Compute the value of B[l].\n\n   b. For the range of w where 2*l <= w <= 2*l + len_a:\n\n       i. For each w in this range, the contribution is B[l] + A[w - 2*l]. We need to compare this with the current dp[w] and take the maximum.\n\n   c. For w >= 2*l + len_a, the contribution is B[l] + A[len_a]. For these w, we can compare this value with dp[w] and take the maximum.\n\nBut again, iterating over all w for each l is O(m * len_b) time, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: for each l, the contribution to the dp array is a certain function, and we can find the maximum over all l for each w.\n\nBut perhaps we can find for each possible w, the maximum between B[l] + A[k], where k is min(w - 2*l, len_a), for all l.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently.\n\nWait, here's a different angle. For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for capacity W can be found as follows:\n\nLet’s say we take x weight 1 items and y weight 2 items, such that x + 2y ≤ W. We want to maximize A[x] + B[y].\n\nWe can think of this as for a given y, x can be up to W - 2y. So for each y, the maximum x is min( W - 2y, len_a ), and thus the maximum value is B[y] + A[ min( W - 2y, len_a ) ].\n\nNow, for each W, the optimal y is such that 2y ≤ W. So the maximum possible y is floor(W / 2).\n\nBut how to find the best y for each W quickly?\n\nSuppose we precompute for all possible y (up to len_b) the value of B[y], and then for each W, we can compute the best possible y in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider that for a given W, the possible y ranges from 0 to y_max = min( len_b, floor(W/2) ). For each y in this range, the value is B[y] + A[ min(W - 2y, len_a) ].\n\nLet me denote this function as f(y) = B[y] + A[ min(W - 2y, len_a) ].\n\nWe can think of this as a function that depends on y, and we need to find its maximum in the range 0 ≤ y ≤ y_max.\n\nNow, the question is: can we find this maximum quickly for any W?\n\nLet me think about the function f(y). As y increases, 2y increases, so W - 2y decreases. Thus, the term min(W - 2y, len_a) decreases. However, B[y] increases as y increases (since the items are sorted in descending order and we are taking the top y items). So the function f(y) may have a single peak, or it may be unimodal. If that's the case, we can use ternary search to find the maximum y for a given W.\n\nBut how to confirm that f(y) is unimodal?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose W is large enough that W - 2y ≥ len_a for some y. In that case, min(...) is len_a, and f(y) = B[y] + A[len_a]. Since B[y] increases with y, this part of the function increases with y. But if W - 2y < len_a for some y, then min(...) is W - 2y, which decreases as y increases. So the term A[W-2y] decreases as y increases. So the function f(y) is B[y] + A[W-2y]. Here, B[y] increases, and A[W-2y] decreases. Depending on the rate of increase and decrease, the function may have a single maximum point.\n\nSo it's possible that the function f(y) is unimodal, which would allow us to perform ternary search on y for each W.\n\nIf this is true, then for each W, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max], which would take O(log y_max) time per W. This would reduce the overall complexity.\n\nBut how to implement this, and whether this assumption holds?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each W, the optimal y is either floor((W - k)/2) for some k, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose W is 5, len_a is 3 (so A[3] is the sum of all 3 weight 1 items), and len_b is 2 (B[2] is the sum of both weight 2 items). \n\nFor y=0: min(5, 3) =5 → but wait, W is 5, 2y is 0, so W-2y is 5. But since weight 1 items are up to 3, then x is min(5, 3) =3. So value is B[0] + A[3].\n\nFor y=1: 2*1=2 → W-2y=3 → min(3,3)=3. So value is B[1] + A[3].\n\nFor y=2: 2*2=4 → W-2y=1 → min(1,3)=1. So value is B[2] + A[1].\n\nSo the values are:\n\ny=0: B[0] + A[3]\n\ny=1: B[1] + A[3]\n\ny=2: B[2] + A[1]\n\nWhich one is larger depends on the actual values of B and A. It's possible that the maximum occurs at y=0 or y=1, or y=2. So the function may not be strictly increasing or decreasing, but it's possible that it's unimodal.\n\nAssuming that the function is unimodal, ternary search can be applied. But how to confirm this?\n\nWell, even if it's not unimodal, ternary search might still find the maximum in practice. But this is risky. However, given the time constraints, perhaps this is the only feasible way forward.\n\nSo, the plan would be:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items:\n\n1. Sort the weight 1 items in descending order of cost, compute prefix sums A.\n\n2. Sort the weight 2 items in descending order of cost, compute prefix sums B.\n\nThen, for each W (from 0 to m), compute the maximum value by trying to find the optimal y via ternary search.\n\nOnce we have this, then for the original problem, we can proceed as follows:\n\nLoop through all possible x (number of weight 3 items taken). For each x, compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3x. If rem is negative, skip. Then, compute the maximum value for rem using the weight 1 and 2 items (using the above approach), and add it to the value of s3[x]. Keep track of the maximum overall.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum value for rem using weight 1 and 2 items. For each x, we can call the ternary search approach for rem. However, since x can be up to 1e5, and for each x, the ternary search takes O(log y_max) time, this may be feasible.\n\nBut how to implement this ternary search for each W?\n\nLet's outline the steps for the ternary search function:\n\nFunction get_max_for_W(W):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = min(len_b, W // 2)\n\n    best = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = compute_value(mid1, W)\n\n        val2 = compute_value(mid2, W)\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            best = max(best, val2)\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            best = max(best, val1)\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    # Also check the endpoints\n\n    for y in [low, high, 0, min(len_b, W//2)]:\n\n        current_val = compute_value(y, W)\n\n        best = max(best, current_val)\n\n    return best\n\nBut this is just an example of how ternary search could be implemented. However, this may not cover all cases, and the function may not be unimodal. So this is a bit risky.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of possible y for each W is small (for example, for W up to 3e5, and len_b up to 1e5), perhaps we can precompute for each possible W the optimal y by trying all possible y in the vicinity of W//2, say from max(0, y_candidate - 100) to y_candidate + 100, etc. But this is also not guaranteed to work.\n\nAlternatively, given that the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, and that for a given W, the optimal y is around W//2, we can try all possible y in the range [max(0, y_candidate - K), min(y_candidate + K, y_max)], where K is a small number like 100. This would make the per-W computation O(K) time. For K=200, this would be 200 * 3e5 = 6e7 operations, which may be manageable.\n\nBut what value of K would ensure that we don't miss the optimal y? Well, it's possible that for some cases, the optimal y is far away from W//2, but perhaps for the given constraints of the problem, this approach would work. However, this is a heuristic and may not pass all test cases.\n\nBut given that the time is limited, perhaps this is the way to proceed.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items:\n\nCompute A and B arrays.\n\nThen, for a given W, the maximum value is computed as follows:\n\ny_max = min(len_b, W // 2)\n\nstart from y = max(0, y_max - 200) to y_max, and for each y in this range, compute the value.\n\nBut how to choose the range? Well, for example, take y from 0 to y_max, but only check a few hundred values around the middle. This is a gamble, but perhaps for the purposes of passing the problem's test cases, it would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for all possible W, the best y by considering all possible y up to len_b, but only for the cases where 2y is close to W - k, where k is the number of weight 1 items. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since the weight 1 items are sorted, for a given W and y, the x is min(W - 2y, len_a). So for a given W, the optimal y is the one that maximizes B[y] + A[ min(W - 2y, len_a) ].\n\nLet me think of this as for each W, the optimal y is either such that W - 2y is between 0 and len_a, or W - 2y >= len_a. \n\nCase 1: W - 2y >= len_a → x = len_a. So the value is B[y] + A[len_a]. For this case, since x is fixed, the optimal y is the maximum possible y that satisfies 2y ≤ W - len_a → y ≤ (W - len_a)/2. So for this case, the maximum y is min( len_b, floor( (W - len_a)/2 ) ), and the value is B[y] + A[len_a].\n\nCase 2: W - 2y < len_a → x = W - 2y. So the value is B[y] + A[W - 2y]. For this case, the optimal y is such that 2y ≤ W and W - 2y ≤ len_a → y ≥ (W - len_a)/2. \n\nSo the optimal y is in the range [(W - len_a)/2, floor(W/2)].\n\nThus, for each W, the optimal y can be found in two ranges:\n\n- y ≤ (W - len_a)/2 → case 1: value is B[y] + A[len_a].\n\n- y ≥ (W - len_a)/2 → case 2: value is B[y] + A[W - 2y].\n\nSo, for case 1, the best y is the maximum possible y in that range, which is min( len_b, floor( (W - len_a)/2 ) ). For this y, the value is B[y] + A[len_a].\n\nFor case 2, we can try to find the best y in the range [max(0, floor( (W - len_a)/2 )), min(len_b, floor(W/2))]. For this range, the value is B[y] + A[W - 2y].\n\nSo for case 2, we can iterate over y in this range, and find the maximum.\n\nBut how large is this range?\n\nLet me compute the length of the range. Let's say the lower bound is L = max(0, (W - len_a)/2 ), upper bound is U = min(len_b, W//2). The number of possible y's is U - L + 1. \n\nBut for W up to 3e5, and len_a up to 1e5, (W - len_a) can be negative, making L=0. So the range could be up to W//2, which is up to 1.5e5. Again, this is too large.\n\nBut perhaps for case 2, we can find the optimal y by taking the maximum between the following candidates:\n\n- y = floor( (W - len_a)/2 )\n\n- y = ceil( (W - len_a)/2 )\n\n- and so on, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, since for case 2, the value is B[y] + A[W - 2y], and since B[y] increases with y, and A[W-2y] decreases with y, the function may have a single maximum point. Hence, we can use ternary search on this range.\n\nSo for case 2, we can perform a ternary search on the range [L, U], and find the maximum value.\n\nThus, combining case 1 and case 2, the overall maximum for W can be found.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's outline the steps for a given W:\n\nCompute case1_value:\n\ny_case1 = min( len_b, floor( (W - len_a) / 2 ) )\n\nif 2*y_case1 <= W - len_a → then case1_value = B[y_case1] + A[len_a]\n\nelse → case1_value is not applicable.\n\nCompute case2_value:\n\nFind the maximum value of B[y] + A[W - 2y] for y in [L, U], where L = max(0, floor( (W - len_a)/2 )), U = min( len_b, floor(W/2) )\n\nThen, the overall maximum is the maximum between case1_value and case2_value.\n\nNow, for case2_value, we can perform a ternary search on the range [L, U], assuming the function is unimodal.\n\nThis would reduce the per-W computation time to O(log (U-L+1)) for case2_value.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, for each W, we need to:\n\n1. Compute case1_value.\n\n   a. Compute (W - len_a). If this is negative, then case1_value is not applicable.\n\n   b. Else, compute y_case1 = min( len_b, floor( (W - len_a) / 2 ) )\n\n   c. if 2*y_case1 <= W - len_a → case1_value is B[y_case1] + A[len_a]\n\n   d. else → case1_value is not applicable (but this should not happen since y_case1 is chosen to satisfy 2y_case1 <= W - len_a?)\n\nWait, no. For example, if W - len_a is 5, then (W - len_a)/2 is 2.5 → floor is 2. So 2y_case1 is 4, which is <= W - len_a (5). So yes, case1_value is valid.\n\nSo case1_value is valid.\n\nThen, case2_value is the maximum of B[y] + A[W - 2y] for y in [L, U], where L = max(0, floor( (W - len_a)/2 )), U = min( len_b, floor(W/2) )\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nNow, for case2_value, since the function is B[y] + A[W-2y], and since B[y] increases with y, and A[W-2y] decreases with y, the function may be unimodal. So we can apply ternary search on y in [L, U].\n\nOnce we find the maximum for case2_value, then the overall maximum is the max between case1_value and case2_value.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, putting this together:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute A and B arrays.\n\nThen, for any W, the maximum value using weight 1 and 2 items is computed as described above.\n\nOnce this is done, the overall solution for the original problem would be:\n\n- Preprocess the weight 1, 2, 3 items, sorted and prefix sums.\n\n- For each possible x (number of weight 3 items taken), compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*x.\n\n   a. If rem < 0, skip.\n\n   b. Compute the max value for rem using weight 1 and 2 items (as above).\n\n   c. Add it to the value of the weight 3 items (s3[x]).\n\n   d. Keep track of the maximum total.\n\nNow, the question is how to loop through all possible x. Since the weight of each item is 3, the maximum number of items we can take is min( len_3, m//3 ). So x ranges from 0 to x_max, where x_max = min( len_3, m//3 ).\n\nFor each x, we need to compute the value s3[x] + max_value_for_rem, where rem = m - 3*x.\n\nNow, the total number of x's is up to 1e5 (since m is 3e5, m//3 is 1e5).\n\nFor each x, we need to compute the max_value_for_rem, which involves O(log (U-L+1)) time for case2, and O(1) for case",
