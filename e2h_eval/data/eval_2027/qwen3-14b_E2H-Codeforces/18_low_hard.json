The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints, and we need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps outside [0, x]. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't land on positions outside [0, x], so any jump that would take it beyond x is not allowed.\n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently for very large m (up to 1e9), which suggests that we need an O(1) or O(some small function of a and b) approach, not something that iterates up to m.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can only move forward by a or backward by b, the positions are determined by some linear combinations. However, since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the reachable positions depend on x.\n\nBut maybe there's a mathematical way to model this. Let's consider the general case where the frog can jump forward a steps or backward b steps. Without considering the boundaries (i.e., if the frog can jump anywhere), the set of positions reachable from 0 would be all integers that can be expressed as k*a - l*b for non-negative integers k and l. However, since the frog can't go negative, but in our case, the frog can't go beyond x. But perhaps we can model this with some modular arithmetic?\n\nWait, but the frog can make multiple jumps. So the key here is to find all positions that are reachable through some combination of adding a and subtracting b, but ensuring that all intermediate steps are within [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, considering the problem without the x constraint: the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b). Because the steps are adding a or subtracting b, which are multiples of their gcd. So the positions reachable are those that are multiples of d = gcd(a, b). However, this is only if the frog can move freely. But with the x constraint, the reachable positions are limited.\n\nBut perhaps the reachable positions are all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, and lie in some range. But how does the x affect this?\n\nWait, but even if the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d, but within [0, x], then f(x) would be the number of such positions. However, this is only true if the frog can reach every such position. But that might not be the case. For example, if a=5 and b=3, then d=1. So theoretically, the frog can reach any integer. But when x is small, like x=5, then maybe the frog can reach 0, 5, 2 (if possible). Wait, but the frog starts at 0. To reach 5, it can do +a once. To reach 2, maybe it can do +a (to 5), then -b (to 2). So yes, but that requires that during the jumps, the frog doesn't go beyond x. So in this case, if x is 5, then the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. Then f(5) would be 3. Which matches the first example given.\n\nSo the problem seems to involve two parts:\n\n1. Determine the set of positions reachable under the constraints of not going beyond [0, x].\n2. Count how many such positions there are for each x, then sum over x from 0 to m.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to compute this sum.\n\nLet me think about the conditions under which the frog can reach a certain position. Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = gcd(a, b), provided that there's a way to reach it without stepping out of [0, x] during the journey.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are in [0, x], and also satisfy some condition based on the steps required to reach them.\n\nWait, but even if a number is a multiple of d, it may not be reachable. For example, if a=2 and b=2, then d=2. The frog can only jump forward by 2 or backward by 2. Starting at 0, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4, etc., but if x is 3, then the frog can't reach 2 because to get there, the frog jumps +2, which is allowed. Wait, 2 is within [0,3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these counts for all values from 0 to a given integer $ m $. The solution involves leveraging mathematical insights into the properties of the jumps and their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by $ a $ or backward by $ b $. The positions reachable are determined by linear combinations of $ a $ and $ b $, constrained by the interval $[0, x]$.\n2. **GCD Insight**: The positions reachable by the frog are all multiples of the GCD of $ a $ and $ b $, denoted as $ d = \\gcd(a, b) $. This is because any linear combination of $ a $ and $ b $ will be a multiple of their GCD.\n3. **Range Calculation**: For each $ x $, the number of reachable positions is the count of multiples of $ d $ within the range $[0, x]$, adjusted for specific constraints based on whether $ a $ and $ b $ are equal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        m = int(input[idx])\n        a = int(input[idx+1])\n        b = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        d = math.gcd(a, b)\n        if a == b:\n            # All positions from 0 to m are reachable\n            total = (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\n            print(total)\n            continue\n        \n        # Now, we need to calculate the sum for each x in [0, m]\n        # For each x, f(x) is the number of multiples of d in [0, x], but considering that the frog can only reach positions that can be formed with steps of a and -b without going out of [0, x]\n        # However, when a != b, the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are >=0 and <=x, and also satisfy that they can be reached via some sequence of jumps.\n        # But since the frog can go back and forth, it can reach any multiple of d that is in [0, x], provided that x is large enough to allow such a path.\n        # However, if the frog cannot reach certain positions due to the constraints of not stepping outside the interval during the jumps, but this seems complex.\n        # However, from the example, when a=5 and b=3, which have gcd 1, the frog can reach every integer once x is large enough.
