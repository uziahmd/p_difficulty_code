    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. Both progress bars update after each byte is copied. The first bar shows the percentage of the current file, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer.\n\nHmm. So for each byte copied (each x in each file i), we have two values: the current file's percentage and the total percentage. We need to collect all the numbers that appear in both at the same time.\n\nThe challenge is to simulate all possible moments and check for overlaps. However, given that the files can be up to 1000 bytes each and n up to 100, the total number of bytes could be up to 100*1000 = 100,000. For each byte, we can compute both percentages and track which numbers are present in both.\n\nBut wait, how do I model all possible moments? Let me think.\n\nEach byte copied is a step. For example, when copying the first byte of the first file, the current file's progress is (100 * 1)/a_1, floored. The total progress is (100 * 1)/total_size, floored. Then for the next byte, etc.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Compute the total size of all files, let's call it total_size.\n\n2. Iterate through each file, and for each byte in that file (from 1 to a_i), compute the current percentage and the total percentage.\n\n3. For each such step, record the value of both percentages and check if they are equal. If they are, add that value to a set of possible answers.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the numbers must be present in both bars at the same time. So for each moment, check if the current percentage of the file and the total percentage are the same. If yes, then that value is part of the answer.\n\nBut also, note that the initial state (before any bytes are copied) shows 0% on both bars. So 0 is always in the answer. Similarly, after all bytes are copied, both bars show 100%. But wait, according to the problem statement, the bars update after each byte. So when the last byte is copied, the total is 100% (since (total_size / total_size) * 100 is exactly 100). So 100 is also included.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think about the initial state. The problem says that both bars show 0% at the beginning. So even before any bytes are copied, 0 is present. But when the first byte is copied, the bars update. So the initial 0 is a valid moment. So we need to include 0 in the answer if there exists a moment where both bars are 0. Well, the initial moment is such a case.\n\nBut for the case of 100%: when the last byte is copied, both bars are 100. So that's also a valid moment.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a set to collect all the valid percentages.\n\n- Initially, add 0 to the set (since at the start, both are 0).\n\n- Then, for each file i, for each byte x from 1 to a_i:\n\n   - Compute current_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n   - Compute total_bytes_so_far = sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} + x\n\n   - total_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_size)\n\n   - If current_percent == total_percent, add this value to the set.\n\n- After processing all bytes, also check if 100 is present. Because when the last byte is copied, the total is exactly 100% (since total_bytes_so_far is total_size, so 100 * total_size / total_size is 100, floor is 100). However, the code above would have handled that for the last byte. Because for the last byte, x is a_n, and the total_bytes_so_far is the sum of all a's. So the code would compute current_percent as floor(100 * a_n / a_n) = 100. And total_percent is floor(100 * total_size / total_size) = 100. So that case is covered.\n\nWait, but what if the total_size is zero? No, since each a_i is at least 1, so total_size is at least n >= 1.\n\nSo the initial 0 is added, and the rest is handled by checking each byte.\n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is already covered when x=0? But according to the problem statement, the bars are updated after each byte. So the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So perhaps the initial state is not captured by the loop. For example, in the first example input, the output includes 0 and 100. So the initial 0 is included, and the 100 is included when the last byte is copied.\n\nSo how do I capture the initial 0? Because in the loop, for each byte, we are processing x from 1 to a_i. So the initial state (x=0 for all files) is not considered. Therefore, I need to check if 0 is present. But according to the problem statement, the initial state is when both bars show 0. So 0 is always a valid value. However, in some cases, maybe the initial 0 is the only occurrence. For example, if the first byte copied makes the current percent 1 and the total percent 0. Then, the initial 0 is present.\n\nSo, the code must include 0 in the answer. However, in the code logic above, the initial 0 is not captured. Because the code checks each byte after it's copied. So how to handle that?\n\nSo, the initial moment (before any bytes are copied) is a valid moment where both bars are 0. So we need to add 0 to the set. But what if, for example, during the copying, the bars never reach 0 again? Well, the initial 0 is valid. So regardless of other steps, 0 is in the answer.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"all such integers from 0 to 100 inclusive that exists a moment when both bars show this number.\"\n\nSo the initial moment is such a moment. Therefore, 0 is always part of the answer. However, in some cases, maybe the initial moment is the only one. For example, if all files are 1 byte, then during the copying, for each byte, the current percent is 100% (for the first file, after x=1, 100*1/1=100, floor is 100). The total percent would be 100% after the first byte. So in that case, 0 is present (initial), and 100 is present (after the first byte). But during the process, the initial 0 is a valid moment.\n\nSo in the code, we need to include 0 in the answer. However, the code as described earlier would miss that. Because in the code, the initial 0 is not checked. So how to handle this?\n\nSo the code needs to check for the initial 0. So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nInitialize a set with 0. Then, process all bytes as before, adding any values where the current percent and total percent are equal. Then, after processing all bytes, check if 100 is in the set. Wait, but the code would have processed the last byte, which would generate 100% for both bars. So that case is already covered.\n\nBut for the initial 0, we need to make sure that it's included. For example, in the first sample input, the output starts with 0. So the code must include 0 in the answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a set called result = {0}.\n\n- Then, for each file i, for each byte x in 1..a_i:\n\n   compute current_percent and total_percent.\n\n   if they are equal, add to result.\n\n- Then, after processing all, check if 100 is in the result. Well, if the last byte is processed, then current_percent for that byte is 100, and the total_percent is 100. So that would have been added. However, what if the total_size is such that when the last byte is copied, the total_percent is 100, but the current_percent is 100. Which it is. So the code would have added 100. So no need to do anything else.\n\nBut what about if the total_size is zero? Well, no, since the input constraints say a_i >= 1.\n\nSo the initial 0 is added, and all other cases are handled by processing each byte.\n\nBut wait, what if during the processing of bytes, the same value is generated multiple times? For example, if during processing, both bars show 50% at some point, then adding 50 to the set once is enough.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and the list a.\n\nCompute total_size = sum(a).\n\nInitialize result as a set containing 0.\n\nThen for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes = sum of a[0..i-1] + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to result.\n\nOnce all bytes are processed, collect all elements in result, sort them, and output.\n\nBut how to compute the sum of a[0..i-1] for each i?\n\nWell, we can precompute the prefix sums. For example, prefix_sum[i] is the sum of the first i files. So for the i-th file (assuming 0-based index), the prefix sum up to the previous file is prefix_sum[i]. So for each file i (starting from 0), the prefix_sum[i] is sum(a[0] ... a[i-1]).\n\nSo for example, prefix_sum[0] is 0, prefix_sum[1] is a[0], prefix_sum[2] is a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nSo to compute this, we can compute a prefix sum array.\n\nLet me think about that. Let's say we have a list prefix_sums where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], ..., prefix_sums[n] = sum(a[0..n-1]).\n\nYes. So for the i-th file (0-based), the sum of the previous files is prefix_sums[i], and when processing x bytes in this file, the total_bytes_so_far is prefix_sums[i] + x.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nCompute prefix_sums as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nThen, for each file i (0-based), which corresponds to prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i].\n\nSo during iteration over the files, for each file index i (from 0 to n-1), the sum of previous files is prefix_sums[i], and for each x in 1..a[i], total_bytes is prefix_sums[i] + x.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nSo n=1, a = [6]. total_size = 6.\n\nprefix_sums = [0, 6].\n\nFor i=0 (the only file), processing x from 1 to 6.\n\nFor each x, current_percent is (100 * x) // 6.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 0 + x = x. total_percent is (100 * x) // 6.\n\nThus, current_percent equals total_percent for all x. Therefore, all the values generated here will be added. But since the initial 0 is already in the set, and during processing, each x will generate the same value for both bars. So the result set will have 0, and all the values generated during the steps. However, for x=1, current_percent is 16 (100*1/6=16.666..., floor 16). total_percent is same. So 16 is added. Similarly for others. Then, when x=6, current_percent is 100, total_percent is 100. So 100 is added. So the result set would be {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100}, which matches the first sample output.\n\nYes. So this approach works for the first sample.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is 2\\n100 500. So n=2, a = [100, 500]. total_size is 600.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100, 600].\n\nFirst file is 100 bytes. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 100 = x // 1.\n\nWhich is x. So for x=1, current_percent is 1. The total_bytes_so_far is 0 + x = x. total_percent is (100 * x) // 600. So for x=1, it's 0. So current_percent (1) != total_percent (0). So nothing is added. For x=6, 100*6//600 is 1. So current_percent is 6, total is 1. Not equal. For x=600? No, because the first file is 100 bytes. So when x is 100, total_bytes_so_far is 100. total_percent is (100 * 100)/600 = 16.666... floored to 16. current_percent is 100*100 /100 = 100. So 100 vs 16, not equal.\n\nSo during processing the first file, none of the steps will have current and total percent equal except maybe 0 (but initial 0 is already added). Then, when processing the second file (500 bytes). For each x from 1 to 500:\n\nsum of previous files is 100. total_bytes_so_far is 100 + x.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 500.\n\ntotal_percent is (100*(100 + x)) // 600.\n\nWe need to find when these two are equal.\n\nLet me take the sample output for this case: the output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. So during processing, those numbers are found.\n\nBut how?\n\nAt the end of the second file, when x=500, total_bytes_so_far is 600. total_percent is 100. current_percent is (100 * 500)/500 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nBut during processing the second file, perhaps there are steps where the two percentages are equal. For example, when the total is 599 bytes. Let's see:\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 + x. Let's say x is 499. Then total is 599. total_percent is (100 * 599)/600 = 99.833... floored to 99. current_percent is (100 * 499)/500 = 99.8 floored to 99. So 99 equals 99. So 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly, when x is 500, both are 100.\n\nBut during the second file, the total percent is (100*(100 + x))/600. Let's find for which x this equals (100x)/500.\n\nSet (100*(100 + x))/600 = (100x)/500 → (100 + x)/6 = (x)/5 → 5(100 +x) = 6x → 500 +5x =6x → x=500. Which is the last byte. So only at x=500. But then why in the sample output there are 95,96, etc.?\n\nAh, perhaps during the second file, there are other points where the two percentages are equal. Maybe when the current percent is 99 and the total percent is 99. Like in the example above.\n\nSo the code would capture that. So the code approach seems correct.\n\nNow, considering that for each byte, we compute both percentages and check if they are equal. So the code would handle that.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps:\n\nRead n from input. Then read the list of a_i. Then compute the prefix_sums. Then iterate through each file, and for each byte in the file, compute current_percent and total_percent.\n\nBut how to handle the input?\n\nThe input is given as per the examples. For example, the first sample input is given as:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', ...]\n\nWait, the user provided some examples. But in the actual problem, the input is read from stdin. So in the code, we need to read from stdin. The input format is:\n\nFirst line: n.\n\nSecond line: n integers, a_1 ... a_n.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n via input(). Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute total_size = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums as [0]*(n+1). Then for i in 1..n, prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1].\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}.\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   prev_sum = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes = prev_sum + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to result.\n\nOnce done, collect all elements in the result, sort them, and print them separated by newlines.\n\nBut wait, the sample output for the first input is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is sorted. So the code should collect all the elements in the set, sort them, and print each on a separate line.\n\nNow, what about the case when the same value is generated multiple times? Since it's a set, duplicates are handled automatically.\n\nNow, testing for the first sample input, which has n=1 and a=[6], the code would generate the correct set.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is n=2, a=[100,500]. The output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. How does that happen?\n\nLet me think. For example, when x is 595 in the total_bytes_so_far. Let's see:\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 100 + x (where x is in the second file). Wait, no, for the second file, the previous sum is 100. So total_bytes_so_far is 100 + x, where x ranges from 1 to 500.\n\nSo for example, when x is 595? Wait no, x can't be more than 500. So for the second file, x ranges from 1 to 500. So total_bytes_so_far ranges from 101 to 600.\n\nLet me think of when the total_percent is 95. Let's compute:\n\ntotal_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / 600) = 95.\n\nSo 100 * total_bytes_so_far / 600 >= 95, and < 96.\n\nMultiply all by 600: 100 * total_bytes_so_far >= 95 * 600 → total_bytes_so_far >= 95 * 6 = 570.\n\nAnd 100 * total_bytes_so_far < 96 * 600 → total_bytes_so_far < 96 * 6 = 576.\n\nSo total_bytes_so_far is in [570, 575], since it's integer.\n\nSo total_bytes_so_far can be 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575.\n\nBut total_bytes_so_far is 100 + x, where x is between 1 and 500. So 100 + x ranges from 101 to 600.\n\nSo 100 + x must be between 570 and 575. So x is between 470 and 475.\n\nSo x ranges from 470 to 475 (inclusive). For each of these x values:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 500.\n\nLet me calculate for x=470:\n\n(100 * 470) / 500 = 94. So floor is 94. But total_percent is 95. So not equal.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So how does 95 get into the result?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate.\n\nLet me think again. For the second sample input, the output includes 95. So there must be a moment when both percentages are 95.\n\nSo for total_bytes_so_far = T, and current_percent = (100 * x) // 500, where T = 100 + x, and x is between 1 and 500.\n\nWe want:\n\ncurrent_percent = floor(100 * x / 500) = floor( (x/5) )\n\ntotal_percent = floor(100*T / 600) = floor( (T * 5)/30 ) ?\n\nWait 100*T / 600 = T/6. So floor(T/6).\n\nSo for current_percent to be equal to total_percent:\n\nfloor(x/5) = floor(T / 6), where T = 100 + x.\n\nSo substituting T:\n\nfloor(x/5) = floor( (100 + x)/6 )\n\nWe need to find x in [1, 500] where this holds.\n\nLet me take x=470:\n\nx/5 = 94 → floor is 94.\n\nT = 100 + 470 = 570 → T/6 = 95 → floor is 95. So 94 != 95. Not equal.\n\nWhat about x=475:\n\nx/5 = 95 → floor 95.\n\nT = 100 + 475 = 575 → 575/6 = 95.833... → floor 95. So 95 equals 95. So yes! So this is a valid case. So when x is 475, current_percent is 95, total_percent is 95. So 95 is added.\n\nSo for x=475, it's valid.\n\nSimilarly, for x=476:\n\nx/5 = 476 /5 = 95.2 → floor 95.\n\nT = 576 → 576/6 = 96 → floor 96. So 95 != 96. Not valid.\n\nSo how do we get 95 in the output? Because when x=475, the current_percent is 95, and total_percent is 95.\n\nSo the code would capture this. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code approach is correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All files are 1 byte. For example, n=2, a=[1,1]. total_size=2. The initial 0 is present. Then, for the first byte (x=1 in first file):\n\ncurrent_percent is 100*1//1 = 100. total_percent is 100*1//2 = 50. Not equal. Then, for the second file, x=1. current_percent is 100*1//1 = 100. total_bytes is 1+1=2. total_percent is 100. So 100 is added. So the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: n=1, a=[1]. Then, during the first byte, current_percent is 100, total_percent is 100. So the result is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: n=1, a=[2]. So total_size is 2.\n\nFor x=1: current is 50, total is 50. So added. So the result is {0,50,100}.\n\nSo the code would correctly capture that.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nThen process each file and each byte.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute total_size = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    prev_sum = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = prev_sum + x\n\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list.\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nThen, print each element on a separate line.\n\nBut wait, the sample outputs have the numbers separated by newlines. For example, the first sample output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nSo in code, for the sorted_result list, we can print each element with a newline.\n\nSo:\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nBut how to handle the case when the same number is generated multiple times? Since it's a set, duplicates are handled.\n\nTesting this code with the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nThe code would generate the set {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100}.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nWhich would generate the output 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: during the processing of the second file, for x in 1..500:\n\nWe need to find all x where current_percent equals total_percent.\n\nBut how many such x's are there?\n\nFor example, when x=475, as discussed, current_percent is 95, total_percent is 95.\n\nSimilarly, for other values.\n\nBut in the sample output, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 are present.\n\nSo the code would capture those.\n\nNow, let's think about the code's performance. For n=100 and a_i=1000, the total number of bytes is 100*1000=10^5. For each byte, we perform O(1) operations. So the code would run in O(1e5) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the input, sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but using split() handles that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n, then the list a.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize the set.\n\nLoop through each file and each byte.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_size = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\nresult = {0}\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    prev_sum = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        total_bytes = prev_sum + x\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but what about the case when the total_size is zero? But according to the problem statement, each a_i is at least 1, so total_size is at least n >=1. So division by zero is not possible.\n\nTesting this code with the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=1, a=[6]\n\ntotal_size=6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 6].\n\nLoop for i=0:\n\ncurrent_file_size = 6.\n\nprev_sum = prefix_sums[0] = 0.\n\nx runs from 1 to 6.\n\nFor each x:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100*x)//6.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0 + x = x.\n\ntotal_percent is (100*x)//6.\n\nSo current_percent == total_percent. So all these values are added. So the result set will have 0, and all the values of (100*x)//6 for x in 1..6.\n\nFor x=1: 16, x=2: 33, x=3: 50, x=4: 66, x=5: 83, x=6: 100. So the set is {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100}.\n\nWhich matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the third example:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998\n\nOutput:\n\n0\n\n50\n\n99\n\n100\n\nWait, the sample output for that input is ['0\\n50\\n99\\n100'].\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nThe total_size is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nSo during the copying:\n\nLet me think about the moment when both bars are 50%.\n\nFor total_percent to be 50, total_bytes must be 50% of 2002 → 1001 bytes. So total_bytes_so_far is 1001.\n\nWhich would happen during the first file (size 1000). So when x is 1001 - 0 (since previous sum is 0) → x=1001. But the first file is 1000 bytes. So x can't be 1001. So that's impossible. So how is 50% achieved?\n\nWait, maybe during the fourth file.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the fourth file, when the total_bytes_so_far is 1001.\n\nLet me think: the prefix_sums for the files:\n\nprefix_sums[0] = 0\n\nprefix_sums[1] = 1000\n\nprefix_sums[2] = 1000 + 2 = 1002\n\nprefix_sums[3] = 1002 + 2 = 1004\n\nprefix_sums[4] = 1004 + 998 = 2002.\n\nSo during the fourth file (i=3, 0-based), prev_sum is prefix_sums[3] = 1004. The file size is 998. So x ranges from 1 to 998. So total_bytes_so_far is 1004 + x.\n\nWe need 1004 + x = 1001 → x = -3. Impossible. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, so how is 50% achieved?\n\nMaybe during the second or third file.\n\nLet me think: total_bytes_so_far = 1001.\n\nWhich is possible when during the second file (file size 2). prev_sum is 1000 (prefix_sums[1] = 1000). So during the second file, x ranges from 1 to 2. So total_bytes_so_far is 1000 + x. So for x=1, total is 1001. Which is 1001 bytes. So total_percent is (100 * 1001) // 2002 = 50.0... (exactly 50.0, since 1001 * 100 / 2002 = (1001 * 100) / (2 * 1001) ) = 50. So floor is 50.\n\nCurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 2 → x is 1. 100 *1 /2 = 50. So current_percent is 50. So both are 50. So 50 is added.\n\nSo during the second file's first byte, this happens. So the code would add 50 to the set. Hence, 50 is in the output.\n\nYes, that's why the third sample output includes 50.\n\nSo the code would capture that.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when n=1, a=[1]. The code adds 0, and during the processing of x=1, current_percent is 100, total_percent is 100. So the output is 0, 100.\n\nAnother case: when a file is 0 bytes? No, the problem says a_i >= 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. Let me write it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer percentages between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that are simultaneously displayed on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file being copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently calculate the total bytes copied up to each file.\n3. **Progress Bar Simulation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute both the current file's progress and the overall progress. Check if these values are equal and record them.\n4. **Result Collection**: Collect all valid percentages in a set to avoid duplicates, then sort and print them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_size = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\nresult = {0}\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    prev_sum = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        total_bytes = prev_sum + x\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files followed by their sizes. These are read and stored in a list.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: This helps in quickly determining the cumulative size of files processed up to any given point, which is essential for calculating the overall progress percentage.\n3. **Progress Bar Simulation**: For each byte copied in each file, we compute the current progress percentage for the file and the overall progress percentage. If these values match, they are added to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n4. **Result Collection**: The set of valid percentages is sorted and printed, ensuring the output is in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the copying process and checks for matching progress percentages, ensuring correctness and optimal performance given the constraints.",
