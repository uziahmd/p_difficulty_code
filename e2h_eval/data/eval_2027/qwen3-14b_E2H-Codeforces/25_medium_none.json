При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an overlap. And if possible, output one such s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. So, the error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively, and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message and the start of the second message have some common substring. The length of this overlap has to be positive and less than the length of s. Also, the case where the entire message is overlapped (like s + s becomes s) is not considered an error. Similarly, if there's no overlap (just concatenation), that's not considered an error either.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to checking if there exists some s such that t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s with some positive overlap. And then outputting s if possible.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's denote the original string as t. We need to find a string s such that when two copies of s are merged with an overlap, we get t.\n\nLet me think about the conditions for this. Suppose the original two messages are s and s. When they are merged with an overlap of length k, where 0 < k < len(s). The merged string would be s[0...len(s)-k-1] + s. Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, if s is \"abc\" and the overlap is 1 character, then the merged string would be \"ab\" + \"abc\" = \"ababc\"? Wait, no. Because the first s ends with the overlapping part, and the second starts with that same part. So, for example, if the first s is \"abrakadabra\" and the second is also \"abrakadabra\", and they overlap by 1 character, then the merged string would be \"abrakadabra\" (the first) plus \"brakadabra\" (the second without the overlapping 'a')? Or wait, the first s's last k characters are the same as the second's first k characters. So the merged string would be s concatenated with s[k:]?\n\nYes. So the merged string is s + s[k:], where k is the length of the overlap. But since the two s's are merged by overlapping k characters, the total length of the merged string is len(s) + len(s) - k = 2*len(s) -k. \n\nBut in our problem, the merged string is t. So, for some k (1 ≤ k < len(s)), we have t = s + s[k:]. Also, since the original two messages were s and s, the merged string t must be of length 2*len(s) -k. But since t is given, we need to find s and k such that this holds.\n\nBut how do we find s and k?\n\nLet me think about possible values of k. Let's suppose that the length of t is L. Then, for some possible s, the length of s must satisfy:\n\nL = 2 * len(s) - k. Since k is between 1 and len(s) - 1, substituting k's min and max:\n\nFor k=1, L = 2m -1 → m = (L+1)/2. For k = m-1, L = 2m - (m-1) = m +1 → m = L-1.\n\nSo m (the length of s) must be between (L - (m-1)) ... wait, perhaps I should think of m as varying. Let me rephrase:\n\nSince k is between 1 and m-1, then L = 2m -k → k = 2m - L. Since k must be ≥1 and ≤ m-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2m - L ≤ m-1.\n\nLet me rearrange these inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: 2m - L ≥ 1 → 2m ≥ L + 1 → m ≥ (L +1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2m - L ≤ m -1 → 2m - L ≤ m -1 → m ≤ L -1.\n\nSo m must be between ceil((L+1)/2) and L-1, inclusive.\n\nWait, but m is the length of s, which must be such that when you take two copies of s and overlap them by k characters, you get t. So for each possible m (possible length of s), we can check whether there exists a k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m-1, and that t is equal to s + s[k:].\n\nBut how do we find m?\n\nThe possible values of m are from ceil( (L+1)/2 ) to L-1. Because for m to be valid, m must be at least (L+1)/2, since m ≥ (L+1)/2. Also, m must be ≤ L-1 because from the second inequality m ≤ L-1. \n\nWait, for example, if the length of t is L. Let's say m is the length of s. Then, the length of t is 2m -k. Since k is between 1 and m-1, the length of t can be between 2m - (m-1) = m +1 and 2m -1. So:\n\nm+1 ≤ L ≤ 2m -1.\n\nWhich implies that m ≤ L-1 and m ≥ L - (2m -1) ? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think of possible m's for a given L.\n\nFor example, if L is 5, then possible m's are such that:\n\nm must satisfy that 2m -k =5, where 1 ≤k ≤m-1.\n\nSo for each m, possible k is 2m -5. And this k must be between 1 and m-1.\n\nSo 1 ≤ 2m -5 ≤ m-1.\n\nSolving 2m -5 ≥1 → 2m ≥6 → m≥3.\n\nAnd 2m-5 ≤m-1 → m ≤4.\n\nSo for L=5, m can be 3 or 4.\n\nIf m=3, then k=2*3-5=1. Which is between 1 and 2 (since m-1=2). So valid.\n\nIf m=4, then k=2*4-5=3. Which must be ≤ m-1=3. So yes, valid.\n\nSo for each possible m in the range [ceil((L+1)/2), L-1], we can check if there exists a k such that 2m -k = L, and then check if the string t can be split into s and s[k:].\n\nBut how to find s? Well, for a given m, the length of s is m. Then, the merged string t is s + s[k:], where k=2m - L. So, for that m, k is fixed. Because for a given m, L is fixed, so k = 2m - L.\n\nSo for each possible m (from the possible range), we can compute k, and check if the first m characters of t (which would be s) and the rest of the string (t[m:]) equals s[k:].\n\nWait, let me see. Because t is s concatenated with s[k:]. So the first m characters of t is s. Then the rest of the string (t[m:]) should be s[k:].\n\nSo for a given m, the candidate s is t[0:m]. Then, check if the rest of the string (t[m:]) equals s[k:], where k = 2m - L. Also, k must be between 1 and m-1. \n\nBut how do we compute k? Let's see:\n\nGiven that L = len(t), m is the length of s. Then:\n\nk = 2m - L.\n\nBut since L = len(t) = 2m -k, solving for k gives k = 2m - L.\n\nSo for each possible m in the range [ceil((L+1)/2), L-1], we can calculate k and check if it's between 1 and m-1. If yes, then check whether t[m:] equals s[k:] where s is t[0:m].\n\nBut wait, what if m is such that 2m - L is not between 1 and m-1? Then that m is invalid. But since we generated m based on the constraints, perhaps that's already handled.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor the input string t:\n\n1. Compute L = len(t).\n\n2. Iterate over all possible m values from (L+1)//2 up to L-1. Because m must be at least ceil((L+1)/2) and at most L-1.\n\n   For example, if L is even, say 6, then (L+1)/2 is 3.5, so ceil is 4. So m ranges from 4 to 5.\n\n   For each m in this range:\n\n   a. Compute k = 2m - L.\n\n   b. Check if 1 ≤ k ≤ m-1. If not, skip this m.\n\n   c. Take s_candidate as t[0:m].\n\n   d. Check if t[m:] equals s_candidate[k:]. If yes, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\n3. If none of the m values work, output NO.\n\nBut why is that correct?\n\nBecause for each possible m, we're checking if the first m characters can be the s, and the rest of the string is s[k:]. Also, since k is computed as 2m - L, which comes from the equation len(t) = 2m -k.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the first example. Let's see:\n\nThe input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (probably length 19? Let me count: abrakadabra is 11 letters. Then the input is abrakadabraabrakadabra? Or maybe the example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters? Well, the output is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 letters. Let's see for that case:\n\nL = len(t) = 21.\n\nPossible m is from (21+1)/2 = 11 up to 20. So m ranges from 11 to 20.\n\nFor m=11:\n\nk = 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Which is between 1 and 10 (since m-1=10). So valid.\n\nCheck if t[m:] equals s_candidate[k:] where s_candidate is t[0:11] = 'abrakadabra'.\n\nt[m:] is t[11:] which is 'abrakadabra' (since the original input is 'abrakadabraabrakadabra'? Or maybe the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. Let me think: 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. Then, if the input is 'abrakadabraabrakadabra', that would be 11 + 11 = 22 letters. But the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. So perhaps the input is the first 11 letters plus the next 10 letters? So the first m=11 letters is s_candidate. Then t[m:] is the rest, which is 10 letters. And s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] which is 'brakadabra' (length 10). So if the t[m:] is equal to that, then yes. Which would be the case if the original input was the merged string. So in this case, the code would find that and return YES.\n\nAnother example is 'acacacaca' which outputs 'acaca'. Let's see. The input length is 9. So L=9. Possible m ranges from (9+1)/2 = 5 (ceil(5) is 5) up to 8. So m can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor m=5: k=2*5 -9 = 1. So check if t[5:] equals s_candidate[1:]. s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'acaca'. t[5:] is 'cacaca'? Wait, original input is 'acacacaca' (9 letters). Let's see:\n\nt[5:] is 'caca' (positions 5 to 8: indexes 5 is 'c', 6 'a', 7 'c', 8 'a').\n\ns_candidate is 'acaca' (positions 0-4). s_candidate[1:] is 'caca' (positions 1-4). So yes, t[5:] is equal to that. So this is valid. Thus, the answer is YES and s_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nSo the code would find this and return it.\n\nAnother example is 'abcabc' which outputs NO. Let's see. L=6. Possible m ranges from (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4, up to 5. So m can be 4,5.\n\nFor m=4: k = 2*4 -6 = 2. Check if 1<=2 <=3 (yes). s_candidate is first 4 letters: 'abca'. Check if t[4:] is 'bc' (since t is 'abcabc', t[4:] is 'bc'). s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[2:] which is 'ca'. So 'bc' vs 'ca' → no match. So invalid.\n\nFor m=5: k=2*5 -6=4. Check 1<=4 <=4 (since m-1 is 4). So yes. s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'abcab'. Check t[5:] is 'c'. s_candidate[4:] is 'b'. So 'c' vs 'b' → no. So no match. Hence, output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example is 'abababab' (output is YES and 'ababab'). Let's check. The input is 'abababab' which is 8 letters. L=8. m ranges from (8+1)/2=4.5 → 5 up to 7.\n\nCheck m=5: k=2*5 -8 = 2. Check 1<=2 <=4. Yes. s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'ababa'. Check t[5:] is 'bab' (positions 5-7: 'bab'). s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[2:] → 'aba' → 'aba' vs 'bab'? No.\n\nm=6: k=2*6-8=4. Check 1<=4 <=5. Yes. s_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'. Check t[6:] is 'ab'. s_candidate[4:] is 'ab' (since s_candidate is 'ababab', indexes 4 and 5 are 'ab'). So t[6:] is 'ab' which matches. So this is valid. Hence, the answer is YES and 'ababab'.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nNow, the code needs to iterate over all possible m in the range from (L+1)//2 to L-1, inclusive. For each m, compute k=2m-L, check if k is between 1 and m-1. Then check if t[m:] equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string t.\n\nCompute L = len(t).\n\nIf L is 1, then it's impossible (since two messages would have to be merged with overlap, but len(s) must be at least 2, since k is positive and less than len(s). Wait, for example, len(s) must be at least 2, because k is at least 1 and less than len(s). So len(s) must be at least 2. So for L=1, the answer is NO.\n\nBut for general cases, proceed.\n\nThen, loop m from (L+1)//2 to L-1, inclusive.\n\nFor each m:\n\nk = 2*m - L\n\nif 1 <= k <= m-1:\n\n   s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n   if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n       return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf after checking all m's, none found, return NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where multiple m's are possible? For example, in the sample input 'acacacaca', m=5 works, but also m=7?\n\nLet me check for that input. The input is 'acacacaca' (length 9). Let's see for m=7:\n\nk=2*7 -9 = 5. Check if 1<=5 <=6 (yes). s_candidate is first 7 letters: 'acacaca'. Then t[m:] is t[7:] which is 'ca'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[5:] → 'aca'[5:]? Wait, s_candidate is 7 letters. indexes 0-6. k=5. s_candidate[5:] is 'ca' (positions 5 and 6: 'c' and 'a'). t[m:] is 'ca' (positions 7 and 8). So yes. So this is also a valid solution. So the code would return the first valid m it finds. Since in the code, we check m in order from (L+1)//2 upwards. For L=9, m starts from 5. So m=5 is checked first, and returns 'acaca', which is correct. But the note says that another possible answer is 'acacaca' (for m=7). So the code can return any valid s, so the first found is acceptable.\n\nSo the code will return the first valid s_candidate found.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t from input.\n\nCompute L = len(t).\n\nIf L < 2: output NO (since len(s) must be at least 2, but for example, if L is 2, then m must be between (2+1)/2=1.5 → 2, up to L-1=1. Which is impossible. So no possible m. Hence, output NO.)\n\nElse:\n\nLoop m from (L+1)//2 to L-1:\n\n   for each m in that range:\n\n      k = 2*m - L\n\n      if k is between 1 and m-1:\n\n          s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n          if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n              print YES and s_candidate.\n\n              exit.\n\nIf none found, print NO.\n\nBut how to handle the m range?\n\nIn Python, for m in range(start, end+1):\n\nstart is (L+1)//2.\n\nend is L-1.\n\nFor example, if L=9, start is (9+1)//2 = 5, end is 8.\n\nSo for m in 5,6,7,8.\n\nSo code:\n\nfor m in range( (L+1)//2, L ):\n\n   ... ?\n\nWait, in Python, range is exclusive of the upper bound. So to include L-1, the code should be:\n\nfor m in range( (L+1)//2, L ):\n\nWait, no. For example, if L is 9, L-1 is 8. So the range should be from (L+1)//2 (which is 5) to L (which is 9), but since the upper bound is exclusive, the code would generate 5,6,7,8. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nfor m in range( (L + 1) // 2, L ):\n\n   compute k = 2*m - L\n\n   if 1 <= k <= m-1:\n\n       check the rest.\n\nBut wait, for example, if m is 5, L is 9, then k=1. Which is okay.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: t is 'aa'. Possible m?\n\nL=2. m ranges from (2+1)//2 = 1.5 → 2 (since integer division in Python (2+1)//2 is 1.5 floored to 1? Wait, no, (L +1)//2 for L=2 is (2+1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 (in Python 3, integer division is floor division). So the range is from 1 to L-1 = 1. So the loop is for m in range(1, 2) → which is m=1. But m must be at least 2? Because for m=1, len(s) is 1. Then k must be 1 <= k <= 0 (since m-1 is 0). Which is impossible. So the code would not process this m. Hence, output is NO.\n\nWhich is correct, because the case where two 'a's are merged with overlap of 1 (which would require that the first 'a' overlaps with the second 'a' by 1 character. But the merged string would be 'a' (since the first a and the second a are merged with 1 character overlap. But the merged string would be 'a' (because the first a's length is 1, and the overlap is 1, so the merged string is a + a[1:] → a + empty string → a. So the input would be 'a', but the original input is 'aa'. So this case is not possible. Hence, for input 'aa', the answer is NO.\n\nAnother case: t is 'aaaaa' (length 5). Let's see possible m's. L=5. (5+1)//2 = 3. So m ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nk=2*3 -5=1. Check 1<=1 <=2 (yes). s_candidate is first 3 letters 'aaa'. Check t[m:] is 'aa' (positions 3 and 4). s_candidate[k:] is 'aa' (positions 1 and 2). So yes. So output YES and 'aaa'.\n\nAnother case: t is 'abababab' (length 8). As discussed earlier, m=6 is valid. So the code would find it.\n\nAnother case: t is 'abcd' (length 4). The code checks m from (4+1)//2=2.5 → 2 (since integer division 5//2 is 2). So m ranges from 2 to 3.\n\nFor m=2:\n\nk=2*2 -4 =0. Which is not >=1. So invalid.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nk=2*3 -4=2. Check if 1<=2 <=2 (since m-1=2). Yes. s_candidate is first 3 letters 'abc'. Check t[3:] is 'd'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[2:] → 'c'. So 'd' != 'c' → invalid. So output is NO. Which is correct, as per the problem statement.\n\nAnother example: 'ababab' (length 6). Let's see.\n\nPossible m ranges from (6+1)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 floored to 3? Wait, (6+1)//2 is 7//2 = 3 in Python. So m ranges from 3 to 5 (since L-1 is 5).\n\nFor m=3:\n\nk=2*3 -6 =0 → invalid.\n\nm=4:\n\nk= 8-6=2. Check 1<=2 <=3. Yes. s_candidate is first 4 letters 'abab'. t[m:] is 'ab'. s_candidate[k:] is 'ab' (positions 2 and 3). So yes. So output YES and 'abab'.\n\nSo the code would output YES and 'abab'.\n\nBut what if the original s was 'abab'? Then two copies would be merged with overlap of 2. So the merged string would be 'abab' + 'ab' → 'ababab' which is the input. So yes.\n\nSo code works here.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead t from input.\n\nL = len(t)\n\nif L < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for m in range( (L + 1) // 2, L ):\n\n        k = 2 * m - L\n\n        if 1 <= k <= m -1:\n\n            s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n            if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n                print(s_candidate)\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, when L is 5, the upper bound is L, which is 5. So range( (L+1)//2, L ) is from 3 to 5, but not including 5. So m will be 3,4. Which is correct.\n\nBut let me test for L=5, m ranges from 3 to 4 inclusive.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → output 'YES\\nacaca'\n\nL=9. (9+1)//2 = 5. So m ranges from 5 to 8 (since L is 9, the upper bound is 9, so range(5,9) → 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor m=5: k= 2*5 -9=1. Check 1<=1<=4 → yes. s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'acaca'. t[m:] is t[5:] → 'cacaca'? Wait original input is 'acacacaca' → indexes 0-8.\n\nt[5:] is from index 5 to 8: 'caca'.\n\ns_candidate is 'acaca' (length 5). s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'caca' → which matches t[m:] → 'caca'. So yes. So output is YES and 'acaca'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abcabc' → output NO. Which we've checked.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' (output 'ababab').\n\nLet me see for L=8, m ranges from (8+1)//2=4.5 → 4 (since integer division 9//2=4). So m ranges from 4 to 7 (since upper bound is 8, range(4,8) → 4,5,6,7.\n\nFor m=6:\n\nk=2*6 -8 = 4. Check 1<=4 <=5 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'.\n\nt[m:] is t[6:] → 'ab'.\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[4:] → 'ab' → yes. So returns YES.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother sample input is 'tatbt' → output NO.\n\nLet's check. len(t) is 5. m ranges from (5+1)//2=3 to 4.\n\nFor m=3: k= 2*3 -5 =1. Check 1<=1 <=2. yes.\n\ns_candidate is 'tat'. t[m:] is t[3:] → 'bt'.\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'at'. 'bt' vs 'at' → no.\n\nFor m=4: k=2*4 -5=3. Check 1<=3 <=3 (yes). s_candidate is 'tatb'. t[m:] is t[4:] → 't'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[3:] → 'b'. 't' vs 'b' → no. So no solution. Hence output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about cases where the same string can be formed with multiple m's? For example, 'abababab' can be formed with m=6 (as above) or m=4?\n\nLet me check for m=4. For L=8, m=4:\n\nk= 2*4 -8 = 0 → invalid. So no.\n\nAnother example: 'aaaaa' (length 5). For m=3, k=1. s_candidate is 'aaa', t[m:] is 'aa', which equals s_candidate[1:] → 'aa' → yes. So output is YES.\n\nAnother case: t is 'aaaaa' (length 5). What if m=4?\n\nk= 2*4 -5 = 3. Check if 1<=3 <=3 (since m-1 is 3). yes. s_candidate is 'aaaa'. t[m:] is t[4:] → 'a'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[3:] → 'a'. So yes. So for m=4, the code would also find a solution. So the code would return the first m in the loop. Since m starts from 3, which is valid, the code returns m=3's s_candidate.\n\nSo the code returns the first possible m, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input as t = input().strip()\n\nThen process.\n\nNow, code:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nL = len(t)\n\nif L < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for m in range( (L + 1) // 2, L ):\n\n        k = 2 * m - L\n\n        if 1 <= k <= m -1:\n\n            s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n            if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n                print(s_candidate)\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about cases where m is such that 2m - L is not integer? Well, since m and L are integers, 2m - L is always integer.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len is 21.\n\nm ranges from (21+1)//2 = 11 to 20.\n\nFor m=11, k=2*11 -21 = 1. Check 1<=1 <=10 → yes. s_candidate is first 11 letters, which is 'abrakadabra'. t[m:] is the rest, which is 'abrakadabra' (assuming the input is 'abrakadabraabrakadabra'?), but the sample output says that the correct s is 'abrakadabra', which is 11 letters. So the code would find that.\n\nAnother sample input is 'acacacaca' → output 'acaca'.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abcabc' → output 'NO'.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' → output 'ababab'.\n\nAnother sample input is 'tatbt' → output 'NO'.\n\nSo the code should pass the samples.\n\nNow, what about when the input is 'aabbaa'?\n\nLet me think. Let's say t is 'aabbaa' (length 6). Possible m ranges from (6+1)//2 = 3.5 → 3. So m ranges from 3 to 5.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nk=2*3 -6=0 → invalid.\n\nm=4:\n\nk= 8-6=2. Check 1<=2 <=3 → yes. s_candidate is first 4 letters: 'aabb'. t[m:] is 'aa'. s_candidate[k:] is 'bb' → 'aa' vs 'bb' → no.\n\nm=5:\n\nk= 2*5 -6=4. Check 1<=4 <=4 → yes. s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'aabba'. t[m:] is 'a'. s_candidate[4:] is 'a' → yes. So output is YES and 'aabba'.\n\nSo the code would output YES and 'aabba'.\n\nSo the merged string would be s + s[4:] → 'aabba' + 'a' → 'aabbaa', which is correct.\n\nThus, the code works here.\n\nAnother case: t is 'aaabaaa' → len 7. Possible m ranges from (7+1)//2=4 to 6.\n\nFor m=4: k= 8-7=1. Check 1<=1 <=3 → yes. s_candidate is 'aaab'. t[m:] is 'aaa'. s_candidate[1:] is 'aab' → 'aaa' vs 'aab' → no.\n\nm=5: k= 10-7=3. Check 1<=3 <=4 → yes. s_candidate is 'aaaba'. t[m:] is 'aa'. s_candidate[3:] is 'ba' → no.\n\nm=6: k= 12-7=5. Check 1<=5 <=5 → yes. s_candidate is 'aaabaa' (first 6 letters). t[m:] is 'a'. s_candidate[5:] is 'a' → yes. So output YES and 'aaabaa'.\n\nThus, the code would return YES.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation. Now, considering that the code may have to handle cases where the m is such that the k is valid. Also, the code is efficient enough for the constraints (max length 100, so m ranges up to 99, which is manageable).\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an overlap. If possible, we also need to find one such message `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: The problem specifies that two identical messages `s` are merged with an overlap of length `k`, where `1 ≤ k < len(s)`. The resulting string `t` must be formed by this overlap.\n2. **Constraints on Length**: For a valid overlap, the length of the original message `s` (denoted as `m`) must satisfy specific constraints based on the length of `t` (denoted as `L`). Specifically, `m` must be in the range from `(L + 1) // 2` to `L - 1`.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each possible length `m` of `s`, compute the overlap length `k` and check if the substring of `t` from index `m` onwards matches the substring of `s` starting from index `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nL = len(t)\nif L < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for m in range((L + 1) // 2, L):\n        k = 2 * m - L\n        if 1 <= k <= m - 1:\n            s_candidate = t[:m]\n            if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `L` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, it's immediately determined that no valid message `s` can exist.\n3. **Iterate Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `m` of the message `s`, starting from `(L + 1) // 2` to `L - 1`, the code checks if the overlap length `k` is valid.\n4. **Overlap Check**: For each valid `m`, the candidate message `s` is checked against the substring of `t` starting from index `m` to see if it matches the expected part after the overlap.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid message `s` is found, it is printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths for the message `s` and ensures that the overlap conditions are met, providing a solution that adheres to the problem constraints.",
