    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But you can't swap 0 and 2 directly. So, what's the approach here?\n\nHmm, the key is to figure out the order of the characters. Since we can swap 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s, but not 0s and 2s directly. Wait, but maybe through some steps? Like, if there's a 0 and a 2 with some 1s in between, can they be swapped? Let me think. For example, suppose I have \"012\". I can swap the 0 and 1 first to get \"102\", then swap the 1 and 2 to get \"120\". But that doesn't help me get the 0 and 2 next to each other. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move 0s and 2s past each other via 1s. But no, because the swaps are only allowed between 0-1 or 1-2. So, 0s and 2s can't be swapped directly. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Because if you have a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. But maybe if there's a 1 in between, you can move the 0 past the 1 and then the 2 past the 1? Wait, but that would require moving the 0 to the right of the 1, then the 2 to the left of the 1. But that would result in the 0 being before the 2 again. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nLet me take an example: \"02\". Can't swap. So their order is fixed. But if there's a 1 between them, like \"012\". Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2. We can swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. Or swap 0 and 1 again? No. Then maybe swap the 1 and 2? So, after swapping 1 and 2, we get 1 2 0. But then the 0 is at the end. But the original 0 and 2 were in positions 0 and 2. Now, the 0 is after the 2. So in this case, the 0 can be moved past the 2 via the 1. Wait, but how? Because the 0 can move to the right of the 1 (by swapping with 1), then the 2 can move to the left of the 1 (by swapping with 1). So in this case, the 0 can end up after the 2. So the relative order of 0 and 2 can be changed if there's a 1 in between. So that suggests that the 0s and 2s can be reordered as long as there's a way to move them through 1s. So perhaps the 1s can act as intermediaries. \n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think of another example. Suppose I have a string like \"02\". Since there's no 1s, I can't swap them. So the order is fixed. But if there's a 1 in between, like \"012\", then I can arrange them as \"021\" (but how?), or maybe not. Wait, the original is 0,1,2. Let me think of possible swaps:\n\nFirst, swap 1 and 2 to get 0,2,1. But wait, that's allowed because they are adjacent. So the original \"012\" can become \"021\" by swapping 1 and 2. Then, can I swap the 0 and 2? No, since they are not adjacent. So the 0 and 2 are in positions 0 and 1. But they are adjacent. Wait, but the swap between 0 and 2 is not allowed. So even though they are adjacent, you can't swap them. So the string \"021\" can't be further modified. So the original \"012\" can be transformed into \"021\" (which has 0 followed by 2). But in that case, the 0 is before the 2. However, if you had \"210\", can you turn it into \"012\"? Let's see. The initial string is 2,1,0. You can swap 1 and 0 (since they are adjacent) to get 2,0,1. Then swap 2 and 0? No. So you can't. So the 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So the order of 0 and 2 depends on their positions relative to 1s. But in this case, the original 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So perhaps the conclusion is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s, but 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. But if there's a 0 followed by 1 followed by 2, you can move the 0 to the right of the 1 (so 1,0,2) and then move the 2 to the left of the 0 (but how? Because 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So maybe you can't. Wait, but the 2 can be moved left through the 0? No, because you can't swap 0 and 2. So the 2 can't move past the 0. So in that case, the 0 can be moved to the right of the 1, but the 2 can't move left past the 0. So the 0 and 2 are in positions where the 0 is before the 2, and they can't be swapped. So the conclusion is that the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. Because if you have a 0 before a 2, you can't swap them, and any 1s between them can be arranged to allow movement of 0s and 2s through the 1s, but not past each other.\n\nSo, the key idea here is that the order of 0s and 2s in the original string is fixed. Because you can't swap 0 and 2. So, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. Similarly, if there's a 2 followed by a 0, then in the final string, the 2 must come before the 0. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s cannot be changed. However, the 1s can be moved around freely. Because 1s can be swapped with 0s and with 2s. So, for example, any 1 can be moved to the left or right through 0s and 2s. So, the 1s can be rearranged freely. But the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then inserting the 1s in between in such a way that the overall string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. The minimal lex string is achieved by having as many 0s as possible as early as possible, then 1s, then 2s. But given that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So the original positions of 0s and 2s determine their relative order. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. But the 1s can be moved around.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- All 0s and 2s must appear in the same order as in the original string. But the 1s can be placed anywhere else. However, since 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s, they can be inserted between 0s and 2s, or before all, or after all.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s optimally.\n\nSo the idea is that the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order, and the 1s can be placed in between them, but also possibly grouped together. For example, if there are multiple 1s, they can be grouped together in the earliest possible positions.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 1s. Let's think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order, and the 1s can be placed in between them. For instance, consider the original string as a sequence of 0s and 2s, with some 1s in between. But the 1s can be moved to any positions where they can be placed. For example, the 1s can be moved to the front of the string, or between the 0s and 2s, etc.\n\nBut to make the lex smallest string, we want as many 0s as possible early. So the 1s should be placed after the 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to think about it. Since the 1s can be moved freely through 0s and 2s, they can be placed anywhere. However, the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So the minimal lex string would be the one where all 0s are as far left as possible, followed by all 1s, then all 2s. But this is only possible if the original order of 0s and 2s allows that. Wait, no. Because the original order of 0s and 2s might have a 0 followed by a 2, but then another 0 after that. So the original order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So the 0s and 2s in the final string must be in the same order as they appear in the original string. So for example, if the original string is \"020\", then the 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 2, 0. So the final string must have the 0s and 2s in that order. But the 1s can be placed in between. But how to arrange the 1s.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in between them. But where?\n\nThe optimal way is to place as many 1s as possible in the earliest positions possible. But since the 1s can be moved anywhere, perhaps the best way is to group all the 1s together and place them in the earliest possible position where they can be inserted.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original string is '100210' as in the first example. The input is '100210', the output is '001120'. Let's see: the original string has 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0. The 0s and 2s in the original string are 0,0,2,0. So their order is fixed. So the final string must have 0,0,2,0. Then the 1s are in positions 0, 4, and 5? Wait, original string is 1,0,0,2,1,0. So the 0s and 2s are 0,0,2,0. The 1s are the first character and the fifth. So in the final string, the 0s and 2s must be in the order 0,0,2,0. The 1s can be placed anywhere else. To make the lex smallest string, we want as many 0s as possible first. So the 1s should be placed after the 0s. But the 0s are already in the first positions. So in the example, the output is '001120'. The 0s and 2s are in order 0,0,2,0. The 1s are placed after the first two 0s and before the 2. That gives the lex smallest string.\n\nAnother example: the input is '11222121', output is '11112222'. Let's see. The original string is 1,1,2,2,2,1,2,1. The 0s and 2s are 2,2,2,2. Wait, no, the original string has no 0s. So the 0s are zero, so the 2s are in their original order. The 1s can be arranged in any order. But since all the 1s can be moved freely, the minimal string is to have all the 1s first, then the 2s. Which is indeed the case here. The output is '11112222'.\n\nThird example: '20' → output is '20'. Since there are no 1s. So the 0 and 2 are in their original order. So no swaps allowed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this list 'fixed_chars'.\n\n- Collect all the 1s. Let's call this list 'ones'.\n\nThen, the problem is to insert the ones into the 'fixed_chars' in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to insert the 1s into the 'fixed_chars' list.\n\nThe lex smallest string would be achieved by placing the 1s as early as possible. However, since the 'fixed_chars' list contains 0s and 2s, which are fixed in their order, inserting the 1s in between them.\n\nBut the 1s are all the same. So the optimal way is to insert all the 1s in the earliest possible positions. For example, if the fixed_chars is [0, 0, 2, 0], then inserting all the 1s before the first 0 would be better than inserting them later. But wait, inserting before the first 0 would make the string start with 1s, then 0s, then 2s, then 0s. Which would be better than inserting them in between 0s and 2s. For example, inserting all the 1s at the beginning.\n\nBut why not? Because 1 is larger than 0. So, inserting 1s before 0s would make the string lex larger. Oh wait! Wait, that's a problem. Because the 1 is larger than 0, so putting 1s before 0s would make the string worse. So the correct approach is to insert the 1s as late as possible, but in positions where they are before the 2s.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be inserted between 0s and 2s. Because inserting them between 0s and 2s would allow the 0s to be as early as possible, and the 1s to be before the 2s. Because 1 is less than 2.\n\nSo the idea is that the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s, but also in between 0s, or between 2s. But since 1 is larger than 0, but smaller than 2, we want to insert the 1s as early as possible, but after the 0s. Because inserting them before the 0s would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is to insert the 1s in the earliest positions possible where they are not before any 0s. So, the 1s should be placed after the 0s and before the 2s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a list of 0s and 2s. For example, fixed_chars = [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 1s can be inserted in any positions, but the optimal way is to insert all of them as early as possible, but after the 0s and before the 2s.\n\nWait, but in this case, the 0s are first, then the 2, then the 0. So the 1s can be inserted between the 0s and 2. So inserting all the 1s there would make the string 0,0,1,1,2,0. Which is better than inserting them after the 2. Because the 1 is less than 2.\n\nSo the idea is that, for the fixed_chars, which are 0s and 2s, we can split them into groups of 0s and 2s. The 1s can be inserted in between the 0s and 2s. For example, between the 0s and the first 2, between 2s and the next 0s, etc. But since 1 is less than 2, inserting 1s between 0s and 2s would be better than inserting them after the 2s. Also, inserting the 1s between 0s is worse than inserting them after the 0s. Wait, but inserting 1s between 0s would create a 0,1,0, which is worse than 0,0,1, because 0 is better than 1. So the optimal way is to insert the 1s in between the 0s and the 2s, but not in between 0s. So how can we do that?\n\nThe key is that the 1s can be placed in any positions between the 0s and 2s, but we want to insert all of them as early as possible, but after the 0s. So for example, if there are multiple 0s followed by a 2, then inserting all the 1s between the 0s and the 2 would be better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nSo the way to model this is to collect all the 1s, and then insert them into the fixed_chars list in the earliest possible position where inserting them would not cause them to be before any 0s.\n\nBut how to find that position.\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a list of characters. Let's imagine that the fixed_chars consists of some 0s and 2s. We need to find the earliest position where inserting the 1s would be optimal.\n\nThe 1s should be inserted in the earliest possible position where they are not before any 0s. Since 1 is larger than 0, but smaller than 2, the best place is between 0s and 2s. For example, if there is a transition from 0 to 2, inserting the 1s there would be optimal.\n\nBut what if there are multiple transitions between 0 and 2? For example, fixed_chars is [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Then, inserting the 1s between the first 0s and the 2, and between the 0 and the next 2. But how to decide where to insert them.\n\nAlternatively, since the 1s are all the same, we can insert all of them in the earliest possible position where inserting them would be beneficial. For example, the earliest position where inserting them would be between a 0 and a 2. If there are no such positions, then insert them after all the 0s (if there are 0s) or before the first 2 (if there are no 0s).\n\nWait, here's an approach:\n\n- The 1s should be inserted in the earliest possible position where inserting them would not disrupt the order of 0s and 2s. The earliest possible position is the first occurrence where a 0 is followed by a 2. Inserting the 1s there would allow them to be between 0 and 2. But if there are no such positions, then insert them either at the beginning (if there are no 0s) or after all 0s (if there are 0s and all 2s come after them).\n\nAlternatively, think of the fixed_chars as a sequence of 0s and 2s. The 1s can be inserted in any of the gaps between the characters. The gaps are:\n\n- Before the first character.\n\n- Between each pair of consecutive characters.\n\n- After the last character.\n\nWe need to choose the gap where inserting the 1s will result in the lex smallest string. Since the 1s are all the same, inserting them all into one gap is better than splitting them into multiple gaps.\n\nNow, the question is which of these gaps is the best to insert the 1s.\n\nFor example, inserting the 1s in the earliest possible gap where inserting them would not be before any 0s. Let's think:\n\nIf the fixed_chars starts with a 0, then inserting the 1s before the first 0 would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So that's not good. So we can't insert them there.\n\nIf the fixed_chars starts with a 2, then inserting the 1s before the 2 would be better than inserting them after, since 1 < 2. So inserting them before the first 2 would be better.\n\nIf the fixed_chars has a 0 followed by a 2, then inserting the 1s between them is better than inserting them after the 2. Because inserting between them gives us 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s.\n\nSo the optimal gap is the earliest possible gap where inserting the 1s would not be before any 0s. How to find that?\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a list. We can iterate through the list and find the first position where inserting the 1s would be optimal.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe 1s can be inserted in the earliest possible position where inserting them would not be before any 0s. So the earliest such position is the first occurrence of a 2 in the fixed_chars, or the first occurrence of a transition from 0 to 2. If there are no 2s, then the 1s can be inserted at the end (since all are 0s, and inserting 1s after them would be better than inserting before them).\n\nAlternatively, the earliest position to insert the 1s is the first position where the current character is 2, or the first position where the previous character is 0 and the current is 2.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nCase 1: fixed_chars is all 0s. Then inserting the 1s after all the 0s is best. Because inserting them earlier would be before 0s (which is worse) or after the 0s (which is better). So the 1s go at the end.\n\nCase 2: fixed_chars is all 2s. Then inserting the 1s before the first 2 is best, because 1 < 2. So the 1s are inserted at the beginning.\n\nCase 3: fixed_chars has both 0s and 2s. Then, the earliest position where the 1s can be inserted is between the 0s and 2s. So, find the first occurrence of a 2 in the fixed_chars, and insert all the 1s before that 2. Because inserting them before that 2 would allow them to be between the 0s and the 2.\n\nBut what if there are multiple 0s and 2s? Like [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. The first 2 is at index 2. Inserting the 1s before that 2 would be the best option. Then the 1s would be between the 0s and the 2, and the rest of the 0s and 2s would follow.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Find the earliest position where inserting the 1s would be optimal. That position is the first occurrence of a 2, if there are any 2s. Otherwise, insert at the end.\n\nBut if there are no 2s, then all are 0s. So insert the 1s after the 0s.\n\nBut if there are no 0s, then all are 2s. Insert the 1s before the 2s.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCollect all the 0s and 2s in their original order (fixed_chars).\n\nCollect all the 1s (ones_list).\n\nIf there are no 2s in fixed_chars:\n\n   insert all 1s after the fixed_chars.\n\nElse if there are no 0s in fixed_chars:\n\n   insert all 1s before the fixed_chars.\n\nElse:\n\n   find the first occurrence of a 2 in fixed_chars. Insert all the 1s before that 2. Because that's the earliest possible position where inserting the 1s would be between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but the first occurrence of a 2 may be preceded by 0s. So inserting the 1s before that 2 would be between the 0s and the 2.\n\nYes. So inserting the 1s before the first 2 would allow them to be placed after all the 0s up to that point.\n\nSo the code could be something like:\n\nfixed_chars = list of 0s and 2s in original order.\n\nones = list of 1s.\n\nif not fixed_chars:\n\n   return ''.join(ones)\n\nif not ones:\n\n   return ''.join(fixed_chars)\n\nif '2' not in fixed_chars:\n\n   # all 0s. insert ones after.\n\n   return ''.join(fixed_chars + ones)\n\nelif '0' not in fixed_chars:\n\n   # all 2s. insert ones before.\n\n   return ''.join(ones + fixed_chars)\n\nelse:\n\n   # find the first occurrence of '2' in fixed_chars.\n\n   first_2_index = index of first '2' in fixed_chars.\n\n   # insert all ones before that index.\n\n   # the new string is fixed_chars[:first_2_index] + ones + fixed_chars[first_2_index:]\n\n   return ''.join( fixed_chars[:first_2_index] + ones + fixed_chars[first_2_index:] )\n\nBut wait, what if the first occurrence of 2 is at position 0? That would mean that the first character is 2. Then, inserting the 1s before it would put them before the 2, which is better than inserting them after.\n\nYes. For example, if fixed_chars is [2, 2, 0, 2], but wait, no. Because the original order of 0s and 2s can't have a 2 followed by a 0. Because according to the earlier reasoning, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So if the original string has a 2 followed by a 0, then in the fixed_chars, the 2 comes before the 0. So, in that case, the first_2_index is 0. Inserting the 1s before that would be before the 2. Which is better than inserting them after.\n\nBut in that case, inserting the 1s before the 2 would make the string start with 1s, but that's better than inserting them after the 2. Because 1 < 2. So yes.\n\nBut in this scenario, the fixed_chars has a 2 followed by 0. So the original string had a 2 followed by a 0. Which is allowed because the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the fixed_chars is [2,0,...].\n\nSo inserting the 1s before the 2 would be better than inserting them after the 2, because 1 is less than 2.\n\nBut inserting them before the 2 would result in 1s followed by 2, which is better than 2 followed by 1s.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nLet's test the first example.\n\nInput: '100210' → fixed_chars is [0,0,2,0], and ones is ['1','1'].\n\nIn fixed_chars, there are 0s and 2s. The first occurrence of 2 is at index 2.\n\nSo the new string is fixed_chars[:2] (which is [0,0]) + ones (['1','1']) + fixed_chars[2:] ([2,0]) → 001120 → which matches the example output.\n\nAnother example: input is '11222121' → the fixed_chars is [2,2,2,2], and the ones are ['1','1','1','1','1'].\n\nSince there are no 0s in fixed_chars, we insert the ones before the fixed_chars. So the output is 1111... followed by 2222 → which matches the example.\n\nThird example: input is '20' → fixed_chars is [2,0], and no ones. So output is '20'.\n\nAnother test case: input is '201' → original string is '2','0','1'. The fixed_chars is [2,0], ones is ['1'].\n\nSince there are 0s and 2s. The first occurrence of 2 is at index 0. So insert the 1s before that. So the new string is ones + fixed_chars → '1' + '20' → '120'.\n\nBut wait, the original string is '201'. The 1 can be moved. Let's see. The original string is 2,0,1. The 1 is after the 0. But since the fixed_chars is [2,0], which is the order of 2 and 0. The 1 can be inserted before the 2. So the final string is '120'.\n\nBut can that be achieved? Let's see. The original string is '201'. The 1 is after the 0. How to move it before the 2?\n\nBut the 0 can be moved past the 1. Wait, the original string is '2','0','1'. The 0 and 1 are adjacent. So we can swap them. So the string becomes '210'. Then, the 2 and 1 can be swapped (they are adjacent) to get '120'. Which is the desired result. So the algorithm works here.\n\nAnother test case: input is '02'. fixed_chars is [0,2], ones is empty. Output is '02'.\n\nAnother test case: input is '021'. fixed_chars is [0,2], ones is ['1']. Insert before the first 2. So the string is 0 followed by 1 followed by 2 → '012', which is lex smaller than '021'.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is '020'. fixed_chars is [0,2,0]. The first occurrence of 2 is at index 1. Insert the 1s before that. So the new string is 0 + ones + 2,0. So if there are ones, say one '1', the string is 0 1 2 0 → '0120'.\n\nWhich is better than inserting the 1 after the 2 (0 2 1 0 → '0210').\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nCollect the fixed_chars as all characters that are 0 or 2, in the original order.\n\nCollect the ones as all characters that are 1.\n\nThen, process as per the algorithm above.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of '2' in fixed_chars.\n\nIn code:\n\nfixed = [c for c in s if c in {'0', '2'}]\n\nones = [c for c in s if c == '1']\n\nThen, check if there are any 2s in fixed.\n\nSo:\n\nif len(fixed) == 0:\n\n    return ''.join(ones)\n\nif len(ones) == 0:\n\n    return ''.join(fixed)\n\nThen, check if there are any 2s in fixed. Well, since the code is in the else part, when fixed is non-empty and ones is non-empty.\n\nBut in code:\n\nif '2' not in fixed:\n\n    # all 0s. insert ones after.\n\n    return ''.join(fixed + ones)\n\nelif '0' not in fixed:\n\n    # all 2s. insert ones before.\n\n    return ''.join(ones + fixed)\n\nelse:\n\n    # find the first occurrence of '2' in fixed.\n\n    first_2 = fixed.index('2')\n\n    # insert the ones after the first part of fixed.\n\n    return ''.join( fixed[:first_2] + ones + fixed[first_2:] )\n\nBut wait, in the else clause, the fixed contains both 0 and 2. So the first_2 is the first occurrence of 2 in fixed.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the fixed is [0, 0, 2, 0, 2], then inserting the ones after the first 2 (the one at index 2) would place them between the first 0s and the 2, and then the rest of the fixed is 0,2.\n\nSo the code would generate fixed[:first_2] + ones + fixed[first_2:], which is [0,0] + ones + [2,0,2].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the first example: input is '100210'.\n\nfixed is [0,0,2,0], ones is ['1', '1'].\n\nIn the else clause, first_2 is 2. So fixed[:2] is [0,0], then add ones, then fixed[2:] is [2,0]. So the result is 00 + 11 + 20 → 001120. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is '201' → fixed is ['2', '0'], ones is ['1'].\n\nIn else clause, '2' is present, '0' is present. first_2 is 0. So fixed[:0] is empty, then add ones, then fixed[0:] is ['2', '0']. So the result is '' + '1' + '20' → '120'.\n\nAnother test case: input is '021' → fixed is ['0', '2'], ones is ['1']. first_2 is 1. So fixed[:1] is ['0'], then add ones, then fixed[1:] is ['2']. So the result is '0' + '1' + '2' → '012'.\n\nAnother test case: input is '0201' → fixed is ['0', '2', '0'], ones is ['1'].\n\nfirst_2 is 1. So fixed[:1] is ['0'], then ones, then fixed[1:] is ['2', '0'] → '0' + '1' + '20' → '0120'.\n\nAnother case: input is '20' → fixed is ['2', '0'], ones is empty. So return fixed → '20'.\n\nAnother case: input is '222' → fixed is ['2','2','2'], ones is empty. Return fixed.\n\nAnother case: input is '111' → fixed is empty, ones is ['1','1','1'] → return ''.join(ones) → '111'.\n\nAnother case: input is '000' → fixed is ['0','0','0'], ones is empty → return fixed.\n\nAnother case: input is '210' → fixed is ['2', '0'], ones is ['1'] → first_2 is 0 → insert ones before → '1' + '20' → '120'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut note that for the fixed list, the code is built by checking for '0' and '2'.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input string, process it, and output the result.\n\nBut the input is given as a single string. For example, in the sample input, the first input is '100210'.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nfixed = []\nones = []\nfor c in s:\n    if c == '1':\n        ones.append(c)\n    else:\n        fixed.append(c)\n\nThen process as before.\n\nBut in code:\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nfixed = []\nones = []\nfor c in s:\n    if c == '1':\n        ones.append(c)\n    else:\n        fixed.append(c)\n\nif not fixed:\n    print(''.join(ones))\nelif not ones:\n    print(''.join(fixed))\nelse:\n    if '2' not in fixed:\n        # all 0s\n        print(''.join(fixed + ones))\n    elif '0' not in fixed:\n        # all 2s\n        print(''.join(ones + fixed))\n    else:\n        first_2 = fixed.index('2')\n        print(''.join(fixed[:first_2] + ones + fixed[first_2:]))\n\nWait, but what if the fixed list contains both ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing specific adjacent swaps on a ternary string consisting of characters '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be directly swapped. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: The relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must remain unchanged because they cannot be swapped directly. However, '1's can be freely moved around '0's and '2's.\n2. **Separate Characters**: We separate the input string into two parts: `fixed`, which contains all '0's and '2's in their original order, and `ones`, which contains all '1's.\n3. **Determine Insertion Point for '1's**: \n   - If there are no '2's in `fixed`, all '1's should be appended after the '0's.\n   - If there are no '0's in `fixed`, all '1's should be placed before the '2's.\n   - Otherwise, insert all '1's just before the first occurrence of '2' in `fixed` to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nfixed = []\nones = []\nfor c in s:\n    if c == '1':\n        ones.append(c)\n    else:\n        fixed.append(c)\n\nif not fixed:\n    print(''.join(ones))\nelif not ones:\n    print(''.join(fixed))\nelse:\n    if '2' not in fixed:\n        # All 0s, append ones\n        print(''.join(fixed + ones))\n    elif '0' not in fixed:\n        # All 2s, prepend ones\n        print(''.join(ones + fixed))\n    else:\n        first_2 = fixed.index('2')\n        result = fixed[:first_2] + ones + fixed[first_2:]\n        print(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and processed to separate '1's from '0's and '2's.\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If there are no '0's or '2's, the result is simply the list of '1's or the original '0's and '2's respectively.\n3. **Inserting '1's**: The optimal position to insert '1's is determined by checking the first occurrence of '2' in the list of '0's and '2's. This ensures that '1's are placed where they contribute most to minimizing the lexicographical order without disrupting the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the smallest lexicographical string by leveraging the constraints and properties of the allowed swaps.",
