Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) is zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need to find the minimal number of such cards required.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to have the total sum be zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards (each with value between -x and x) that sum up to T. But how?\n\nLet me think. Each card can contribute a maximum of x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, for example, if T is positive, we can use as many x as needed. But since we want the minimal number of cards, we should use as many as possible of the maximum value (x) to reach T.\n\nWait, but let's think in terms of absolute values. Let's take the absolute value of T. Let's say T is some value. Let me denote |T| as the absolute value. Then, the minimal number of cards needed would be the ceiling of |T| divided by x. Because each card can contribute up to x towards the sum. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2*2=4 is less than 5, so we need 3 cards: 2+2+1, but wait, but each card can be any value between -x and x. Oh right, but the sum of the new cards needs to be exactly T. So, for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then the maximum per card is 2. So, how to get 5? Well, 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So three cards. But what if T is 6 and x is 2? Then 3 cards of 2 each. So, the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is 3 and x is 2? Then 2 + 1 = 3. So two cards. Which is ceil(3/2) = 2. So yes, that formula seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 0? Then we need zero cards. But that's a special case. But in the problem, the initial sum S could be zero. Then T is zero, so no cards needed. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards, S.\n2. Compute T = -S. That's the sum that the new cards need to contribute.\n3. If T is zero, return 0.\n4. Else, compute the absolute value of T, call it abs_T.\n5. The minimal number of cards is ceil( abs_T / x ), but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Let's say T is 5, x is 2. Then 5 / 2 is 2.5. Ceil is 3. Which is correct. Another example: T is 4, x is 2. 4/2 is 2, so two cards. Correct. What if T is 3 and x is 3? Then 3/3 is 1. So one card. Correct. So yes, the minimal number is ceil( abs_T / x ), but only if T is not zero.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 1 and x is 2? Then 1/2 is 0.5, ceil is 1. Which is correct. Because we can use a single card with 1.\n\nSo the formula is correct. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only when T is not zero. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how to compute this in Python?\n\nWell, for integers, we can compute it as (abs_T + x - 1) // x. Because for example, 5 + 2-1 = 6, divided by 2 gives 3. Which is correct. For 3 + 2-1 =4 divided by 2 is 2. Correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCalculate S = sum of the found cards.\n\nIf S is zero, then output 0.\n\nElse, T = -S. abs_T = abs(T). Then the answer is (abs_T + x -1 ) // x.\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input",
