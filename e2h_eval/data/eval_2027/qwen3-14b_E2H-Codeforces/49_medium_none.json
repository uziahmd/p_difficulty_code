They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the given edges which have GCD and LCM values. So each edge between two lawns (say u and v) has a GCD and LCM of their mushroom counts. We need to assign numbers to each node such that for every edge, the GCD and LCM match the given ones.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the constraints. For any two numbers a and b, their GCD and LCM must satisfy GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. Also, since the GCD divides both a and b, and the LCM is a multiple of both, the given GCD and LCM must satisfy that GCD divides LCM. Otherwise, it's impossible. Wait, right! Because if the GCD is g and LCM is l, then g must divide l. Otherwise, there's no solution. So for each edge, we can first check if GCD divides LCM. If not, immediately return NO.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about each edge. Suppose for an edge between u and v, the GCD is g and LCM is l. Then, the numbers on u and v must be multiples of g. Let me denote a = g * x and b = g * y, where x and y are coprime (since GCD(a,b) is g). Then, LCM(a,b) = g * x * y. So according to the problem, this should equal l. Therefore, g * x * y = l. Which implies x*y = l/g. And since x and y are coprime, l/g must be equal to x*y where x and y are coprime. So, x and y are factors of l/g, and coprime. But how do we find x and y?\n\nBut for the problem, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node has some value, and for each edge, the values of the nodes must satisfy the GCD and LCM conditions. However, since the GCD and LCM are given, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined up to some factors, and we need to assign values in a way that satisfies all edges.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a union-find structure, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined by the relations between connected nodes. For example, if two nodes are connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, then the values of the nodes must be multiples of g, and their product must be g*l. But how do we handle multiple edges and ensure consistency across the entire graph?\n\nLet me think about the variables. For each node, the value is some number. Let's consider that for each edge between u and v, the values a_u and a_v must satisfy:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g_uv\nlcm(a_u, a_v) = l_uv\n\nWhich implies that a_u * a_v = g_uv * l_uv. Also, since the GCD is g_uv, both a_u and a_v must be multiples of g_uv. So, let me define a_u = g_uv * x_u, a_v = g_uv * x_v. Then, since the GCD of a_u and a_v is g_uv, the GCD of x_u and x_v must be 1. Also, the LCM of a_u and a_v is g_uv * x_u * x_v. Which equals l_uv. Therefore, x_u * x_v = l_uv / g_uv. Since l_uv must be divisible by g_uv, otherwise it's impossible. So, for each edge, we can check if l_uv % g_uv != 0, then output NO.\n\nSo the first step is to check for each edge whether l_uv is divisible by g_uv. If not, return NO.\n\nNow, considering that for each edge, x_u * x_v = k, where k is l_uv/g_uv. And also, gcd(x_u, x_v) = 1. So, x_u and x_v are coprime factors of k. Which means that k must be a product of two coprimes. So, for each edge, k must be such that it can be split into two coprime factors. But since x_u and x_v are coprime, any factorization of k into two coprimes would work. However, how do we assign x_u and x_v for each edge?\n\nBut here's the thing: for each edge, the product x_u * x_v is fixed. But the individual x's must be assigned in a way that is consistent across the entire graph. For example, if there's a chain of edges, the x values must be consistent. How can we model this?\n\nThis seems similar to a system of equations where each equation is x_u * x_v = k for some k, and also that x_u and x_v are coprime. However, solving such a system isn't straightforward. Let's think of it as a graph where each edge imposes a relation between x_u and x_v. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that x_u and x_v are coprime, and x_u * x_v = k, then one of them must be a divisor of k, and the other is k divided by that divisor. But since they are coprime, the divisor must be a factor of k, and the other factor must be co-prime with it. So, for example, if k is 6, then possible pairs (x_u, x_v) could be (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But in any case, the product is fixed.\n\nBut how do we assign these values across the graph? This seems like a problem where we can model the x's as variables, and for each edge, we have a constraint that x_u * x_v = k. However, the constraints are multiplicative. But since the x's are coprime, perhaps we can model this as a bipartition problem or something else.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the same x_u can be involved in multiple edges. For example, if node u is connected to node v with some k1, and node u is connected to node w with some k2. How do we ensure that the x_u chosen for the first edge is compatible with the x_u chosen for the second edge?\n\nThis feels like a problem where the variables are connected through multiplicative constraints. However, solving such a system is challenging. Let's think about the implications.\n\nSuppose we have a connected component. Let's pick a root node and assign a value to it, then propagate the constraints. However, since the constraints are multiplicative, this might not be straightforward. Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n1 0 → Output is YES and 1.\n\nNo edges, so any value is allowed. But since there's only one node, the answer is 1 (assuming that the problem allows any value, but since there are no constraints, perhaps the problem expects us to assign 1? Well, the problem says that the original map had numbers ≥1. So for a single node with no edges, any value is acceptable. But the sample output shows 1. So perhaps the code can assign 1 in such cases.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 1\n1 2 1 3 → Output is YES 1 3.\n\nSo for the edge between 1 and 2, GCD is 1, LCM is 3. Then, the product of the two numbers is 1*3 = 3. So possible pairs are (1,3) and (3,1). Which gives the sample output.\n\nBut how to model this in general?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that for each edge between u and v, the numbers a_u and a_v must be multiples of the GCD. So, let's say for each node, the value is a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the value is determined by the product of the GCD and some variable x. But how?\n\nWait, earlier analysis shows that for each edge (u, v) with GCD g and LCM l, then a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime, and x*y = l/g. So, the product of x and y is fixed. However, the x and y must be coprime.\n\nBut this suggests that for each edge, the x and y are factors of k = l/g, and coprime. So, for each edge, we can model the relation between x_u and x_v as x_u * x_v = k. But since x_u and x_v are coprime, then each must be a divisor of k, and their product is exactly k.\n\nBut how to assign x values across the graph? Let's think of this as a graph where each edge connects u and v with the constraint x_u * x_v = k. However, since x_u and x_v are coprime, this implies that x_u divides k and x_v divides k, and they are coprime.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's take an example. Suppose we have a connected component. Let's pick a starting node and assign a value to x for that node. Then, for each adjacent node, we can compute x based on the edge's k. However, since x_u * x_v = k, once we know x_u, x_v is k/x_u. But then, when we reach another node via a different path, we need to make sure that the x values are consistent.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a BFS or DFS approach, assigning values as we go and checking for consistency.\n\nBut here's the problem: For each edge, the product of x_u and x_v is fixed. So, during traversal, if we assign x_u, then x_v is determined as k / x_u. However, if there's a cycle in the graph, we need to ensure that the assignments are consistent.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a triangle of nodes u, v, w. Edge u-v has k1, v-w has k2, and u-w has k3. When we assign x_u, then x_v = k1 / x_u. Then, from v to w, x_w = k2 / x_v = k2/(k1/x_u) = (k2 * x_u)/k1. Then, from u to w, x_w should be k3 / x_u. So equating the two expressions for x_w:\n\n(k2 * x_u)/k1 = k3 / x_u → x_u² = (k1 * k3)/k2 → x_u must be sqrt( (k1*k3)/k2 ). But since x_u must be an integer, this is only possible if (k1*k3)/k2 is a perfect square. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nThis suggests that for each connected component, we need to assign x values in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. However, this seems complex. How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, since x_u and x_v are coprime, and x_u * x_v = k, then x_u must be a divisor of k, and x_v must be k / x_u. Moreover, since they are coprime, x_u and x_v must be coprime. So for each edge, the k must be such that it can be split into two coprime factors. But k is l/g, and l/g must be an integer. So the first check is that for each edge, l is divisible by g. If not, return NO.\n\nBut even if that's true, for a connected component, the assignments may not be possible. For example, if there's a cycle that leads to a contradiction.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n1. For each edge, check if l_uv % g_uv != 0 → if yes, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component in the graph (the graph is built from the given edges), perform a BFS/DFS to assign x values to the nodes, ensuring that all constraints are met.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. Let's model the x values. For each edge (u, v), x_u * x_v = k, where k = l_uv/g_uv. Also, x_u and x_v must be coprime. So, for the entire connected component, the product of x values along any path between two nodes must be consistent.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the x values as variables. For each edge between u and v, x_u * x_v = k. Let's take the logarithm of both sides. Then log x_u + log x_v = log k. But since we're dealing with integers, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, think of the variables as part of a system of equations. However, solving this system is non-trivial. But perhaps we can model this as a bipartition problem. For example, if we can assign x_u as a product of primes in such a way that for each edge, the x_u and x_v are coprime and their product is k.\n\nBut how to proceed? Let's think of the x values as being uniquely determined by the product of primes in certain ways. For example, if k is a product of primes p1^a1 * p2^a2 ... then since x_u and x_v are coprime, all the primes in x_u must be disjoint from those in x_v. So, each prime in k must be entirely in x_u or entirely in x_v. Thus, for each edge, the k must be square-free? No, because x_u and x_v can have exponents as long as they are in separate primes. Wait, no. For example, if k is 4, which is 2^2. Then x_u and x_v must be coprime and multiply to 4. The possible pairs are (1,4), (4,1). Because if x_u is 2 and x_v is 2, they are not coprime. So for k=4, the only possible pairs are (1,4) and (4,1). So in this case, the exponents of primes in k must be assigned entirely to one of the x's. So for any prime in k, all its exponents must be in either x_u or x_v, but not both.\n\nThis suggests that for each edge, the k must be square-free? No, because in the example above, k=4 is not square-free, but it's possible. So the key is that the exponents of each prime in k must be entirely assigned to one of the two x's. Therefore, the prime factors of k must be split between x_u and x_v, with no overlap. Thus, for each edge, the k must be such that it can be split into two coprime factors, which is always possible (for example, 1 and k).\n\nBut how does this affect the connected component? For example, if there's a cycle, the assignment of primes must be consistent.\n\nLet me think of this as building a graph where each edge enforces that the set of primes in x_u and x_v are disjoint, and their product is k. So, for each edge, the primes in k must be partitioned between the two nodes. This seems like a problem where each node's x value is a product of certain primes, and the edges enforce that the primes are assigned to one side or the other.\n\nThis seems very abstract. How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, for each connected component, we can assign a base value to a node and propagate the constraints. For example, let's pick a starting node and assign x as 1. Then for each adjacent node, x is determined as k / x_prev. Then, we proceed recursively. However, this may not work if there's a cycle that leads to inconsistency.\n\nBut how to check for consistency?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose we have a cycle of three edges:\n\nu-v with k1, v-w with k2, w-u with k3.\n\nAssume we start at u with x_u = 1. Then x_v = k1 / x_u = k1. Then x_w = k2 / x_v = k2/k1. Then, from the third edge, x_u must equal k3 / x_w → 1 = k3 / (k2/k1) → k3 = k2/k1 → k1 * k3 = k2. If this is not true, then there's a contradiction.\n\nSo, during BFS/DFS traversal, whenever we reach a node that has already been assigned a value, we must check if the new value matches the existing one. If not, return NO.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Assign x values using BFS/DFS. For each node, when visiting it, assign x as per the edge constraints. For example, if the current node is u, and we have an edge to v with k, then x_v = k / x_u. However, we need to make sure that x_v is an integer, and that x_u and x_v are coprime.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that x_u and x_v are coprime? Because for each edge, the x_u and x_v must be coprime. So, when we assign x_v = k / x_u, we must check that GCD(x_u, x_v) == 1. However, since k = x_u * x_v and x_u and x_v are coprime, this is automatically satisfied. Because if there was a common divisor d >1 between x_u and x_v, then d would divide k, but since x_u and x_v are coprime, their product is k, and their GCD is 1. So, the condition that x_u and x_v are coprime is equivalent to x_u * x_v = k and their GCD is 1. Therefore, if we assign x_v = k / x_u, then x_u and x_v will automatically be coprime. Because if they had a common divisor, then that would imply that k has a square factor. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nSuppose x_u and x_v are not coprime. Let d = GCD(x_u, x_v). Then d divides both x_u and x_v, so d^2 divides x_u * x_v = k. Therefore, k must have a square factor. However, for the initial assignment, when we assign x_u and x_v, we have x_u * x_v = k. However, the requirement is that x_u and x_v are coprime. So, in order for this to be possible, k must be such that it can be written as a product of two coprime numbers. Which is always possible (as 1 and k), but in the case of the cycle example, the constraints may require that k's prime factors are split between the nodes in a way that is consistent with the entire graph.\n\nBut how can we ensure that during the BFS/DFS traversal?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that during the traversal, when we assign x_v = k / x_u, we must ensure that x_v is an integer. Because if k is not divisible by x_u, then this assignment is invalid, meaning that there's no solution. But how can that happen?\n\nBecause during the traversal, x_u is assigned as a value that comes from previous steps. For example, if the first edge is between u and v, and we assign x_u = 1, then x_v = k. But if there's another edge that requires x_u to be something else, then that would be a problem. However, in the BFS/DFS approach, the assignment is done in a way that ensures that x_u * x_v = k for each edge. So, during the traversal, when we process an edge, the x values are assigned based on the previous assignments. But how can we ensure that the product is correct?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have a tree structure. For example, a chain u-v-w. The edges u-v has k1, v-w has k2. Assign x_u = 1. Then x_v = k1. Then x_w = k2 / x_v = k2/k1. Now, for the edge u-w, if there is one, then x_u * x_w must equal k3. But since x_u is 1 and x_w is k2/k1, then k3 must be k2/k1. Otherwise, it's impossible. So, during the traversal, when we reach a node that's already visited, we must check if the new x value matches the existing one. If not, return NO.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Choose a starting node. Assign x as 1 (or any value? Well, perhaps 1 is the easiest choice, but maybe there's a better way.)\n\n- Perform BFS/DFS, assigning x values based on the edges. For each edge (u, v), if u is already processed, then v's x is determined as k / x_u. If v is unprocessed, assign x_v and proceed.\n\n- When processing a node, if it's already been assigned, check if the current x value matches the expected value. If not, return NO.\n\nBut what if the starting node's x value is not 1? For example, suppose we have a component where the x values can be multiplied by a constant. Like, if all x's are multiplied by some factor. However, since the product of x_u and x_v is fixed for each edge, this would not be possible unless all x's are multiplied by 1. Because, for example, if we have x_u' = c * x_u and x_v' = c * x_v, then x_u' * x_v' = c^2 * (x_u * x_v) = c^2 *k. Which would not equal k unless c=1. Therefore, the x values are uniquely determined up to a constant factor? No, because the product x_u * x_v must equal k. So, if you multiply x_u by c, then x_v must be multiplied by k/(c * x_u) * ... Wait, this seems complicated.\n\nBut the problem is that the x values are determined by the constraints. So, the starting node's x value can be chosen as any value that allows the rest to be consistent. However, how to choose that value? Because for example, in a connected component, the x values are determined up to a multiplicative factor. Wait, no. Because for each edge, the product is fixed. So, for example, in a tree structure, once you assign x to the root node, all others are determined. However, if there's a cycle, the x values are constrained to satisfy the cycle condition. So, for a connected component with no cycles (tree), the x values are determined once the root's x is chosen. However, in that case, the root's x can be any value that divides all the k's along the path. Wait, no. Because the root's x is assigned as 1, then others are determined. But if the root's x is assigned as something else, then the others change accordingly. However, the product for each edge remains the same. For example, if we have an edge between u and v with k. Suppose x_u is a, then x_v is k/a. If we choose x_u as a different value, say a * c, then x_v becomes k/(a*c) = (k/a)/c. But then the product x_u * x_v is still k. However, the problem is that in this case, x_u and x_v may not be coprime. Wait, no. Because x_u * x_v = k. And the requirement is that x_u and x_v are coprime. So, if we choose x_u as a value that divides k, and x_v as k/x_u, then x_u and x_v are coprime. But how?\n\nAh, here's the problem. Because if we choose x_u as a divisor of k, but not coprime with k/x_u, then that would violate the condition. For example, if k is 6, and x_u is 2, then x_v is 3. They are coprime. If x_u is 3, then x_v is 2. Also coprime. But if k is 4 and x_u is 2, then x_v is 2. Which are not coprime. So this would be invalid. Hence, the assignment of x_u must be such that x_u and k/x_u are coprime. Therefore, when choosing x_u for the root node, we must select a divisor of k such that it is coprime with k/x_u. But how?\n\nWait, but in the initial step of the BFS/DFS, how do we choose the x value for the starting node? Because for the first edge, the starting node's x is arbitrary, but it must be chosen such that for all edges connected to it, the x value is compatible with the k's. But how?\n\nThis seems like a problem. For example, suppose the starting node is connected to two edges. Let's say the first edge has k1 and the second has k2. How do we choose x for the starting node such that both edges can be satisfied?\n\nWait, but in the BFS/DFS approach, the starting node's x is chosen as 1. Then, for each edge, the connected node's x is determined as k / x_start. But this may not be valid for other edges connected to the starting node. For example, suppose the starting node u has two edges: one with k1 and another with k2. If we assign x_u = 1, then for the first edge, the other node v has x_v = k1. For the second edge, the other node w has x_w = k2. But then, what if there's another edge between v and w? Then, the product x_v * x_w must equal k3. Which would require k1 * k2 = k3. If that's not the case, then it's impossible.\n\nBut during the traversal, this would be detected when processing that edge. However, the problem is that the initial assignment of x_u = 1 may not work, but another assignment could. For example, suppose the starting node u is connected to two edges with k1 and k2. Let's say that x_u can be chosen as a divisor of k1 and k2, such that x_u is coprime with k1/x_u and also with k2/x_u. How can we find such a value?\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we handle this in our algorithm?\n\nPerhaps the key is that the product of all k's along any cycle must be a square. Wait, earlier example with the cycle of three edges required that k1 * k3 = k2. Which is a condition that must be satisfied for consistency. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire connected component must have all the products of the k's along any cycle be a square. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis seems too vague. Let me think again about the x variables. For each edge, x_u * x_v = k. So, for the entire component, the product of x's along any path between two nodes must be the product of the k's of the edges along the path. For example, if we have a path from u to v with edges e1, e2, ..., en, then the product of x's along the path (x_u * x_{next} * ... * x_v) would be equal to the product of the k's of the edges. However, since each edge contributes x_u * x_v = k, and the product along the path would be x_u * (x_u * x_v1) * (x_v1 * x_v2) * ... * (x_{v_{n-1}} * x_v) ) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider a path u - v - w. For edge u-v, x_u * x_v = k1. For edge v-w, x_v * x_w = k2. Then, multiplying these two equations gives x_u * x_v^2 * x_w = k1 * k2. However, if we want to find x_u * x_w, we can rearrange as x_u * x_w = (k1 * k2) / x_v^2. But this depends on x_v. However, if there's a direct edge between u and w with k3, then x_u * x_w = k3. So combining with the previous equation, k3 = (k1 * k2) / x_v^2 → x_v^2 = (k1 * k2) / k3. Which implies that (k1 * k2) must be divisible by k3, and that the quotient must be a perfect square. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nThis suggests that for any cycle in the graph, the product of the k's around the cycle must be a perfect square. However, how can we ensure that during the traversal?\n\nBut during the BFS/DFS traversal, when we encounter a node that has already been visited, we can check whether the product of the k's along the path from the starting node to the current node equals the product of the x's along that path squared. Or something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, during the BFS/DFS traversal, when we reach a node that has already been assigned a value, we can check whether the product of the k's along the path from the starting node to this node equals the product of the x's along the path. Wait, but the product of the x's along the path is x_start * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_current. However, this seems unrelated to the k's.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think back to the original problem. Perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- For each edge, check if l_uv is divisible by g_uv. If not, return NO.\n\n- For each connected component, build a graph where each edge has the value k = l_uv / g_uv.\n\n- Then, for each connected component, perform a BFS/DFS to assign x values to the nodes. Start with a node, assign x as 1. For each neighbor, compute x_neighbor = k / x_current. Check if this is an integer. If not, return NO. Also, check if x_current and x_neighbor are coprime. If not, return NO. Then proceed. When revisiting a node, check if the computed x matches the existing value. If not, return NO.\n\nBut why would x_current and x_neighbor be coprime? Because x_current * x_neighbor = k, and the product of two numbers is k. However, if k is not square-free, then x_current and x_neighbor may not be coprime. For example, if k is 4, and x_current is 2, then x_neighbor is 2, which are not coprime. But in this case, the original problem would have required that the GCD of a_u and a_v is g_uv. But a_u = g_uv * x_current, a_v = g_uv * x_neighbor. So their GCD is g_uv * GCD(x_current, x_neighbor). But according to the problem statement, the GCD should be g_uv. So GCD(x_current, x_neighbor) must be 1. Therefore, during the assignment, we must ensure that x_current and x_neighbor are coprime. Hence, when we assign x_neighbor = k / x_current, we must check that GCD(x_current, x_neighbor) == 1. If not, then it's impossible.\n\nBut how can that happen? Because x_current * x_neighbor = k. If their GCD is d>1, then d divides both x_current and x_neighbor, hence d^2 divides k. So, for the pair (x_current, x_neighbor) to be coprime, k must be square-free? No, not necessarily. For example, k=4, x_current=1, x_neighbor=4 → GCD(1,4)=1. Which is valid. Or k=6, x_current=2, x_neighbor=3 → GCD(2,3)=1. Which is valid. But if x_current=2 and x_neighbor=2, then GCD is 2, which is invalid. So, for a given k, there are possible ways to split into x_current and x_neighbor that are coprime, and others that are not. However, the problem requires that the split is such that x_current and x_neighbor are coprime.\n\nBut how do we ensure that during the BFS/DFS traversal? Because when we assign x_neighbor = k / x_current, we need to check that GCD(x_current, x_neighbor) is 1. However, this depends on the choice of x_current. For example, in the case of k=4, if x_current is 1, then x_neighbor is 4 → coprime. If x_current is 2, x_neighbor is 2 → not coprime. Hence, during the traversal, when we choose x_current as 1, it works, but if we choose x_current as 2, it doesn't. Hence, the choice of x_current for the starting node must be such that all splits along the edges are coprime.\n\nBut how can we ensure this? Because during the traversal, the choice of x_current for the starting node determines the rest of the assignments. If we choose a wrong x_current, it might lead to invalid splits.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the BFS/DFS approach with arbitrary starting x (like 1) may not work in all cases. For example, consider a component with a single edge between u and v, with k=4. If we assign x_u = 1, then x_v = 4, which is coprime. So that's valid. If we assign x_u = 2, then x_v = 2, which is invalid. But how do we know which choice is correct?\n\nThe problem is that the BFS/DFS approach starts with an arbitrary choice (like x_u=1) and proceeds. But this may not work in all cases. However, perhaps there's a way to choose x_current for the starting node such that all splits are valid.\n\nWait, but for any k, there is at least one way to split it into coprime factors. For example, 1 and k. Hence, if during the traversal, we can choose x_current as 1, then the rest of the assignments would be valid. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we choose the starting node's x value as 1. For each edge, x_neighbor = k / 1 = k. Then, GCD(1, k) is 1, which is valid. Then, for the next edge, the x value is k, and the neighbor's x is k_new / k. But we need to check if GCD(k, k_new /k) is 1. Which depends on k_new and k. For example, if k_new is k * m, where m is coprime with k. Then, k_new /k = m, which is coprime with k. Hence, GCD(k, m) = 1. But if k_new is not a multiple of k, then k_new/k is not an integer, leading to invalid.\n\nWait, but during the traversal, when we assign x_neighbor = k / x_current, we must check that it is an integer. Because if it's not, then it's impossible. For example, if the current x is 2, and the k is 3, then x_neighbor would be 3/2, which is not an integer. Hence, invalid.\n\nSo during the BFS/DFS traversal, whenever we assign x_neighbor = k / x_current, we must check that this division results in an integer. If not, return NO.\n\nMoreover, after that, we must check that GCD(x_current, x_neighbor) is 1. Because that's required by the problem's constraints.\n\nThus, the algorithm steps are:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Initialize all nodes as unvisited.\n\n- Pick a starting node, mark it as visited, assign x as 1.\n\n- For each edge in the component, perform BFS/DFS:\n\n   For each node u in the queue:\n\n      For each neighbor v of u:\n\n         if v is not visited:\n\n             compute k = l_uv/g_uv (already checked earlier)\n\n             x_v = k / x_u\n\n             check if x_v is integer. If not, return NO.\n\n             check if GCD(x_u, x_v) == 1. If not, return NO.\n\n             assign x_v and add to queue.\n\n         else:\n\n             check if x_v == k / x_u. If not, return NO.\n\nBut wait, during traversal, the edge between u and v is considered. So, for each edge, when we process it, we need to ensure that the product of x_u and x_v is equal to k. However, during the traversal, when we process the edge from u to v, we may have already processed v, and then we need to check that the product is correct.\n\nBut how do we ensure that all edges are processed? Because the traversal may not visit all edges. For example, if the graph is disconnected, but that's handled per connected component.\n\nWait, but the traversal is for a connected component. So all edges in the component are processed during the traversal. Because during BFS/DFS, we process all edges incident to the nodes in the component.\n\nBut how do we ensure that for each edge, the product of x_u and x_v is equal to k? Because during the traversal, when we process an edge from u to v, we assign x_v based on x_u. However, when we later process the edge from v to u, we would have already assigned x_u, and check that x_u equals k / x_v. Which is guaranteed since x_v was set to k / x_u.\n\nThus, during the traversal, for each edge, the product of x_u and x_v will be equal to k. So the algorithm checks for consistency when a node is revisited.\n\nBut what about the GCD check? Because",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on given GCD and LCM values from edges connecting lawns.

Actually, for each node, the value is determined by the x_values multiplied by the GCD of the edge it was first processed through?\n    # No, this is incorrect. We need to find the actual a_i such that for every edge (u, v), GCD(a_u, a_v) = g and LCM(a_u, a_v) = l.\n    # However, during the traversal, we have x_u and x_v such that a_u = g * x_u, a_v = g * x_v, but this g depends on the edge.\n    # Wait, this approach is flawed. Because for different edges, the GCD is different. So the previous approach is incorrect.\n    # Oh no! There's a mistake here. The previous approach assumes that all edges in the component share the same GCD, which is not the case. The earlier analysis was incorrect. Need to rethink.\n    \n    # Let me re-express the problem correctly.\n    # For each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we have:\n    # a_u = g * x_u, a_v = g * x_v, where x_u and x_v are coprime, and x_u * x_v = l/g.\n    # But this g is specific to the edge. Therefore, the previous approach of using x_values is not sufficient because the x_values depend on the edge's GCD.\n    # This means that the earlier approach is wrong and needs to be revised.\n    \n    # So, the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n    # For each edge (u, v) with GCD g and LCM l, the product a_u * a_v = g * l.\n    # Also, GCD(a_u, a_v) = g.\n    # Let me consider that for each node, the value a_i must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. However, this is not straightforward.\n    # Another approach is to build a graph where each edge imposes a relation between a_u and a_v. However, solving this system is complex.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, I need to refer back to the correct approach.\n    # The correct way is to model the problem as a graph where each edge enforces that a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, with x*y = l/g and gcd(x,y) = 1. However, this g is specific to the edge. Thus, the previous approach of using x_values is incorrect.\n    \n    # Therefore, the correct approach is to use a Union-Find structure with additional constraints. However, this seems complicated.\n    # Alternatively, considering that for each edge, the ratio between a_u and a_v is fixed. For example, a_u / a_v = x / y, where x*y = l/g and gcd(x,y) = 1. But this is not helpful.\n    \n    # Given the time, perhaps the correct solution is to re-express the problem using the following approach:\n    # For each edge, the product of a_u and a_v is g*l. Also, since the GCD is g, the values of a_u and a_v are multiples of g. Let me define a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, then x and y are coprime and x*y = l/g.\n    # Therefore, for each edge, we can derive that x and y must be factors of l/g and coprime. However, the challenge is to assign these x and y across the graph.\n    \n    # To handle this, we can model the problem as a graph where each edge imposes that the product of the x-values of its endpoints is k = l/g. And these x-values must be coprime. This is similar to the earlier approach, but the x-values are relative to the edge's GCD.\n    # However, this is not feasible because the GCD varies per edge.\n    \n    # Therefore, the initial approach is incorrect and needs to be abandoned. Given time constraints, I will refer to the correct approach from competitive programming knowledge.\n    \n    # Correct approach: For each connected component, choose a root and assign a value to it. Then, for each edge, propagate the constraints. However, the values must be consistent across all edges.\n    \n    # The correct way to model this is to use a BFS/DFS approach, where for each node, we store its value, and for each edge, we ensure that the GCD and LCM conditions are met.\n    \n    # Given the complexity, the correct solution is to realize that for each node, its value must be a multiple of the GCD of all edges incident to it. However, this may not be directly applicable.\n    \n    # Given the time, I will proceed with the following corrected code, which uses the BFS approach, but with a different assignment of a_values, ensuring that for each edge, the GCD and LCM are satisfied.\n    \n    # Reinitializing variables\n    visited = [False] * n\n    a_values = [1] * n  # This will store the actual mushroom counts\n    \n    for start in range(n):\n        if not visited[start]:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(start)\n            visited[start] = True\n            # Choose an arbitrary value for the starting node.
