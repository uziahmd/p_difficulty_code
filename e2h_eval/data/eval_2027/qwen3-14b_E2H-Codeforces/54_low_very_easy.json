Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me recall that in a regular polygon, each interior angle can be calculated. Wait, but here the angle we're talking about isn't necessarily an interior angle. Because the problem says that v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 are on its sides. So, for example, if you pick three consecutive vertices, like in a triangle, the angle at the middle vertex is the interior angle. But if you pick vertices that are further apart, the angle might be different.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the central angles. For a regular polygon with n sides, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. But how does that relate to the angles formed by three vertices?\n\nLet me think: For a regular polygon, if I pick three vertices v1, v2, v3, then the angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2. For example, in a square (n=4), if v2 is one vertex, and v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the angle is 90 degrees. But if v1 is adjacent and v3 is two steps away (like across the square), then maybe the angle is 45 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I need to find a formula for the angle at v2.\n\nLet me think geometrically. Suppose we have a regular polygon with n sides. Let's fix v2 as a vertex. Let's say there are k vertices between v2 and v1 along one side, and m vertices between v2 and v3 along the other side. Wait, but since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 depends on how many edges are between v1 and v2 and between v3 and v2. But since the polygon is regular, the angle will depend on the number of steps between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. However, since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle formed by choosing v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between v2 and v1 (in one direction) and l steps between v2 and v3 (in the other direction) would have a certain measure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. For example, if we choose v2 as the middle vertex, and then v1 and v3 are separated by k vertices. Wait, maybe there's a formula here.\n\nLet me think about the regular polygon. For a regular n-gon, the measure of the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. Now, suppose we have three vertices v1, v2, v3 arranged such that there are k edges between v1 and v2, and l edges between v2 and v3. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 depends on the arc between v1 and v3. Wait, maybe the angle is determined by the number of sides between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The angle between these two chords can be calculated using the formula for the inscribed angle. Wait, but in a regular polygon, the angle at v2 would be related to the arc between v1 and v3. Let me recall that in a circle, the inscribed angle subtended by an arc is half the measure of the central angle for that arc. But since the regular polygon is inscribed in a circle, this applies here.\n\nSo, for example, if the arc between v1 and v3 (passing through the other side of the polygon) is m steps (each step is one edge of the polygon), then the central angle for that arc is m*(360/n) degrees. Then the inscribed angle would be half of that. However, the angle at v2 is not an inscribed angle unless v2 is on the circumference. Wait, but v2 is a vertex of the polygon, so it's on the circumference. So, if I have an arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2, then the angle at v2 would be half of the central angle of that arc. Or wait, maybe the other way around.\n\nWait, let's think about the case where v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2. Then the arc between them (not passing through v2) is 2 steps (each step is 1 edge). The central angle for that arc is 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given target angle. The approach involves calculating the angles that can be formed using the properties of regular polygons and their inscribed angles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular n-gon, each central angle between adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $. For any three vertices $ v1, v2, v3 $, the angle at $ v2 $ depends on the arc length between $ v1 $ and $ v3 $.\n2. **Inscribed Angle Calculation**: The angle at vertex $ v2 $ formed by vertices $ v1 $ and $ v3 $ is half the central angle subtended by the arc between $ v1 $ and $ v3 $. This leads to the formula for the angle at $ v2 $ being $ \\frac{(k-1) \\times 180^\\circ}{n} $, where $ k $ is the number of vertices between $ v1 $ and $ v3 $.\n3. **Finding Optimal Angle**: We iterate through possible values of $ k $ (from 2 to $ n-1 $) to find the angle closest to the target angle $ a $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # The angle at vertex v2 when there are k steps between v1 and v3 (excluding v2)\n    # The formula for the angle is ((k - 1) * 180) / n\n    # We need to find k such that this angle is closest to a\n    \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 2\n    for k in range(2, n):\n        angle = ((k - 1) * 180) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k for consistency\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now, construct the triplet\n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 1 + best_k, and v3 as 1 + best_k + 1\n    # But need to wrap around if necessary\n    # However, since the polygon is regular and we can choose any valid triplet, let's pick a simple one\n    \n    # For example, let's take v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 1 + best_k + 1\n    # Wait, need to think about how to get the correct positions\n    # Let's take v2 as 1, then v1 is 2, and v3 is 1 + best_k + 1?
