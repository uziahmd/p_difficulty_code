            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The output is the minimal number of draws required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. The output for each case is the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nSo for each of the three cases given in the input, I have to compute the answer.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each set of three tiles, I need to check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to make it possible.\n\nBut how do I check if a set of tiles can form a mentsu, possibly after adding some tiles?\n\nWait, the problem says that after drawing extra tiles, she can have a mentsu. So the total tiles after adding will be 3 + k, where k is the number of draws. But the mentsu can be formed from any subset of those tiles. For example, if she has three tiles, and adds one, making four tiles, then there must be a subset of three tiles that forms a mentsu.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: for the initial three tiles, what's the minimal k such that adding k tiles allows forming a mentsu.\n\nBut how do I find that?\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If so, return 0.\n\nIf not, then check what's the minimal number of tiles needed to add to get a mentsu.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possibilities for forming a mentsu. The mentsu can be a triplet or a sequence.\n\nFor a triplet: all three tiles must be same. So, for example, if the three tiles are all same, then it's a triplet. Otherwise, maybe adding some tiles to get a triplet.\n\nFor a sequence: the three tiles must be consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s.\n\nBut with the initial three tiles, perhaps they can form part of a sequence when adding some tiles.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each possible way to form a mentsu (either triplet or sequence), determine the minimal number of tiles needed to add to reach that configuration.\n\nThen take the minimum among all possible options.\n\nSo for each of the three initial tiles, we need to check all possibilities of forming a triplet or sequence, and compute how many tiles are needed to reach that.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think for the triplet case first.\n\nCase 1: Triplet.\n\nThe current three tiles may have some counts. For example, suppose the three tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then, to form a triplet, we need to add one more 1m. So the number of tiles needed is 1.\n\nAlternatively, if the three tiles are [1m, 2m, 3m], then to form a triplet, you need to add two tiles of the same as one of them. Wait, no. Because a triplet requires three identical tiles. So for example, in the case of three different tiles, you need to add two of one of them. For example, if you have one 1m, you need two more to make a triplet. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles to add would be based on how many of each tile you already have.\n\nSo for example, if the three tiles are a, b, c. Let's say they are all different. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two more of any one of them. But that would require 2 tiles. However, maybe there's a better way. For example, if two of them are same. Like [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then you need to add one more 1m to get a triplet. So the number of tiles needed is 1.\n\nBut if the three tiles are all different, then the minimal is 2 (since you need three same, but you have one of each, so you need to add two of one of them).\n\nBut wait, what if the three tiles are [1m, 1m, 1m] already? Then no tiles needed. So that's the case of existing triplet.\n\nSo for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles to add is (3 - max_count) where max_count is the maximum count of any tile in the current three. For example, if two of the same, then 3-2=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw in order to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid mentsu. If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Triplet Check**: If the tiles do not form a valid mentsu, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet. This involves checking how many of each tile are present and determining how many more are needed to form a triplet.\n3. **Sequence Check**: Check if the tiles can be extended into a sequence by adding one or two tiles. This involves checking if the tiles can form part of a sequence and calculating the minimum additional tiles required to complete it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_draws(tiles):\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    # Parse the tiles into a list of (number, suit)\n    parsed = []\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        parsed.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    # Check for triplet\n    counts = Counter(parsed)\n    if any(v >= 3 for v in counts.values()):\n        return 0\n    \n    # Check for sequence\n    # Group by suit\n    suits = {}\n    for num, suit in parsed:\n        if suit not in suits:\n            suits[suit] = []\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n    \n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        if len(nums) < 3:\n            continue\n        # Sort the numbers\n        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n        # Check if they form a sequence\n        if sorted_nums[0] + 1 == sorted_nums[1] and sorted_nums[1] + 1 == sorted_nums[2]:\n            return 0\n    \n    # If not already a mentsu, compute minimal draws\n    # Try all possibilities for triplet and sequence\n    \n    # First, check for possible triplet\n    # For each tile, count occurrences\n    counts = Counter(parsed)\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n    # To form a triplet, need 3 of the same\n    triplet_needed = 3 - max_count\n    \n    # Now check for possible sequences\n    # For each suit, collect numbers\n    min_seq_draws = float('inf')\n    suits = {}\n    for num, suit in parsed:\n        if suit not in suits:\n            suits[suit] = []\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n    \n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        # Need to find if with adding some tiles, we can get a sequence\n        # Let's sort the numbers\n        nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n        # We can have 1, 2, or 3 numbers in the suit\n        # For example, if there are two numbers, check if adding one can make a sequence\n        # Or if there's one number, need to add two more\n        \n        if len(nums_sorted) == 3:\n            # Already checked earlier, but maybe not a sequence\n            # Check again\n            if nums_sorted[0] + 1 == nums_sorted[1] and nums_sorted[1] + 1 == nums_sorted[2]:\n                min_seq_draws = 0\n            else:\n                # Need to find the minimal draws to make a sequence\n                # Possible options: extend to a sequence by adding one or two tiles\n                # For example, [1, 2, 4], can add 3 to make [1,2,3,4], then take 1,2,3 or 2,3,4\n                # But how to find the minimal?\n                # For this case, the current three numbers are not a sequence.
