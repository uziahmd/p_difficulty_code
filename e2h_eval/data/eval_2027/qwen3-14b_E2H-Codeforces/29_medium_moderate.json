Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. But directly applying each substitution step by step would be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters long and there are up to 1e5 queries. So, we need an efficient way to handle these substitutions.\n\nHmm. Let me think. Each query replaces all occurrences of a digit di with ti. But if we process each query naively by replacing every occurrence in the string, that could be O(n * len(s)) time, which might not be feasible for large n and large s. For example, if each query replaces a digit that's present in the string many times, and there are many such queries, this approach would be too slow.\n\nSo, what's a smarter way? Maybe we can model the substitutions using some kind of mapping that keeps track of how each digit is transformed through the sequence of queries. Since substitutions can depend on previous substitutions, we need to process them in order and track for each digit what it gets replaced with.\n\nWait, but substitutions are done in sequence. For example, if a query replaces '2' with '00', and then another query replaces '0' with '1', then the first substitution would have replaced '2's with '00's, and then the second substitution would replace those '0's with '1's. So, the order of processing queries matters.\n\nBut if we process the queries in order, and for each digit, keep track of what it's currently mapped to, then maybe we can represent the substitutions as a transformation function. However, the problem is that when a query comes in, say replacing 'd' with 't', we need to replace all current instances of 'd' in the string with 't'. But if we have already replaced 'd' with something else before, then this new query would overwrite that.\n\nWait, no. Each query replaces all occurrences of di in the current string. So, for example, suppose initially the string is '123', then first query is '2->00', then the string becomes '1003'. Then, a query '0->1' would replace all 0s with 1s, leading to '1113'.\n\nSo, the key is that each substitution is applied to the current state of the string. So, the order of queries is important, and each substitution affects the current string.\n\nBut if we try to simulate this directly, for each query, replacing all occurrences of di in the current string with ti, then for each query, we need to scan the entire string and replace each occurrence. For example, if the string is length 1e5 and there are 1e5 queries, this would be O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nTherefore, we need a smarter approach. How can we model the transformations without actually expanding the string each time?\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Let's consider that each digit in the original string is transformed through the sequence of queries. But since substitutions can be applied multiple times, perhaps we can model for each digit (from 0-9) what it is currently mapped to. However, this is only possible if substitutions are applied in a way that each replacement is done once, and subsequent replacements can be handled by updating the mappings.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's maintain for each digit d (0-9), a mapping to a string (or some representation that allows us to compute the value efficiently). Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a query comes in, say \"d -> t\", we need to update the mapping for d. However, this isn't straightforward because any existing mappings that include d would need to be updated. For example, if previously, digit 'a' was mapped to a string that includes 'd', then when we replace 'd' with 't', the mapping for 'a' should now be updated to replace all occurrences of 'd' in its current mapping with 't'.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Because each time we have a substitution, we have to update all existing mappings that might have the substituted digit in their expansion. That sounds like it could be manageable if we can track for each digit, what it's currently expanded to, and when a substitution occurs, we can update the mappings accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a memoization approach where for each digit, we track what it expands to. However, when a substitution is made, we need to update the mappings of other digits that might have included the substituted digit in their expansion.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of maintaining a substitution system where each substitution can affect other substitutions. For example, if you have a substitution rule for 'a' and then later a substitution rule for 'b', and 'a' was mapped to a string containing 'b's, then when you change 'b's substitution, you need to update the substitution for 'a' as well.\n\nThis suggests that we need to track for each digit, the current expansion, and when a substitution is performed for a digit d, we need to go through all digits that have expansions containing d and update them. But that's not feasible unless we can find a way to represent the expansions in a way that allows for efficient updates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the expansion of each digit as a function that can be represented in terms of other digits. For example, if we have a mapping where each digit d maps to a string, but when a substitution is made for d, we can update the mapping for d. However, any other digits that had their expansion dependent on d would need to be updated as well. But how do we track that?\n\nThis seems complex. Let me think again. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit, which represents what it is currently expanded to. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Now, when a query comes in: replace all instances of di with ti. So, for example, if we have a query \"2->00\", then the mapping for '2' becomes '00'. But any other digits that had their mapping include '2' would need to have their mappings updated to replace '2's with '00's. Wait, but how can we track that?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a digit '1' that was mapped to '23', and then we have a query that replaces '2' with '00'. Then, the mapping for '1' should now be '003', right? Because the original mapping for '1' was '23', which after substituting '2's becomes '003'.\n\nSo, whenever a substitution is made for a digit d, we need to check all existing mappings of other digits to see if they contain d in their expansion, and if so, replace those d's with the new expansion of d. But how can we track that efficiently?\n\nThis seems like a problem. Because for each substitution, we may need to go through all existing mappings and check if they contain the substituted digit. But with 10 digits, and n up to 1e5, this could be manageable. Let's think:\n\nEach substitution for a digit d would require us to go through all other digits (0-9) and check if their current expansion contains d. If so, we need to replace all instances of d in their expansion with the new expansion of d. But how do we do that efficiently?\n\nWait, but the substitution is applied to the entire string. So, when a query comes in, it's replacing all instances of di in the current string. However, the current string is built by expanding all digits according to their current mappings. So, perhaps instead of tracking the actual string, we can track for each digit what it expands to, and then when we need to compute the final value, we can expand the original string's digits using these mappings.\n\nBut the problem is that the substitutions are applied in sequence. So, for example, if the original string is '123', and first we replace 2 with 00, then replace 0 with 1, then the original '2' would be replaced with 00, and then those 0s would be replaced with 1s. So, the final expansion of the original '2' is '11'.\n\nBut if we track for each digit, what it expands to, then during the first substitution, the mapping for 2 becomes '00'. Then, when we substitute 0 with '1', the mapping for 0 becomes '1'. But the mapping for 2 is still '00'. However, if we were to expand the original '2', it would now be '00', which would expand to '11' because 0 is now mapped to '1'. So, the problem is that the expansion of '2' depends on the current mappings of other digits.\n\nSo, the way to model this is that when we process a substitution for a digit d, we need to update the expansion of d to ti. But any existing expansions of other digits that contain d must be updated to use the new expansion of d. However, this seems recursive and difficult to manage.\n\nWait, but if we process substitutions in order, and for each substitution, we can update the mapping of the substituted digit, and then for all other digits, their current expansion is already built with previous substitutions. Therefore, if we want to ensure that when a substitution is made for d, all other digits that had their expansion based on d are updated, we need to recompute their expansion.\n\nBut that's not feasible unless we can track dependencies. Alternatively, perhaps we can represent each digit's expansion as a string, and whenever a substitution is made for a digit d, we need to go through all other digits and check if their expansion contains d, and replace those occurrences with the new expansion of d. However, this would be O(10 * L) per substitution, where L is the length of the expansion strings. But given that the sum of lengths of ti across all queries is 1e5, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nLet me think through this approach. Let's have a dictionary or array for each digit, say, map[d], which is the current expansion of digit d. Initially, map[d] = str(d) for each d from 0-9.\n\nWhen a query comes in, say, replacing d with t, we need to update the map for d. However, any other digits that have their expansion containing d would need to have their expansion updated. For example, if map[1] was \"23\" and then we replace d=2 with \"00\", then map[1] should become \"003\".\n\nBut how do we track that? Well, when we process the query, we can take the current expansion of d (before the substitution) and replace all occurrences of d in other digits' expansions. Wait, no. Because the substitution is to replace all instances of d in the current string. But the current string is built by expanding each digit in the original string according to their current mappings. However, the substitution applies to the current string, which means that all instances of d in the current string (i.e., in the expansions of all digits) are replaced with t.\n\nBut this seems impossible to track unless we can find a way to represent the substitutions in a way that allows for dynamic updates.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of the problem in terms of the final expansion of each digit. When processing the queries, for each substitution, we can update the expansion of the substituted digit, but also update the expansions of other digits that may have included the substituted digit in their expansion.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose:\n\nInitially, map[2] = '2', map[0] = '0'.\n\nFirst query: replace 2 with '00'. So, map[2] becomes '00'.\n\nNow, suppose there's another digit, say, 1, whose expansion was '23'. After this substitution, the expansion of 1 should be '003'.\n\nBut how do we know that? Because the substitution replaces all 2s in the current string with '00's. So, the expansion of 1, which is '23', would be replaced to '003'.\n\nSo, when we process a substitution for d, we need to go through all other digits and replace any occurrence of d in their expansion with the new expansion of d.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when we process the substitution, the substitution is applied to the entire string. So, any occurrence of d in the current string (which is generated by expanding all digits according to their current mappings) will be replaced with t. Therefore, for each digit in the original string, their expansion would be modified as follows: if their expansion contains d, then those parts would be replaced with t.\n\nBut how do we model this in our map?\n\nAh! Here's the key insight: when a substitution is made for a digit d, we need to update all other digits' expansions by replacing all occurrences of d in their expansion with the new expansion of d. Because, after this substitution, any occurrence of d in the current string (which is generated by the expansions of digits) would be replaced with t. Therefore, the expansion of any other digit that had d in their expansion must now have that part replaced with t.\n\nSo, for example, when we replace d with t, we need to update all other digits' expansions by replacing any occurrence of d in their expansion with t. However, this is not exactly correct, because the substitution replaces all occurrences of d in the current string. But the current string is the result of expanding all digits. Therefore, any expansion that includes d in their current expansion would be affected by this substitution.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n- Maintain for each digit d, a string expansion that represents what d is currently replaced with.\n\n- When processing a substitution query (d -> t):\n\n   - For all digits x (from 0 to 9), if x's expansion contains d, then replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t. But wait, no. Because the substitution replaces all d's in the current string with t. So, the expansion of x (which is part of the current string) would have their d's replaced with t. Therefore, x's expansion should be updated to have all d's replaced with t.\n\n   - However, the substitution is for the current string. So, the current expansion of d is being changed from whatever it was (say, old_d_exp) to t. Therefore, any expansion that had d in it would now have their d's replaced with t.\n\n   - Therefore, when processing the substitution, we need to:\n\n      1. Update the expansion of d to be t.\n\n      2. For all other digits x (0-9), check if their expansion contains d. If so, replace all instances of d in their expansion with t.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the substitution is replacing all occurrences of d in the current string. But the current string is built by expanding all digits according to their current mappings. So, the substitution replaces all instances of d in the current string with t. However, the current string is generated by expanding the original string's digits. But for the purpose of maintaining the mappings, we need to ensure that any future expansion of digits (like the original digits) will reflect the substitution.\n\nSo, for example, suppose the original string is '1', and we first replace 1 with '2', then replace 2 with '3'. The final expansion of '1' would be '3'. So, when we process the first substitution (1 -> 2), the expansion of 1 becomes '2'. Then, when processing the second substitution (2 -> 3), we need to update the expansion of 2 to '3', and also check if any other digits have expansions that include 2. For example, if there was another digit 3 whose expansion was '2', then after the substitution, it would be updated to '3'.\n\nBut how do we track that? The idea is that whenever a substitution is made for d, we need to update all other digits' expansions to replace their occurrences of d with the new expansion of d. Wait, but the new expansion of d is t. So, when we process the substitution d -> t, we need to update the expansion of d to t, and then for all other digits x, we need to replace any occurrence of d in x's expansion with t.\n\nYes. Because, for example, if a digit x's expansion was 'd1d2d3', and then we replace d with t, then x's expansion would become t1t2t3 (assuming that d was in the expansion). But that's not accurate. Wait, no. The substitution replaces all instances of d in the current string with t. So, the current expansion of x (which is part of the current string) would have any d's replaced with t. Therefore, the expansion of x must be modified to replace all d's in it with t.\n\nBut in this approach, when we process the substitution, we have to go through all digits x and modify their expansion by replacing d with t. However, this could be expensive if done naively. For example, if we have 10 digits and each substitution requires scanning all 10 digits and modifying their expansions, and each modification takes O(L) time where L is the length of the expansion, then for n substitutions, the total time is O(n * 10 * L_avg). But considering that the sum of lengths of ti across all queries is 1e5, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize for each digit (0-9), their expansion is the digit itself. So, for example, map['0'] = '0', etc.\n\nThen, for each query:\n\n   Parse the query into d and t.\n\n   For the current substitution, we need to replace all occurrences of d in the current string. But since the current string is built by expanding each digit, this implies that for all digits x, their expansion may have d in them. Therefore, we need to update the expansion of x by replacing all instances of d in their expansion with the new t.\n\nWait, but the substitution is to replace all instances of d in the current string. So, the substitution is applied once. But how does that affect the expansions? For example, if the substitution is d -> t, then after this substitution, all instances of d in the current string are replaced with t. Therefore, the expansion of any digit that had d in their expansion must now have those d's replaced with t. Thus, for all digits x, their expansion should be modified to replace all instances of d with t. However, the substitution is applied once, and after that, the expansion of d is now t. So, any future substitutions that refer to d will use the new expansion.\n\nSo, the process for handling a substitution d -> t is:\n\n1. For all digits x (0-9), replace all instances of d in their expansion with t. But wait, no. Because the substitution replaces all instances of d in the current string with t. However, the current string is built by expanding the original digits. So, after this substitution, the expansion of d is now t, and all other digits' expansions must have their d's replaced with t.\n\nBut this seems to imply that when we process the substitution, we need to:\n\n- First, for all digits x, replace their expansion's d with t. Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the substitution replaces all instances of d in the current string with t. The current string's expansion is built by expanding the original digits. However, the substitution is applied to the entire string. So, after substitution, the expansion of d is now t. But any other digits that had d in their expansion would have their expansion modified to replace d with t. Therefore, the steps are:\n\nWhen processing a substitution d -> t:\n\n   For each digit x in 0-9:\n\n      If x is not d, then replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t.\n\n   Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, but why not include d in this? Because, after substitution, the expansion of d is t. So, if we process the substitution, the expansion of d is set to t. However, when we process other digits, their expansion may have d in them, which are replaced with t.\n\nBut for the digit d itself, its expansion is now t, so there's no need to process it again. Because, if we have a substitution d -> t, then after that, the expansion of d is t. So, any future substitutions that involve d would refer to this new expansion.\n\nBut in the case of the substitution, the current expansion of d is being replaced. So, for example, suppose the current expansion of d is 'abc', and we have a substitution d -> 'xyz'. Then, all instances of d in the current string (which includes the expansion of d itself) are replaced with 'xyz'. Therefore, the expansion of d is now 'xyz', and any other digits that had d in their expansion must have their expansion modified to replace d with 'xyz'.\n\nThus, the correct approach is:\n\nWhen a substitution d -> t is processed:\n\n   For each digit x in 0-9:\n\n      Replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t.\n\n   Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, no. Because in the above example, the expansion of d was 'abc' before the substitution. When we replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion (including x=d) with t, then for x=d, we would replace d's expansion with t. But that's redundant because the substitution is d -> t. So, perhaps the steps are:\n\n   For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n      Replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t.\n\n   Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, but that would be redundant. Because, for x=d, the expansion is being replaced with t. Then, we set the expansion of d to t again. So, perhaps the correct steps are:\n\n   For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n      if x's expansion contains d, then replace all d's in it with t.\n\n   Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Because the substitution is to replace all d's in the current string with t. The current string is built by expanding all digits. So, the substitution affects all instances of d in all expansions. Therefore, for each x, we need to replace all d's in their expansion with t. However, the substitution is to replace d with t. Therefore, after this, the expansion of d is t. So, in this case, when we process the substitution, the steps are:\n\n   For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n      replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t.\n\n   Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, but that would be redundant. Because when x is d, the expansion of d would be replaced with t, and then we set it again. So, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n   For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n      replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t.\n\n   Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Because the first step already replaces all d's in x's expansion, including x=d. For example, if x is d, then the expansion of d is replaced with t. So, after that, setting the expansion of d to t again is redundant. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n   For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n      replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t.\n\n   Then, the expansion of d is already set to t, so no need to do anything else.\n\nWait, but initially, the expansion of d is something else. Let's take an example. Suppose the expansion of d is 'old', and we have a substitution d -> 'new'. Then, for all x, we replace d's in their expansion with 'new'. For x=d, this would replace all d's in the expansion of d (which is 'old') with 'new', resulting in 'new' (assuming that 'old' contains d's). But this may not be correct. For example, suppose the expansion of d is 'd', and we have a substitution d -> 'new'. Then, replacing all d's in x's expansion with 'new' would change the expansion of d (x=d) to 'new', which is correct.\n\nSo, the correct steps are:\n\n   For each substitution d -> t:\n\n      For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n         replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t.\n\n      Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, no. Because when we process the substitution, the replacement is done for all x's expansions. But the substitution is to replace all d's in the current string with t. Which includes all instances of d in the current string, which is generated by the expansions of the digits. Therefore, after this replacement, the expansion of d is now t, because any occurrence of d in the expansion of d would be replaced with t. However, if the original expansion of d was something else that didn't contain d, then after replacing all d's in x's expansion with t, the expansion of d would be replaced with t. Wait, no. For example, suppose the expansion of d is 'abc', and there is no d in it. Then, when we process the substitution d -> t, we replace all d's in all x's expansions (including d's expansion) with t. Since there are no d's in d's expansion, nothing changes. Then, we set the expansion of d to t. Which is correct, because the substitution says that d is replaced with t. So, even if the expansion of d was 'abc', after the substitution, the expansion of d should be t. Therefore, the steps are:\n\n   For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n      replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t.\n\n   Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, no. Because after replacing all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t, including x=d, the expansion of d is already updated. For example, if the expansion of d was 'abc', then after replacing all d's in it with t, since there are none, it remains 'abc'. Then, we have to set the expansion of d to t. So, the correct steps are:\n\n   For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n      replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t.\n\n   Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, but that would be wrong. Because, the substitution is to replace all d's in the current string with t. The current string is generated by expanding the digits. So, for example, the current expansion of d is 'abc', which may contain d's (but in this case, it doesn't). However, the substitution is to replace all d's in the current string with t. So, in the current string, any occurrence of d (which is in the original digits, or in the expansions of other digits) would be replaced with t. But the expansion of d is 'abc', which doesn't contain d. Therefore, after the substitution, the expansion of d should be t. Because the substitution replaces all d's in the current string with t. However, the current string's expansion includes the expansion of d, which is 'abc'. But the substitution replaces d's in the current string. So, the d's in the original string (if any) would be replaced with t. However, the expansion of d is 'abc', which is part of the current string. But the substitution replaces all d's in the current string. So, the expansion of d is part of the current string. However, the expansion of d is 'abc' which does not contain d. Therefore, after substitution, the expansion of d is still 'abc', but any occurrence of d in the original string would be replaced with t. But this seems conflicting.\n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe substitution is applied to the entire string. So, the substitution replaces all instances of d in the current string. The current string is generated by expanding all digits in the original string according to their current expansions. So, the substitution replaces all d's in the current string with t. This affects the entire string, which includes all digits in the original string. But how does this affect the mappings?\n\nFor example, suppose the original string is 'd', and we perform a substitution d -> t. The current string is 'd', which is replaced with t. So, the final string is t. Therefore, the expansion of d must be t. Therefore, after the substitution, the expansion of d is t.\n\nAnother example: suppose the original string is 'x', and x's expansion is 'd', and we perform substitution d -> t. The current string is 'd', which is replaced with t. Therefore, the expansion of x should be updated to t. So, in this case, the substitution affects x's expansion.\n\nTherefore, the substitution d -> t implies that any occurrence of d in the current string is replaced with t. The current string is built by expanding all digits in the original string. So, for each digit in the original string, their expansion may contain d, and after substitution, those d's are replaced with t.\n\nThus, the way to model this is that after substitution, for each digit x, their expansion is the result of replacing all d's in their previous expansion with t. Additionally, the substitution replaces the digit d itself with t. Therefore, the steps are:\n\nFor substitution d -> t:\n\n   For each digit x (0-9):\n\n      new_exp_x = replace all occurrences of d in x's current expansion with t.\n\n   Set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, but that would be incorrect. Because after the substitution, the expansion of d is t. However, when we replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t, including x=d, which would have been replaced. So, for example, if x is d, then the previous expansion of d is, say, 'abc', and after replacing all d's in it with t, it's still 'abc' (if there are no d's in it). Then, we set the expansion of d to t. Therefore, this approach would work.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe steps are:\n\nWhen processing a substitution d -> t:\n\n   For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n      temp = current expansion of x\n\n      new_exp = temp.replace(d, t)\n\n      store new_exp as the new expansion for x.\n\n   Then, set the expansion of d to t.\n\nWait, but this would replace all occurrences of d in x's expansion with t. But why do we need to do this for all x? Because the substitution replaces all d's in the current string (which is built by expanding all digits) with t. Therefore, the expansion of each digit x must be modified to have their d's replaced with t. And then, the substitution of d to t is applied, which is already handled by replacing all d's in x's expansions (including x=d).\n\nWait, but if x is d, then after replacing all d's in x's expansion (which is the expansion of d) with t, the new expansion of d would be the previous expansion with d's replaced by t. But the substitution is supposed to replace all d's in the current string with t. So, the expansion of d is part of the current string, and thus any d's in it would be replaced. However, the substitution is to replace d with t, which would mean that the expansion of d should be t. So, in this case, the process of replacing all d's in x's expansion with t (for x=d) would be:\n\nIf the previous expansion of d was 'd', then after replacing all d's with t, it becomes 't', which is correct. But if the previous expansion of d was 'ab', then after replacing d's with t, it remains 'ab', and then we need to set it to t. So, the process of replacing all x's expansions with t's would not be sufficient for the expansion of d. Hence, the steps are:\n\nFor substitution d -> t:\n\n   For all digits x in 0-9:\n\n      new_exp = current_exp[x].replace(d, t)\n\n      store new_exp as current_exp[x]\n\n   Then, set current_exp[d] = t\n\nWait, but that would overwrite the previous replacement. Because when we process x=d, we first replace d's in current_exp[x] (which is d's expansion) with t. Then, after that, we set current_exp[d] to t. So, for example, if the previous expansion of d was 'd', then after the first step (replacing d's in x=d's expansion with t), it becomes 't', and then we set it to t again. So, no problem. If the previous expansion of d was 'abc', then after replacing d's in x=d's expansion (which has none), it's 'abc', then we set it to t.\n\nAh! So the steps are:\n\n1. For all x, replace d's in their expansion with t. This ensures that any occurrence of d in the current string (generated by the expansions) is replaced with t. However, the substitution is to replace d with t. So, the expansion of d should now be t. Therefore, after doing this for all x, we need to set the expansion of d to t. But why?\n\nBecause, in the first step, we replaced all d's in the expansions of all digits with t. However, the substitution is to replace d with t. So, the expansion of d is now t. However, during the first step, if the expansion of d was, say, 'd', then after replacing d's with t, it becomes 't', which is correct. If the expansion of d was 'abc', then after replacing d's in it (there are none), it remains 'abc', and then we need to set it to t. Therefore, the second step is necessary.\n\nWait, but why? Because the substitution is to replace all instances of d in the current string with t. However, the current string includes the original digits. For example, suppose the original string has a digit d. Its expansion is 'abc' (which doesn't contain d). Then, the substitution replaces all d's in the current string with t. But the original string's d is part of the current string. So, the original d would be replaced with t. However, the expansion of d is 'abc', which is part of the current string. But the substitution replaces all d's in the current string, which includes the original d's. So, the expansion of d is not part of the current string except when it's used in other digits' expansions.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Let me think of a concrete example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nOriginal string is 'd'.\n\nInitial expansion for d is 'd'.\n\nQuery: d -> t.\n\nProcessing this query:\n\nStep 1: For all x, replace d's in their expansion with t.\n\nFor x=d, the expansion is 'd', which after replacing d with t becomes 't'.\n\nFor other x, their expansion doesn't contain d, so no change.\n\nThen, step 2: set expansion of d to t. So, after step 1, the expansion of d is already 't', and step 2 does nothing.\n\nFinal expansion of d is 't'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nOriginal string is 'x', where x's expansion is 'd'.\n\nQuery: d -> t.\n\nProcessing this query:\n\nStep 1: For all x, replace d's in their expansion with t.\n\nFor x=x, the expansion is 'd' → replaced with 't'.\n\nFor x=d, the expansion is 'd' → replaced with 't'.\n\nThen step 2: set expansion of d to t. Which is already done.\n\nSo, the expansion of x becomes 't', which is correct. Because the substitution replaces all d's in the current string (which is 'd') with t, so the final string is t.\n\nAnother example:\n\nOriginal string is 'd'.\n\nInitial expansion of d is 'd'.\n\nQuery: d -> 'a'.\n\nThen another query: a -> 'b'.\n\nProcessing first query:\n\nStep 1: replace d's in all x's expansions with 'a'.\n\nFor x=d: expansion is 'd' → replaced with 'a'.\n\nThen step 2: set expansion of d to 'a'.\n\nNow, expansion of d is 'a'.\n\nProcessing second query: a -> 'b'.\n\nStep 1: replace all a's in x's expansions with 'b'.\n\nFor x=d: expansion is 'a' → replaced with 'b'.\n\nFor x=a: expansion is 'a' → replaced with 'b'.\n\nThen step 2: set expansion of a to 'b'.\n\nNow, the expansion of d is 'b', and expansion of a is 'b'.\n\nSo, the original string 'd' would expand to 'b', which is correct. Because first, d is replaced with 'a', then a is replaced with 'b'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nOriginal string is 'x', where expansion of x is 'd'.\n\nFirst query: d -> 'a'.\n\nSecond query: d -> 'b'.\n\nAfter first query:\n\nexpansion of x is 'a'.\n\nexpansion of d is 'a'.\n\nSecond query: replace d with 'b'.\n\nStep 1: replace all d's in x's expansion with 'b'. x's expansion is 'a', which has no d's. So, no change. For x=d, expansion is 'a', which has no d's. So, after step 1, expansion of d is still 'a'.\n\nThen step 2: set expansion of d to 'b'.\n\nSo, now expansion of d is 'b', and expansion of x is still 'a'.\n\nSo, the original string 'x' would expand to 'a', which is correct. Because the substitution d -> 'b' is applied after the first substitution. The original string's x is 'd' which was replaced with 'a' in the first substitution. The substitution d -> 'b' replaces all d's in the current string. However, the current string is generated by expanding the original string, which is x's expansion of 'a'. There are no d's in the current string, so the substitution has no effect. Hence, the expansion of x remains 'a'.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo, the steps for processing the substitution are:\n\nFor each query d -> t:\n\n   For all digits x in",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$.
