Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm. So the initial number of candles is 'a', and each time he burns a candle, it becomes a used one. Then, whenever he has 'b' used candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be burned again, adding to the total hours and eventually more used candles. \n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the total hours and the number of used candles. Let me think about the steps.\n\nLet me take the first example: 4 and 2. \n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He burns them all, which takes 4 hours. Now he has 4 used candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he burns those 2, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used candles. He can make 2 / 2 = 1 new candle. Burn that, adding 1 hour. Now he has 1 used candle. Which is less than 2, so he can't make any more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Start with 6, burn them all (6 hours). Now 6 used. Make 6/3=2 new. Burn those (2 hours). Now 2 used. Can't make any more. Wait, but the output is 8. Wait 6+2=8? Oh right, but wait, after burning the two, he has 2 used. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. So total is 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Each time you burn a candle, it adds 1 hour and gives you one used candle.\n- Whenever you have enough used candles (>=b), you can make new ones. Each new candle is made by taking b used ones, which gives you one new candle. But the number of new candles is floor(used / b). \n\nBut how do we model this? Because after making new candles, those new ones can be burned again, leading to more used ones. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nWait, maybe not. Wait, initially, he has a candles. He uses them all, which gives him 'a' used candles. So the process is:\n\ntotal_hours starts at 0.\n\nWe can think of it as:\n\nEach time, we burn all the available candles. Then collect the used ones, and convert them into new ones. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to model it with a loop. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nWe have a variable 'current_candles' which is the number of candles available to burn. Initially, this is 'a'.\n\nWe also have a variable 'used_candles' which is the number of used candles we have collected. Initially zero.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to track the total hours and the number of used candles. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nEvery time you burn a candle, you get one hour, and add one used candle. \n\nBut when you have enough used candles, you can make new ones. So, the process is:\n\nStart with a candles. Burn them all. So total hours += a. Then, used_candles = a. \n\nThen, while used_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used_candles // b \n\n    total_hours += new_candles \n\n    used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles \n\nRepeat until used_candles < b.\n\nWait, that's probably the way. Let me test with the first example.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total_hours is 0. \n\nFirst step: burn 4 candles. total_hours =4. used_candles=4.\n\nNow, check if used_candles >= b (4 >= 2). Yes.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total_hours +=2 → 6. \n\nused_candles =4%2 + 2 → 0 +2 =2.\n\nAgain, check 2 >=2. Yes.\n\nnew_candles =2//2=1. total_hours +=1 →7. \n\nused_candles =2%2 +1 →0+1=1. Now less than 2. So stop. \n\nTotal is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3. \n\nInitial total_hours is 6. used_candles=6.\n\nCheck 6 >=3. new_candles=6//3=2. total becomes 6+2=8. used_candles=",
