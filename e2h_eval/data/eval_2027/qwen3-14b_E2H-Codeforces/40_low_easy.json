For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we need to compute this modulo a given mod. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's required here. The constraints are n up to 500, which is quite big. So any brute-force approach of generating all permutations is out of the question. For n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way too large. So we need an efficient approach, probably involving dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics.\n\nLet me think about the problem. Let's break it down into parts.\n\nThe total number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q is equal to (total number of permutation pairs) / 2 minus the cases where p equals q. But since p and q are distinct permutations, the total number of ordered pairs where p != q is (n!)^2 - n! (since there are n! permutations). Then, since for each unordered pair {p, q} with p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, the number of ordered pairs where p is lex smaller than q is ( (n!^2 - n! ) ) / 2. However, this might not be directly useful here because we need to consider the inversion counts as well.\n\nBut our problem requires us to count among these pairs where p is lex smaller than q, those where inv(p) > inv(q). Let's denote the number of such pairs as the answer.\n\nNow, considering that for each pair (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). So the total number of pairs where p < q is equal to the sum of these three possibilities. Our answer is the first part.\n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's consider all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Let's suppose that for the entire set, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) if the inversion counts are symmetric. But perhaps not. However, if we can find the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q, then maybe we can find a way to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q. Let's call this T. Then, the answer is equal to the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. Let's denote for each permutation p, its inversion count as inv_p. Let's imagine that we have all permutations sorted in lex order. Now, for each pair (p, q) where p < q, we want to know if inv_p > inv_q.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems challenging. However, perhaps there's a clever observation here.\n\nSuppose we consider all possible pairs of permutations (p, q), regardless of their lex order. Let's denote the number of pairs where inv_p > inv_q as A, and the number where inv_p < inv_q as B, and the number where inv_p = inv_q as C. Since for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of inv_p > inv_q or inv_p < inv_q holds. So A + B = total_pairs - C, where total_pairs is (n!)^2 - n!.\n\nBut since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is considered in the ordered pairs. Now, if we can find A and B, then since in the case of p < q, the number of such pairs where inv_p > inv_q is equal to (A - D)/something? Not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Suppose that for each such pair, exactly one of inv_p > inv_q or inv_p < inv_q holds (assuming that inv_p != inv_q). Then, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv_p > inv_q is equal to the number of pairs where p < q and inv_p < inv_q if the inversion counts are symmetric. But that's only true if for every pair {p, q}, exactly one of the two conditions holds, and the lex order is independent of inversion counts. Which is not necessarily the case",

Answer is (T - C) // 2 mod mod\n            # But division by 2 mod mod requires that mod is odd, but in the problem statement mod can be even. So we need to handle this carefully.\n            # Wait, the problem says that mod may not be a prime. So division by 2 is only possible if mod is coprime with 2. But since we are working modulo mod, perhaps we can compute (T - C) multiplied by the modular inverse of 2 modulo mod. However, if mod is even, then 2 may not have an inverse. But in this case, (T - C) must be even because T is (n! * (n! - 1))//2, which is an integer. Similarly, C is sum (c_k choose 2), which is also an integer. Thus, (T - C) is an integer, and hence (T - C) is even. Therefore, (T - C) // 2 is an integer, and we can compute it modulo mod by multiplying by the inverse of 2 modulo mod if it exists, or by checking if the value is even and dividing accordingly.\n            # However, in Python, we can compute (T - C) // 2 as (T - C) divided by 2 using integer division.\n            # But since we're working modulo mod, we need to compute (T - C) mod (2*mod), then divide by 2, then take mod again.\n            # But this might complicate things. Alternatively, we can compute (T - C) as a value, then divide by 2, and then take mod mod.\n            # However, since the actual value of T and C is computed modulo mod, we can't directly compute (T - C) // 2 mod mod unless we have the exact value of (T - C) modulo 2*mod. This seems complicated.\n            # So perhaps we should compute T and C as integers, then compute (T - C) // 2 mod mod.\n            # But for n up to 500, the number of permutations is 500! which is a very large number. So computing T and C directly is impossible due to their size.\n            # Therefore, we need to compute (T - C) mod (2*mod), then divide by 2.\n            # But how to compute T and C mod 2*mod? Well, let's proceed.\n            # So first, compute fact[n] mod (2*mod), then compute T mod (2*mod). Similarly for C.\n            # However, this approach may be computationally feasible.\n            # But for n up to 500, the factorial is huge. However, we can compute fact[n] mod (2*mod) using modular arithmetic.\n            # Let me re-express the steps:\n            # Compute fact_n = n! mod (2*mod)\n            # Compute T = (fact_n * (fact_n - 1) // 2) mod (2*mod)\n            # Compute sum_c = sum (dp[n][k] * (dp[n][k] - 1) // 2) mod (2*mod)\n            # Then answer = ((T - sum_c) // 2) mod mod\n            # However, how to compute dp[n][k] for all k?

For each k, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q) is (c_k * (c_k - 1)) // 2. And for each such unordered pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) is exactly (c_k * (c_k - 1)) // 2\n            # Therefore, C is sum_{k} (c_k choose 2)\n            # Thus, the answer is (T - C) // 2\n            # So first compute T = (fact[n] * (fact[n] - 1)) // 2\n            # Then compute C = sum_{k} (c_k * (c_k - 1) // 2)\n            # Then answer = (T - C) // 2\n            # But how to compute fact[n] modulo mod?\n            # So the problem reduces to computing fact[n], and the sum of c_k choose 2 for all k\n            # So the key steps are:\n            # 1. Compute the number of permutations of n elements with k inversions, for all k (this is dp[n][k])\n            # 2. Compute fact[n] = n! mod mod\n            # 3. Compute T = (fact[n] * (fact[n] - 1) // 2) mod mod\n            # 4. Compute C = sum (dp[n][k] * (dp[n][k] - 1) // 2) for all k\n            # 5. Answer is (T - C) // 2 mod mod\n            # But division by 2 mod mod requires that mod is odd, but in the problem statement mod can be even. So we need to handle this carefully.\n            # Wait, the problem says that mod may not be a prime. So division by 2 is only possible if mod is coprime with 2. But since we are working modulo mod, perhaps we can compute (T - C) multiplied by the modular inverse of 2 modulo mod. However, if mod is even, then 2 may not have an inverse. But in this case, (T - C) must be even because T is (n! * (n! - 1))//2, which is an integer. Similarly, C is sum (c_k choose 2), which is also an integer. Thus, (T - C) is an integer, and hence (T - C) is even. Therefore, (T - C) // 2 is an integer, and we can compute it modulo mod by multiplying by the inverse of 2 modulo mod if it exists, or by checking if the value is even and dividing accordingly.\n            # However, in Python, we can compute (T - C) // 2 as (T - C) divided by 2 using integer division.\n            # But since we're working modulo mod, we need to compute (T - C) mod (2*mod), then divide by 2, then take mod again.\n            # But this might complicate things. Alternatively, we can compute (T - C) as a value, then divide by 2, and then take mod mod.\n            # However, since the actual value of T and C is computed modulo mod, we can't directly compute (T - C) // 2 mod mod unless we have the exact value of (T - C) modulo 2*mod. This seems complicated.\n            # So perhaps we should compute T and C as integers, then compute (T - C) // 2 mod mod.\n            # But for n up to 500, the number of permutations is 500! which is a very large number. So computing T and C directly is impossible due to their size.\n            # Therefore, we need to compute (T - C) mod (2*mod), then divide by 2.\n            # But how to compute T and C mod 2*mod? Well, let's proceed.\n            # So first, compute fact[n] mod (2*mod), then compute T mod (2*mod). Similarly for C.\n            # However, this approach may be computationally feasible.\n            # But for n up to 500, the factorial is huge. However, we can compute fact[n] mod (2*mod) using modular arithmetic.\n            # Let me re-express the steps:\n            # Compute fact_n = n! mod (2*mod)\n            # Compute T = (fact_n * (fact_n - 1) // 2) mod (2*mod)\n            # Compute sum_c = sum (dp[n][k] * (dp[n][k] - 1) // 2) mod (2*mod)\n            # Then answer = ((T - sum_c) // 2) mod mod\n            # However, how to compute dp[n][k] for all k? The previous code has an error in the DP setup. Let me correct that.\n            # Let's re-implement the DP correctly.\n            # The correct recurrence for the number of permutations of length i with j inversions is:\n            # dp[i][j] = sum_{k=0}^{min(j, i-1)} dp[i-1][j-k] \n            # because inserting the new element into position k (from 0 to i-1) adds k inversions.\n            # So the previous code's DP is incorrect. Let me fix that.\n            # So the code needs to be rewritten to correctly compute dp[i][j].\n            # Let's rework the code from scratch.\n\n    # Correct DP setup\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    dp = [[0] * (max_inv + 1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[1][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        for j in range(max_inv + 1):\n            for k in range(min(i-1, j) + 1):\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j - k]\n                dp[i][j] %= mod\n\n    # Now compute fact[n] mod (2*mod)\n    fact = [1] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % (2 * mod)\n\n    T = fact[n] * (fact[n] - 1) // 2\n    T_mod_2mod = T % (2 * mod)\n\n    # Compute C = sum over k (dp[n][k] * (dp[n][k] - 1) // 2)\n    sum_c = 0\n    for k in range(max_inv + 1):\n        c = dp[n][k]\n        sum_c += c * (c - 1) // 2\n        sum_c %= (2 * mod)\n\n    answer = (T_mod_2mod - sum_c) // 2\n    answer %= mod\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
