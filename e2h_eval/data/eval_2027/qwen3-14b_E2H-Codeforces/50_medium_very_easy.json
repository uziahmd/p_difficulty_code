    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nSo, a good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, each edge is part of two vertices' products. So for every vertex, the product of its adjacent edges is -1.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what constraints this imposes on the tree structure and edge weights. Let me think about the implications.\n\nLet me consider the product condition. For each vertex, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's denote that for vertex i, product_{edges incident to i} weight = -1.\n\nBut since each edge connects two vertices, each edge's weight contributes to the product of both endpoints. So, if I take the product of all these products for all vertices, what would that be?\n\nEach edge's weight is multiplied exactly twice (once for each endpoint). So the total product over all vertices' products is (product of edge weights)^2. But each vertex's product is -1, so the total product is (-1)^n. Therefore:\n\n(product of edge weights)^2 = (-1)^n.\n\nBut since each edge's weight is ±1, the product of all edge weights squared is 1. So 1 = (-1)^n. Which implies that n must be even? Wait, no. Because (-1)^n must equal 1. Therefore, this equation holds only when n is even. Otherwise, there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, that suggests that for odd n, there are no good trees. Because if n is odd, then (-1)^n is -1, but the left side is 1. So that's impossible. Therefore, for odd n ≥ 1, the answer is zero?\n\nBut looking at the sample input, for n=2 (even), the answer is -1 mod MOD. For n=1, the output is zero. Wait, n=1: the tree has zero edges. But the condition says for each vertex i, product of edges incident to it is -1. But vertex 1 has zero edges. The product of zero numbers is 1? Or is it undefined? Wait, the problem says \"each edge is either 1 or -1\", but for a single node, there are no edges. So the product for that vertex would be 1 (since the product over an empty set is 1). But the condition requires that product to be -1. So for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is zero, which matches the second sample input where n=1 gives output 0.\n\nSo, this suggests that for n odd, the answer is zero. Because when n is odd, the product of all vertex products is (-1)^n = -1, but the left side is 1. Contradiction. Hence, no good trees. Therefore, for any odd n ≥ 1, the answer is zero.\n\nWait, but n=1 is odd, and indeed there are no good trees. For n=3, same thing. So, the first thing to check is whether n is even. If n is odd, output zero. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo for even n, we need to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nNow, assuming n is even. How do we proceed?\n\nLet me think about the conditions again. Each vertex's product of incident edges is -1. Let me consider the tree structure. Let's think about the product for each vertex. For example, in a tree with n nodes, each node has degree ≥ 1 (since it's a tree, except for n=1). Wait, for n ≥ 2, each node has degree ≥ 1.\n\nBut the product of the edges around each node is -1. Let me think about the degrees. Suppose that for a node with degree k, the product of the edge weights is -1. Since each edge is ±1, the product is -1. So, the number of edges with -1 incident to that node must be odd. Because product of numbers ±1 is -1 iff there are an odd number of -1s.\n\nSo for each node, the number of edges with weight -1 incident to it is odd. That's a crucial observation.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting all possible trees (structure and edge weights) where:\n\n- The tree is a normal tree (so structure is any possible tree on n nodes).\n\n- For each node, the number of edges incident to it with weight -1 is odd.\n\nAdditionally, the edge weights are ±1.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nMoreover, for each tree structure, how many valid edge weight assignments are there?\n\nBut the problem says that we have to consider all such trees (structure and edge weights) that are good, and sum d(1,n) over them.\n\nBut perhaps we can find some way to model the constraints and find the sum.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each node, the number of edges with -1 is odd. Let me think of this as a system of equations. Let me denote for each edge e, a variable x_e ∈ {1, -1}. Then, for each node v, the product of x_e for all edges e incident to v is -1. Taking the product over all edges incident to v, which equals -1. But since each x_e is ±1, the product is -1 iff the number of -1s is odd.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the product of all x_e for edges incident to v, that equals -1. So, for each node v, the product of x_e (over edges incident to v) is -1.\n\nBut since the product of all edges incident to v is -1, taking the logarithm isn't helpful here. Alternatively, maybe take the product of all such equations across all nodes. But earlier we saw that this leads to a contradiction unless n is even. Which is already handled.\n\nNow, considering that the problem requires us to compute the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees. Let me think about what d(1, n) represents. It's the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n. So, for each tree, we have to calculate this sum and add them all up.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that for each good tree, the edge weights are constrained by the product conditions. So, perhaps we can find the number of good trees, and then find the expected value of d(1,n) multiplied by the number of good trees. But perhaps there's a clever way to compute the sum directly.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 5e5, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each node, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. Let me think of the entire tree. Let me consider the product of all these equations. For each node, the product of its incident edges is -1. Multiply all those equations together. On the left side, each edge is multiplied twice (once for each endpoint). So the total product is (product of x_e^2) for all edges. Since x_e is ±1, x_e^2 is 1. Therefore, the product is 1. On the right side, we have (-1)^n. Therefore, (-1)^n must equal 1, which implies that n is even. Which aligns with our previous conclusion. So for even n, there are possible good trees, otherwise not.\n\nSo, for even n, we can proceed.\n\nNow, the key question is: for even n, how many good trees are there, and what is the sum of d(1,n) over them?\n\nBut perhaps the number of good trees is something manageable, and the sum can be computed via linearity of expectation or similar techniques.\n\nBut first, let's think about the constraints. For a given tree structure, how many valid edge weight assignments are there?\n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. Each edge can be assigned a ±1, but with the constraints that for each node, the product of its incident edges is -1.\n\nLet me consider the variables x_e for each edge e. Let me take the product for each node. For example, for node v, the product of x_e (for edges incident to v) equals -1. Let me take the product of all such equations. As before, we get that (-1)^n = 1, which holds for even n.\n\nBut how to count the number of solutions to this system of equations?\n\nThe system is over the multiplicative group {1, -1}, but perhaps it's easier to take logs and convert into additive equations modulo 2.\n\nLet me take the logarithm (in multiplicative terms). Let me map each x_e to a variable y_e ∈ {0, 1}, where y_e = 0 corresponds to x_e = 1, and y_e = 1 corresponds to x_e = -1. Then, the product of x_e for edges incident to v is -1. Taking log (but in additive terms), the sum of y_e (mod 2) for edges incident to v must be 1. Because:\n\nproduct x_e = (-1)^{sum y_e} = -1 → sum y_e ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nTherefore, for each node v, the sum of y_e over edges incident to v is 1 mod 2.\n\nThis is a system of linear equations over GF(2). The variables are the edges, and each equation corresponds to a node.\n\nNow, the system is:\n\nFor each node v, sum_{e incident to v} y_e = 1 mod 2.\n\nBut how many solutions does this system have?\n\nThe system has n equations (one per node) and m = n-1 variables (edges in a tree). However, since the tree is connected, the sum of all equations is equal to the sum over all nodes of the sum of their incident edges. Each edge is counted twice (once per endpoint). Therefore, the sum of all equations is 2 * sum y_e ≡ 0 mod 2. But the sum of the RHS is n * 1 mod 2. Which must be equal to 0 mod 2. Which is true only if n is even. Which is the case here.\n\nTherefore, the system is consistent for even n, and the rank of the system is n-1. Because the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, which is the same as the sum of the RHS. So the system has rank n-1. Hence, the number of solutions is 2^{m - (n-1)} } = 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? Wait, m is n-1 variables, and the rank is n-1, so the number of solutions is 2^{number of variables - rank} } = 2^{ (n-1) - (n-1) } = 1. So there's exactly one solution for the system of equations for a given tree structure?\n\nWait, that seems surprising. Let me think again. For a given tree structure, how many ways are there to assign the y_e (i.e., edge weights) such that for each node, the sum of y_e around it is 1 mod 2?\n\nIf the system has rank n-1, then the number of solutions is 2^{number of variables - rank} }, which is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1. So there is exactly one solution for each tree structure. Therefore, for each tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights to satisfy the constraints. Wait, that's a big insight!\n\nSo, for any given tree structure, there's exactly one possible assignment of edge weights (±1) that satisfies the product condition for all nodes. Therefore, the number of good trees is equal to the number of possible tree structures multiplied by 1. So, the number of good trees is n^{n-2} (the number of trees) multiplied by 1. But wait, no. Because for each tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign the edge weights. Therefore, the total number of good trees is equal to the number of tree structures (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1. So, for even n, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2}.\n\nWait, but the sample input for n=2: the number of trees is 1 (since 2^{0} = 1). And the sample says there is exactly 1 good tree. Which matches. For n=4, the number of trees is 4^{2} = 16. And the sample says there are 16 good trees. Which matches the third sample input. So yes, this seems correct.\n\nSo, the key takeaway is that for each tree structure, there is exactly one valid edge weight assignment that makes it a good tree. Therefore, the problem reduces to: for each tree structure, compute d(1,n) under the unique edge weight assignment that satisfies the conditions, and sum all these values over all tree structures.\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nNow, the challenge is to find the sum over all trees of d(1,n) under their unique edge weight assignment.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think about the edge weight assignment for a given tree.\n\nLet me recall that the edge weights are determined uniquely by the constraints. So, for a given tree, the edge weights are determined by the system of equations. Let's think about solving this system.\n\nLet me think of the equations again. For each node v, sum_{e incident to v} y_e = 1 mod 2. Where y_e is 0 or 1 (representing edge weight 1 or -1).\n\nThis is a system of equations. Since the tree is connected and the system is consistent (for even n), there is exactly one solution. How can we find this solution?\n\nLet me think of the system as follows. Each equation is the sum of variables (y_e) around a node equals 1 mod 2.\n\nBut this system is similar to finding a Eulerian circuit, but perhaps not. Alternatively, think of it as finding a vector y that satisfies the equations.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equations as requiring that each node has an odd degree in the subgraph formed by edges with y_e = 1. Because each y_e is 1 if the edge is -1, and 0 otherwise. The sum of y_e for edges incident to v is the number of edges with -1 weight incident to v, which must be odd. Therefore, the system requires that each node has an odd degree in the subgraph of edges with weight -1.\n\nBut since the tree is a connected graph, and each node has odd degree in this subgraph, the subgraph must have an even number of nodes with odd degree. But since all nodes have odd degree, the number of nodes is even. Which holds because n is even.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nWell, the subgraph of edges with weight -1 must have all nodes with odd degree. But since the tree is connected, and the subgraph is a collection of edges (possibly disconnected), but with all nodes having odd degree. However, for a graph to have all nodes with odd degree, the number of nodes must be even, which is satisfied here.\n\nBut how to find such a subgraph?\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this. For example, since the tree is connected, and the subgraph has all nodes with odd degree, this subgraph must have exactly n nodes with odd degree, which is even. So, the subgraph is a collection of edges such that each node has odd degree. But how to find such a subgraph?\n\nBut perhaps the solution is to choose any spanning tree (which is the tree itself) and assign the edges in such a way that each node has odd degree. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the system of equations. Let me pick a root for the tree, say node 1. Then, perhaps perform some kind of traversal and assign the variables accordingly.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose I have a tree rooted at node 1. For each node, except the root, there's a parent edge. Let me assign variables for the edges in such a way that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nFor example, for the root node (node 1), the sum of its incident edges' y_e must be 1 mod 2. Suppose I have children of the root. For each child, there's an edge between the root and the child. Let me assign the variables for these edges in a way that allows the constraints to be satisfied.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Since the system of equations is over a tree, and the system has exactly one solution, perhaps we can find a way to express the variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me consider the system of equations again. Let me imagine that for each node, the sum of the y_e for edges incident to it is 1 mod 2. Let me think of the tree as a graph. Since it's a tree, it has no cycles, so the equations are independent except for the dependency that the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2.\n\nBut how to solve this system? For example, suppose we pick a root, and for each node except the root, we can determine the value of the edge between the node and its parent.\n\nLet me think of the root as node 1. For each node v, let me define the edge from v to its parent as e_v. Then, the equation for node v (assuming it's not the root) can be used to determine the value of e_v, based on the values of the other edges incident to v. However, since v is a leaf (if we consider the parent edge), then for a leaf node, the only edge is the parent edge. So for a leaf node, the equation is e_v = 1 mod 2. Which would set e_v = 1. But then, for the parent node, this contributes to its equation.\n\nWait, this seems like a possible approach. Let me try to formalize it.\n\nLet me build the tree as a rooted tree with root at node 1. For each node v, except the root, there is a parent p(v). Let me consider the edge between v and p(v) as e_v. Now, for each node v (excluding the root), the equation for v is sum_{edges incident to v} y_e = 1 mod 2. The edges incident to v are e_v (to the parent) and the edges to its children. However, if we process the tree in a bottom-up manner, perhaps we can determine the variables.\n\nBut this seems complex. Alternatively, since the system has a unique solution, perhaps we can find that the value of each edge depends on the parity of the number of nodes in some subtree. Or perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of the system as follows: Let me consider that the equations for all nodes except the root can be used to determine the variables, and the root's equation is dependent. For example, suppose I have n-1 equations (for all nodes except the root) and solve them, and then the root's equation will automatically be satisfied due to the consistency.\n\nLet me try that. Let me choose the root as node 1. For each node v ≠ 1, I can write the equation for v as follows: the sum of y_e for edges incident to v is 1 mod 2. Let me assume that for each node v ≠ 1, we can express the edge between v and its parent (say, e_v) in terms of the other edges. However, since the other edges are not yet determined, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for each node v ≠ 1, the equation is:\n\nsum_{children edges} y_e + y_{e_v} = 1 mod 2.\n\nBut if we can determine the children edges first, then we can solve for y_{e_v}.\n\nBut this seems like a recursive approach. Let's think of the tree as rooted and process it in post-order traversal. For each node, after processing all children, we can determine the value of the edge between the node and its parent.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose node v is a leaf (other than the root). Its only edge is the one connecting it to its parent. The equation for node v is y_e = 1 mod 2. Therefore, y_e = 1. So the edge between v and its parent is assigned 1 (i.e., weight -1).\n\nThen, for the parent of v, which has other children, we can process similarly.\n\nLet me take a small example. Suppose the tree is a chain: 1-2-3-4. Root is 1. Let's process the tree.\n\nNode 4 is a leaf. Its equation is y_3 (edge between 3 and 4) = 1 mod 2. So y_3 = 1.\n\nNode 3 has edges to 2 and to 4. The equation for node 3 is y_2 (edge between 2 and 3) + y_3 = 1 mod 2. Since y_3 is 1, this implies y_2 = 0 mod 2. So y_2 = 0 (edge weight 1).\n\nNode 2 has edges to 1 and to 3. Equation: y_1 (edge between 1 and 2) + y_2 = 1 mod 2. y_2 is 0, so y_1 = 1 mod 2. So y_1 = 1 (edge weight -1).\n\nFinally, node 1 has edges to 2. The equation is y_1 = 1 mod 2. Which is satisfied (y_1 is 1). So the system is satisfied.\n\nIn this case, the edge weights are:\n\nEdge 1-2: -1 (y=1)\n\nEdge 2-3: 1 (y=0)\n\nEdge 3-4: -1 (y=1)\n\nSo the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4. The sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nBut according to the sample input for n=4, in the third test case, the sum over all trees is -10. But for this particular tree, the d(1,4) is -1. However, there are 16 trees, and the sample says that sum is -10.\n\nBut how does this relate to our current approach?\n\nThe key idea is that, for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined, and we need to find the sum of d(1,n) across all trees. However, for large n, enumerating all trees is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mathematical formula or combinatorial approach to compute this sum.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the contribution of each edge to the total sum. For each edge e, what is the total contribution of e's weight to all d(1,n) across all good trees?\n\nBecause d(1,n) is the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n. So for each tree, the sum is the sum of the weights of edges on the path from 1 to n. Therefore, the total sum over all trees is equal to the sum over all edges e of (number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n) multiplied by the expected weight of e in those trees.\n\nBut since for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined, we can think of the total sum as the sum over all edges e of (number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n) multiplied by the weight of e in that tree.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight of each edge is determined by the system of equations, perhaps there's a way to find for each edge e, what is the value of its weight in the unique assignment, and then multiply that by the number of trees where e lies on the path from 1 to n.\n\nBut how to find the weight of e in the unique assignment?\n\nLet me think back to the system of equations. For each tree, the edge weights are determined uniquely. So, for a given tree, the weight of each edge depends on the structure of the tree. However, perhaps there's a pattern based on the position of the edge in the tree.\n\nLet me think again of the rooted tree approach. When we processed the tree with root 1, for each node v, the edge between v and its parent had a certain value. Perhaps there's a relationship between the depth of the node and the value of the edge.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the system of equations again. For each node, the sum of the y_e (for edges incident to it) is 1 mod 2. Let me think of the entire tree as a graph and consider that the variables y_e are determined uniquely.\n\nLet me consider that the system of equations can be solved by choosing any spanning tree (which is the tree itself) and assigning variables in a way that satisfies the equations. But how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the system of equations as a linear system. Since it's a tree, the system is connected. For the system of equations, the solution is unique. Let me think of the solution as follows: the variables are the edges. The equations are that the sum of variables around each node is 1 mod 2.\n\nLet me think of this as a system where the variables are the edges and the equations are for each node. For a tree, the system is connected and has a unique solution.\n\nBut how to find this solution?\n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. Let me imagine that I fix the value of all variables except one, and then solve for the last variable. However, this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the system as follows. Since the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, and the system has a unique solution, we can choose any variable to be free, but since the system has full rank (n-1), there are no free variables. So, the solution is uniquely determined.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider the following idea. Let me imagine that I have a tree, and I want to assign the variables y_e such that each node has an odd number of -1 edges (i.e., y_e = 1). Let me consider that for each node, the number of -1 edges incident to it is odd. This is equivalent to saying that the number of edges with y_e = 1 is odd for each node.\n\nNow, consider that the entire tree is a graph. The sum of degrees in the subgraph formed by edges with y_e = 1 is equal to twice the number of edges in the subgraph. But since each node has odd degree, the sum of degrees is n (since each contributes 1 mod 2, but the actual sum is sum_{v} deg(v) = 2 * |E_sub|, which is even. Since n is even, this is possible.\n\nBut how to construct such a subgraph?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an Eulerian trail, but not exactly. Alternatively, since the degrees are all odd, the subgraph must consist of a collection of cycles and paths. But since the original graph is a tree, which has no cycles, the subgraph can't contain cycles. Therefore, the subgraph is a collection of paths, and each node has degree 1 or 3 or ... but since it's a tree, the subgraph can't have cycles. So the subgraph must be a collection of paths where each node is an endpoint of an odd number of paths. But since each node has odd degree, it must be an endpoint of an odd number of paths. However, in a tree, the subgraph of edges with y_e = 1 is a forest of paths (since no cycles). Each path contributes two endpoints with degree 1, and the rest of the nodes in the path have degree 2 (even). But this contradicts the requirement that all nodes have odd degree. Hence, this suggests that the subgraph must consist of a collection of paths where each node is an endpoint of exactly one path. Which is only possible if the subgraph is a collection of paths where each node is in exactly one path and is an endpoint of that path. This implies that the subgraph is a matching of paths, each of length 1 (i.e., edges), but that would make each node have degree 1. However, this would require that the number of edges in the subgraph is n/2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, this line of thinking may not be helpful. Let me return to the earlier approach of solving the system.\n\nLet me think of the tree as rooted at node 1. For each node v, let me define the value of the edge between v and its parent as follows. Let me assume that for all children of v, their edges have been determined. Then, for node v, the equation is:\n\nsum_{edges incident to v} y_e = 1 mod 2.\n\nThe edges incident to v are:\n\n- The edge to its parent (say e_p).\n\n- The edges to its children (say e_1, e_2, ..., e_k).\n\nAssume that we have determined the values of e_1, e_2, ..., e_k. Then, the equation becomes:\n\ny_p + sum_{i} y_i = 1 mod 2.\n\nSolving for y_p, we get:\n\ny_p = 1 - sum_{i} y_i mod 2.\n\nThus, for each node, once the values of its children's edges are known, the value of its edge to the parent can be determined. This suggests a post-order traversal approach to compute the values of the edges.\n\nLet me try this approach for the earlier example of the chain 1-2-3-4.\n\nRooted at 1. Process the tree in post-order:\n\nProcess node 4 (leaf). It has no children. So sum of children edges is 0. So y_p (edge to parent, which is node 3) is 1 - 0 = 1 mod 2. So y_3 (edge between 3 and 4) is 1.\n\nThen process node 3. Its children are node 4. Sum of children edges is 1. So y_p (edge to parent, node 2) is 1 - 1 = 0 mod 2. So edge between 2 and 3 has y=0.\n\nProcess node 2. Its children are node 3. Sum of children edges is 0. So y_p (edge to parent, node 1) is 1 - 0 = 1 mod 2. So edge between 1 and 2 has y=1.\n\nFinally, node 1 has no parent. Its equation is sum of its edges (only the edge to node 2, which is 1) equals 1 mod 2. Which is satisfied.\n\nSo the edge values are as before.\n\nNow, for this tree, the path from 1 to 4 includes edges 1-2 (y=1), 2-3 (y=0), 3-4 (y=1). The sum is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2? Wait, no. Wait, the d(1,4) is the sum of the edge weights. But the edge weights are -1 if y_e=1, and 1 if y_e=0. So for the edge 1-2: y=1 → weight is -1. Edge 2-3: y=0 → weight 1. Edge 3-4: y=1 → weight -1. Sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nNow, the question is: for a general tree, how does the edge weight of an edge e depend on the structure of the tree?\n\nLet me think recursively. For a node v, the value of the edge between v and its parent is determined by the sum of the values of the edges to its children. Let me denote for each node v, the value of the edge between v and its parent as w(v). Then, the value of w(v) is 1 - sum_{children u of v} w(u) mod 2.\n\nWait, no. Earlier, the equation for node v is:\n\nw(v) + sum_{children u} w(u) = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo, solving for w(v):\n\nw(v) = 1 - sum_{children u} w(u) mod 2.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. For leaves (except root), they have no children. So their w(v) is 1 - 0 = 1 mod 2. For internal nodes, it depends on their children.\n\nNow, the question is: for each edge e between node v and its parent p(v), what is the value of w(v) (which is the y_e for that edge)?\n\nOnce we know this, we can compute the weight of each edge as -1 if w(v) is 1, and 1 otherwise.\n\nBut how does this help us compute the sum over all trees of d(1,n)?\n\nLet me think about the contribution of each edge to the total sum. For a given tree, the d(1,n) is the sum of the weights of edges on the path from 1 to n. So, for each edge e, if it lies on the path from 1 to n in the tree, then its weight contributes to the sum. So, for all trees, we need to find for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the weight of e in that tree.\n\nBut since for each tree, the weight of e is determined by the structure of the tree, this seems challenging. However, perhaps there's a way to find for each edge e, the expected value of its contribution to d(1,n) across all trees, multiplied by the number of trees.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each tree, the path from 1 to n is unique. So, for each tree, the contribution of edge e is its weight multiplied by an indicator variable of whether e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nThus, the total sum is the sum over all trees T of [sum_{e on path from 1 to n in T} weight(e in T)].\n\nWhich is equal to the sum over all edges e of [weight(e in T) × (number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n in T)] summed over all trees T.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me denote for an edge e, let C(e) be the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. And let W(e) be the weight of e in the unique assignment for that tree. Then, the total sum is sum_e C(e) × W(e).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing for each edge e, the value of C(e) × W(e), and summing over all possible edges e.\n\nBut how to compute C(e) and W(e)?\n\nFirst, let's think about C(e). For a given edge e, how many trees on n labeled nodes include e and have it on the path between 1 and n?\n\nBut the total number of trees is n^{n-2}. For a given edge e between nodes u and v, the number of trees containing e is n^{n-3} × 2 (wait, no. Cayley's formula says that the number of trees containing a specific edge is n^{n-3} × 1? Or is there another way to calculate it?)\n\nActually, the number of trees on n labeled nodes that contain a specific edge (u, v) is n^{n-3} × 1. Because, according to Cayley's formula, the number of trees containing a specific edge is n^{n-3} × 1. Here's why: consider that the number of trees on n nodes is n^{n-2}. For any specific edge, the number of trees containing it is (n-1)^{n-3} × 1? No, I think there's a formula for this.\n\nThe number of trees on n labeled nodes that contain a specific edge can be calculated by considering that the edge is part of the tree. To count this, we can think of the tree as being formed by connecting two subtrees. Specifically, removing the edge (u, v) splits the tree into two subtrees. However, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, there's a well-known result that the number of trees containing a specific edge is n^{n-3} × 1. Because, for example, the number of trees on n nodes is n^{n-2}. The number of trees containing a specific edge is (n-1)^{n-3} × 2? No, I'm not sure. Let me think of it differently.\n\nLet me use the fact that the number of trees containing a specific edge can be found using Prüfer sequences. In a Prüfer sequence, each edge is represented in a certain way. But perhaps it's easier to think of the number of trees that contain edge (u, v) as follows: consider that the edge (u, v) is present in the tree. Then, the tree is formed by connecting u and v, and the rest of the tree is formed by adding n-2 edges. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the total number of trees is n^{n-2}. The number of trees that contain edge (u, v) is equal to the number of ways to form a tree where u and v are connected. Let me think of the number of trees where u and v are connected. But that's all trees, since they are connected. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps we can think of the number of trees containing a specific edge (u, v) as follows. Consider that the tree is a spanning tree. If we contract the edge (u, v), we get a tree on n-1 nodes. The number of trees on n-1 nodes is (n-1)^{n-3}. However, each such tree corresponds to a tree on n nodes that contains the edge (u, v). So the number of trees containing edge (u, v) is (n-1)^{n-3} × 1? Or is it multiplied by",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distances between nodes 1 and n in all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, where each vertex's product of incident edge weights is -1. The solution involves leveraging combinatorial properties and modular arithmetic to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: A good tree has edges with weights ±1 such that the product of weights of edges incident to each vertex is -1. For odd values of n, no such trees exist, so the result is zero.\n2. **Tree Structure and Edge Weights**: For even n, each tree structure has exactly one valid edge weight assignment that satisfies the conditions.\n3. **Path Contribution Calculation**: For each tree, the distance from node 1 to node n is the sum of weights along the unique path between them. We need to compute this sum across all valid trees.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using properties of trees and combinatorics, we determine the contribution of each edge to the total sum based on its position in the tree and the number of trees where it lies on the path from node 1 to node n.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # For even n >= 2\n    # The answer is (n-1) * (-1)^{something} multiplied by some combinatorial factor?\n    # From the sample, when n=2: answer is -1 mod MOD\n    # When n=4: answer is -10 mod MOD\n    # Looking for a pattern: Let's think about the formula.\n    \n    # After analysis, the sum is (-1) * (n-1) * (n^{n-2}) / something?
