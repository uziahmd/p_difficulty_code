    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the task is to find two things for a given p: the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph, and then among all such graphs with that minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly p-reachable means. The problem says that a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Wait, so for each pair u < v, if they can reach each other, that contributes 1 to p. So the total count of such pairs is exactly p.\n\nSo the first part is to find the minimal number of nodes n such that there exists a directed graph with exactly p such pairs. Then, among all such graphs with that minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's consider that for a graph with n nodes, the maximum number of pairs (u, v) with u < v that are mutually reachable is C(n, 2), which is when every pair is mutually reachable. But that's only possible if the graph is strongly connected. However, maybe for some structures, like a DAG with certain components, we can have different counts.\n\nBut the key here is that the p-reachable condition requires exactly p such pairs. So the problem reduces to finding the minimal n where the maximum possible number of such pairs is at least p, but perhaps we can structure the graph in a way that exactly p pairs are mutual.\n\nWait, but how do we model the minimal n? Let me think of the possible ways to arrange the nodes to get exactly p mutual pairs. For example, if we have a set of nodes arranged in a strongly connected component (SCC), then all pairs within that component contribute to the count. If there are multiple SCCs, then pairs between different components don't contribute unless there's a path both ways between them, which would require that they are in the same component.\n\nWait, no. If two nodes are in different components, say A and B, and there's a path from A to B but not vice versa, then they aren't mutually reachable. So mutual reachability implies that the nodes are in the same strongly connected component. Therefore, the number of mutual pairs is the sum over each SCC of C(k, 2), where k is the size of the component.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find a collection of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m such that sum_{i} C(k_i, 2) = p, and the total number of nodes is sum k_i, and this sum is minimized. Because each component contributes C(k_i, 2) to the p value.\n\nSo the first part of the problem reduces to finding the minimal sum of k_i's where the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals p. And then, for that minimal sum, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, but how do we find the minimal n? Let me think. For example, if p is 3, then the possible options are:\n\nOption 1: one component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3). Sum is 3 nodes. That's minimal.\n\nAnother option would be, say, a component of size 2 (C(2,2)=1) and another component of size 2 (another 1), and then another component of size 2 (another 1). Total sum is 6, which is worse than 3. So the minimal n is 3.\n\nSo the problem is to split p into a sum of C(k_i, 2) terms, such that the sum of k_i is as small as possible.\n\nSo the first step is to find the minimal n such that there exists a decomposition of p into sum C(k_i, 2) where sum k_i is minimized.\n\nNow, how to find that decomposition?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of representing p as the sum of triangular numbers, but with the goal of minimizing the sum of their bases.\n\nThe triangular numbers here are C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2. So for each term, we want to choose as large as possible k's to minimize the sum of k_i's. Because larger k's contribute more to the sum of C(k,2) per unit of k. For example, using a single component of size k gives C(k,2) = p. The sum of k_i is k. So for a given p, the minimal n is achieved by choosing the largest possible k_i's.\n\nWait, but how to split p into such terms. Let's think of the optimal way to split p into sum of C(k_i, 2) terms. To minimize the sum of k_i, we should maximize the individual C(k_i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine two key values for a given integer $ p $: the minimum number of nodes required to construct a $ p $-reachable directed graph and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understanding Reachability**: A $ p $-reachable graph is defined by having exactly $ p $ ordered pairs of nodes $(u, v)$ where $ u < v $ and both nodes are mutually reachable. This mutual reachability implies that these nodes must be in the same strongly connected component (SCC).\n\n2. **Triangular Numbers Insight**: The number of mutual pairs in a component of size $ k $ is given by the triangular number $ \\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} $. To minimize the number of nodes, we should maximize the size of each component contributing to the sum of triangular numbers that equals $ p $.\n\n3. **Decomposition Strategy**: For a given $ p $, decompose it into the sum of triangular numbers such that the sum of their bases (component sizes) is minimized. This involves using the largest possible components first.\n\n4. **Unidirectional Pairs Calculation**: Once the minimal number of nodes is determined, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs can be calculated based on the structure of the components and their interconnections.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    # Find minimal n\n    n = 0\n    remaining = p\n    while remaining > 0:\n        k = 1\n        while (k * (k - 1)) // 2 <= remaining:\n            k += 1\n        k -= 1\n        n += k\n        remaining -= (k * (k - 1)) // 2\n\n    # Now calculate max unidirectional pairs\n    # We need to find the decomposition of p into C(k_i, 2)\n    # For the minimal n, which is the sum of k_i's\n    # Then, the max unidirectional pairs is total_pairs - 2*p\n    # Where total_pairs is C(n, 2) - sum(C(k_i, 2)) + sum(C(k_i, 2)) ?\n\n    # Wait, the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1)\n    # The number of mutual pairs is p (from the problem statement)\n    # The number of unidirectional pairs is total_pairs - 2*p\n    # Because each mutual pair contributes to both (u,v) and (v,u), but they are not counted here.\n    # Wait, no. The problem defines unidirectional as (u,v) where u != v, there's a path from u to v but not vice versa.\n    # So the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1)\n    # From these, subtract the mutual pairs (each mutual pair is counted twice, once as (u,v) and once as (v,u)), so 2p\n    # But also subtract the pairs that are not reachable at all. Hmm, this seems complex.\n    # However, according to the note in the example, when p=3 and n=3, the number of unidirectional pairs is 0. Let's check:\n    # n=3, total ordered pairs (u,v) with u != v is 6. If all are mutual, then p=3 (since C(3,2)=3). The unidirectional pairs would be 6 - 2*3 = 0. Which matches the example.\n    # So the formula for the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is total_ordered_pairs - 2*p, where total_ordered_pairs is n*(n-1).\n    # But wait, that assumes that all non-mutual pairs are unidirectional. Which may not be true if there are pairs that are not reachable at all. But in the optimal configuration for maximizing unidirectional pairs, we arrange the components such that all non-mutual pairs are unidirectional.\n\n    # Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is n*(n-1) - 2*p\n\n    max_unidirectional = n * (n - 1) - 2 * p\n    print(f\"{n} {max_unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single integer $ p $.\n\n2. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The algorithm iteratively finds the largest possible component size $ k $ such that the triangular number $ \\binom{k}{2} $ does not exceed the remaining value of $ p $. This ensures the minimal number of nodes by using the largest components first.\n\n3. **Calculating Unidirectional Pairs**: The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is derived from the total number of ordered pairs of nodes (excluding self-loops) minus twice the number of mutual pairs (since each mutual pair contributes to both directions).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required values using properties of triangular numbers and ensures optimal performance for large inputs.",
