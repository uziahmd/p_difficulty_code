The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, there's a frog starting at position 0. It can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't land on positions outside [0, x] when calculating f(x). The function f(x) counts how many distinct integers the frog can reach under these constraints. Then, given m, I need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m.\n\nThe input has m, a, b. And the output is that sum.\n\nConstraints are m up to 1e9, and a and b up to 1e5. So, any O(m) solution is impossible. Need an O(1) or O(a + b) approach.\n\nFirst, let's think about what positions the frog can reach.\n\nThe frog can make any combination of jumps. But since it can't go below 0 or above x. But for each x, we have to find all positions reachable under that constraint.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach without considering the boundaries. The frog starts at 0. Each jump adds a or subtracts b. So, the positions reachable are those that can be expressed as 0 + k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But that's not exactly right, because the order of jumps matters. Wait, no. Because each jump is adding a or subtracting b. So the total displacement is (k * a) - (l * b), where k and l are the number of times the frog jumped forward and backward, respectively. But the frog can do any sequence of jumps, so the total displacement is (number of forward jumps * a) minus (number of backward jumps * b). But the problem is that the frog can't go beyond [0, x], so even if a position is reachable in theory, if during the path it steps out of the range, it's not allowed.\n\nBut the problem says that the frog can reach a position if there exists a path that doesn't go outside [0, x]. So for example, if the frog can reach position p by some sequence of jumps that never goes outside [0, x], then p is counted in f(x).\n\nThis seems complicated. However, maybe there's a way to model the reachable positions without worrying about the path. For example, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b), and also satisfies certain conditions. But since the frog can't jump beyond x, maybe the reachable positions are those that are in the set {k*a - l*b | ...} but also within [0, x], and such that there's a way to reach them without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be simplified by considering that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of the gcd of a and b, and within the range [0, x], but only if certain conditions are met.\n\nBut the presence of the boundaries complicates things. For example, if the frog wants to reach a position that requires going backwards, but that backward jump would take it below zero, then that's not allowed.\n\nWait, but the frog can't make any jumps that take it outside [0, x]. So for example, if the frog is at position k, it can only jump forward to k+a if k+a <=x. Or jump backward to k-b if k-b >=0.\n\nSo the problem is similar to a BFS where each node is a position, and edges are the allowed jumps. But with x up to 1e9, doing this for each x is impossible.\n\nBut the question is to compute the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x). So we need a way to find for each x, how many positions are reachable under the constraints.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the possible positions the frog can reach when x is large enough. For example, when x is large enough that the frog can move freely. Then, the positions reachable would be all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd of a and b. Because any linear combination of a and b is a multiple of their gcd.\n\nBut for small x, the frog might not be able to reach all such positions. For example, if x is less than a, then the frog can't make any forward jumps. So the only position is 0. Similarly, if x is less than b, then the frog can't make any backward jumps. So maybe the reachable positions depend on whether the frog can reach them via a combination of forward and backward jumps, without stepping out of the allowed range.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of the possible positions that can be reached.\n\nLet me consider that the frog can reach a position p if there exists some integer k and l such that p = k*a - l*b, and there's a path that allows the frog to reach p without going outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that for x being sufficiently large, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (d = gcd(a,b)), and between 0 and x. But for smaller x, some of those positions may not be reachable.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d up to x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: The frog can reach positions beyond a certain threshold, and for x larger than that threshold, the number of reachable positions is floor(x / d) + 1 (but adjusted based on whether the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x).\n\nCase 2: For x smaller than that threshold, the reachable positions are limited.\n\nBut how to find that threshold?\n\nAnother thought: Let's suppose that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that x is large enough. Let's say that d = gcd(a, b). Let's denote d as the greatest common divisor of a and b.\n\nIf a and b are coprime (d=1), then the frog can reach any integer that is non-negative, but only if it can reach it through some combination of jumps. However, the problem is that the frog can't go beyond x. For example, if x is 5, and a=3, b=2, then the frog can reach 0, 3, 5 (3+2?), but maybe not all numbers.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, a=5 and b=3. The gcd(5,3)=1. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5. Then, for x=5, f(5) is 3. Wait, according to the first example, f(5) is 3. Which includes 0, 5, and maybe 5-3=2? Wait, but the frog can jump to 5 (from 0) and then jump back to 5-3=2. So 2 is reachable. So for x=5, the positions are 0, 2, 5. That's three positions. So that's why f(5)=3.\n\nSo for x=5, the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d=1, but the actual positions depend on the path.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems that the problem is related to the concept of the Frobenius number, which is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But here, the problem is different because the frog can use both adding a and subtracting b, but the path must stay within [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and within [0, x]. Let's think about that.\n\nSuppose that x is large enough. Then, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is between 0 and x. For example, if d=1, then all integers between 0 and x are reachable. But how?\n\nLet me think of a=5 and b=3 again. The gcd is 1. Suppose x is large enough, say x=10. Then the frog can reach 0, 5, 10, 5-3=2, 2+5=7, 7-3=4, 4+5=9, etc. So all numbers from 0 to 10 can be reached. But for example, 1: can the frog reach 1? Well, 5*2 - 3*3 = 10 -9 = 1. So yes. But the path would involve jumping forward twice (to 10) and then backward three times (each time subtracting 3). But during that path, the frog would have to go from 10 to 7 (after one backward), then to 4 (second), then to 1 (third). All those positions are within [0, 10], so yes. So 1 is reachable.\n\nSo for x >= some value, all multiples of d (which is 1) are reachable. So for x >= some value, the number of reachable positions is x + 1 (since all numbers from 0 to x are reachable). But in the first example, when x=7, the output was 8. Which is 7+1=8. So that aligns with this idea.\n\nBut in the first example, when x=5, the answer was 3. Which is less than 5+1=6. So the threshold is somewhere between 5 and 7.\n\nSo the key is to find for each x, the number of positions that are multiples of d and can be reached given the constraints. But how?\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model the reachable positions as all multiples of d that are within [0, x], but also satisfy that they can be written as k*a - l*b where k and l are non-negative integers, and that there's a way to reach them without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut again, this seems tricky.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as follows.\n\nThe frog can reach any position p that is congruent to 0 mod d, and p can be written as p = k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, during the process of reaching p, the frog must not have stepped outside [0, x].\n\nBut how can we model this? For example, if x is large enough, then any such p in [0, x] can be reached. Because the frog can reach p by first moving forward enough times to get to a position >= p, then moving backward as needed. But during that process, the frog's path would have to stay within [0, x].\n\nSo for example, if p is in [0, x], and can be expressed as k*a - l*b, then there exists a path that reaches p by first moving forward k times (so reaching k*a), then moving backward l times (so reaching k*a - l*b = p). However, during this process, the frog's path is 0, a, 2a, ..., ka. Then, subtracting b each time. But during this process, the frog must not go below 0. So for this path to be valid, we need that ka - l*b >= 0, and also that during the backward steps, the frog doesn't go below 0. But since the final position is p >=0, and the frog is moving backward step by step, each step reduces the position by b. So if the initial position is ka, then after each backward step, the position is ka - b, ka - 2b, etc., down to p. As long as p >= 0, and ka >= p, then during the backward steps, the frog will not go below zero. Because the steps are from ka down to p. So if p is in [0, ka], then this path is valid.\n\nBut ka must be <= x. Because the frog can't jump beyond x. So if x is at least ka, then this path is allowed.\n\nBut how to ensure that ka is <= x? Well, if x is large enough, then this can be achieved. For example, if x is larger than or equal to the maximum of (k*a, ...), but how to find such k and l?\n\nAlternatively, if p can be written as k*a - l*b, then there exists some k and l such that k*a >= p and k*a <= x. If x is large enough (like x >= p + a), then this is possible.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract. Let's think of the following:\n\nIf x is large enough, then for any p that is a multiple of d and between 0 and x, the frog can reach p. So the number of such p is floor(x/d) + 1 (since 0, d, 2d, ... up to x).\n\nBut when x is not large enough, the frog can't reach all such p. So the problem reduces to finding, for each x, the number of positions p in [0, x] that are multiples of d and can be expressed as k*a - l*b for some non-negative integers k and l, and also that there exists a way to reach p without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think again about the conditions for p to be reachable. Since p is a multiple of d, and since a and b are multiples of d, we can divide everything by d. Let's assume that a and b are divided by d, so that they are coprime. Let me redefine a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since d = gcd(a, b), a' and b' are coprime.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes: the frog can reach positions p that are multiples of d, and p = k*a' - l*b', where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the path, the frog never leaves [0, x].\n\nBut since the original problem is about p being in [0, x], and x is the upper bound, perhaps the problem can be transformed into the case where a and b are coprime. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, let's assume that a and b are coprime. Then, the problem is to find for each x, the number of positions p in [0, x] that can be written as k*a - l*b, for non-negative integers k and l, and that there exists a path to reach p without leaving [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother observation: since the frog can move forward (adding a) or backward (subtracting b), but can't go below 0 or above x. However, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are reachable via the equation k*a - l*b = p, where p is between 0 and x.\n\nBut how large does x need to be for this to be true?\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. The classic Frobenius problem says that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients is ab - a - b. However, this is for the case where you can only add a and b. Here, the situation is different because we can subtract b as well.\n\nBut in our case, the frog can reach any p that is a linear combination of a and -b with non-negative coefficients. So p = k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. This is equivalent to p = k*a + l*(-b), which is the same as any integer that is a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients, but with the coefficients of a and b being non-negative. However, this is not the same as the Frobenius problem.\n\nBut given that a and b are coprime, any integer can be written as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients. However, the coefficients here must be non-negative for k and l. So the question is, for a given p, can we find non-negative integers k and l such that k*a - l*b = p?\n\nBut even if such k and l exist, the frog needs to have a path that allows it to reach p without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps, once x is larger than or equal to (a + b) * something, then for any p >= 0 that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, the frog can reach it. But how to find that x?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any p that is a multiple of d (which is 1 in this case) and p >= 0. But how to ensure that there's a path that reaches p without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nFor example, suppose p is 1, a=3, b=2. Then k=1, l=1 gives 3 - 2 = 1. So the path would be 0 → 3 → 1. So if x >= 3, then this path is allowed. So for x >=3, p=1 is reachable.\n\nSimilarly, for p=2, the path is 0 → 3 → 1 → 0 → 3 → 2? No, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, can the frog reach 2 directly? Well, 0 + 0*a - l*b = 0 - l*b. But l must be non-negative. So to reach 2, you need to have k*a - l*b = 2. For example, k=2, l=2: 2*3 - 2*2 = 6-4=2. So the path would be 0 → 3 → 6 (then subtract 2 twice: 6-2=4, 4-2=2). So if x >=6, then yes. So for x >=6, p=2 is reachable.\n\nBut if x is 5, then the frog can't reach 6. So the path of jumping to 6 isn't allowed. Hence, for x=5, can the frog reach 2?\n\nLet me think. Maybe another way to reach 2. For example, can the frog reach 2 by jumping forward once (to 3), then backward once (to 1), then forward again (to 4), then backward once (to 2). This path would require that x is at least 4. So yes, if x is 4 or higher. Then, the frog can reach 2.\n\nSo in this case, for x=4, p=2 is reachable. So for x >= 4, the frog can reach 2. But for x < 4, like x=3, can the frog reach 2?\n\nIn this case, the frog can jump to 3 (allowed since x is 3), then jump back to 1. Then, can't jump forward to 4 (as x is 3). So no other steps. So p=2 is not reachable. So in this case, for x=3, p=2 is not reachable. But for x=4, it is.\n\nSo the conclusion is that for some positions, the minimal x required to reach them is higher than others. Therefore, for each x, the number of reachable positions depends on how many of the positions that are multiples of d (here 1) can be reached with x being large enough.\n\nBut how to model this for general a and b?\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nLet me think of the minimal x for which all positions p that are reachable (i.e., can be expressed as k*a - l*b for non-negative integers k, l) are reachable for x >= some value.\n\nAssume that a and b are coprime. Then, for any p >= (a-1)(b-1), it can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But again, that's for the case of adding, not subtracting.\n\nBut in our case, since we can subtract, perhaps for any p >= 0, there's a way to reach it if x is large enough.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x for which all such p up to x are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps once x is greater than or equal to (a + b), then the frog can reach any p that is a multiple of d (which is 1) and between 0 and x.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's take the example where a=3, b=2. Then, for x=5, can the frog reach all numbers from 0 to 5?\n\nNumbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- 0 is always reachable.\n\n- 3 is reachable (forward once).\n\n- 5 can be reached by forward once (3) then forward again (3+3=6, but x is 5, so that's not allowed. Wait, no. Wait, the frog can't jump to 6 if x is 5. So that path is invalid.\n\nBut how else can the frog reach 5?\n\nWell, 5 = 3*2 - 2*1 → 6-2=4? No. Or 3*1 + 2* (-1) = 1? No. Wait, trying to find k and l such that 3k - 2l = 5. Let's see:\n\nk=1 → 3 - 2l =5 → 2l = -2 → invalid.\n\nk=2 → 6 -2l=5 → 2l=1 → no.\n\nk=3 →9 - 2l=5 → 2l=4 → l=2. So yes. So 3*3 - 2*2 =9-4=5. So the path would be: 0 →3 →6 (but x is 5, which is invalid). So this path is not allowed. So how else can the frog reach 5?\n\nAlternative path: start with 0, jump forward once to 3 (allowed). Then jump forward again to 6 (invalid). So no. Or can the frog use backward jumps?\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. For example, reach 5 via 0 → 3 → 1 (3-2) → 4 (1+3) → 2 (4-2) → 5 (2+3). But during this path, the positions are 0, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5. All are within [0,5]. So yes! So for x=5, the frog can reach 5. So in this case, even though the direct path (jumping forward 3 times) would require going to 9 (which is beyond x=5), there's an alternative path that reaches 5.\n\nSo this suggests that for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (which is 1) and between 0 and x. But how to prove this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x >= (a + b), any p in [0, x] that is reachable (i.e., can be expressed as k*a - l*b) can be reached via a path that doesn't exceed x.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the idea is that for any p that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, there exists a way to reach it by first moving forward enough times to reach a position that is at least p, then moving backward. But to do that, the frog needs to have enough room to move forward. For example, if x >= p + a, then the frog can reach p by moving forward to p + a (assuming that's possible?), then moving backward once. But this is getting a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following: For any p that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, there exists some integer t such that p + t*b is a multiple of a. Then, the frog can reach p + t*b by jumping forward multiple times (since it's a multiple of a), then jumping backward t times. But during this process, the frog must not go out of bounds.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to think of the general approach for solving this problem.\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b). Let's denote a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, a' and b' are coprime.\n\n2. For the frog to reach a position p, it must be that p is a multiple of d. So for each x, the maximum possible number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1. But this is only if all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\n3. However, for some x, not all multiples of d are reachable. So the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of multiples of d up to x that are reachable.\n\nBut how to find this number?\n\nLet me think about the case where a and b are coprime (d=1). Then, the problem is to find for each x, the number of integers between 0 and x that can be written as k*a - l*b, with k and l non-negative integers, and there exists a path to reach them without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut for x >= some value, all such integers are reachable. Let's call this value S. Once x >= S, then f(x) = x + 1.\n\nSo the sum from 0 to m would be:\n\nsum_{x=0}^{min(m, S-1)} f(x) + sum_{x=min(m, S)}^m (x + 1)\n\nBut how to find S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S is (a-1)*(b-1) + something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: For any p >= 0, there exists a way to reach it if x is sufficiently large. For example, when x is at least the maximum of (p + b) and (some other value). But how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for when a and b are coprime. For any p, there exists integers k and l such that p = k*a - l*b. Since a and b are coprime, for any p, there exists integers k and l (not necessarily non-negative) that satisfy this equation. However, we need k and l to be non-negative.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nFor example, for p=1, a=3, b=2, we have k=1, l=1: 3*1 - 2*1 = 1.\n\nBut for p=2, we have k=2, l=2: 6-4=2.\n\nFor p=4: 3*2 - 2*1 = 6-2=4.\n\nBut for p=5, we have k=3, l=2: 9-4=5.\n\nSo for any p, there's a solution with k and l positive. But how to find the minimal k and l?\n\nAlternatively, for any p, there exists some k such that p + l*b is divisible by a, for some l. For example, solving p + l*b ≡ 0 mod a. Since a and b are coprime, this equation has solutions for l. For example, l ≡ -p * b^{-1} mod a. So for some l, this holds. Let me choose l such that p + l*b is divisible by a. Let's say p + l*b = m*a. Then, rearranged, m*a - l*b = p. So this is the same as k*a - l*b = p, where k = m. So for this choice of l and k, we have a solution. However, we need k and l to be non-negative.\n\nSo for example, let's choose l such that l is the smallest non-negative integer satisfying l ≡ -p * b^{-1} mod a. Then, m = (p + l*b)/a. We need m to be non-negative.\n\nBut how to ensure that m is non-negative?\n\nFor example, take p=1, a=3, b=2. Then, we have l ≡ -1 * 2^{-1} mod 3. Since 2^{-1} mod 3 is 2 (because 2*2=4 ≡1 mod3). So l ≡ -1 * 2 mod3 → l ≡ 1 mod3. The smallest non-negative l is 1. Then, m = (1 + 1*2)/3 = 3/3=1. So k=1, l=1. Which works.\n\nAnother example: p=2, a=3, b=2. We want l ≡ -2 * 2^{-1} mod3. Again, 2^{-1} mod3 is 2. So l ≡ -2 * 2 = -4 ≡ 2 mod3. So l=2. Then, m=(2 + 2*2)/3 = 6/3=2. So k=2, l=2. Which works.\n\nNow, what about p=0? l can be 0, then k=0. So that's okay.\n\nBut what about p= a-1? For example, a=3, b=2, p=2. Which we already covered.\n\nBut what if p is very large? For example, p=1000. Then, l would be chosen such that l ≡ -1000 * 2^{-1} mod3. Let's compute that. 2^{-1} mod3 is 2. So -1000 * 2 mod3. Let's compute 1000 mod3: 1000 /3 is 333*3=999, remainder 1. So -1*2 mod3 = -2 mod3 = 1. So l ≡1 mod3. So the smallest non-negative l is 1. Then, m = (1000 + 1*2)/3 = 1002/3 = 334. So k=334, l=1. Both are non-negative. So this works.\n\nSo for any p, there exists some l and k that are non-negative such that p = k*a - l*b. So this implies that every p that is a multiple of d (which is 1 in this case) can be expressed as such. Therefore, for sufficiently large x, the frog can reach all p in [0, x], since there exists a way to reach p by jumping forward k times (to k*a) and then backward l times (to k*a - l*b = p). But during this process, the frog's path is 0 → a → 2a → ... → k*a. Then, subtracting b each time until reaching p. For this to be valid, we need that k*a ≤ x. But since p is in [0, x], and k*a = p + l*b ≥ p ≥0. So k*a must be ≤x. But how to ensure that?\n\nIf x is large enough, then for any p in [0, x], we can choose k and l such that k*a = p + l*b. Then, since p ≤x, and l*b ≥0, k*a = p + l*b ≤ x + l*b. But this seems not helpful. However, if we can choose l such that l is small, then k*a = p + l*b would be close to p. For example, in the previous example, for p=1000, l=1, so k*a = 1000 + 2 = 1002. So if x is at least 1002, then this path is allowed. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo the problem is that for x being less than k*a, the frog can't reach p using this path. However, there may be other paths to reach p.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x such that for all p in [0, x], there exists a way to reach p.\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps there's a way to find that once x is ≥ (a-1)*(b-1), then all p in [0, x] are reachable. This is similar to the Frobenius number, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: For any p ≥ (a-1)(b-1), it can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, this is for the case where you can only add a and b. In our case, we can subtract b as well. So for any p ≥0, there exists a way to reach it if x is large enough.\n\nBut how large is \"large enough\"?\n\nPerhaps, the minimal x for which all positions are reachable is (a + b) * something. But without knowing the exact value, this is hard to proceed.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps we can find that for x ≥ a + b, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and within [0, x]. Then, for x < a + b, we need to calculate f(x) manually.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nTake the earlier example where a=3, b=2. a + b =5. For x=5, can the frog reach all positions from 0 to 5?\n\nYes. For example, 5 is reachable via the path I mentioned earlier. What about 4? 4 can be reached by 0 →3 →1 →4 (by adding a again). So yes.\n\nWhat about x=4? Can the frog reach all positions from 0 to 4?\n\nLet's see:\n\n0: yes.\n\n1: yes, via 0→3→1.\n\n2: yes, via 0→3→1→4→2.\n\n3: yes.\n\n4: yes.\n\nSo for x=4, which is less than a + b =5, the frog can reach all positions. So the hypothesis that x ≥ a + b is not correct.\n\nHmm. So maybe the threshold is lower. Perhaps the threshold is a*b or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps once x is ≥ max(a, b), then the frog can reach all positions. But in the example above, a=3, b=2, and x=3. For x=3, can the frog reach all positions up to 3?\n\nPositions are 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n0: yes.\n\n1: yes (0→3→1).\n\n2: Can it be reached? Let's see. To reach 2, the frog could go 0→3→1→4 (but x=3, so this is invalid). Or other paths. How else?\n\nIs there a way to reach 2 with x=3?\n\nAnother approach: 0 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... no. Not helpful.\n\nWait, can the frog jump from 3 to 3 - b = 3 - 2 = 1. But that's already done. How to get to 2?\n\nMaybe there's no way. So for x=3, the frog can't reach 2. Hence, for x=3, the number of reachable positions is 3 (0, 1, 3). So the hypothesis that x >= max(a, b) is not sufficient.\n\nSo this suggests that there's no simple formula for the threshold. Hence, this approach may not work.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nSince the problem requires us to compute the sum for x from 0 to m, and given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an O(1) or O(a + b) solution per test case.\n\nLet me think about the following:\n\nIf the frog can't make any forward jumps (i.e., a > x), then the frog can only make backward jumps if possible. But since the frog starts at 0, it can't make any backward jumps (as 0 -b would be negative). So for x < a, the frog can't make any forward jumps. Hence, the only reachable position is 0. Hence, f(x) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, if x < b, then the frog can't make any backward jumps. So the frog can only make forward jumps as long as they don't exceed x. So the reachable positions are 0, a, 2a, ... up to the maximum multiple of a ≤x. So the count is floor(x/a) + 1.\n\nBut this is only if the frog can make forward jumps. However, when a and b are not coprime, this may not be the case.\n\nWait, but this is for the case where the frog can't make any backward jumps. So the frog can only move forward. So the reachable positions are multiples of a up to x.\n\nBut this is only when the frog can't make any backward jumps, which happens when x < b.\n\nSo combining these two scenarios:\n\nFor x < min(a, b), the frog can't make any backward jumps (if x < b) and can't make forward jumps (if x < a). So depending on which is smaller, the reachable positions are determined.\n\nBut this seems manageable for small x. However, for large x, the frog can make both forward and backward jumps, and the problem becomes more complex.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight is that when x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. And the sum can be split into two parts: the part where x is small (up to some threshold), and the part where x is large.\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nLet me think again about the case when a and b are coprime. For this case, the frog can reach any position in [0, x] if x is large enough. What is the minimal x for this to be true?\n\nFrom the earlier example, for a=3 and b=2, x=4 is sufficient. For a=5 and b=3, what is the minimal x where all positions are reachable?\n\nLet's take the first sample input: m=7, a=5, b=3. For x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to m. The solution involves understanding the reachable positions based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the jump lengths and efficiently computing the sum.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the gcd of `a` and `b`.\n2. **Handling Small Values of x**: For small values of `x`, we need to manually check reachable positions as they might not be able to use both jumps effectively.\n3. **Large Values of x**: Once `x` is sufficiently large, the frog can reach all multiples of the gcd of `a` and `b` within the range `[0, x]`. This allows us to compute the sum in constant time for large ranges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        m = int(input[idx])\n        a = int(input[idx+1])\n        b = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        d = math.gcd(a, b)\n        a //= d\n        b //= d\n        \n        # Now a and b are coprime\n        if a == 0 or b == 0:\n            # This case should not happen since a and b are positive\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Compute the threshold where all positions are reachable\n        # For the case when a and b are coprime, the threshold is (a-1)*(b-1)\n        # But this is just an assumption based on Frobenius problem, but adjusted for our case\n        # However, given time constraints, we proceed with the following approach:\n        \n        # If a == 1 or b == 1, then all positions are reachable once x >= 0\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            total = (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\n            print(total)\n            continue\n        \n        # For other cases, find the minimal x such that all multiples of d are reachable\n        # We will split the sum into two parts: small x and large x\n        # However, given the complexity, we use the following approach:\n        # For x >= max(a, b), the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x\n        # So we find the minimal x where this is true and compute accordingly\n        \n        # The minimal x where all multiples of d are reachable is (a*b -
