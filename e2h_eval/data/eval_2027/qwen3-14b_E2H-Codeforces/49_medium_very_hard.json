They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about restoring the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the GCD and LCM values given for each road (edge) between two lawns (vertices). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Each edge connects two lawns, and for that edge, we have the GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts on those two lawns. Our task is to assign numbers to each lawn such that all these conditions are satisfied. If it's not possible, we return NO.\n\nLet me think about the properties of GCD and LCM. For two numbers a and b, we know that GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So for each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we have that a_u * a_v = g * l. Also, since GCD(a_u, a_v) is g, both a_u and a_v must be multiples of g. Let me denote a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y. Then, the LCM of a_u and a_v would be g * LCM(x,y). But since the LCM is given as l, we have g * LCM(x,y) = l. Which implies that LCM(x,y) = l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime (because we divided by their GCD), because LCM(x,y) = x*y when x and y are coprime. Therefore, x*y = l/g. \n\nSo for each edge, the product of x and y must be l/g, and x and y are coprime. So for each edge, the possible pairs (x, y) are coprime pairs whose product is l/g. However, since the actual values of a_u and a_v are determined by g*x and g*y, we need to assign these x and y values in a way that is consistent across the entire graph.\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node has a value (a_i) and edges enforce certain relationships between pairs of nodes. The challenge is to assign values to all nodes such that all edges' constraints are satisfied.\n\nHmm. How can we model this? Maybe as a graph where each node's value is determined by some relations. Since each edge gives us a relation between two nodes, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations or constraints. But how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as building a graph where each connected component must have values assigned in a way that satisfies the constraints. For example, if two nodes are connected by an edge, their values must be multiples of the GCD and satisfy the LCM condition. But how to model this?\n\nWait, considering that for each edge, the two nodes must have values a and b such that GCD(a,b) = g and LCM(a,b) = l. Which also implies that a and b are multiples of g, and that l must be a multiple of g. Because LCM(a,b) is a multiple of both a and b, which are multiples of g. So for each edge, the given LCM must be a multiple of the given GCD. Otherwise, it's impossible. For example, if the GCD is 2 and the LCM is 3, then 2*3 = a*b, but since GCD is 2, a and b are multiples of 2, so a*b must be divisible by 4, but 2*3=6 isn't. Therefore, in such a case, the answer is NO.\n\nSo first, for each edge, check if LCM is divisible by GCD. If not, output NO. Wait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed that the original numbers were valid, but when we have the current edges, maybe they are invalid? Like, suppose someone inputs a GCD and LCM where LCM is not a multiple of GCD. Then our code should output NO.\n\nSo first step: for each edge, check if l % g != 0. If yes, then it's impossible. So we can immediately return NO.\n\nOnce that's done, for each edge, we can compute the product of the two numbers as g*l. And since a and b are multiples of g, we can write a = g * x, b = g * y, and then x and y must be coprime, and x*y = l/g. So for each edge, the product of x and y is (l/g). Also, since x and y are coprime, their product is equal to their LCM. Which makes sense because LCM(x,y) = x*y when they are coprime.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning variables x_i to each node, such that for each edge (u, v) with g and l, the product of x_u and x_v is (l/g), and x_u and x_v are coprime.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because for each edge, the product of x_u and x_v is fixed, and they must be coprime. \n\nThis seems like a constraint that can be modeled as a bipartitioned graph, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as a graph where each node's x_i must be a factor of some product, and for each edge, the product of x_u and x_v is fixed. However, since x_u and x_v are coprime, they cannot share any common factors. Therefore, for each edge, the x_u and x_v must be coprime and their product is known.\n\nThis seems similar to building a graph where each connected component must have variables assigned such that for each edge, the product of variables is fixed and they are coprime. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the variables x_i. Suppose we have a connected component. For each node in the component, the x_i must be such that for every edge in the component, the product of x_i and x_j is fixed. But since the product is fixed, and the variables are coprime, perhaps there's a way to assign values based on the edges.\n\nLet me consider a connected component. Let's pick a root node and assign a value to it. Then, for each adjacent node, we can determine the value based on the edge's product. But since x_i and x_j must be coprime, we have to make sure that when we assign x_j, it doesn't share any factors with x_i.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have an edge between u and v with product p = x_u * x_v. Since x_u and x_v are coprime, then x_u must be a divisor of p, and x_v must be p/x_u. But since they are coprime, x_u and x_v must be coprime. Therefore, for each edge, the pair (x_u, x_v) must be a pair of coprime divisors of p, such that their product is p.\n\nSo, for example, if p is 6, then possible pairs are (1,6) and (6,1), (2,3), (3,2). But since x_u and x_v are coprime, these are the only possibilities. However, when building the graph, if there are multiple edges connected to a node, the assignments must be consistent.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be modeled as a graph where each edge imposes that the product of x_u and x_v is fixed. However, since x_u and x_v are coprime, once you assign x_u, x_v is determined as p / x_u. But the problem is that when there are multiple edges connected to a node, the assignments must agree.\n\nFor example, suppose node u is connected to node v with product p1, and node u is connected to node w with product p2. If we assign x_u = a, then x_v must be p1/a, and x_w must be p2/a. But then, when considering the edge between v and w, if such an edge exists, the product of x_v and x_w must be p3, which is the product for that edge. So, (p1/a) * (p2/a) must equal p3. Therefore, (p1*p2)/a² = p3 → a² = (p1*p2)/p3. Which must be a square. So, unless that's the case, the assignment is impossible.\n\nThis seems complex. How can we model this?\n\nAnother approach: since x_u and x_v are coprime and their product is known, then the variables x_i can be considered as part of a bipartition. For example, if we have a tree structure, we can assign x_i values starting from a root and propagating through the tree. However, if the graph has cycles, then the assignments must be consistent with the cycle's constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each connected component is a bipartition graph. Wait, but why? Because for each edge, x_u and x_v are coprime. But that doesn't directly imply a bipartition. However, considering that x_u and x_v are coprime, and x_u * x_v = p (for that edge), then x_u must be a divisor of p and x_v must be p/x_u. But for other edges connected to u, say between u and w, the product is q. Then, x_u * x_w = q. Since x_u is already determined, x_w is q/x_u. However, x_u and x_w must be coprime. So, q/x_u must be coprime with x_u. Which implies that x_u must divide q, and that x_u and q/x_u are coprime. Which is equivalent to saying that x_u must be a divisor of q, and that x_u and q/x_u are coprime. Which implies that x_u is a divisor of q and that x_u is square-free? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the x_i variables must be such that for any two nodes connected by an edge, their x_i's are coprime. But that's already part of the problem's constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is as follows:\n\nEach connected component in the graph must be handled separately. For each component, we can choose a starting node and assign a value to it. Then, for each neighbor, we assign the value based on the edge's product. However, during this process, we need to ensure that the assignments are consistent and that the coprimality conditions are met.\n\nBut how do we choose the initial value? For example, if we have a connected component with multiple edges, the initial value may need to be chosen such that all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with a Union-Find data structure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's similar to a graph where each edge enforces a relation between two variables, and we need to find a valid assignment.\n\nLet me think of it as a graph where each node has a variable x_i. For each edge (u, v), the product x_u * x_v = p_uv, where p_uv is (l/g) for that edge. Also, x_u and x_v are coprime.\n\nNow, suppose we have a tree structure. We can assign x_1 arbitrarily (as long as it divides p_1v for its edges), then propagate the values through the tree. However, since x_u and x_v are coprime, once x_u is chosen, x_v is fixed as p_uv / x_u. But we need to make sure that this value is an integer, and that x_u and x_v are coprime.\n\nWait, but for each edge, p_uv is (l/g) for that edge, which is an integer. So, x_u * x_v = p_uv, and since x_u and x_v are coprime, their product is p_uv. Therefore, x_u must be a divisor of p_uv, and x_v must be p_uv / x_u, and they must be coprime.\n\nSo, for example, if I have a tree and assign x_u to be a divisor of p_uv, then x_v is determined. However, when moving further down the tree, the assignments must be consistent with the other edges.\n\nBut how do I choose the initial x_u? Because if I choose x_u as any divisor of p_uv, but then later steps may require that x_u divides another product.\n\nThis seems tricky. However, perhaps there's a unique way to assign x_i once we fix the value for one node. For example, in a tree, if we fix x_root, then all other x_i's are determined. However, we need to make sure that all the constraints are satisfied. \n\nBut how do we choose x_root? Well, for the tree to be consistent, the x_root must be such that all the assignments derived from the edges are integers, and that all coprimality conditions are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the x_root can be chosen as any divisor of the product of the edges connected to it. But how do we find such a divisor?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of an example. Suppose we have two nodes connected by an edge with p = 6. Then, possible pairs (x_u, x_v) are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). However, for each of these, the coprimality condition holds. So, how do we choose which pair to take?\n\nBut in this case, since there's only one edge, any of these choices is valid. However, if there are more edges connected to these nodes, the choice may affect the rest of the assignments.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is to find for each connected component a way to assign x_i's such that for every edge, x_u * x_v equals p_uv and they are coprime. \n\nBut how to model this? It seems like a system of equations with multiplicative constraints. However, solving such systems is non-trivial.\n\nAnother thought: since x_u and x_v are coprime and their product is p_uv, then x_u must be a divisor of p_uv, and x_v must be p_uv / x_u. Moreover, since x_u and x_v are coprime, x_u must be a divisor of p_uv that is coprime with p_uv / x_u. Which implies that x_u must be square-free? Not necessarily. Wait, suppose p_uv is 6. Then x_u could be 2, and x_v is 3. They are coprime. But 2 divides 6, and 3 divides 6. But 2 and 3 are coprime. So, the key is that x_u and x_v are coprime and their product is p_uv. Therefore, x_u must be a divisor of p_uv, and x_v is p_uv / x_u, and gcd(x_u, x_v) = 1. Which is equivalent to x_u being a divisor of p_uv, and x_u and p_uv/x_u being coprime. Which implies that x_u must be a divisor of p_uv and that x_u is square-free? No, for example, if p_uv is 4, then x_u could be 1 and x_v is 4. They are coprime. Or x_u could be 4 and x_v is 1. But if p_uv is 4, and x_u is 2, then x_v is 2, but their GCD is 2, which is not allowed. So in that case, x_u can't be 2. So for p_uv=4, the possible x_u's are 1 and 4. \n\nTherefore, the possible x_u's for a given p_uv are the divisors of p_uv that are coprime with p_uv / x_u. Which is equivalent to x_u being a divisor of p_uv, and that x_u and p_uv/x_u are coprime. Which is equivalent to x_u being a divisor of p_uv, and that x_u is square-free? No, for example, p_uv = 12. Suppose x_u is 3, then x_v is 4. They are coprime. But 3 is square-free. If x_u is 4, then x_v is 3. Also coprime. 4 is not square-free (it's 2^2). So that's allowed. So the condition is not that x_u is square-free, but that x_u and p_uv/x_u are coprime. Which implies that x_u must be square-free? No, for example, x_u = 4 and p_uv = 12, x_v = 3. 4 and 3 are coprime, but 4 is not square-free. So the condition is that x_u and x_v are coprime. Which is equivalent to x_u and p_uv/x_u are coprime, which implies that x_u must be a divisor of p_uv, and that x_u and p_uv/x_u are coprime. \n\nBut how do I find such x_u? For example, given a p_uv, the x_u can be any divisor d of p_uv such that d and p_uv/d are coprime. \n\nBut how can I find such d? Well, since d and p_uv/d are coprime, their greatest common divisor must be 1. Which implies that d must be a product of some subset of the prime factors of p_uv, and p_uv/d must be the product of the remaining primes. Therefore, p_uv must be square-free? Or no. Let me think. Suppose p_uv is 12 = 2^2 * 3. Suppose d is 2. Then p_uv/d is 6. gcd(2,6) is 2, which is not 1. So d=2 is not allowed. If d is 3, then p_uv/d is 4, and gcd(3,4) is 1. So that's allowed. If d is 4, then p_uv/d is 3. gcd(4,3)=1. Allowed. If d is 1, then p_uv/d is 12. gcd(1,12)=1. Allowed. If d is 12, same as above. So for p_uv=12, the allowed divisors are 1, 3, 4, 12. \n\nSo the allowed divisors are those which are products of distinct primes in the prime factorization of p_uv. Because if p_uv has a prime factor raised to a power higher than 1, then any d that includes that prime must not include it again. Wait, but in the example of p_uv=12=2^2*3, the allowed d's are 1, 3, 4, 12. Let's see: 3 is 3^1, 4 is 2^2, 1 is nothing, 12 is 2^2*3. So, the allowed d's are the ones where each prime factor in d appears exactly with the same exponent as in p_uv. Because for example, if d is 4 (2^2), then p_uv/d is 3 (which is 3^1). Their gcd is 1. Similarly, if d is 3 (3^1), then p_uv/d is 4 (2^2), gcd is 1. If d is 12 (2^2*3^1), then p_uv/d is 1, which is okay.\n\nSo the allowed divisors d are those that are square factors of p_uv, but in a way that their complement (p_uv/d) is also square-free? Not sure. Alternatively, the allowed d's are those that are square factors of p_uv. Wait, no. For example, d=4 is allowed even though it's not square-free. So the allowed d's are those where each prime factor in d is present in p_uv with exponent equal to the exponent in p_uv. Because if p_uv has a prime factor with exponent k, then d can take all of that exponent (so that p_uv/d has zero exponents for that prime), or none (so that d has zero exponents, and p_uv/d has the full exponent). But if d takes some exponent less than the full exponent, then p_uv/d will have that prime in both d and p_uv/d, leading to a gcd greater than 1.\n\nAh! So for the product x_u * x_v to be p_uv, and x_u and x_v to be coprime, x_u must be a divisor of p_uv, and x_v must be p_uv / x_u. And for them to be coprime, x_u and x_v must not share any common prime factors. Therefore, x_u must contain all occurrences of some subset of the primes in p_uv, and x_v contains the rest. Thus, the prime factors of p_uv must be partitioned into two subsets, one assigned to x_u and the other to x_v. \n\nSo, for example, if p_uv is 12 = 2^2 * 3^1, then the primes are 2 and 3. The possible partitions are:\n\n- x_u has 2^2 and 3^1, x_v has nothing → x_u=12, x_v=1.\n- x_u has 2^2, x_v has 3^1 → x_u=4, x_v=3.\n- x_u has 3^1, x_v has 2^2 → x_u=3, x_v=4.\n- x_u has nothing, x_v has all → x_u=1, x_v=12.\n\nThese are the four possibilities. So, in general, for any p_uv, the allowed x_u's are those that are products of some subset of the primes in p_uv's prime factorization, with their exponents matching exactly those in p_uv. \n\nSo, the key idea here is that for each edge, the product p_uv is fixed, and the x_u and x_v are determined by splitting the prime factors of p_uv into two groups. Therefore, the x_i's are determined by the way the primes are distributed among the nodes. \n\nNow, how can we model this in a graph? It seems like each node's x_i is a product of certain primes, and for each edge, the primes assigned to the two nodes must be disjoint. \n\nThis looks like a bipartition problem. For example, if the graph is bipartite, then we can assign the primes to one partition and the other partition. However, this is only possible if the graph is bipartite. Wait, but this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, considering that each edge requires that the primes in x_u and x_v are disjoint, which implies that the variables x_i must be such that for any two connected nodes u and v, their x_i's are coprime. This is a strong condition. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning to each node a set of primes (with their exponents as per p_uv) such that for any two connected nodes, their sets are disjoint. \n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like a graph coloring problem, where each color represents a set of primes. However, the colors are not fixed, and the assignment depends on the edges. \n\nAlternatively, think of the graph as a collection of variables that must be assigned to different \"groups\" of primes. However, this seems too abstract. \n\nAnother approach: since x_u and x_v are coprime, and x_u * x_v = p_uv, then the primes in p_uv are split between x_u and x_v. Therefore, for any connected component, the primes in all the p_uv's for that component must be partitioned into different variables. \n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the entire connected component. Suppose we have a connected component. All the p_uv's in this component must have their primes assigned to variables in such a way that no two connected nodes share a prime. \n\nThis seems like a problem where each node's x_i is a product of certain primes, and the primes are assigned in a way that connected nodes don't share any. \n\nThis feels like a bipartition problem. For example, if the graph is bipartite, then we can assign primes to one partition and not the other. However, this is only possible if the graph is bipartite. \n\nBut what if the graph has cycles that are not bipartite? For example, a triangle. Suppose we have three nodes A, B, C, connected in a triangle. Each edge has p_uv = 6 (primes 2 and 3). Then, for each edge, the primes must be split between the two nodes. \n\nFor example, A-B: A has 2, B has 3. B-C: B has 3, C has 2. C-A: C has 2, A has 3. But this leads to a contradiction. Because in the first edge, A has 2, and in the third edge, A must have 3. So this is impossible. Hence, such a graph would not have a solution. \n\nBut how can we detect this? It seems that for any cycle in the graph, the number of edges in the cycle must be even. Otherwise, there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, this is similar to checking if the graph is bipartite. In a bipartite graph, any cycle has even length. So, if the graph is not bipartite, then there is an odd-length cycle, which may lead to contradictions. \n\nBut how does this relate to our problem? \n\nIn our problem, each edge enforces that the two nodes are in different \"groups\" of primes. So, perhaps the graph must be bipartite. \n\nWait, but each edge requires that the two nodes are in different groups. Because their x_i's are coprime, which implies that they can't share any primes. So, if we model this as a bipartition, where each node is colored black or white, and for each edge, the two nodes have different colors. Then, this would ensure that the primes assigned to black nodes are not shared with white nodes. \n\nBut how do we assign the primes? \n\nAh, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartition of the graph. If the graph is bipartite, then we can assign primes to one partition and not the other. However, this depends on the p_uv values. \n\nWait, maybe not. For example, if the graph is bipartite, then for each edge, the two nodes are in different partitions. Then, for each edge, the primes in p_uv can be assigned to either of the two partitions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bipartition is not about the primes, but about the variables. For example, for each edge, the variables x_u and x_v must be coprime. Which implies that the variables are in different partitions. Hence, the graph must be bipartite. If the graph is not bipartite, then there's no way to assign variables to satisfy the coprimality condition. \n\nWait, this seems promising. Let's think: if the graph is bipartite, then we can assign all primes in the connected component to one of the two partitions. For example, suppose the component is bipartitioned into sets A and B. Then, for each edge between A and B, the primes in p_uv can be assigned entirely to A or entirely to B. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each connected component, the graph must be bipartite. If it's not, then there's no solution. \n\nBut why? Let's take an example. Suppose there is a triangle (non-bipartite). Let's say each edge has p_uv = 6 (so primes 2 and 3). Then, for each edge, we need to split the primes between the two nodes. \n\nSuppose the triangle is A-B-C-A. \n\nFor edge A-B: A has 2, B has 3. \n\nFor edge B-C: B has 3, C has 2. \n\nFor edge C-A: C has 2, A has 3. \n\nBut this leads to A having both 2 and 3, which contradicts the previous assignment. So, this is impossible. Hence, the graph must be bipartite. \n\nThus, the first check is whether the graph is bipartite. If not, then output is NO. \n\nBut wait, this depends on the edges. For example, if the edges are such that their p_uv allows for some other assignments. \n\nBut how? For example, suppose the triangle has edges with p_uv = 1. Then, since p_uv = 1, x_u * x_v = 1. Hence, x_u = 1 and x_v = 1. Since 1 and 1 are coprime. So, the graph can be bipartitioned. \n\nBut in this case, the graph is a triangle, but since all edges have p_uv = 1, the x_i's are all 1, and hence coprime. So the graph can be bipartitioned (since any graph can be bipartitioned if all edges have no constraints except that the variables are 1). \n\nWait, but the bipartition check is not needed. Because the problem is not about the graph's bipartition, but about the variables being coprime. However, if the graph is not bipartite, then there's a cycle of odd length, which may create a contradiction. \n\nBut how? Let's think of a cycle of three nodes, each connected in a triangle, and each edge has p_uv = 6. \n\nAssume that the graph is not bipartite (which it is, being a triangle). Now, can we find x_i's such that for each edge, the product is 6 and the x_i's are coprime? \n\nLet me try. Let's say:\n\nA and B: x_A * x_B = 6. Let's say x_A = 2, x_B = 3. \n\nB and C: x_B * x_C = 6. Since x_B is 3, x_C must be 2. \n\nC and A: x_C * x_A = 2 * 2 = 4, which is not equal to 6. Contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, what if x_A = 6, x_B = 1. Then x_B * x_C = 1 * x_C = 6 → x_C = 6. Then x_C * x_A = 6 * 6 = 36 ≠ 6. \n\nAnother possibility: x_A = 1, x_B = 6. Then x_B * x_C = 6 * x_C = 6 → x_C = 1. Then x_C * x_A = 1 * 1 = 1 ≠ 6. \n\nAnother approach: x_A = 3, x_B = 2. Then x_B * x_C = 2 * x_C = 6 → x_C = 3. Then x_C * x_A = 3 * 3 = 9 ≠ 6. \n\nNo matter what, it seems impossible. So the conclusion is that for this case, there's no solution. Hence, the graph being non-bipartite leads to a contradiction. \n\nSo, the first step is to check whether the graph is bipartite. If not, then output NO. \n\nBut wait, what about a graph that is not bipartite, but the edges have p_uv = 1? For example, a triangle where each edge has p_uv = 1. Then x_i's for all nodes must be 1. Which satisfies the conditions. So the graph is not bipartite, but there exists a solution. \n\nAh, right. So the bipartition check is not sufficient. So, the previous reasoning is incorrect. \n\nSo, the problem is not directly about the graph's bipartition. \n\nAlternative approach: think of the variables x_i as being in a way that for each edge (u, v), x_u and x_v are coprime. This implies that the graph must be bipartitioned in terms of the primes. But how?\n\nAnother thought: since for any two connected nodes, their x_i's are coprime, then the entire graph must be such that any two nodes connected by a path have x_i's that are pairwise coprime. Which is not possible unless the graph is a collection of trees. But that's not necessarily true. \n\nAlternatively, think of the x_i's as being products of primes that are unique to each node. So, for example, each node is assigned a unique set of primes, and these sets are disjoint for any two connected nodes. However, this would require that the graph is a collection of trees. \n\nBut again, this is not necessarily the case. \n\nPerhaps the problem can be modeled using a union-find structure with additional constraints. However, I'm not sure. \n\nLet me go back to the initial idea of building the x_i's based on the edges. Let's imagine that we have a connected component. We can build a spanning tree for the component. For each node, assign x_i based on the parent node's x_i. \n\nLet's take the root node. Assign x_root as some value. Then, for each child node, x_child = p_uv / x_parent, where p_uv is the product for the edge between parent and child. However, we must ensure that x_parent and x_child are coprime. \n\nBut how do we choose x_root? \n\nThe problem is that the choice of x_root affects the validity of the assignments. For example, if the root is assigned a value that doesn't allow for the rest of the assignments to be valid, then the entire component is invalid. \n\nSo, perhaps for each connected component, we need to:\n\n1. Check that the component is bipartitionable. Wait, but earlier example shows that it's not necessary. \n\nWait, but in the case of a triangle with p_uv = 1, the component is not bipartite, but the solution exists. \n\nSo, what's the difference between this case and the previous case where the solution didn't exist? \n\nIn the case of p_uv = 1, the product x_u * x_v = 1, which implies that x_u = 1 and x_v = 1. So, for all edges, the variables are 1, which are coprime. Hence, the solution exists regardless of the graph structure. \n\nSo, the key is that for certain p_uv values, the constraints are automatically satisfied. \n\nThis suggests that the bipartition check is not sufficient. \n\nAlternative idea: For each connected component, construct a graph where each edge represents a relation between x_u and x_v. For example, for each edge, we have x_u * x_v = p_uv. Additionally, x_u and x_v are coprime. \n\nThis is a system of equations. How can we solve this system?\n\nLet's take the example of a connected component. Assume that the component is a tree. Then, we can choose x_root as any divisor of p_root_child, and then assign x_child = p_root_child / x_root. Then, proceed recursively. However, we need to ensure that for each assignment, the x_i and x_j are coprime. \n\nBut how to choose x_root? It must be such that for all edges in the tree, the assignments are valid. \n\nBut how can we find such an x_root? \n\nLet me think. For the tree, suppose we have a root node R. For each edge from R to its children, the product is p. For the root's x value to be valid, it must be a divisor of p, and p / x must be coprime with x. \n\nSo, for each edge connected to the root, x must be a divisor of p, and x and p/x must be coprime. \n\nBut for multiple edges connected to the root, x must satisfy this condition for each of their respective p's. \n\nThis seems very restrictive. \n\nFor example, suppose the root has two edges: one with p=6, and another with p=12. Then, x must be a divisor of 6 and 12. Let's see. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. For each of these, check if x and p/x are coprime. \n\nFor p=6:\nx=1: 1 and 6 → coprime.\nx=2: 2 and 3 → coprime.\nx=3: 3 and 2 → coprime.\nx=6: 6 and 1 → coprime.\n\nFor p=12:\nx=1: 1 and 12 → coprime.\nx=2: 2 and 6 → gcd 2 → not coprime.\nx=3: 3 and 4 → coprime.\nx=6: 6 and 2 → gcd 2 → not coprime.\n\nSo, the x for the root must be a divisor of both 6 and 12, and for each p, x and p/x are coprime. \n\nThe common divisors of 6 and 12 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor x=1: valid for both p=6 and p=12. \nFor x=2: valid for p=6 (2 and 3), but invalid for p=12 (2 and 6).\nFor x=3: valid for p=6 (3 and 2), and for p=12 (3 and 4) → valid.\nFor x=6: invalid for p=12 (6 and 2).\n\nSo, possible x values are 1 and 3. \n\nSo, choosing x_root as 1 or 3. \n\nOnce chosen, the rest of the tree can be built. \n\nBut how do we find such x_root? \n\nIt seems that for a tree, the x_root must be a value that satisfies the coprimality condition for all edges connected to it. \n\nThis suggests that for each connected component, we need to find a value for the root that is compatible with all edges connected to it, and then propagate the values through the tree. \n\nBut how to find this value? \n\nThe problem is that for a component with",

The initial approach was to model x_i such that for each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, a_u = g * x_u and a_v = g * x_v, but that would require that the GCD(a_u, a_v) is g and LCM(a_u, a_v) is l. However, this is only true if x_u and x_v are coprime and their product is l/g. But the actual a_i is g * x_i. However, in our code above, we have for each edge, x_u * x_v = l/g. So the a_i for each node is g * x_i, but this depends on the edge. This is incorrect because a node may be part of multiple edges, each with different g and l. \n\n    # Oh no! This is a critical mistake. The previous approach assumes that the same g is used for all edges, which is not the case. Each edge has its own g and l. Hence, the previous approach is incorrect. \n\n    # Therefore, the entire approach needs to be revised. The previous idea of using a bipartition and assigning x_i is invalid because the g varies per edge. \n\n    # So, the correct approach is to model the problem differently. Let me think again.\n\n    # For each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we have that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime and x*y = l/g. However, this implies that a_u and a_v are multiples of g, and their GCD is g, LCM is l. \n\n    # But for a node that is connected to multiple edges, each with different g's, the a_i must satisfy all those constraints. \n\n    # This suggests that the previous approach is incorrect. Hence, I need to rethink the entire solution.\n\n    # Given the time constraints, I'll refer to the correct approach from competitive programming knowledge. \n\n    # The correct approach is to model this as a graph where each node's value must be a multiple of the GCD for each edge it is part of. Additionally, for each edge, the product of the values of the two nodes must equal GCD * LCM. \n\n    # To handle this, we can use a Union-Find structure with constraints, but this is complex. \n\n    # Another approach is to build a system where for each connected component, we assign values to nodes such that for every edge, the product of the two nodes' values equals GCD * LCM. \n\n    # Let's try to model this with DFS again. For each edge, we have a_u * a_v = g * l. Also, GCD(a_u, a_v) = g. \n\n    # Since GCD(a_u, a_v) = g, we can write a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where GCD(x, y) = 1, and x * y = l / g. \n\n    # This means that for each edge, the product of x and y is fixed, and they are coprime. \n\n    # So, for each edge, we can treat the x and y as variables that are coprime and multiply to l/g. \n\n    # Now, the problem becomes assigning these x and y values across the graph.

Let me re-express.\n\n    # Actually, the value array holds x_i, which is the value such that a_i = g_i * x_i for each edge. However, since each edge has its own g and l, how can we compute a_i?\n\n    # Wait, no. The initial approach was to model x_i such that for each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, a_u = g * x_u and a_v = g * x_v, but that would require that the GCD(a_u, a_v) is g and LCM(a_u, a_v) is l. However, this is only true if x_u and x_v are coprime and their product is l/g. But the actual a_i is g * x_i. However, in our code above, we have for each edge, x_u * x_v = l/g. So the a_i for each node is g * x_i, but this depends on the edge. This is incorrect because a node may be part of multiple edges, each with different g and l. \n\n    # Oh no! This is a critical mistake. The previous approach assumes that the same g is used for all edges, which is not the case. Each edge has its own g and l. Hence, the previous approach is incorrect. \n\n    # Therefore, the entire approach needs to be revised. The previous idea of using a bipartition and assigning x_i is invalid because the g varies per edge. \n\n    # So, the correct approach is to model the problem differently. Let me think again.\n\n    # For each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we have that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime and x*y = l/g. However, this implies that a_u and a_v are multiples of g, and their GCD is g, LCM is l. \n\n    # But for a node that is connected to multiple edges, each with different g's, the a_i must satisfy all those constraints. \n\n    # This suggests that the previous approach is incorrect. Hence, I need to rethink the entire solution.\n\n    # Given the time constraints, I'll refer to the correct approach from competitive programming knowledge. \n\n    # The correct approach is to model this as a graph where each node's value must be a multiple of the GCD for each edge it is part of. Additionally, for each edge, the product of the values of the two nodes must equal GCD * LCM. \n\n    # To handle this, we can use a Union-Find structure with constraints, but this is complex. \n\n    # Another approach is to build a system where for each connected component, we assign values to nodes such that for every edge, the product of the two nodes' values equals GCD * LCM. \n\n    # Let's try to model this with DFS again. For each edge, we have a_u * a_v = g * l. Also, GCD(a_u, a_v) = g. \n\n    # Since GCD(a_u, a_v) = g, we can write a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where GCD(x, y) = 1, and x * y = l / g. \n\n    # This means that for each edge, the product of x and y is fixed, and they are coprime. \n\n    # So, for each edge, we can treat the x and y as variables that are coprime and multiply to l/g. \n\n    # Now, the problem becomes assigning these x and y values across the graph. This can be modeled as a graph where each node has a value x_i, and for each edge, x_u * x_v = k (where k = l/g), and GCD(x_u, x_v) = 1. \n\n    # To solve this, we can perform a BFS or DFS and assign values to nodes, ensuring that for each edge, the product condition is met and the coprimality is maintained. \n\n    # However, this requires that for each edge, the product is fixed, and the assignments are consistent across the entire graph. \n\n    # Given the complexity, here's the corrected code based on the correct approach:\n\n    # Reimplementing the solution with proper handling of the a_i values:\n\n    import sys\n    import math\n    from collections import defaultdict, deque\n\n    def main():\n        input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        idx = 0\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        m = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n\n        edges = []\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        for _ in range(m):\n            u = int(input[idx]) - 1\n            idx += 1\n            v = int(input[idx]) - 1\n            idx += 1\n            g = int(input[idx])\n            idx += 1\n            l = int(input[idx])\n            idx += 1\n            if l % g != 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n            k = l // g\n            edges.append((u, v, g, l, k))\n            graph[u].append((v, k))\n            graph[v].append((u, k))\n\n        value = [None] * n\n        visited = [False] * n\n\n        def dfs(u, parent_val, parent_k):\n            visited[u] = True\n            value[u] = parent_val\n            for v, k in graph[u]:\n                if not visited[v]:\n                    # Check if parent_val divides k\n                    if k % parent_val != 0:\n                        return False\n                    val_v = k // parent_val\n                    if math.gcd(parent_val, val_v) != 1:\n                        return False\n                    if not dfs(v, val_v, k):\n                        return False\n                else:\n                    if value[v] is None:\n                        continue\n                    if value[u] * value[v] != k:\n                        return False\n                    if math.gcd(value[u], value[v]) != 1:\n                        return False\n            return True\n\n        for start in range(n):\n            if not visited[start]:\n                # Try assigning value[start] as 1\n                value[start] = 1\n                if not dfs(start, 1, 1):\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n        # Now, reconstruct the a_i values by multiplying with the GCD from the edge\n        # But wait, how to get the correct GCD for each node?
