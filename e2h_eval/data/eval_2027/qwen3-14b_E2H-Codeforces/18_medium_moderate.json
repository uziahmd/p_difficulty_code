The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints, and we need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps outside [0, x]. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't go beyond 0 or x during any of its jumps. So, for each x, we need to find all positions reachable under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, but can't go below 0 or above x. However, the frog can make multiple jumps. Let's consider the movement in terms of equations.\n\nThe key observation here is that the positions the frog can reach must satisfy some linear combination of a and b. Let's think about the general case where there are no constraints (i.e., x is very large). Then, the frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b, but since the frog starts at 0, perhaps the reachable positions are those congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b). Wait, but since the frog can only add a or subtract b, maybe the reachable positions are those numbers that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, this might not capture all possibilities, because the frog can do multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the frog can move in both directions, the set of positions reachable without any constraints would be all integers that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd of a and b. Because any linear combination of a and b is a multiple of their gcd. However, since the frog can only add a or subtract b, perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d. But I'm not sure. For example, if a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of 1, which is all integers. But that's probably not the case. Wait, maybe the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of d, but also depends on the steps taken.\n\nBut in our problem, the frog is constrained to stay within [0, x] during all jumps. So even if a position is reachable in theory, if it's outside [0, x], it's not counted.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Let's consider the minimal steps required to reach certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, but can't go below 0 or above x. Let's model this as a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent the allowed jumps. However, for large x (up to 1e9), this is impossible to model directly.\n\nSo, we need to find for each x, the number of positions reachable in this graph. But again, with m up to 1e9, we need an O(1) or O(some small function of a and b) per test case approach.\n\nLet me look at the sample input. In the first example, m=7, a=5, b=3. The output is 19. The note says that for x=5, f(x)=3. Let's see why. The frog can reach 0, 5, and 5-3=2. Then from 2, can it jump +5? That would take it to 7, but if x is 5, then 7 is outside. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5)=3. For x=7, the frog can reach more positions. For example, from 5, you can jump to 5+5=10 (but x=7, so invalid), or 5-3=2. From 2, you can jump +5 to 7 (which is allowed). So 7 is added. Then from 7, you can jump back to 7-3=4. Then from 4, you can jump to 4+5=9 (invalid) or 4-3=1. From 1, you can jump to 1+5=6 (allowed). Then from 6, you can jump to 6-3=3. And so on. So for x=7, the reachable positions are 0,2,5,7,4,1,6,3. So 8 positions. Which matches the note.\n\nSo the positions reachable are those that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd of a and b. Because when you add a or subtract b, you're adding multiples of d. So the positions must be multiples of d. So perhaps the first thing to check is whether the frog can reach any positions. For example, if a and b are not coprime, then the positions are multiples of their gcd. However, even that may not be sufficient, because the frog can't reach certain positions due to the constraints of not going out of bounds.\n\nSo let's define d = gcd(a, b). Let's consider that all reachable positions must be multiples of d. So, for any x, the maximum number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1 (if the frog can reach all multiples of d between 0 and x). However, this is not always the case. For example, in the first sample, d = gcd(5,3) = 1. So the maximum possible positions for x=7 is 8 (since 0,1,...,7). However, in the sample, for x=5, f(x) is 3. But 0, 2, 5 are multiples of 1, but the frog can't reach all positions. So the problem is that even though the positions are multiples of d, the frog can't reach them due to the constraints of not being able to go out of bounds.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, then from 2, jump to 7 (if allowed), which is 2+5=7. Then from 7, subtract 3 to get 4, etc. So the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d, but only if they can be reached via the allowed steps.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: For each x, how many multiples of d are reachable, given that the frog can't go out of [0, x] during any jump.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and lie in [0, x], provided that x is sufficiently large. For example, if a and b are coprime (d=1), then once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x], because the frog can reach any integer. But when x is small, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nBut how to find for each x, the number of reachable positions?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. Let's suppose that the frog can reach any multiple of d that is between 0 and x, provided that x is large enough. But when x is small, some positions may not be reachable. However, the problem requires us to compute for all x from 0 to m, the sum of f(x).\n\nThis seems complex. Let's think of the problem in terms of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b). If d is not 1, then all reachable positions must be multiples of d. So, for each x, the number of positions is the number of reachable multiples of d in [0, x], multiplied by 1 (since each such position is a multiple of d). However, if the frog can't reach all such positions, then this is not the case.\n\nBut how to determine which multiples are reachable?\n\nAnother thought: Let's assume that a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer >= (some value) by combining steps. But how?\n\nFor example, if a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. The frog can reach 0. Then, from 0, it can jump to 5. From 5, it can jump to 5-3=2. From 2, it can jump to 2+5=7. From 7, jump to 7-3=4. From 4, jump to 4+5=9, or 4-3=1. From 1, jump to 1+5=6, etc. So for any x, once x is large enough, all positions can be reached. However, for smaller x, like x=5, the frog can reach 0,2,5.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to the classic coin problem where you can make change with coins of denominations a and b. Except that here, the frog can only add a or subtract b. So the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path from 0 to that position doesn't go out of bounds. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and that can be written as some linear combination of a and b. However, since the frog can only add a or subtract b, perhaps the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is between 0 and x. But how to find the count of such positions?\n\nBut this seems computationally difficult. Let's think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps required to reach a certain position.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a BFS. However, since m can be up to 1e9, we need to find a pattern or formula that can be computed quickly.\n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. Let's say a=5 and b=3. Then, the frog can reach any integer >= (a*b - a - b) ? Wait, no. Wait, the classic coin problem says that the largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b (assuming they are coprime) is ab -a -b. However, in this case, the frog can add a or subtract b. So it's different. For example, the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of d (here 1), but how?\n\nAlternatively, since the frog can add a or subtract b, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, given that x is large enough. But how to find the minimal x for which all multiples of d up to x are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all multiples of d once x is at least (a + b) * something. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the case when a=5 and b=3. Let's see:\n\nThe reachable positions are 0, 5, 2 (5-3), 7 (2+5), 4 (7-3), 9 (4+5), 1 (4-3), 6 (1+5), 3 (6-3), 8 (3+5), etc. So for any position >=0, as long as it's a multiple of 1 (so all positions), the frog can reach it. But how?\n\nWait, for example, position 1 is reachable. How? From 4 (which is 5-3+5-3?), then subtract 3 to get 1. So yes. So once the frog can reach positions up to a certain point, it can reach all positions beyond that. So perhaps for a and b coprime, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (which is 1) once x is large enough. For example, once x is at least (a + b), the frog can reach all positions.\n\nBut how to find for each x, how many positions are reachable?\n\nAnother idea: For a and b coprime, the reachable positions are all integers >=0 that are multiples of d (which is 1), but the frog can reach them only if there exists a way to reach them without stepping out of [0, x] during the jumps. But this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, since d divides both a and b, let's divide everything by d. Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Then, since gcd(a', b') = 1. So the problem reduces to finding positions that are multiples of d, and which can be written as k*a' - l*b'.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, the equation k*a' - l*b' = n (for some n) has solutions. However, the question is whether there's a way to reach n through the allowed steps (without going out of bounds).\n\nBut this seems abstract. Let's think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps needed to reach a position. For example, to reach a certain position, the frog needs to have a path that doesn't go out of bounds. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are greater than or equal to (some value), but for positions less than that, it depends.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps we need to find for each x, the number of positions that are multiples of d and can be reached by the frog, given the constraints.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nLet’s first compute d = gcd(a, b). Then, the reachable positions must be multiples of d. Let’s denote a’ = a/d, b’ = b/d. Now, since a’ and b’ are coprime.\n\nNow, the problem becomes: For each x, find the number of positions in [0, x] that are multiples of d, and which can be reached by the frog. But since the frog can only add a’*d or subtract b’*d, the problem reduces to the same problem but with a’ and b’ coprime.\n\nSo, the problem now is to find for each x, the number of positions in [0, x] that are multiples of d and can be reached by the frog. Let’s focus on the case where a and b are coprime (since we can divide by d). Let’s assume that a and b are coprime for now.\n\nIn this case, the frog can reach any integer that is a non-negative linear combination of a and b, but with the constraint that during the jumps, the frog never goes below 0 or above x.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nLet me think of the reachable positions as those that can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path to reach that position does not go out of [0, x].\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe another approach: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (in the original problem) and which is >=0 and <=x, provided that x is large enough. However, for small x, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nBut how to find for each x, the count of such positions?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and which is >=0 and <=x, provided that there exists a sequence of jumps that allows the frog to reach it without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this for all x?\n\nAnother idea: For the frog to reach a certain position s, it must be possible to reach s from 0 using a series of jumps that never go below 0 or above x. However, since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the minimal requirement is that s can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. But even then, the path to reach s must not go outside [0, x].\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps for a and b coprime, once x is large enough, all positions in [0, x] are reachable. Let's suppose that for x >= (a + b), the frog can reach all positions in [0, x]. Then, for x < (a + b), we need to compute manually.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each x, the number of reachable positions is:\n\nif x < (a + b): count the number of reachable positions (which can be found via BFS for small x)\n\nelse: the number of multiples of d in [0, x], which is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nIn the first sample, a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. For x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. The total is 3. However, floor(5/1) +1 = 6, which is not matching. So this suggests that the assumption is incorrect. Therefore, the idea that for x >= some value, all positions are reachable is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are >= (a - b) or something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think again. For the case where a and b are coprime. Let's suppose that the frog can reach any position that is >= (something). For example, in the first sample, once x is large enough, the frog can reach any position. But for x=7, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Which is 8 positions. Which is exactly 7+1 = 8. So for x=7, which is larger than 5 and 3, the frog can reach all positions. So maybe once x is >= (a + b), the frog can reach all positions.\n\nIn the first sample, a=5, b=3. a + b = 8. For x=7, which is less than 8, the frog can reach all positions. Hmm, but that contradicts the earlier example where for x=5, the frog can't reach 1,3,4,6,7. So maybe my previous idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, when x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. According to the note, f(7) is 8, which is exactly 7+1. So for x=7, which is less than a + b (8), the frog can reach all positions. So perhaps my previous assumption was wrong. How is this possible?\n\nBecause the frog can reach positions by going forward and backward. For example, to reach 1, the frog can go 0 →5 →2 →7 →4 →1. So even though x is 7, which is less than a + b (5+3=8), the frog can reach 1. So maybe the threshold is not a + b.\n\nSo perhaps the frog can reach all positions once x is >= max(a, b). But in the first sample, a=5, max(a, b) is 5. For x=5, the frog can't reach 1, 3, 4, etc. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. This suggests that there's no simple threshold. Therefore, perhaps we need to find for each x, the number of positions that are multiples of d and can be reached by the frog, which depends on the parity of steps or something else.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as a graph where nodes are positions and edges are jumps. Then, the reachable positions are those that can be reached from 0. However, since the graph is infinite, we can't process it directly. But for each x, the frog can't go beyond x, so for each x, the reachable positions are those in the connected component of 0 in the graph induced by positions [0, x].\n\nBut again, for large x, this seems impractical. However, perhaps there's a pattern in the reachable positions once x is large enough.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and which is reachable via some combination of adding a and subtracting b. Let's ignore the constraints of not going out of bounds for a moment. Then, the set of reachable positions is all integers that are congruent to 0 mod d. Because the frog can add a and subtract b any number of times, which are multiples of d. So for example, if you can reach position s, then you can reach s + k*a, or s - l*b, etc.\n\nBut the constraints of not going out of bounds complicate things. However, if x is large enough that the frog can perform any necessary jumps without going out of bounds, then the reachable positions would be all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are reachable given that the frog can't go out of bounds during any jump.\n\nBut how to determine for each multiple of d, whether it is reachable.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the minimal steps needed to reach a particular multiple of d. For example, to reach a position s, the frog must have a way to reach it by adding a's and subtracting b's, without ever stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in the range [0, x], provided that there exists some k ≥ 0 such that s = k*a - m*b, where m is such that during the jumps, the frog never went out of [0, x]. However, this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps the key insight is that the frog can reach any multiple of d that is ≥0 and ≤x, provided that x is large enough. For example, once x is large enough that the frog can reach all positions via forward and backward jumps. But how to find what x is large enough.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position s that is a multiple of d and satisfies s ≤ x and s ≥ 0, and s can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the sequence of jumps, the frog never went out of [0, x].\n\nBut this seems too abstract to model.\n\nLet's think of the problem in terms of the following: For a and b coprime, the frog can reach any position s ≥0, provided that s can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. Because the frog can make as many jumps as needed. However, the problem is that the frog can't go out of bounds during the jumps. But if x is large enough that the frog can reach s without going out of bounds, then s is counted.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x for which this is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position s that is a multiple of d and ≥0, as long as s ≤ x and x is ≥ s. But this would imply that for any x, the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d in [0, x]. Which is not true, as seen in the first sample.\n\nIn the first sample, for x=5, the number of multiples of d (which is 1) is 6 (positions 0-5). But the actual count is 3. So this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. So what's the difference between the sample and this hypothesis? It seems that even though s is a multiple of d and within [0, x], the frog may not be able to reach it due to the constraints on the jumps.\n\nSo, how can we find for a given x, which multiples of d are reachable?\n\nMaybe the answer lies in the fact that the frog can reach any multiple of d that is ≥0 and ≤x, provided that x is large enough. But for smaller x, it depends on whether the frog can reach that position through some sequence of jumps that don't go out of bounds.\n\nBut how to find for all x up to m, the sum of f(x), where f(x) is the number of reachable positions.\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's find for each x, the maximum number of positions reachable. This depends on the ability to reach positions via forward and backward jumps.\n\nLet's think of the problem as a BFS for small values of x. For example, if x is small, like up to a + b, we can precompute the reachable positions. But for larger x, there's a pattern.\n\nLet me think of the following: For x ≥ some value, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. Let's call this value T. Once x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1. For x < T, we need to compute the count manually.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nLet's consider the case where a and b are coprime. Let's say that T is the maximum between a and b. Or perhaps T is a + b. Or some other value.\n\nIn the first sample, a=5, b=3. For x=5, the frog can't reach 1, 3, 4. For x=7, it can reach all positions. So T=7 in this case. But how to find T.\n\nAnother idea: The frog can reach any position s ≥0, provided that s can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and s is reachable via some path that doesn't go out of bounds. For example, to reach s, the frog can go forward k times and backward l times. But the path must not go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut this seems too abstract. Perhaps we can find that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. For example, once x is large enough that the frog can reach any position by first moving forward enough times to get to a position from which it can subtract b's to reach the desired s.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we want to reach position s. The frog can first jump forward several times to reach a position that is greater than s, and then subtract b's to reach s. But during this process, the frog must not go below 0 or above x.\n\nFor example, if s is a multiple of d, and x is large enough that the frog can reach s by first jumping forward enough times to reach a position that is ≥s + b, then subtract b's until reaching s. But during this process, the frog must not exceed x.\n\nSo, if x is at least s + b, then this is possible. But since s can be up to x, this implies that x must be at least x + b, which is impossible. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, the frog can reach s by moving forward to s + k*b, then subtracting k*b. But this requires that s + k*b is ≤x. So, if x is large enough that there exists a k such that s + k*b ≤x, then this is possible. For example, if x is ≥s, then k=0 is sufficient. But this is trivial.\n\nBut this doesn't help. It seems that the problem is that for small x, the frog may not be able to reach certain positions even though they are multiples of d.\n\nBut how to find for which x the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nLet me think of the following: For the frog to be able to reach any position s, it must be possible to reach it by adding a's and subtracting b's, and during the process, the frog never goes out of bounds. This seems to depend on the ability to reach s from 0 through some sequence of jumps that don't go out of bounds.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that once the frog can reach both positions a and b, it can reach any position that is a multiple of d. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Let's imagine that the frog can reach any position s that is a multiple of d and s ≥0, provided that s can be expressed as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. This is equivalent to saying that s is in the set generated by the semigroup of a and -b. However, this set is not well-known, and it's unclear how to find its elements.\n\nBut given that a and b are coprime, this set should include all integers ≥ (some value). For example, in the case of a=5 and b=3, the set includes all integers ≥ 2 (since 2=5-3, and then adding 5's and subtracting 3's can reach any higher number).\n\nIf this is the case, then for x ≥ this value, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. For x < this value, it depends.\n\nBut how to find this value.\n\nThis seems related to the Frobenius number, which is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But in this case, the problem is different: the coefficients are not both non-negative. One is positive (k), the other is negative (l). So it's not the same as the classic Frobenius problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the frog can add a and subtract b, the problem is to find all integers that can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. Let's call this set S. What's the structure of S?\n\nFor example, if a=5 and b=3, then S contains 0 (k=0, l=0), 5 (k=1, l=0), 2 (k=1, l=1), 7 (k=2, l=1), 4 (k=2, l=2), 9 (k=3, l=2), 1 (k=1, l=2), 6 (k=2, l=3), 3 (k=1, l=3), 8 (k=3, l=3), etc. It seems that all integers >= 0 are in S. But wait, what about 0? Yes. 1 is in S. 2 is in S. 3 is in S (k=1, l=3: 5-3*3 = 5-9 = -4? No, that's not right. Wait, earlier example said that 3 is reachable. How?\n\nAh, earlier example said that from 4 (which is 5-3+5-3), then subtract 3 to get 1. Then from 1, add 5 to get 6. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. So yes, 3 is in S. So for a=5 and b=3, it seems that S contains all integers >= 0. So why for x=5, the frog can't reach 1, 3, 4?\n\nBecause the frog can't reach those positions without going out of bounds. For example, to reach 1, the frog would need to go from 0 →5 →2 →7 (which is outside x=5), then subtract 3 to get 4, then subtract 3 again to get 1. But during this process, the jump to 7 is outside x=5, which is not allowed. Hence, even though 1 is in S, it's not reachable for x=5.\n\nSo the problem is that for small x, even though the position is in S, the path to reach it may require going outside [0, x], which is not allowed.\n\nThus, for each x, the reachable positions are the subset of S ∩ [0, x] that can be reached via paths that stay within [0, x].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For each x, the reachable positions are those in S ∩ [0, x], and which are reachable from 0 without leaving [0, x]. \n\nTo find this, perhaps we can model the reachable positions as those in S ∩ [0, x] and which are >= (some value). But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position s in S ∩ [0, x] if s can be reached by a sequence of jumps that never go below 0 or above x. This seems to depend on x being large enough to allow for such a sequence.\n\nBut how to find this for all x.\n\nLet me think of the following: For any s in S, there exists a minimal x_s such that if x >= x_s, then s is reachable. For example, for s=1, x_s is 7 (as in the first sample). Once x >=7, the frog can reach 1.\n\nThus, for x >= x_s, s is counted in f(x). For x < x_s, it is not counted.\n\nBut how to find x_s for each s.\n\nThis seems too complex for large m.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nLet's consider that the frog can reach all positions in S ∩ [0, x] if x is large enough. Let's find the minimal x such that this is true. Let's call this threshold T. Once x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nFor x < T, we need to compute f(x) manually.\n\nBut how to compute T?\n\nAssuming that a and b are coprime, T could be a + b - 1. Or some other value.\n\nIn the first sample, a=5, b=3. T=7, which is a + b - 1 = 5 +3 -1 =7. So this fits. Let's see for other examples.\n\nTake a=4, b=5. They are coprime. Let's see what T could be. Suppose T is a + b -1 = 8. For x=8, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nFor example, to reach 1: 0 -> 4 -> 8 (add 4 twice), then subtract 5 (8-5=3), then subtract 5 again (3-5=-2, which is invalid). So this path is not allowed. Alternative path: 0 ->4 -> 8 (x=8), then subtract 5 to get 3. From 3, add 4 to get 7. Subtract 5 to get 2. Add 4 to get 6. Subtract 5 to get 1. So yes, for x=8, the frog can reach 1. Thus, T=8 in this case.\n\nSo it seems that T = a + b -1 may be the threshold. Once x >= T, the frog can reach all positions in S ∩ [0, x]. For x < T, it depends.\n\nIf this is true, then we can split the problem into two parts:\n\nFor x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nFor x < T, compute f(x) manually.\n\nBut how to compute T.\n\nLet me think: T is the minimal x such that for any s in S ∩ [0, x], the frog can reach it. Assuming a and b are coprime, T = a + b -1.\n\nBut how to prove this? Well, for any s in S ∩ [0, x], where x >= a + b -1, the frog can reach s by first reaching s + k*b (for some k), then subtracting b k times. But how to ensure that s + k*b <= x.\n\nFor example, choose k such that s + k*b is <= x. Since x >= a + b -1, and s is >=0, we can choose k = floor((x - s)/b). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the frog can reach any s by first jumping forward enough times to get to a position >= s, and then subtracting b as needed. For example, if the frog can reach a position >= s + b, then it can subtract b once to get to s + b - b = s. But this requires that the frog can reach a position >= s + b, and that this position is <= x.\n\nIf x >= s + b, then this is possible. But since s is <= x, then s + b could be up to x + b. But x >= T = a + b -1. So for s <= x, s + b <= x + b. But x >= a + b -1, so x + b >= a + b -1 + b = a + 2b -1. Not sure.\n\nThis line of thinking isn't leading me anywhere. Let's return to the initial plan.\n\nAssume that for x >= T = a + b -1, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1. For x < T, compute f(x) manually.\n\nBut how to compute T for general a and b.\n\nActually, T would depend on a and b, but for the purposes of solving the problem, perhaps we can set T = a + b -1. Let's proceed with this assumption and see if it works for the sample.\n\nIn the first sample, T = 5 + 3 -1 =7. For x >=7, f(x) = x +1. For x=7, the sample says f(7)=8, which is 7+1. So this fits. For x=5, which is less than T, we need to compute manually.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Compute a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, a' and b' are coprime.\n\n3.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to m.

This helps in efficiently calculating the number of reachable positions for smaller values.\n4. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of reachable positions for all values from 0 to `m` is computed by combining results from the BFS for smaller values and a direct formula for larger values.
