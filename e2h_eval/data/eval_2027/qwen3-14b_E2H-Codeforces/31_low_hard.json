Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need to find the minimal number of such cards required.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The target is to have the total sum be zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards (each with value between -x and x) that sum up to T. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible ways. Each card can contribute between -x and x. So for each card added, the maximum possible contribution towards T is x, and the minimum is -x.\n\nBut since we want the minimal number of cards, we need to maximize the contribution per card. So, for example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute as much as possible (x) towards it. Similarly, if T is negative, each card can contribute as little as possible (-x). However, there's a catch here. Because the sum of the new cards must exactly equal T.\n\nSo let's think of it this way: Let's say T is the required sum. Let's take absolute value of T, because the sign depends on whether we need to add positive or negative numbers.\n\nFor example, suppose T is 5, and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to +2. So how many cards do we need? Well, 5 divided by 2 is 2.5. Since we can't have half a card, we need 3 cards. Because 2*2=4 is less than 5, but 3*2=6. Wait, but 6 is more than 5. But how can we get exactly 5? Well, maybe using two cards of 2 and one of 1. But wait, the problem allows any numbers between -x and x. So the sum of k cards can be any integer between -k*x and k*x. So for T, the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|. Because if you have k cards, the maximum possible sum is k*x. So if |T| <= k*x, then it's possible. So the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x. But wait, let's check with examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Their sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So the required sum is -2. So the absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 = 1. So k is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2: 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Their sum is -4. T is 4. So |T| is 4. x is 3. So 4/3 is 1.333... so ceiling is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: if T is 5 and x is 2. Then |T| is 5. 5/2 is 2.5. Ceiling is 3. So 3 cards. Because 3*2=6. But how do you get 5? Well, two cards of 2 and one of 1. So yes. So the minimal number is 3.\n\nBut what if T is 0? Then no cards needed. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Let T be the negative of that sum. If T is zero, return 0. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach T, which is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the maximum possible sum with k cards is k*x. So for |T|, we need k such that k*x >= |T|. So the minimal k is ceil( |T| / x ). But since |T| can be divided by x, or not.\n\nBut let me check some examples:\n\nIf |T| is 4 and x is 3. Then 4/3 is 1.333, so ceil is 2. So 2 cards. Which would allow 3 + 1 = 4. So yes.\n\nBut what if |T| is 3 and x is 3. Then 3/3 = 1. So k=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the current sum. This is because the total sum of all cards (found and new) must be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero target sum, compute the minimum number of cards required. This is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by the maximum absolute value on a card (x). This ensures that the sum of the new cards can reach the target sum using the fewest cards possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        nums = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        total = sum(nums)\n        target = -total\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        min_cards = math.ceil(abs_target / x)\n        print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, handling multiple test cases if present.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine the target sum needed from the new cards.\n- **Target Adjustment**: If the target sum is zero, no cards are needed. Otherwise, the minimum number of cards is calculated by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum card value (x), rounding up to ensure the sum can be achieved.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum number of cards required using basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
