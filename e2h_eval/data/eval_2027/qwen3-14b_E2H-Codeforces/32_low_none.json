    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is defined as the max minus min of the array. So, I need to figure out which element to remove so that when I take the remaining elements, their max and min difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think. The initial idea is that the instability of the original array is max(a) - min(a). But when we remove one element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nWell, if the element we remove is either the current maximum or the current minimum, then the new max or min would be adjusted. But if there are multiple instances of the max or min, removing one might not change the overall max or min.\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], the original max is 7 and min is 1. If we remove 7, the new max is 3, min is 1, so instability is 2. If we remove 1, the new min is 3, max is 7, instability is 4. So removing the max here gives a better result.\n\nBut how do I find which element to remove? Well, perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the first occurrence of the max or the first occurrence of the min, but maybe not. Wait, but maybe the best way is to consider all possibilities where removing an element could affect the max or min.\n\nBut considering all possibilities for each element would be O(n^2), which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think. The key observation here is that the minimal instability after removing one element can be found by considering the cases where the removed element is either the current maximum or the current minimum. However, there might be other cases where removing an element that's not the max or min could help. Wait, but if the array has multiple elements, then the max and min are fixed. For example, suppose the array is sorted. Let's say it's sorted as a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n. Then, the original instability is a_n - a_1. If I remove a_1, the new instability is a_n - a_2. If I remove a_n, the instability is a_{n-1} - a_1. If I remove any element in between, say a_i where 1 < i < n, then the instability would be a_n - a_1 (since the max and min remain the same). So in this case, the best option is to remove either the first element or the last element. But wait, that's only if the array is sorted. So maybe the optimal approach is to sort the array first.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when you remove an element, the max and min of the remaining elements could be different. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 4, 7], then removing 3 gives the array [1,4,7], instability 6. Removing 4 gives [1,3,7], instability 6. But if you remove 7, the instability is 3-1=2. So the best is to remove the max. So in this case, the optimal is to remove the max or the min, depending on which gives a smaller instability.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is: after sorting the array, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (max of the array after removing the first element) - (min of the array after removing the first element) and (max of the array after removing the last element) - (min of the array after removing the last element). But wait, when you remove the first element, the new min is the second element, and the new max is the last element. Similarly, when you remove the last element, the new max is the second to last element, and the min is the first element. So in that case, the instability would be (a[n-1] - a[1]) if you remove the first element, and (a[n-2] - a[0]) if you remove the last element. Wait, but if the array is sorted, then the original max is a[-1], and the original min is a[0]. So when you remove the first element, the new min is a[1], and the new max is a[-1]. So instability is a[-1] - a[1]. When you remove the last element, the new max is a[-2], and the new min is a[0], so instability is a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between these two options. But what about if there are other elements that can be removed to get a better instability?\n\nWait, for example, if the array is [1,",
    "response": "To solve the problem of minimizing the instability of an array after removing exactly one element, we need to efficiently determine which element's removal leads to the smallest difference between the maximum and minimum values of the remaining elements.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **Instability Definition**: The instability is defined as `max(a) - min(a)` for the array `a`.\n\n2. **Impact of Removing Elements**:\n   - If the array is sorted, removing the first or last element (i.e., the current min or max) can potentially reduce the instability.\n   - However, removing any other element from the middle of the sorted array doesn’t change the max or min, hence the instability remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Optimal Strategy**:\n   - Sort the array.\n   - Consider two main scenarios:\n     - Remove the first element: new instability = `a[-1] - a[1]`\n     - Remove the last element: new instability = `a[-2] - a[0]`\n   - These two cases cover the best possible reductions in instability since any other removal would not affect the global max or min.\n\n---\n\n### Efficient Algorithm\n\n- **Time Complexity**: Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`, and computing the minimal instability is `O(1)` after sorting.\n\n- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the array, which is acceptable for `n ≤ 10^5`.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation in Python\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    # Compute the minimal instability by removing either the first or last element\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    \n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Execution\n\n**Input:**\n```\n4\n1 3 3 7\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n2\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- Sorted array: `[1, 3, 3, 7]`\n- Option 1: Remove 1 → instability = `7 - 3 = 4`\n- Option 2: Remove 7 → instability = `3 - 1 = 2`\n- Minimum is `2`.\n\n---\n\nThis approach ensures optimal performance and correctness for all valid input sizes within the constraints.",
