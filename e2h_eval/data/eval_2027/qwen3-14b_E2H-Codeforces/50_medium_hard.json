    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand the problem first.\n\nThe problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. A good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1, and for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i is -1. \n\nFirst, let's parse the requirements for a good tree. Each vertex must have the product of its incident edges equal to -1. Since each edge connects two vertices, the product for each vertex depends on the edges connected to it. \n\nLet me think about the implications. For any tree, each edge is part of exactly two vertices' products. So if I consider all vertices, the product of all their individual products would be (-1)^n. But each edge is counted twice in this product (once for each endpoint). So the overall product would be the product of all edges' weights raised to the power of 2. Because each edge is multiplied twice. But the product of all edges' weights squared is 1, since any number squared is 1. However, the product of all the vertex products is (-1)^n. Therefore, (-1)^n must equal 1, which implies that n must be even? Wait, but this is a contradiction unless n is even. Wait, but the problem says that n can be any positive integer. So how does that work?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me re-express this. Let me denote for each vertex i, the product of the edges adjacent to i is -1. Let me take the product of all these products over all vertices. That product would be (-1)^n. On the other hand, each edge is adjacent to exactly two vertices. So each edge's weight is multiplied twice into this product. Therefore, the product of all vertex products is the product of (each edge's weight)^2. Since each edge is counted twice. So the product is (product of all edge weights)^2. Which is 1, because any number squared is 1. Therefore, (-1)^n must equal 1. Which implies that n must be even. Otherwise, there are no good trees. \n\nSo for example, when n is odd, there are no good trees. Therefore, the answer for n odd is zero. But looking at the sample input, when n=2 (even), there is one good tree. For n=1, the problem says n is positive. But for n=1, there are no edges. So the product for the single vertex is the product of zero edges. What is the product of zero elements? Well, that's 1. But the condition requires it to be -1. Therefore, for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is zero. \n\nSo for n=1, output is zero. For n even, there might be some trees. For n odd, output is zero. Wait, but the second sample input is n=1, and the output is 0. Which matches that. \n\nSo the first thing to check is whether n is even. If it's odd, return 0. Also, if n=1, return 0. \n\nBut wait, what about n=2? For n=2, the tree is a single edge. The product for each vertex is the weight of the single edge. So for each vertex, the product must be -1. So the edge weight must be -1. So the only possible tree is the one with edge weight -1. Then d(1,2) is -1. Which matches the first sample. \n\nSo the first step is: if n is odd, return 0. Also, for n=1, return 0. \n\nNow, assuming n is even, how do we compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees?\n\nBut how many good trees are there? And how to compute the sum?\n\nLet me think about the constraints of a good tree. Each vertex has product of incident edges equal to -1. Let's think about the degrees of the tree. But the tree is arbitrary in structure, but with edge weights. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this. Let me think: For each edge, it's either +1 or -1. Let me think about the product conditions. Let me consider that each vertex's product is -1. Let me take the product of all edges adjacent to a vertex. Let me call this product P_i = -1 for each i. \n\nNow, for any tree, the product of P_i for all i is (-1)^n. But as before, that product is also equal to the product of all edge weights squared, which is 1. Therefore, (-1)^n must be 1. Which implies that n is even. So for even n, there can be good trees. \n\nSo the problem reduces to n even. Now, how to count the number of such trees and compute the sum of d(1,n) over them?\n\nBut the problem isn't to count them, but to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all such trees. \n\nSo perhaps we can find a way to model the constraints and compute the expectation or something similar. \n\nLet me think about the structure of the good trees. \n\nEach tree must satisfy that for every vertex, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let me note that the product of the edges around a vertex is -1. \n\nLet me consider that for a tree, the number of edges is n-1. For each edge, it contributes to two vertices. \n\nLet me think of the variables. Let me assign variables to the edges. Let me say that each edge e has a weight w_e âˆˆ {1, -1}. \n\nFor each vertex v, the product of the w_e for edges adjacent to v is -1. \n\nThis gives us a system of equations. However, since the tree is connected, perhaps these equations are not independent. Let me check. \n\nSuppose we have a tree with n vertices. Let me take the product of all the equations. As before, the product of all P_i is (-1)^n. But the product of all P_i is also the product of all w_e^degree(e) ? No, each edge is in exactly two vertices. So each w_e is multiplied twice. Thus, the product of all P_i is product_{e} w_e^2 = 1. Therefore, the product of all equations is (-1)^n = 1. Which requires that n is even. \n\nSo for even n, the equations are consistent. However, how many independent equations are there? \n\nIn a tree, there are n-1 edges. Each equation corresponds to a vertex. However, the product of all equations is 1. So the equations are not all independent. For example, if we know the equations for n-1 vertices, the nth equation is determined. \n\nTherefore, the number of constraints is n-1. \n\nBut how to model this? For example, for a tree, the system of equations is over-constrained except for the fact that the product of all equations is 1. So, for a given tree structure (i.e., the set of edges), how many ways are there to assign the edge weights so that all the vertex conditions are satisfied?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I fix the tree structure. How many valid assignments of edge weights are there?\n\nEach assignment must satisfy that for each vertex, the product of its adjacent edges is -1. Let me think of this as a system of equations. Each equation is the product of variables (edges) adjacent to a vertex equals -1. \n\nLet me take the example of n=2. There's one edge. The product for vertex 1 is w1 = -1. Similarly for vertex 2. So the only solution is w1=-1. So exactly 1 assignment. \n\nAnother example: n=4. Let's imagine a tree structure. Suppose it's a star with vertex 1 connected to 2,3,4. Then for vertex 1, the product of edges (w12 * w13 * w14) = -1. For each of vertices 2,3,4, their product is just the weight of their single edge (since they have degree 1). So for vertex 2: w12 = -1. Similarly, vertex 3: w13 = -1. Vertex 4: w14 = -1. Then the product for vertex 1 is (-1)^3 = -1. Which satisfies the condition. So this is a valid assignment. So for this tree structure, there is exactly one valid assignment of edge weights. \n\nBut how about another tree structure? Suppose the tree is a chain: 1-2-3-4. Let's see. Let's denote edges as e1 (1-2), e2 (2-3), e3 (3-4). \n\nFor each vertex:\n\nVertex 1: e1 â†’ product is e1 = -1 â†’ e1 = -1.\n\nVertex 2: e1 * e2 = -1 â†’ (-1) * e2 = -1 â†’ e2 = 1.\n\nVertex 3: e2 * e3 = -1 â†’ 1 * e3 = -1 â†’ e3 = -1.\n\nVertex 4: e3 = -1 â†’ which is correct. \n\nSo this gives exactly one assignment. \n\nSo for any tree structure, there is exactly one assignment of edge weights that satisfies the conditions. \n\nWait, that seems to be the case. Because for any tree, the equations can be solved uniquely once we fix the tree structure. \n\nBut why? Let's think about the system of equations. Suppose we have a tree. Let me pick a root, say, node 1. Then, for each node, the product of the edges along the path from the root to that node can be determined. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of the tree as a graph. Let me pick an arbitrary spanning tree. Then, for each edge, we can assign variables. But the equations are such that each vertex has product of edges equal to -1. \n\nBut for a tree with n nodes, there are n-1 edges. The system of equations for the vertices is such that the product of edges adjacent to each vertex is -1. However, since the product of all equations is 1, which holds for even n, then the system is consistent and has solutions. \n\nBut how many solutions? Let me think. Suppose we have a tree structure. Let me think of the variables as the edge weights. Each equation is multiplicative. \n\nLet me take the example of a tree. Let me consider that the equations are over GF(2), but with multiplicative factors. Wait, perhaps it's easier to take logarithms, but since the values are Â±1, we can model them as elements of the multiplicative group {+1, -1}, which is isomorphic to GF(2) under addition. \n\nLet me take the logarithm in the multiplicative group. Let me map -1 to 1, and 1 to 0. Then, the product of edges becomes the sum modulo 2. \n\nSo for each vertex, the sum (mod 2) of the variables (edge weights converted to 0 and 1) adjacent to it must be 1. Because the product of the edges is -1, which corresponds to the sum being 1 mod 2. \n\nSo this transforms the problem into a system of linear equations over GF(2). \n\nLet me denote for each edge e, a variable x_e âˆˆ {0, 1}, where x_e = 0 corresponds to weight 1, and x_e = 1 corresponds to weight -1. \n\nThen, for each vertex v, the sum of x_e over all edges adjacent to v is equal to 1 mod 2. \n\nNow, this is a system of linear equations over GF(2). \n\nThe question is: how many solutions does this system have? \n\nIn GF(2), the system is Ax = b, where A is the incidence matrix of the tree (but with entries mod 2), and b is a vector of all 1s. \n\nBut for a tree, the incidence matrix has rank n-1. However, the sum of all rows of the incidence matrix is zero mod 2. Because each edge is incident to two vertices, so each column has exactly two 1s. Therefore, the sum of all rows would be a vector where each entry is the degree of the vertex mod 2. But for a tree, the sum of degrees is 2(n-1), which is 0 mod 2. However, the sum of the rows of the incidence matrix would be a vector with all entries 0 mod 2. \n\nBut in our case, the system is Ax = 1, where 1 is the all-ones vector. \n\nBut the sum of the equations (rows of A) is 0 mod 2. However, the sum of the right-hand side is n mod 2. \n\nSo for the system to be solvable, we must have that n mod 2 is 0. Which is true since we are considering even n. \n\nThus, the system has solutions. \n\nNow, the rank of the incidence matrix of a tree is n-1. However, in GF(2), the rank of the incidence matrix of a tree is n-1 if the tree is connected. But since the tree is connected, the rank is n-1. However, the system Ax = b has solutions. \n\nBut how many solutions? \n\nThe number of solutions is 2^(k), where k is the dimension of the null space of A. The rank of A is n-1, so the null space has dimension (number of variables) - rank. The variables are the edges, which are n-1. So the null space dimension is (n-1) - (n-1) ) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the system is Ax = b, and the matrix A is (n x (n-1))? No, the incidence matrix of a tree has n rows (vertices) and n-1 columns (edges). \n\nBut the rank of the incidence matrix of a connected graph is n-1. However, in GF(2), the rank of the incidence matrix of a tree is n-1 if the tree has at least one edge. \n\nSo the system Ax = b has solutions. The number of solutions is 2^{d}, where d is the dimension of the null space. The null space is the set of solutions to Ax = 0. \n\nBut since the rank is n-1, and the number of variables is n-1, the null space has dimension 0. Therefore, the system Ax = b has exactly one solution. \n\nWait, that would mean that for each tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights. Which aligns with the examples we considered earlier. \n\nSo, for any given tree structure, there is exactly one assignment of edge weights that makes it a good tree. \n\nTherefore, the total number of good trees is equal to the number of possible tree structures multiplied by 1. Because for each tree structure, exactly one assignment of weights. \n\nBut the problem states that the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}, which is Cayley's formula multiplied by 2^{n-1} (for each edge's weight). \n\nBut according to our analysis, the number of good trees is equal to the number of tree structures (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1 (the number of valid weight assignments per structure). So the total number of good trees is n^{n-2}. \n\nBut this is only for even n. For odd n, it's zero. \n\nSo now, the problem reduces to: for even n â‰¥ 2, compute the sum over all trees (structures) of d(1, n) for the unique weight assignment that makes the tree good. \n\nSo the key is to find, for each tree structure, the value of d(1,n) under the unique weight assignment that satisfies the good tree conditions. Then sum all those values. \n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently? \n\nLet me think about the properties of d(1,n). \n\nd(u, v) is the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from u to v. \n\nIn the case of a good tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the tree structure. So for each tree structure, we have a certain path from 1 to n, and the sum of the weights along that path. \n\nThe challenge is to find the sum of these sums across all possible tree structures. \n\nBut considering that n can be up to 5e5, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution. \n\nLet me think of generating functions or combinatorial interpretations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the expected value of d(1,n) multiplied by the number of trees. \n\nBut how? Let me think of linearity of expectation. Suppose that for each edge, we can compute the contribution of that edge to the sum over all trees. \n\nBut since for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined, perhaps we can find for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path between 1 and n, multiplied by the weight of e in that tree. \n\nBut the problem is that for each tree, the weight of e depends on the tree's structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the expected value of d(1,n) over all trees (with the unique weight assignment), multiplied by the total number of trees (n^{n-2} ), which is the total number of good trees. \n\nSo, let me denote that S is the required sum. Then S = (sum over all trees T) [d_T(1,n)], where d_T is the distance in the tree T with the unique weight assignment. \n\nSo, perhaps we can find E[d_T(1,n)] * total_trees, where total_trees = n^{n-2}.\n\nBut how to compute E[d_T(1,n)]? \n\nLet me think about the properties of the unique weight assignment. \n\nFor a given tree structure T, the edge weights are determined by the constraints. Let me think about how to compute the weight of an edge. \n\nLet me consider the tree as a graph. Let me pick any root, say node 1. Then, for each node, we can perform a traversal and determine the edge weights based on the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: for each vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1. Let me consider that for each node, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose I have a tree rooted at 1. For each child of the root, I can assign the edge weight in a way that satisfies the constraints. \n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me think of the tree as a graph, and the weight of each edge is determined by the product conditions. \n\nLet me take an example. For a tree, the unique assignment of weights can be found by choosing a root (say, node 1), and then for each node, assign the edge weights in a way that ensures that the product for the parent and child nodes are satisfied. \n\nFor example, let's consider the root node 1. It has some children. Let me suppose that the root has degree k. The product of all edges adjacent to the root must be -1. Let me denote the edges from the root to its children as e_1, e_2, ..., e_k. Then, the product of these edges is -1. \n\nNow, for each child, say node v, which is connected to the root via edge e. The product of edges adjacent to v must be -1. Since v has degree 1 (if it's a leaf) or more. But if it's a leaf, then the product is just e, so e must be -1. \n\nBut this suggests that the weight of the edge from the root to a leaf must be -1. \n\nBut then, for the root, the product of all edges (including those to leaves and non-leaves) must be -1. \n\nThis seems complex. Perhaps there's a general formula for the weight of an edge in terms of the degrees of the nodes. \n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the degrees. \n\nWait, but in the system of equations over GF(2), each equation says that the sum of the variables (x_e) adjacent to a vertex is 1 mod 2. \n\nLet me think of the system again. The variables x_e are the edge weights (converted to 0 and 1). \n\nSo, for each vertex v, sum_{e adjacent to v} x_e = 1 mod 2. \n\nThis is a system of equations. For a tree, the system has a unique solution. \n\nLet me think of the solution. For example, in the case of a tree rooted at node 1, we can assign the variables as follows. For each node, the x_e from the parent to the node is determined by the equations. \n\nLet me take a root node 1. Let me traverse the tree in a BFS manner. For each node, once we have processed its parent, we can determine the x_e for the edge between parent and node. \n\nFor example, suppose we have a parent node u and a child node v. Let me denote the edge between them as e. \n\nAt the time of processing v, we have already processed u. Let me consider the equations for u and for v. \n\nFor u, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to u must be 1 mod 2. Let me assume that u has already been processed, and all edges except e (the one to v) have been assigned x values. Then, the x_e for the edge between u and v is determined by the equation for u. \n\nBut for the node v, once we assign x_e, then we can proceed to process its children. \n\nBut how does this work? Let me think. \n\nLet me take the root node 1. Initially, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to 1 must be 1 mod 2. However, initially, none of the edges are assigned. So, during traversal, when we process the children of the root, we can assign their edge variables. \n\nBut this seems recursive. Let me think of the root node. Suppose it has degree d. The sum of all edges adjacent to the root must be 1 mod 2. However, each of those edges is connected to a child. \n\nLet me take the root node 1. For each of its children, say, node v. When we process node v, we can assign the edge between 1 and v. \n\nLet me think of the root's equation. Suppose that the root has k children. Let me process each child in turn. For each child, after processing, the edge between the root and the child is determined. However, the root's equation requires that the sum of all edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. \n\nBut how can this be done? Because when processing the first child, we can assign the edge's x value. But then, when processing the next child, we need to adjust the x value based on the previous assignments. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system can be solved by choosing a root and assigning the variables in such a way that for each node, the equation is satisfied. \n\nLet me consider the following approach. For the root node, which has degree d. Let me assign the variables for the edges from the root to its children. Suppose that the root has k children. For each child, the edge between the root and the child is determined by the equations for the child. \n\nFor example, for the child v, which is connected to the root. The equation for v is that the sum of its adjacent edges is 1. Since v is connected to the root (edge e) and possibly other edges (to its children). \n\nBut during traversal, when we process v, we can assume that all edges except the ones to its children are already processed. \n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the x_e for each edge in terms of the degrees of the nodes. \n\nBut I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the problem differently. \n\nSince the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees is equal to the sum over all trees T (structure) of d_T(1,n), where d_T(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n in T. \n\nLet me think about the contribution of each edge to this sum. \n\nFor each edge e, how many trees T have e on the path from 1 to n, and what is the sign (weight) of e in those trees? \n\nIf I can compute for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the weight of e in those trees, then summing over all edges will give the total sum S. \n\nBut how to find this for each edge e?\n\nLet me think about the following. For any edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of trees that contain e and where 1 and n are in different components when e is removed. \n\nBut since the tree is connected, removing e splits it into two components. Let me denote that when e is removed, the tree splits into two subtrees. Let me assume that e connects nodes u and v. Let me assume that one of the subtrees contains node 1 and the other contains node n. Or vice versa. \n\nBut for a given edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees that contain e and for which e lies on the path between 1 and n. \n\nBut how to count that? \n\nAlternatively, for any edge e, the number of trees that include e is equal to the number of trees where e is present. But since all trees are considered, regardless of their structure, perhaps there's a formula. \n\nBut Cayley's formula counts the number of trees. For a labeled tree, the number of trees that contain a specific edge e is n^{n-3} * 2? Or perhaps another way. \n\nWait, there's a known formula for the number of trees containing a specific edge. For labeled trees, the number of trees that include a specific edge between u and v is n^{n-3} * 2? Or perhaps it's n^{n-3} multiplied by something else. \n\nActually, the number of labeled trees on n nodes that contain a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 1. Because the total number of trees is n^{n-2}. And the number of trees containing any particular edge is (n-1) * n^{n-3} }? Wait, no. \n\nWait, there's a theorem called the \"Cayley's formula for the number of trees containing a specific edge\". \n\nThe number of labeled trees on n nodes that contain a specific edge between u and v is n^{n-3} * 1. Because, when you contract the edge u-v into a single node, the number of trees becomes (n-1)^{n-3} ? No, perhaps it's better to think of it as follows. \n\nThe total number of trees is n^{n-2}. For any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees where u and v are connected by an edge is (n-1) * n^{n-3} ? \n\nAlternatively, the number of trees containing edge uv is (n^{n-2}) * (number of edges / total number of possible edges) ? But that's not accurate. \n\nWait, for a labeled tree, the number of edges is n-1. Each tree has exactly n-1 edges. The total number of possible edges is C(n,2). \n\nBut the average number of trees containing any particular edge is (n^{n-2} * (n-1)) ) / C(n,2) ) ?\n\nBut this might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, there's a formula: the number of trees containing a specific edge uv is n^{n-3} * 2. Wait, I recall that the number of trees that contain a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 2? Or perhaps n^{n-3}? \n\nActually, there's a way to think of it as follows. Let's consider the number of trees that contain the edge uv. We can think of the tree as consisting of the edge uv, and then the rest of the tree is a tree on the two subtrees formed by removing uv. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to use PrÃ¼fer codes. \n\nIn the PrÃ¼fer code of a tree, each node's occurrence count is equal to its degree minus 1. The edge between u and v is present in the tree if and only if u appears in the PrÃ¼fer code or v appears in the PrÃ¼fer code. Wait, no. The PrÃ¼fer code represents the tree as a sequence of n-2 elements. Each element corresponds to the neighbor of the node with the smallest label that is removed. \n\nAlternatively, the number of trees that include a specific edge uv is (n-2) * n^{n-4} }? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of the number of trees that contain edge uv. Let's imagine that we fix the edge uv. Then, the tree can be viewed as a tree on n nodes where uv is present. To count the number of such trees, we can consider that once uv is fixed, the rest of the tree can be considered as connecting the remaining n-2 nodes to the two nodes u and v. \n\nThis is equivalent to considering that the tree is formed by connecting the rest of the nodes to the subtree consisting of u and v. \n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think that the number of trees containing edge uv is equal to the number of trees on n nodes multiplied by the probability that a random tree contains edge uv. \n\nWhat is the probability that a random tree contains edge uv? \n\nWell, for any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees containing edge uv is equal to the number of trees where u and v are adjacent. \n\nIn a random tree, the probability that u and v are adjacent is (number of trees containing uv) / total number of trees. \n\nBut according to the formula, the number of trees containing uv is n^{n-3} * 2? \n\nWait, I remember that for any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees that contain the edge uv is n^{n-3} * 2. \n\nWait, no. Let me think of n=2. The number of trees containing the only possible edge is 1. According to the formula n^{n-3} * 2: 2^{2-3} * 2 = 2^{-1} * 2 = 1. Which matches. For n=3, the number of trees containing a specific edge is 2. The total number of trees is 3^{3-2} = 3. For each edge, there are exactly 2 trees containing it. For example, the three trees are the three possible edges. Each tree contains exactly one edge. So for a specific edge, there is 1 tree. Wait, this contradicts the earlier idea. \n\nAh, I think I made a mistake. For n=3, the total number of trees is 3^{3-2} = 3. Each tree is a single edge. So for a specific edge uv, there is exactly one tree that contains it. So the formula for the number of trees containing a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 1? For n=3, 3^{0} * 1 = 1, which is correct. For n=2, 2^{-1} * 1? No, that's 0.5. Which is wrong. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. \n\nLet me think again. For a labeled tree, the number of trees that contain a specific edge uv is equal to (n-2) * n^{n-3} ? Or perhaps not. \n\nWait, there's a formula that for any two nodes u and v, the number of trees where u and v are adjacent is (n-2) * n^{n-3} }? \n\nNo, for n=2, this would give (0)*n^{-1} = 0, which is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the number of trees containing edge uv is n^{n-3} * 2? For n=2, 2^{2-3} * 2 = 1, which is correct. For n=3, 3^{0} * 2 = 2. But in reality, for n=3, there are 3 trees, each containing exactly one edge. So for a specific edge uv, the number of trees containing it is 1. Which contradicts the formula. \n\nHmm, this suggests that I need to find another approach. \n\nLet me think about the number of trees containing edge uv. \n\nWhen building a tree, the number of trees that include edge uv can be calculated by considering that once we include uv, the tree can be viewed as combining the two subtrees rooted at u and v. \n\nAlternatively, using the fact that for any tree, the number of trees containing a particular edge is equal to the number of ways to form a tree on n nodes where that edge is present. \n\nLet me consider that the edge uv is present. To form a tree, we need to connect the remaining n-2 nodes to the rest of the tree. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, I recall that in a random labeled tree, the probability that two specific nodes u and v are connected by an edge is 2/(n). \n\nFor example, for n=2, it's 1, which is 2/2 = 1. For n=3, the probability is 2/3. Since there are 3 trees, each with one edge. For a specific pair of nodes, there is one tree where they are connected, and two trees where they are not. So the probability is 1/3. But 2/n for n=3 is 2/3. So this contradicts. \n\nWait, this suggests that the probability is 2/(n). But for n=3, it's 1/3, not 2/3. So this is incorrect. \n\nI think I need to look for another way. \n\nLet me think of the number of trees that contain edge uv as follows: \n\nConsider that in a labeled tree, the number of trees where u and v are connected by an edge is equal to the number of ways to choose the rest of the tree. Once we have the edge uv, the tree can be viewed as a tree on n-1 nodes (u and v are merged into a single node?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the number of trees containing edge uv is equal to the number of trees on n-1 nodes multiplied by something. \n\nWait, here's a method: the number of trees containing edge uv is equal to the number of ways to build a tree on n nodes such that uv is an edge. This can be calculated as follows: \n\nWe can think of the tree as consisting of the edge uv, and then the rest of the tree is formed by attaching the remaining n-2 nodes to the existing structure. \n\nBut this doesn't directly help. \n\nAlternatively, using the concept of PrÃ¼fer sequences. In a PrÃ¼fer sequence, each node's label appears exactly (degree - 1) times. \n\nFor the edge uv to be present in the tree, u and v must be adjacent. This means that in the PrÃ¼fer sequence, one of u or v must appear exactly once less than their degree, and the other must appear similarly. \n\nBut this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, for the edge uv to be present, there must be a step in the PrÃ¼fer sequence generation where either u or v is removed. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the number of trees containing edge uv is equal to the number of ways to choose a tree on n nodes where u and v are adjacent. \n\nLet me think of it as follows: For any tree, the number of edges is n-1. The total number of trees is n^{n-2}. \n\nThe total number of edges across all trees is n^{n-2} * (n-1). \n\nBut the total number of possible edges is C(n, 2). \n\nIf the distribution is uniform (which it may not be), then the number of trees containing edge uv would be (n^{n-2} * (n-1)) / C(n, 2) ). \n\nFor example, for n=3, this would be (3^{1} * 2) / 3 = (3*2)/3 = 2. But earlier, we know that there are 3 trees, each with one edge, so for a specific edge, there is 1 tree. So this formula gives 2, which is wrong. \n\nSo this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm. This seems like a dead end. \n\nLet me return to the original problem. We need to find for each tree T, the value of d_T(1,n), and sum over all T. \n\nBut perhaps there's a clever observation about the sum. \n\nLet me think about the unique weight assignment for a tree. For each tree, the weight of each edge is determined by the system of equations. \n\nLet me think of the weight of an edge e as being determined by the parity of the number of nodes in some way. \n\nAlternatively, since the system of equations is over GF(2), and the solution is unique, perhaps the weight of each edge can be expressed as a function of the degrees of the nodes. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nLet me think of the system again. For each vertex v, the sum of x_e (over edges adjacent to v) is 1 mod 2. \n\nThis is a system of equations with a unique solution. Let me try to find the solution for a tree. \n\nLet me consider the tree as a rooted tree at node 1. For each node, I can determine the x_e for the edge connecting it to its parent. \n\nLet me define for each node v (except the root), the edge from v to its parent",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distances $d(1, n)$ for all good edge-weighted trees with $n$ vertices. A good tree is defined such that each vertex has the product of the weights of its incident edges equal to -1, and each edge weight is either 1 or -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: For a tree to be good, each vertex must have the product of its incident edge weights equal to -1. This implies that the number of vertices $n$ must be even because the product of all vertex products must be 1 (since each edge is counted twice), which only holds true if $n$ is even.\n2. **Tree Structure and Edge Weights**: For any given tree structure, there is exactly one valid assignment of edge weights that satisfies the conditions of a good tree. This is derived from solving a system of linear equations over GF(2).\n3. **Sum of Distances**: The sum of distances $d(1, n)$ across all valid trees can be computed using combinatorial insights. The key insight is that for each edge in the tree, its contribution to the sum can be determined based on the number of trees where it lies on the path between nodes 1 and n.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute powers of n modulo MOD\n    power_n_n_minus_2 = pow(n, n-2, MOD)\n    \n    # The answer is (n^{n-2} * (-1)^{k}) summed over all trees, but here we found that it's 0 except for specific cases\n    # However, from the analysis, the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees is zero for even n > 1?\n    # Wait, no.
