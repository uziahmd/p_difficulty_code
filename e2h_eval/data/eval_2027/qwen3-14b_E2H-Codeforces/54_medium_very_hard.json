Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the geometry behind this. Let me think about regular polygons and angles formed by their vertices.\n\nIn a regular n-gon, each internal angle can be calculated. Wait, but the problem isn't about the internal angles of the polygon itself. Instead, it's about choosing three vertices where one is the vertex of the angle, and the other two are on the sides of that angle.\n\nLet me recall that in a regular polygon, the central angles are 360/n degrees. But how does that relate to the angles formed by three vertices?\n\nLet me think: Suppose we have a regular polygon with n sides. Let's pick a vertex v2. Then, the other two vertices v1 and v3 must lie on the sides of the angle at v2. So, the angle between the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 is what we're trying to compute.\n\nBut how do we calculate that angle? For a regular polygon, the angle depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2. For example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 (say, next vertex clockwise), and v3 is k steps away counter-clockwise, then the angle formed would be determined by the arc between them.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a formula for this. Let me think about the regular polygon inscribed in a circle. Since it's regular, all vertices lie on a circle. The angle at v2 would be an inscribed angle. But wait, the angle formed by three points on a circle depends on the arc between them.\n\nWait, the central angle corresponding to the arc between v1 and v3 would be some value, and the inscribed angle would be half of that. But I'm not sure if that applies here directly. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider the case of a regular polygon. Let's take a regular n-gon. For any three vertices v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the vertex of the angle. Let me imagine the polygon is inscribed in a unit circle. The angle at v2 is formed by the lines v2v1 and v2v3.\n\nThe key here is to find the measure of this angle. Let's suppose that between v1 and v2, there are k steps in one direction, and m steps in the other direction. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon through v2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving along the perimeter. Let me think: If I fix v2 as the vertex of the angle, then v1 and v3 are two other vertices such that when you go from v1 to v2 to v3, you're moving around the polygon. The angle at v2 is determined by how far apart v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nFor example, in a regular pentagon (n=5), if I choose v2 as the middle vertex, and v1 is adjacent to v2 clockwise, and v3 is two steps counter-clockwise from v2, then the angle at v2 would be something. How do I calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for the angle formed at v2 by two other vertices. Let me think about the central angles. Let's say that between v2 and v1, there are k steps (i.e., the arc between them is k*(360/n) degrees). Similarly, between v2 and v3, there are m steps. But since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 would be determined by the arcs between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon through the opposite side of v2. For instance, if between v1 and v3 there are k edges (so the arc between them is k*(360/n) degrees), then the angle at v2 would be half of that arc. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle subtended by an arc is half the central angle. But wait, that's only if the angle is formed by two chords from a point on the circumference. So, if v1 and v3 are two points on the circle, and v2 is another point on the circumference, then the angle at v2 between v1 and v3 would be equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Or maybe the other way around?\n\nWait, let me recall: The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is θ degrees, then the angle at v2 is θ/2. But if the arc that contains v2 is the one intercepted, then it would be different. Wait, no. The intercepted arc is the one that's opposite the angle. So, for example, if you have points A, B, C on a circle, with angle ABC. Then the intercepted arc is AC that does not contain B. So the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc AC that does not contain B.\n\nSo, in our case, if v2 is the vertex of the angle, then the intercepted arc between v1 and v3 is the arc that does not contain v2. The length of that arc depends on how far apart v1 and v3 are.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 will be (k * 360/n) degrees, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along that arc. Wait, but how do we find k?\n\nLet me think: For a regular n-gon, the total number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 depends on the positions. Let's assume that v1 and v3 are positioned such that the arc between them not containing v2 has k edges. Since the polygon is regular, the number of edges between v1 and v3 along that arc is (some value). For example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent, then the arc between them is 1 edge. But if they are opposite, then it's n/2 edges (if n is even).\n\nBut how to find this k for any given v1 and v3?\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed v2, if I choose v1 and v3 such that there are m steps between v2 and v1 in one direction, and m steps between v2 and v3 in the other direction. Wait, no. Let me think of the case where v2 is fixed, and v1 is k steps away in one direction, and v3 is l steps away in the other direction. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 would be (k + l) steps. Because moving from v1 to v2 is k steps, and from v2 to v3 is l steps in the other direction. Then the arc that doesn't contain v2 is the rest of the polygon, which would be n - (k + l) steps. Wait, but this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, for the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2, the number of edges is (n - (d + 1)), where d is the distance between v1 and v3 along the arc that passes through v2. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a circle. For a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. Now, suppose that from vertex v2, we pick two other vertices v1 and v3 such that between v1 and v3, there are k edges along the arc that does not pass through v2. Then the central angle for that arc is k*(360/n) degrees. Then the angle at v2 (the inscribed angle) would be half of that, so (k*180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, that seems promising. So the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. But how to find k?\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, for any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must have a certain number of edges. Let me think of the possible values of k. Since the polygon is convex, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 must be longer than or equal to 2 edges? Or maybe not. For example, if the polygon is a triangle (n=3), then any three vertices are all connected. So if v2 is one vertex, then v1 and v3 are the other two. The arc between them not containing v2 is 1 edge. Then the angle would be (1*180)/3 = 60 degrees, which matches the first sample input where the angle was 60 degrees.\n\nYes! So in the first sample, n=3, a=15. The only possible angle is 60 degrees, which is the closest possible. That aligns with the sample explanation.\n\nAnother example: n=4 (square). For example, if we take vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at 2 is between 1 and 3. The arc between 1 and 3 not containing 2 is 2 edges (since the square has 4 edges; the arc from 1 to 3 via the other side is 2 edges). So the angle would be (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees. But wait, in the sample input for n=4 and a=67, the closest angle is 45 degrees. How is that possible?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the square example, if you take vertices 1, 2, 4. Then the angle at 2 between 1 and 4. What's the arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain 2? Well, the square's vertices are 1, 2, 3, 4. The arc from 1 to 4 that doesn't contain 2 would be passing through 3. So the arc has 2 edges (from 1 to 3 to 4?), no. Wait, from 1 to 4, the arc that doesn't contain 2 is 1 -> 4 (but that's adjacent?), no. Wait, in a square, the vertices are arranged in order 1, 2, 3, 4. The arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 directly (if that's possible). Wait, but in a square, adjacent vertices are connected. So between 1 and 4, there's one edge (since it's a square). Wait, no, in a square, 1 is adjacent to 2 and 4. So the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is just one edge. Then the angle at 2 would be (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. Which matches the sample input where for n=4 and a=67, the closest angle is 45 degrees.\n\nSo that formula seems to work. Therefore, the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. And since the polygon is regular, k can be from 1 to (n-2), because if k is larger than n-2, then the arc that contains v2 would be shorter.\n\nWait, but how do we determine k for a given choice of v1 and v3?\n\nWell, for any three distinct vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be of length k, where k is between 1 and (n-2). Because if you have three distinct vertices, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 can't be zero (since they are distinct), and can't be n-1 (because that would imply that the arc that contains v2 is 1 edge, which is possible only if v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other and v2 is between them. Wait, but then the arc that does not contain v2 would be n-1 edges, which would make the angle (n-1)*180 /n. But for example, in a square (n=4), if v1 and v3 are adjacent (like 1 and 2), and v2 is 3. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 to 2 (which is one edge) but that's the arc that contains v2 (since v2 is 3, which is adjacent to 2 and 4). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. For any three distinct vertices, there are two arcs between v1 and v3. One arc contains v2, the other does not. The length of the arc that does not contain v2 is k, and the length of the arc that contains v2 is (n - k). Since the total number of edges between v1 and v3 along the entire polygon is (n-2) steps? No. For example, in a square, the arc between 1 and 3 can be two steps (through 2) or two steps (through 4). Wait, no. Wait, the number of edges between 1 and 3 along the arc that contains v2 (say v2 is 2) is 2 steps (1-2-3). The arc that does not contain v2 is 1-4-3, which is also 2 steps. So in this case, k would be 2, which would give angle (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees. But earlier when we considered the angle at 2 between 1 and 4, the arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain 2 is 1 edge (from 1 to 4 directly), which gives k=1, leading to 45 degrees.\n\nSo for a given choice of v1, v2, v3, the value of k is the number of edges in the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. So how to find this k?\n\nLet me think of the positions of the vertices. Let's imagine that the polygon is numbered in clockwise order. Let's fix v2 as some vertex. Then, for any other two vertices v1 and v3, the arc between them that does not contain v2 must be determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the value of k can be determined as follows: Let's say that between v1 and v2, there are x steps in one direction (clockwise), and between v2 and v3 there are y steps in the other direction (counter-clockwise). Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be (n - (x + y + 1)) steps? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for the angle at v2, the value of k is (number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2). To find this, suppose that when you move from v1 to v3 clockwise, you pass through v2. Then the arc that does not contain v2 would be the other arc. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, for any two vertices v1 and v3, the minimal number of steps between them along the perimeter is d, and the maximal is n - d. So, if we want the arc that does not contain v2, then we have to find which of these two arcs (d or n-d) is the one that does not contain v2. But this seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Since the angle at v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2, and that arc's length is k edges. Then, the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. Now, for any possible k, what are the possible values?\n\nSince the three vertices must be distinct, the minimal k is 1 (when v1 and v3 are adjacent, and the arc not containing v2 is that one edge). The maximal possible k is n-2. Because if k were n-1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be n-1 edges. But that would mean that the arc that contains v2 is 1 edge, implying that v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other, and v2 is between them. But then, the arc that does not contain v2 would be n-1 edges, which is impossible because that would require the arc to go all the way around the polygon except for one edge. However, since v1 and v3 are adjacent, the arc between them that does not contain v2 would have to be n-1 edges. But that would only be possible if the arc that contains v2 is 1 edge (the edge between v1 and v3). But if v2 is between them, then that's impossible since v1 and v3 are adjacent.\n\nSo the maximum k is n-2. For example, in a square (n=4), k can be 1 or 2. If k=2, then the angle is (2*180)/4 = 90 degrees. Which is the case when v1 and v3 are opposite each other (like 1 and 3 in a square) and v2 is adjacent to both. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 2 edges (like 1-4-3).\n\nSo, given this, the angle at v2 is determined by k. And for each possible k (from 1 to n-2), there are multiple ways to choose v1 and v3 such that the arc between them not containing v2 is k edges. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the k that makes (k * 180)/n as close as possible to a, and then selecting any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that k.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each possible k (from 1 to n-2), compute the angle theta = (k * 180)/n.\n\n2. Find the k that minimizes |theta - a|.\n\nOnce we find the optimal k, we need to find any triplet of vertices that forms this angle.\n\nNow, how to find the optimal k?\n\nLet me think. For a given a, we can compute the target k. Let's see:\n\nWe want theta = (k * 180)/n ≈ a.\n\nSolving for k: k ≈ (a * n)/180.\n\nBut since k must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we can compute the ideal k as floor((a * n)/180) and ceil((a * n)/180), and check which one is closer.\n\nBut since a can be up to 180, and n can be up to 1e5, this calculation needs to be done carefully.\n\nBut first, note that for the angle theta, the possible values are multiples of (180/n) degrees. For example, in n=4, theta can be 45, 90 degrees (k=1 and 2).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the k that is closest to (a * n)/180. However, since k must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we need to find the best k in that range.\n\nOnce we find the best k, we can then select any triplet of vertices that corresponds to this k.\n\nNow, how to choose the triplet once we have k?\n\nFor example, for a given k, we can choose v2 as any vertex, and then choose v1 and v3 such that there are k edges between them along the arc that does not contain v2.\n\nLet me think of a simple way to construct such a triplet. Let's choose v2 as vertex 1. Then, we can choose v1 as vertex 2 (adjacent to v2), and v3 as vertex (k+2). Wait, no. Because the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be k edges. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have v2 as vertex 1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be k edges. Let's choose v1 as vertex 2 (adjacent to v2 in clockwise direction). Then, to have the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2, v3 should be located k steps away from v1 in the counter-clockwise direction. Wait, perhaps I need to think of the positions.\n\nLet me imagine the polygon as a circle with vertices numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Let me fix v2 as vertex 1. Then, to form an angle with k steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 (vertex 1), I need to select v1 and v3 such that when you go from v1 to v3 along the arc that doesn't pass through v2 (vertex 1), there are k edges.\n\nLet me think of v1 as vertex 2 (next to v2). Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 (vertex 1) would be the arc that goes from v1 (vertex 2) counter-clockwise to v3. How many steps would that take? Let's say we want that arc to be k steps. So, starting from v1 (vertex 2), moving counter-clockwise k steps would reach v3. But since the polygon is numbered in clockwise order, moving counter-clockwise from vertex 2 would go to vertex 1, then to vertex n, then to n-1, etc. So, for example, if k=1, then v3 would be vertex 1 (but that's v2, which is not allowed). So that's not correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the arc that does not contain v2. So if v2 is vertex 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must not pass through vertex 1. So if v1 is vertex 2, then v3 must be located such that the arc from v1 to v3 does not pass through 1. That would be the arc that goes clockwise from v1 (vertex 2) through 3, 4, etc. So, if I want the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) to be k edges, then the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is k. So, for example, if v1 is vertex 2, then v3 is vertex 2 + k (mod n?), but ensuring that the arc between them doesn't pass through v2 (vertex 1). Let's take n=4, k=1. Then, v1 is 2, and v3 is 3. The arc from 2 to 3 is 1 step, which doesn't pass through 1. So the angle at v2 (vertex 1) would be (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. Which matches the sample input where for n=4 and a=67, the closest is 45.\n\nSo, in general, for a given k, if we choose v2 as vertex 1, then v1 can be vertex 2, and v3 can be vertex (2 + k). Wait, but in the case of n=4, k=1: 2 + 1 = 3, which is correct. For k=2: 2 + 2 = 4. The arc between 2 and 4 is 2 steps (2->3->4), which does not contain v2 (vertex 1). The angle would be (2*180)/4 = 90 degrees.\n\nSo this seems to work. So for a general k, the triplet could be v1 = 2, v2 = 1, v3 = 2 + k. But wait, 2 + k may exceed n. For example, if n=5, k=3, then 2 + 3 = 5. That's okay. But if k=4, then 2+4=6, but n=5. So that's not correct. Wait, but k can be up to n-2. For example, in n=5, k can be up to 3. Because n-2 = 3.\n\nSo for k up to n-2, 2 + k is <= 2 + (n-2) = n. So yes, in that case, v3 is 2 + k.\n\nSo the triplet would be (v1, v2, v3) = (2, 1, 2 + k). But wait, in this case, the arc between v1 and v3 (2 and 2 + k) is k steps. And since v2 is 1, which is not on that arc, this works.\n\nBut wait, what if 2 + k exceeds n? For example, if n=5, k=3. Then 2 + 3 =5, which is valid. For n=5, k=2, 2+2=4. So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems like a valid approach. Therefore, once we find the optimal k, we can output the triplet (2, 1, 2 + k). However, there's a possibility that 2 + k exceeds n. But since k can be up to n-2, then 2 + k can be up to 2 + (n-2) = n. So it's okay.\n\nBut what about when k is 0? Well, k starts at 1.\n\nSo this gives us a way to generate a valid triplet for any k between 1 and n-2. Thus, once we find the optimal k, we can output 2, 1, 2 +k.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input for the first case:\n\nSample input 3 15. n=3, a=15. The optimal k is (15 * 3)/180 = 0.25. Since k must be integer >=1, the closest is k=1. So theta = (1 * 180)/3 = 60 degrees. Then the triplet is (2, 1, 3). Which matches the sample output of \"1 2 3\"? Wait, no. Wait the sample output for the first input is \"1 2 3\". But according to our triplet (v1, v2, v3) is (2, 1, 3). Which would be 2 1 3, but the sample output is 1 2 3. So perhaps the order of the triplet is not important as long as v2 is the middle vertex. Wait the problem says that the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex. So the triplet is v1, v2, v3, where the angle is at v2. So the triplet (2, 1, 3) would have v2 as 1, and the angle is between 2 and 3. But the sample output for the first case is 1 2 3. Which would have v2 as 2. So perhaps there are multiple valid triplets.\n\nAh, right. The problem allows any triplet that satisfies the condition. So in our approach, we can choose any triplet. So for example, if we choose v2 as vertex 2, then v1 and v3 can be chosen accordingly. So perhaps there are multiple ways to choose the triplet once we have the correct k.\n\nBut regardless, the approach is to find the correct k, then find any triplet that corresponds to that k.\n\nSo, the question now is, how to find the optimal k.\n\nLet me think of the steps again.\n\nGiven n and a, compute the ideal k as (a * n)/180. Since k must be integer, we can check floor(k_ideal), ceil(k_ideal), and possibly others if they are near.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and n-2, we need to clamp the value.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a is 67 and n is 4:\n\nk_ideal = (67 * 4)/180 = 268 / 180 ≈ 1.488. So possible candidates are 1 and 2.\n\nFor k=1: theta is 45 degrees. For k=2: 90 degrees. Which is closer to 67? 67-45=22, 90-67=23. So 45 is better. Hence, choose k=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample input for the second case.\n\nSimilarly, for the third sample input: n=4, a=68. k_ideal is (68 *4)/180 = 272/180 ≈ 1.511. So candidates are 1 and 2. For k=1, 45 degrees. For k=2, 90. Which is closer to 68? 68-45=23, 90-68=22. So 90 is better. Hence, choose k=2.\n\nWhich matches the third sample.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCalculate k_ideal = a * n / 180. Then check the floor and ceiling of that value, and also possibly the floor-1 and ceiling+1 if needed. But since k must be between 1 and n-2, we can generate possible candidates and select the best one.\n\nBut since the function is linear, the closest k is either floor(k_ideal) or ceil(k_ideal). So for example, if k_ideal is exactly between two integers, then we can check both.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute k_ideal = (a * n) / 180.0.\n\nThen, the candidate k values are floor(k_ideal) and ceil(k_ideal). Also, need to check if these are within 1 to n-2.\n\nBut wait, what if k_ideal is less than 1? For example, if a is very small. But since a is at least 1, and n is at least 3, then:\n\nFor a=1, n=3: k_ideal is (1 *3)/180 = 0.016... So floor is 0, but k can't be 0. So the minimal possible k is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if k_ideal is larger than n-2, then the maximum possible k is n-2.\n\nSo the algorithm for finding the optimal k is:\n\nCompute k_ideal = (a * n) / 180.0\n\ncandidates = set of possible k values around k_ideal, clamped between 1 and n-2.\n\nFor each candidate k in candidates, compute the absolute difference between theta and a. Choose the k with the minimal difference. If there's a tie, choose any.\n\nOnce the optimal k is found, generate a triplet.\n\nNow, how to generate the triplet?\n\nAs discussed earlier, choosing v2 as vertex 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k. However, this may not work if 2 +k exceeds n. Wait, earlier analysis said that since k is up to n-2, 2 +k can be up to 2 + (n-2) = n, which is okay.\n\nBut for example, if n=4, k=2: 2+2=4. Which is valid. So the triplet would be 2, 1, 4. Which is a valid triplet. The angle at v2 (1) between 2 and 4. The arc between 2 and 4 not containing 1 is 2 steps (2->3->4), so theta is (2*180)/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input for the third case (n=4, a=68), the optimal k is 2. So the triplet would be 2 1 4. However, the sample output for that case is \"4 1 2\". Which is another valid triplet. The order of v1 and v3 can be swapped, since the angle is formed between them. So for example, 2 1 4 and 4 1 2 are both valid.\n\nSo the code can generate any valid triplet. For simplicity, we can choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 +k. However, there's a case when 2 +k equals n+1? No, because k is up to n-2, so 2 + (n-2) = n.\n\nSo the triplet would be (2, 1, 2 +k). But the problem requires that the output is three distinct vertices. Let's check:\n\nv1 is 2, v2 is 1, v3 is 2 +k. Since k >=1, 2 +k >=3. So v3 is different from v1 (2) and v2 (1). So yes, distinct.\n\nThus, this triplet is valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute k_ideal = a * n / 180.0\n\n- Generate possible k candidates (floor(k_ideal), ceil(k_ideal), and possibly others if needed)\n\n- For each candidate k, check if it's between 1 and n-2. If not, clamp it to the nearest valid value.\n\n- For each valid candidate, compute the absolute difference between theta and a.\n\n- Select the k with minimal difference. If multiple, choose any (e.g., the smallest or largest).\n\nOnce the optimal k is found, output the triplet (2, 1, 2 +k). However, the problem requires that the output is three integers, which can be in any order as long as the angle is formed with v2 as the middle vertex. So the triplet could be written as (v1, v2, v3) where v2 is the middle.\n\nBut the sample outputs have varying orders. For example, in the first sample input, the output is 1 2 3, which corresponds to v1=1, v2=2, v3=3. In our approach, the triplet would be (2, 1, 3) (v1=2, v2=1, v3=3). Which is different from the sample. However, the problem states that any correct triplet is acceptable.\n\nBut why is the sample output 1 2 3? Let's see. In that case, the angle is at vertex 2. The arc between 1 and 3 that does not contain 2. But in a triangle, the arc between 1 and 3 that does not contain 2 is 1 edge (since the triangle has three edges). Wait, but in a triangle, the arc between 1 and 3 that does not contain 2 would be the arc that goes from 1 to 3 directly (which is one edge). But since the polygon is a triangle, the arc between 1 and 3 that doesn't contain 2 is one edge. So the angle at 2 would be (1 * 180)/3 = 60 degrees. Which is correct. So the triplet (1, 2, 3) is valid.\n\nSo our approach of using (2, 1, 3) is also valid. But the sample output uses a different triplet. However, the problem allows any valid triplet.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can generate triplets in different ways. However, for the code, the easiest way is to choose v2 as 1, and then v1 as 2 and v3 as 2 +k. But in some cases, this may not be the same as the sample output. However, since the problem allows any correct triplet, this is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if the optimal k is 0? Well, since k starts from 1, that's not possible.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute k_ideal = (a * n) / 180.0\n\nGenerate candidates k_floor = floor(k_ideal), k_ceil = ceil(k_ideal). Also check if k_floor and k_ceil are within [1, n-2]. Also, check if k_floor -1 or k_ceil +1 could be better (though in most cases, floor and ceil are sufficient).\n\nBut since the function is linear, the minimal difference is achieved by the closest integer to k_ideal. However, due to possible clamping, we need to check the candidates.\n\nOnce the optimal k is found, output the triplet (2, 1, 2 +k). However, in some cases, this may not be the only option. For example, when k is 1, the triplet could be (1, 2, 3) as in the first sample. How can we generate that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps choosing v2 as 2, and v1 as 1, v3 as 3. Then the arc between 1 and 3 that does not contain 2 is 1 edge (since in triangle, the arc between 1 and 3 that does not contain 2 is one edge). So the angle is (1*180)/3=60 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can choose",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently determining the optimal vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices can be determined by the number of edges between those vertices along the arc that does not contain the vertex forming the angle. This angle can be calculated using the formula: `theta = (k * 180) / n`, where `k` is the number of edges between the two vertices along the arc that does not contain the vertex forming the angle.\n\n2. **Finding Optimal k**: The value of `k` that minimizes the difference between the calculated angle and the target angle `a` can be approximated by `(a * n) / 180`. We consider both the floor and ceiling values of this ideal `k` to determine the closest valid integer values within the range [1, n-2].\n\n3. **Generating the Vertices**: Once the optimal `k` is determined, we can generate the required vertices. For simplicity, we choose the vertex `v2` as the first vertex (vertex 1), and then select `v1` and `v3` such that they form the required arc length `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the ideal k\n    k_ideal = (a * n) / 180.0\n    \n    # Generate candidate k values\n    candidates = set()\n    for k in [math.floor(k_ideal), math.ceil(k_ideal)]:\n        if 1 <= k <= n - 2:\n            candidates.add(k)\n        else:\n            # Clamp to the nearest valid value\n            if k < 1:\n                candidates.add(1)\n            elif k > n - 2:\n                candidates.add(n - 2)\n    \n    # Also check k_floor - 1 and k_ceil + 1 in case of edge cases\n    for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        k_candidate = int(k_ideal) + delta\n        if 1 <= k_candidate <= n - 2:\n            candidates.add(k_candidate)\n    \n    # Now find the best k among the candidates\n    best_k = None\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for k in candidates:\n        theta = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(theta - a)\n        if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and k < best_k):\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Now generate the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    # Ensure v3 does not exceed n\n    if v3 > n:\n        v3 = v3 - n  # Not necessary since best_k is clamped to n-2, so 2 + (n-2) = n\n    \n    # Output the triplet in the format v1 v2 v3\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle) are read from standard input.\n2. **Ideal k Calculation**: The ideal value of `k` is calculated based on the formula derived from the geometry of regular polygons.\n3. **Candidate k Values**: Potential values for `k` are generated around the ideal value, considering the constraints of valid indices (1 to n-2).\n4. **Optimal k Selection**: The candidate values are evaluated to find the one that results in the smallest angular difference from `a`.\n5. **Vertex Selection**: Using the optimal `k`, the vertices are chosen such that the angle formed at vertex `v2` (chosen as vertex 1) is minimized, ensuring the correct arc length between the other two vertices.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values for `k` and ensures the closest possible angle to the target `a` is found, leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons.",
