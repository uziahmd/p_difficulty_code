On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray [l, r] in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. \n\nHmm. So the key here is that reversing a subarray can potentially improve the longest non-decreasing subsequence. But how do we approach this efficiently?\n\nFirst, I need to think about what the original longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is. But since we can reverse any subarray, we need to find the best possible reversal that maximizes the LNDS.\n\nBut considering all possible subarrays to reverse would be O(n^2) possibilities, and for each possibility, computing the LNDS would take O(n^2) time. For n=2000, that would be O(n^4), which is way too slow. So that's not feasible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS can be calculated based on the counts of 1s and 2s and their arrangement.\n\nWait, but when you reverse a subarray, the sequence changes. Let's consider how reversing a subarray can affect the LNDS.\n\nThe original array's LNDS is already something, but perhaps by reversing a certain part, we can merge more 1s and 2s into a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nFor example, if there's a segment like 2 1, reversing it gives 1 2, which is better. So maybe the optimal reversal is to fix such segments.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother idea: the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the minimum number of transitions between 2 and 1. Wait, no. Because the LNDS can be as long as the entire array if it's non-decreasing. But since the elements are 1 and 2, the LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Because each such occurrence breaks the non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut when we reverse a subarray, perhaps we can reduce the number of these transitions.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the maximum possible LNDS for the array is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s, but that's only if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, the LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s minus some number of transitions.\n\nWait, for example, if the array is 1 2 1 2. The LNDS is 2 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But after reversing [2,3], it becomes 1 1 2 2, which has LNDS 4.\n\nSo the maximum possible is the entire array if it's non-decreasing. So the problem reduces to finding the best reversal that can turn the array into a non-decreasing one as much as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother angle: since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is immediately followed by a 1. Because each such occurrence is a \"drop\" that breaks the sequence. However, this is not exactly accurate. For example, in the array [2,1,2], the LNDS is 2 (like 2,2 or 1,2), but there are two drops (2→1 and 1→2? No, wait the drops are 2→1, and then 1→2 is an increase. So the number of drops is 1. So the formula would be n - number of drops. But in this case, n is 3, number of drops is 1. 3-1=2, which matches the LNDS. Another example: [1,2,1,2]. The number of drops is 2 (2→1 and 1→2? No, wait the drops are 2→1 and 2→1 again? Wait, the array is 1,2,1,2. The transitions between elements are 1→2 (increase), 2→1 (drop), 1→2 (increase). So there are 1 drop. So n - drops is 4 -1 =3. But the LNDS is 2 (the maximum is 2, like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). Wait, that doesn't match. So my previous idea is incorrect. So that approach may not work.\n\nAlternative approach: the LNDS in a sequence of 1s and 2s is the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s plus the number of times they can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Wait, no. The LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Since the elements are 1 and 2, the LNDS is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s in the sequence, but only if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in order.\n\nWait, for example, in the array [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 2+2=4? No, because the sequence can be 1,2,2 (length 3) or 1,1,2 (length 3). Wait, but the actual maximum is 3. So the maximum possible is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for sequences of 1 and 2, the LNDS can be computed as follows: the maximum number of elements is the total number of elements if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s plus the number of transitions between them. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the LNDS as the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Or something like that. Not sure.\n\nBut maybe for the problem at hand, since we can reverse any subarray, we need to find the best possible way to arrange the array so that the number of transitions from 2 to 1 is minimized.\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray affect these transitions?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have a subarray from l to r. Reversing it will change the transitions inside this subarray and also the transitions between l-1 and l, and between r and r+1.\n\nSo the idea is to find a reversal that reduces the number of 2→1 transitions in the entire array as much as possible. Because each such transition reduces the LNDS by 1 (assuming that the rest of the array is non-decreasing).\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the minimal number of 2→1 transitions possible after reversal. So our goal is to find the reversal that minimizes the number of 2→1 transitions.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think about the original number of 2→1 transitions. Let's call this T. Then, when we reverse a subarray, some of these transitions are removed and new ones are added. We need to calculate the change in T.\n\nBut considering all possibilities for reversing subarrays is challenging.\n\nAnother approach: since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the optimal scenario is to have all the 1s first, followed by all the 2s. In that case, the LNDS is n. So if we can find a reversal that turns the array into such a form, that's the best. If not, then perhaps the next best thing is to minimize the number of 2→1 transitions.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the reversal that can create the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's say that there are some positions where 2 is followed by 1. Each such occurrence is a problem. Reversing a subarray that contains some of these transitions may help.\n\nFor example, suppose the original array has a segment like 2 1. Reversing this segment turns it into 1 2, which removes one 2→1 transition. Similarly, if there's a longer segment with multiple transitions, reversing it could fix them.\n\nBut how do we find which reversal would give us the maximum gain in reducing transitions?\n\nLet me think of the original number of transitions T. When we reverse a subarray [l, r], the transitions that are affected are:\n\n- The transition between l-1 and l (if l > 1)\n- The transition between r and r+1 (if r < n)\n- All transitions within the subarray [l, r]\n\nSo, for each possible reversal, we can compute the change in T. The optimal reversal is the one that gives the maximum decrease in T.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nOriginal T is the number of positions i where a[i] = 2 and a[i+1] = 1.\n\nFor a reversal of [l, r], the new array will have:\n\n- The elements from l to r reversed.\n\nSo, the transitions inside [l, r] are reversed. Let's think about how many transitions are removed and added.\n\nFor example, in the original subarray, there are some transitions between consecutive elements. After reversal, those transitions are reversed. For instance, if the original subarray had a transition from 2 to 1 (which contributes to T), after reversal, it becomes a transition from 1 to 2 (which does not contribute to T). Similarly, transitions from 1 to 2 in the original become 2 to 1 after reversal.\n\nSo, for the original subarray [l, r], the number of transitions that are 2→1 is x, and the number of transitions that are 1→2 is y. After reversal, the number of transitions 2→1 in this subarray becomes y, and 1→2 becomes x. So the net change in T for the subarray is (y - x) (since originally x transitions were contributing to T, now y contribute).\n\nBut also, the transitions between l-1 and l, and between r and r+1 may change.\n\nSo the overall change in T is:\n\ndelta_T = [new transitions between l-1 and l] + [new transitions between r and r+1] - [old transitions between l-1 and l] - [old transitions between r and r+1] + [change in transitions inside the subarray].\n\nSo, the total delta_T is:\n\ndelta_T = (new_trans_l - old_trans_l) + (new_trans_r - old_trans_r) + (y - x).\n\nWhere old_trans_l is the original transition between l-1 and l, and new_trans_l is the transition between l-1 and the new element at position l (which is the original a[r]).\n\nSimilarly for old_trans_r and new_trans_r.\n\nSo, for each possible reversal [l, r], we can compute the delta_T and find the maximum delta_T (since we want to minimize T, which is equivalent to maximizing delta_T).\n\nOnce we find the maximum delta_T, the new T is original_T + delta_T. Then the maximum LNDS is n - (original_T + delta_T) ?\n\nWait, earlier I thought that the LNDS is n - T, but that seems to not hold in some examples. Let me check again.\n\nTake the first example: original array [1, 2, 1, 2]. Original transitions are:\n\nBetween 1 and 2: 1→2 (no contribution to T).\n\nBetween 2 and 1: 2→1 → contributes 1 to T.\n\nBetween 1 and 2: 1→2 → no contribution. So original_T is 1. Then the LNDS is 3 (n - T = 4 -1 =3). But the actual LNDS is 3, which matches. After reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2]. The transitions are 1→1 (no), 1→2 (no), 2→2 (no). So T is 0. So LNDS is 4-0=4, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: array [2,1,2]. Original transitions: 2→1 (contributes 1), 1→2 (no). T is 1. LNDS is 3 -1 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [2,1,1,2]. Original transitions: 2→1 (contributes 1), 1→1 (no), 1→2 (no). T=1. LNDS is 4-1=3. Which is correct (the LNDS is 3, like 1,1,2).\n\nSo yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the maximum possible LNDS is n - (original_T + delta_T). So the problem reduces to finding the maximum delta_T possible over all possible reversals.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the original_T (number of 2→1 transitions in the original array).\n\n2. For each possible reversal [l, r], compute the delta_T that would result from reversing that subarray.\n\n3. Find the maximum delta_T.\n\n4. The answer is original_T + max_delta_T, then the maximum LNDS is n - (original_T + max_delta_T) ?\n\nWait no. Because original_T is the initial value. The new T is original_T + delta_T. Then the maximum LNDS is n - (original_T + delta_T). But we want to maximize this value, which is equivalent to minimizing (original_T + delta_T). So the maximum delta_T is the maximum amount that we can subtract from original_T. Wait, no. Because delta_T is the change in T. For example, if delta_T is negative, that means that T decreases. So the maximum delta_T would be the largest possible decrease in T. Wait, no. Because delta_T is (new_T - original_T). So if we want to minimize new_T, we need to find the maximum delta_T (but delta_T is new_T - original_T?), no. Wait, original_T is the current value. After reversal, the new_T is original_T + delta_T. So if delta_T is negative, then new_T is less than original_T. So to minimize new_T, we need to find the maximum possible delta_T (but delta_T is negative, so the maximum delta_T is the least negative, or the most negative? Wait, no. For example, if original_T is 5, and delta_T is -3, then new_T is 2. If another delta_T is -5, then new_T is 0. So the larger the delta_T (i.e., more negative), the better. So to find the maximum possible decrease in T, we need to find the maximum delta_T (which is the maximum possible decrease in T, which is the minimum new_T).\n\nBut how is delta_T computed?\n\nLet me re-express delta_T.\n\ndelta_T = (new_T - original_T).\n\nWe want new_T as small as possible, so we want delta_T as small as possible (i.e., as negative as possible). Therefore, the maximum possible delta_T is the maximum of all possible delta_T values (but since delta_T can be negative, the maximum is the one that reduces T the most).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate original_T.\n\nFind the maximum delta_T (could be negative) that can be achieved by any reversal.\n\nThen the new_T is original_T + delta_T.\n\nThe answer is n - new_T.\n\nSo the problem becomes, find the maximum delta_T (could be negative) achievable by any reversal.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute delta_T for all possible [l, r] intervals efficiently.\n\nHow to compute delta_T for each [l, r]?\n\nAs discussed earlier, delta_T is:\n\ndelta_T = (new_trans_l - old_trans_l) + (new_trans_r - old_trans_r) + (y - x)\n\nwhere x is the number of 2→1 transitions in the original subarray [l, r], and y is the number of 1→2 transitions in the original subarray [l, r].\n\nBut how to compute x and y for any [l, r]?\n\nAlso, the new_trans_l and new_trans_r depend on the elements before and after the reversed subarray.\n\nLet me break down each component.\n\nFirst, the transitions inside the subarray [l, r].\n\nOriginal subarray has elements a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r]. When reversed, the elements become a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l].\n\nThe original transitions inside the subarray are between positions i and i+1 for i from l to r-1. Let's count how many of these transitions are 2→1 (x) and 1→2 (y). After reversal, these transitions are reversed. So, for each original transition between a[i] and a[i+1], the reversed subarray will have a transition between a[i+1] and a[i] (but in the reversed array, the positions are swapped). However, the number of transitions that are 2→1 in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of transitions that were 1→2 in the original subarray. Because, for example, a transition from 1→2 in the original becomes 2→1 in the reversed subarray. Wait, no. Let me think: in the original subarray, for each pair (a[i], a[i+1]), the transition is from a[i] to a[i+1]. When reversed, the subarray is reversed, so the new elements are [a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]]. The transitions inside the reversed subarray are between a[r] and a[r-1], a[r-1] and a[r-2], etc. So the original transition between a[i] and a[i+1] becomes a transition between a[i+1] and a[i] in the reversed subarray. So for each original transition, if it was 2→1, then after reversal, it's 1→2. So the number of 2→1 transitions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of 1→2 transitions in the original subarray. Similarly, the number of 1→2 transitions in the reversed subarray is equal to the number of 2→1 transitions in the original subarray. Thus, the change in transitions inside the subarray is (y - x), where x is the original number of 2→1 transitions in the subarray, and y is the original number of 1→2 transitions in the subarray. Because the original subarray had x 2→1 transitions contributing to T, and after reversal, the subarray has y 2→1 transitions. So the delta for the subarray is y - x. Since original_T includes x, and after reversal, the new_T includes y, so the delta is (y - x) - (x - y)? No, wait the original contribution of the subarray to T is x. After reversal, the contribution is y. So the delta_T for the subarray is (y - x). Because the original_T includes x, and after reversal, the contribution is y. So the change in T is y - x. So the delta_T for the subarray is (y - x). \n\nThen, we also have to account for the transitions between l-1 and l, and between r and r+1.\n\nLet me handle those:\n\nOriginal transitions:\n\n- Between l-1 and l: if l > 1, then original_trans_l = 1 if a[l-1] == 2 and a[l] == 1, else 0.\n\nAfter reversal, the new element at position l is a[r]. So the new transition between l-1 and l is 1 if a[l-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1, else 0. So the delta for this part is (new_trans_l - old_trans_l).\n\nSimilarly for the transition between r and r+1: original_trans_r is 1 if a[r] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1 (if r < n). After reversal, the new element at position r is a[l]. So the new transition between r and r+1 is 1 if a[l] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1, else 0. So delta for this part is (new_trans_r - old_trans_r).\n\nPutting it all together, delta_T is:\n\ndelta_T = (new_trans_l - old_trans_l) + (new_trans_r - old_trans_r) + (y - x).\n\nSo, for each [l, r], we need to compute:\n\n- x: number of 2→1 transitions in the original subarray [l, r]\n- y: number of 1→2 transitions in the original subarray [l, r]\n- old_trans_l: original transition between l-1 and l (if l > 1)\n- new_trans_l: new transition between l-1 and l after reversal (if l > 1)\n- old_trans_r: original transition between r and r+1 (if r < n)\n- new_trans_r: new transition between r and r+1 after reversal (if r < n)\n\nBut how to compute x and y for all possible [l, r] efficiently?\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums for the number of 2→1 transitions and 1→2 transitions in the array. For example, for each i from 1 to n-1, we can compute whether a[i] is 2 and a[i+1] is 1. Then, for any interval [l, r], the number of 2→1 transitions in that interval is the sum of these flags from i = l to i = r-1.\n\nSimilarly for the 1→2 transitions.\n\nSo, for example, let's create two arrays:\n\ntrans_2_1[i] = 1 if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1, else 0. For i from 0 to n-2 (assuming 0-based indexing).\n\ntrans_1_2[i] = 1 if a[i] == 1 and a[i+1] == 2, else 0.\n\nThen, for a subarray [l, r], the number of 2→1 transitions inside is sum(trans_2_1[i] for i in l-1 to r-2) assuming 1-based indices. Wait, need to be careful with indices.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nAssume the original array is 1-based. For positions l to r, the transitions inside are between positions l and l+1, l+1 and l+2, ..., r-1 and r. So for each i from l to r-1, the transition between i and i+1.\n\nThus, for a given [l, r], the number of 2→1 transitions inside is sum(trans_2_1[i] for i in l to r-1).\n\nSimilarly for the 1→2 transitions.\n\nSo, we can precompute prefix sums for trans_2_1 and trans_1_2. Let's say prefix_2_1[i] is the sum of trans_2_1[1..i], and similarly for prefix_1_2.\n\nThen, the number of 2→1 transitions in [l, r] is prefix_2_1[r-1] - prefix_2_1[l-1].\n\nSimilarly for 1→2 transitions.\n\nOnce we have that, we can compute x and y for any [l, r].\n\nNow, the problem is to loop through all possible [l, r] intervals and compute delta_T for each, then find the maximum delta_T.\n\nBut for n=2000, the number of intervals is O(n^2) = 2000^2 = 4 million, which is manageable if each iteration is O(1).\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and the array a.\n\nCompute original_T as the sum of trans_2_1 for all positions (i.e., the total number of 2→1 transitions in the original array).\n\nCompute prefix_2_1 and prefix_1_2 arrays.\n\nThen, for each possible l and r (1 <= l <= r <= n):\n\nCompute x = number of 2→1 transitions in [l, r] → which is prefix_2_1[r-1] - prefix_2_1[l-1]\n\nCompute y = number of 1→2 transitions in [l, r] → prefix_1_2[r-1] - prefix_1_2[l-1]\n\nThen, compute the delta for the subarray transitions: (y - x)\n\nThen, compute the delta for the left boundary (l-1 and l) and right boundary (r and r+1).\n\nFor the left boundary:\n\nif l > 1:\n\nold_trans_l = 1 if a[l-1] == 2 and a[l] == 1 else 0\n\nnew_trans_l = 1 if a[l-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1 else 0\n\ndelta_left = new_trans_l - old_trans_l\n\nelse:\n\ndelta_left = 0\n\nSimilarly for the right boundary:\n\nif r < n:\n\nold_trans_r = 1 if a[r] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1 else 0\n\nnew_trans_r = 1 if a[l] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1 else 0\n\ndelta_right = new_trans_r - old_trans_r\n\nelse:\n\ndelta_right = 0\n\nThen, total delta_T for this [l, r] is delta_left + delta_right + (y - x).\n\nWe need to track the maximum delta_T across all [l, r].\n\nOnce we have that maximum delta_T, the answer is n - (original_T + max_delta_T).\n\nBut wait, original_T is the initial T, and after the reversal, the new_T is original_T + delta_T. Then the maximum LNDS is n - new_T.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute this.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nFor example, when l = r. Reversing a single element does nothing. So delta_T is zero. But in that case, the code would compute x as the number of transitions in [l, r], which is zero (since there are no transitions between elements in a single element). Similarly, y is zero. So delta for subarray is 0. Then, the left and right boundaries are checked. For l = r, if l is 1, then no left boundary. If r is n, no right boundary. So delta_left and delta_right are zero. So overall delta_T is 0. So for all single-element reversals, delta_T is zero. So they don't contribute to the maximum delta_T unless all other options are worse.\n\nAnother case: when the entire array is already non-decreasing. Then original_T is zero. The maximum delta_T is zero, and the answer is n - 0 = n.\n\nNow, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. For example, the input is given as:\n\nFirst line is n, second line is the array.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is given as:\n\nInput:\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\nWait, but the input is given as a list of two test cases? Or is that just an example of multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains an integer n, then the second line contains the array.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user shows two examples. But the actual code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the code should process a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence.\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. The sample input shows two examples, but that's probably for illustration. So the code should read n, then the array.\n\nBut the user provided the sample input as a list of two cases. However, the code must process one case per run. So the code should read from stdin, which for the first example would be:\n\n4\n\n1 2 1 2\n\nand for the second example:\n\n10\n\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1\n\nSo, the code should read n and then the array.\n\nNow, implementing the steps.\n\nIn Python, for the array, let's index from 1 to n for easier handling. So, for example, a[1], a[2], ..., a[n].\n\nCompute the trans_2_1 and trans_1_2 arrays.\n\nBut for the prefix sums, perhaps we can use 1-based indices.\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize prefix_2_1 as an array of size n+1, where prefix_2_1[0] = 0, and for i from 1 to n-1, prefix_2_1[i] = prefix_2_1[i-1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1 else 0). Similarly for prefix_1_2.\n\nWait, but the original array is 1-based. So for i from 1 to n-1, check a[i] and a[i+1].\n\nOnce that's done, for a given l and r, the number of 2→1 transitions in the subarray [l, r] is sum from i=l to i=r-1 of trans_2_1[i]. Which is prefix_2_1[r-1] - prefix_2_1[l-1].\n\nSame for the 1→2 transitions.\n\nNow, for each l and r in 1<=l<=r<=n:\n\nCompute x = prefix_2_1[r-1] - prefix_2_1[l-1]\n\ny = prefix_1_2[r-1] - prefix_1_2[l-1]\n\nThen compute delta_subarray = y - x.\n\nThen compute delta_left and delta_right.\n\nFor delta_left:\n\nif l > 1:\n\nold_trans_l = 1 if a[l-1] == 2 and a[l] == 1 else 0\n\nnew_trans_l = 1 if a[l-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1 else 0\n\ndelta_left = new_trans_l - old_trans_l\n\nelse:\n\ndelta_left = 0\n\nSimilarly for delta_right:\n\nif r < n:\n\nold_trans_r = 1 if a[r] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1 else 0\n\nnew_trans_r = 1 if a[l] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1 else 0\n\ndelta_right = new_trans_r - old_trans_r\n\nelse:\n\ndelta_right = 0\n\nThen total delta_T for this [l, r] is delta_left + delta_right + delta_subarray.\n\nWe need to track the maximum delta_T.\n\nOnce we have that, the answer is n - (original_T + max_delta_T).\n\nBut original_T is the sum of all trans_2_1, which is prefix_2_1[n-1].\n\nSo, original_T = prefix_2_1[n-1].\n\nNow, the code.\n\nLet me think about the code steps.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers. Let's make it 1-based, so insert a dummy at index 0.\n\nThen compute prefix_2_1 and prefix_1_2.\n\nThen compute original_T.\n\nThen iterate over all possible l and r.\n\nBut for n=2000, the loops would be O(n^2) = 4 million operations. For each, the calculations are O(1). That's acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, even 4 million operations are manageable.\n\nNow, let's test with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 2 1 2\n\nOriginal array is [1,2,1,2]\n\nprefix_2_1:\n\nfor i from 1 to 3 (since n=4):\n\ni=1: a[1]=1, a[2]=2 → not 2→1 → 0.\n\ni=2: a[2]=2, a[3]=1 → 1.\n\ni=3: a[3]=1, a[4]=2 → 0.\n\nprefix_2_1 is [0, 0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, ...? Let me think:\n\nprefix_2_1 is of size n+1. For i in 1 to n-1 (since for n=4, i ranges 1-3).\n\nprefix_2_1[0] = 0\n\nprefix_2_1[1] = prefix_2_1[0] + trans_2_1[1] → trans_2_1[1] is 0 → 0.\n\nprefix_2_1[2] = prefix_2_1[1] + trans_2_1[2] → 0 + 1 → 1.\n\nprefix_2_1[3] = 1 + trans_2_1[3] → trans_2_1[3] is 0 → remains 1.\n\nprefix_2_1[4] is not used, since for r up to 4, r-1 is 3.\n\noriginal_T is prefix_2_1[3] = 1.\n\nNow, for l=2, r=3:\n\nx = prefix_2_1[r-1] - prefix_2_1[l-1] → r-1=2, l-1=1 → prefix_2_1[2] - prefix_2_1[1] = 1-0=1.\n\ny is prefix_1_2[r-1] - prefix_1_2[l-1]. Let's compute prefix_1_2.\n\ntrans_1_2[i] is 1 if a[i] is 1 and a[i+1] is 2.\n\nFor i=1: 1→2 → yes → 1.\n\ni=2: 2→1 → no.\n\ni=3: 1→2 → yes → 1.\n\nprefix_1_2 for i=1 to 3:\n\nprefix_1_2[0] = 0\n\nprefix_1_2[1] = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nprefix_1_2[2] = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nprefix_1_2[3] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo for l=2, r=3, y = prefix_1_2[2] - prefix_1_2[1] = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\ndelta_subarray = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nThen delta_left: l=2, which is >1.\n\nold_trans_l is a[1] and a[2] → 1 and 2 → 1→2 → not 2→1 → old_trans_l is 0.\n\nnew_trans_l is a[1] (which is 1) and a[r] (a[3] is 1). So 1 and 1 → no → 0. So delta_left is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\ndelta_right: r=3 <4.\n\nold_trans_r is a[3] (1) and a[4] (2) → 1→2 → no. So old_trans_r is 0.\n\nnew_trans_r is a[l] (a[2] is 2) and a[r+1] (a[4] is 2). So 2→2 → no. So delta_right is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nTotal delta_T = 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nWhich is the delta for this reversal. original_T is 1, so new_T is 1 + (-1) = 0. The answer is 4 - 0 = 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would find this delta_T of -1. But perhaps there are other intervals that give a larger delta_T (more negative).\n\nBut in this case, this is the best option.\n\nSo the code would find that the maximum delta_T is -1, leading to answer 4.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n10\n\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1\n\nOriginal array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n\noriginal_T is the number of 2→1 transitions in the original array.\n\nLet me compute the transitions:\n\nCheck each pair:\n\npositions 1-2: 1→1 → no.\n\npositions 2-3: 1→2 → no.\n\npositions 3-4: 2→2 → no.\n\npositions 4-5: 2→2 → no.\n\npositions 5-6: 2→1 → yes → contributes 1.\n\npositions 6-7: 1→1 → no.\n\npositions 7-8: 1→2 → no.\n\npositions 8-9: 2→2 → no.\n\npositions 9-10: 2→1 → yes → contributes 1.\n\nSo original_T is 2.\n\nNow, after reversing [3,7], which is positions 3 to 7 (original elements 2,2,2,1,1).",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can reduce the number of transitions from 2 to 1, which in turn increases the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Transitions**: Calculate the number of transitions from 2 to 1 (denoted as `trans_2_1`) and from 1 to 2 (denoted as `trans_1_2`) in the original array.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Use prefix sums to efficiently compute the number of transitions within any subarray.\n3. **Evaluate Reversals**: For each possible subarray reversal, calculate the change in the number of 2→1 transitions (`delta_T`). This involves considering transitions within the subarray and at its boundaries.\n4. **Maximize Delta**: Track the maximum reduction in transitions (`delta_T`) across all possible subarray reversals. The result is derived from adjusting the original number of transitions with the best `delta_T`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    # Convert to 1-based indexing\n    a = [0] + a\n    \n    # Precompute trans_2_1 and trans_1_2 for each position i (1-based)\n    trans_2_1 = [0] * (n)  # trans_2_1[i] corresponds to a[i] and a[i+1]\n    trans_1_2 = [0] * (n)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1:\n            trans_2_1[i-1] = 1\n        if a[i] == 1 and a[i+1] == 2:\n            trans_1_2[i-1] = 1\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums for trans_2_1 and trans_1_2\n    prefix_2_1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    prefix_1_2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix_2_1[i] = prefix_2_1[i-1] + trans_2_1[i-1]\n        prefix_1_2[i] = prefix_1_2[i-1] + trans_1_2[i-1]\n    \n    original_T = prefix_2_1[n-1]\n    \n    max_delta = 0  # Initialize with 0, which is the delta for reversing a single element\n    \n    for l in range(1, n+1):\n        for r in range(l, n+1):\n            # Compute x and y\n            if r == l:\n                x = 0\n                y = 0\n            else:\n                x = prefix_2_1[r-1] - prefix_2_1[l-1]\n                y = prefix_1_2[r-1] - prefix_1_2[l-1]\n            delta_subarray = y - x\n            \n            # Compute delta_left\n            delta_left = 0\n            if l > 1:\n                old_trans_l = 1 if (a[l-1] == 2 and a[l] == 1) else 0\n                new_trans_l = 1 if (a[l-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1) else 0\n                delta_left = new_trans_l - old_trans_l\n            \n            # Compute delta_right\n            delta_right = 0\n            if r < n:\n                old_trans_r = 1 if (a[r] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1) else 0\n                new_trans_r = 1 if (a[l] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1) else 0\n                delta_right = new_trans_r - old_trans_r\n            \n            total_delta = delta_left + delta_right + delta_subarray\n            \n            if total_delta < max_delta:\n                max_delta = total_delta\n    \n    new_T = original_T + max_delta\n    answer = n - new_T\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and converted into a 1-based indexed array for easier handling.\n2. **Transition Arrays**: Arrays `trans_2_1` and `trans_1_2` are used to mark transitions between elements.\n3. **Prefix Sums**: Prefix sums are computed to quickly determine the number of transitions within any subarray.\n4. **Delta Calculation**: For each subarray reversal, the change in transitions (`delta_T`) is calculated by considering internal transitions and boundary effects.\n5. **Max Delta Tracking**: The maximum reduction in transitions (`max_delta`) is tracked, leading to the final result after adjusting the original transition count.\n\nThis approach efficiently evaluates all possible subarray reversals and leverages prefix sums to keep the complexity manageable, ensuring an optimal solution for large input sizes.",
