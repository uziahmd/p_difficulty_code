    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to count the number of arrays of N sets that satisfy certain conditions related to being children of each other in some permutation. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem statement again. A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1,2}, then B must have 2 and 3. Wait, no: each x in A needs an x+1 in B. So for x=1, B must contain 2; for x=2, B must contain 3. So B has to contain 2 and 3. But B can have more elements as well.\n\nNow, the main condition is that there exists a rearrangement of the array of sets such that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. So the array can be reordered in some way where each consecutive pair satisfies the child relationship.\n\nThe challenge is to count all possible arrays of N sets (each set contains distinct integers from 1 to K) that can be rearranged into such a chain.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the order can be rearranged, perhaps we need to find a way to model the dependencies between the sets. For example, if we arrange the sets in a certain order where each set is a child of the next, then the entire array can be ordered accordingly.\n\nBut how do we count all possible arrays that can be ordered in such a way? Maybe we can model this by considering the structure of the sets in terms of their elements.\n\nLet me think about the properties that the sets must have. For the entire array to be reorderable into a chain where each is a child of the next, there must be some ordering of the sets where each set in the sequence is a child of the next. Let's consider that each set can be thought of as a node in a DAG, and there's an edge from A to B if A is a child of B. Then, the problem reduces to finding arrays of N sets where the nodes form a path of length N-1 in this DAG. However, since the array can be reordered, the actual arrangement is that the sets form a DAG where there's a topological order that is a path of length N-1. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the sets must form a chain where each set is a child of the next. But since the order can be rearranged, maybe the sets can be ordered in some way such that each one is a child of the next. This suggests that the sets can be arranged in a sequence where each set is a child of the next. But how do we model this for counting purposes?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the constraints on the sets. For the entire array to be reorderable into such a chain, there must be a way to arrange them so that each set is a child of the next. Let's imagine that the sets are ordered in such a way. Then, for each set S_i in the ordered sequence, every element x in S_i must have x+1 in S_{i+1}.\n\nBut since the order can be any permutation, perhaps we need to model the sets in terms of their \"levels\" or something similar. For example, if we can assign to each set a level l such that for any two sets A and B, if A is before B in the sequence, then A's level is less than B's level, and the elements in A are such that their x+1 are present in B. Wait, but how does that translate?\n\nAlternatively, think of the sets as being part of a directed acyclic graph where edges represent the child relationship. Then, the problem requires that the sets form a DAG where there exists a path of length N-1. However, since the array can be reordered, the sets must form a DAG that has a topological order which is a linear chain of N elements. But I'm not sure how to count this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that each set can be assigned a certain \"type\" based on the elements it contains. For instance, the elements in a set must be such that for any element x, x+1 is present in the next set. But since the order is arbitrary, perhaps the sets can be ordered in a way that their elements are non-decreasing in some way.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let's think about the elements in the sets. Suppose that for each set, the elements are such that they can be part of a chain where each subsequent set has elements that are one higher than the previous. For example, imagine that all sets are subsets of some structure where their elements are compatible with being in a chain.\n\nBut perhaps we can model the problem by looking at the maximum element in each set. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a sequence of sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_N arranged in some order. Then, for each consecutive pair S_i and S_{i+1}, every element in S_i must have x+1 in S_{i+1}. This implies that for each element x in S_i, x+1 must be in S_{i+1}. Therefore, the elements in S_i must be less than or equal to the maximum element of S_{i+1} minus 1. Because if S_{i+1} has an element y, then y-1 could be in S_i. But if S_i has x, then x+1 must be in S_{i+1}.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum element of S_i must be less than or equal to the maximum element of S_{i+1} minus 1. Because if S_i has an element x, then x+1 is in S_{i+1}, so x+1 <= max(S_{i+1}), hence x <= max(S_{i+1}) - 1. Therefore, the maximum element of S_i is <= max(S_{i+1}) - 1. Which implies that the maximum elements of the sets in the ordered sequence are strictly increasing by at least 1 each step.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Because if you have a sequence S_1, S_2, ..., S_N arranged in order where each is a child of the next, then the maximum element of S_1 must be <= max(S_2) - 1. Similarly, max(S_2) <= max(S_3) - 1, etc. Therefore, the max elements of the sequence form a strictly increasing sequence, each step increasing by at least 1. So, for the entire sequence, the max elements are m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, where m_i+1 >= m_i + 1.\n\nBut since each set can have elements up to K, the maximum possible value of m_N is K. So, the sequence of max elements would be m_1, m_2, ..., m_N, where m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, and each m_i+1 >= m_i + 1. But wait, m_i+1 can be m_i + 1 or more. However, the minimal possible sequence would be m_1, m_1 + 1, m_1 + 2, ..., m_1 + N-1. But since the maximum m_N can't exceed K, this implies that m_1 + N -1 <= K. Therefore, the maximum possible m_1 is K - N + 1.\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, if we can model the problem by considering the maximum elements of the sets in the ordered sequence, perhaps we can find a way to count all possible valid sequences of sets.\n\nBut here's the thing: the order of the array can be rearranged. So, for the entire array of sets, there must exist some permutation of the sets where the max elements form a strictly increasing sequence with each step increasing by at least 1. Therefore, the sets in the array must have their maximum elements such that there exists a way to arrange them in an order where each next set's maximum is at least one more than the previous.\n\nBut what's the implication for the sets themselves? Each set's maximum element can be any value, but when considering all sets, their max elements must be such that they can be ordered in a sequence where each is at least one more than the previous. So, the multiset of max elements of the sets must be such that there exists a permutation where each next element is at least one more than the previous. Which is equivalent to saying that the multiset of max elements is a collection of numbers where the maximum number is at least the minimum plus N-1 (since each step increases by at least 1). Wait, no. Because if you have N elements, the minimal possible maximum is m_min + N - 1, where m_min is the minimal element. But if the elements can be arranged in a sequence where each is at least one more than the previous, then the maximum element must be at least the minimal element plus N-1. However, this is only if the elements are all distinct. Wait, but if the max elements can be arranged in a strictly increasing sequence, then they must be distinct. Because each next element is larger than the previous. Therefore, the max elements of the sets in the array must be distinct. So, each set has a unique maximum element. Because if two sets have the same maximum, then in any permutation, they cannot be adjacent in the required order. Because if two sets have the same maximum, say m, then you can't have one before the other, because the next set must have a maximum of at least m+1. Therefore, the conclusion is that the max elements of the sets in the array must be distinct. So, for each set in the array, its maximum element is unique. Therefore, the number of sets N must be <= K. Because the maximum elements are distinct and each is between 1 and K. Wait, but if K is 2 and N is 2, then the maximum elements can be 1 and 2, which is allowed. But if N is larger than K, then it's impossible. However, looking at the sample input, for example, the first sample has N=2 and K=2, and the output is 11. So, for N=2 and K=2, it's possible. But if N=3 and K=2, then the answer would be zero. Because you can't have three distinct max elements when K=2.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is whether N > K. If N > K, then the answer is zero. Because there are only K possible distinct max elements, and we need N of them. Therefore, in that case, the answer is zero. Otherwise, when N â‰¤ K, proceed.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to considering that each set in the array must have a unique maximum element, and that these maxima can be arranged in a sequence where each is at least one more than the previous. But since the maxima are distinct, arranging them in increasing order will automatically satisfy that each next element is larger than the previous. However, the requirement for the child relationship is not just that the maxima are increasing, but also that for each set in the sequence, all elements in it are such that their x+1 is present in the next set. So, the maxima being increasing is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose that we have two sets A and B, with max(A) = m and max(B) = n, where m < n. Is that sufficient for A to be a child of B? No. Because A could have elements that are not covered by B's elements. For example, suppose A has {1,3}, and B has {2,4}. Then, for A to be a child of B, every element x in A must have x+1 in B. For x=1, x+1 is 2 which is in B. For x=3, x+1 is 4 which is in B. So yes, A is a child of B. However, if A has {1,2}, and B has {2,3}, then for x=1, x+1=2 is in B. For x=2, x+1=3 is in B. So A is a child of B. But if A has {1,3} and B has {2,3}, then for x=3, x+1 is 4, which is not in B. So A is not a child of B. Thus, even though max(A)=3 < max(B)=3? No, in this case, max(A) is 3 and max(B) is 3. But in our earlier reasoning, the maxima must be distinct. So in the scenario where the maxima are distinct, say, m and n with m < n, then for A to be a child of B, the elements of A must be such that for each x in A, x+1 is in B. How can we ensure that?\n\nWell, for any x in A, since the maximum of A is m, and the maximum of B is n â‰¥ m + 1. So x can be at most m. Then x+1 is at most m+1. Since B's maximum is n â‰¥ m+1, but that doesn't necessarily mean that x+1 is in B. For example, if m is 2, n is 3. A could be {2}, and B could be {3}. Then x+1 for 2 is 3, which is in B. So that's okay. But if A is {1}, and B is {3}, then x+1 is 2, which is not in B. Hence, A is not a child of B. Thus, even though the maxima are increasing, the sets may not satisfy the child relationship.\n\nTherefore, the condition that the maxima are strictly increasing is necessary but not sufficient. So, how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the sets in terms of their elements. For the entire array to be reorderable into a chain where each is a child of the next, the sets must be such that there exists an ordering S_1, S_2, ..., S_N where each S_i is a child of S_{i+1}. Let's think of the sets as nodes in a DAG, with edges from S_i to S_j if S_i is a child of S_j. Then, the problem requires that the array of sets can be ordered into a path of N nodes. However, counting all such arrays seems complex.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming or combinatorics. Let's think about the structure of the sets. For a set to be a child of another, the elements in the first set must be such that each x has x+1 in the second set. This implies that the elements of the first set are all less than or equal to the elements of the second set minus 1. So, for any element x in the first set, x+1 is in the second set. Therefore, the second set must contain all elements x+1 for x in the first set. However, the second set can have other elements as well.\n\nBut how can we model this for multiple sets in a sequence? Let's imagine that the sets are ordered in a sequence where each is a child of the next. Let's denote the sets as S_1, S_2, ..., S_N. Then:\n\nFor each x in S_1, x+1 is in S_2.\nFor each x in S_2, x+1 is in S_3.\n...\nFor each x in S_{N-1}, x+1 is in S_N.\n\nBut how can we model this for the entire array of sets? It seems challenging. However, perhaps there's a way to model the sets based on their elements in terms of a chain of dependencies.\n\nAnother observation: For the entire sequence of sets, each element x in any set S_i must have x+1 present in S_{i+1}, and x+2 in S_{i+2}, etc., up to S_N. Because S_i is a child of S_{i+1}, which is a child of S_{i+2}, and so on. Therefore, for any x in S_i, x + (N - i) must be present in S_N. Since S_N can't have elements larger than K, this implies that x + (N - i) â‰¤ K. Therefore, for any element x in any set S_i, x â‰¤ K - (N - i). \n\nBut since i ranges from 1 to N, the minimal value of K - (N - i) is K - N + 1 (when i=1). Therefore, all elements in all sets must be â‰¤ K - N + 1 + (N - i) ? Wait, perhaps I should think of the maximum element in S_i. Let me see. For any element x in S_i, x + (N - i) â‰¤ K. Therefore, x â‰¤ K - (N - i). The maximum x in S_i is thus at most K - (N - i). Therefore, the maximum element of S_i is at most K - (N - i). But since the maximum element of S_i is m_i, then m_i â‰¤ K - (N - i). Rearranged, m_i + (N - i) â‰¤ K. So m_i â‰¤ K - (N - i) = K - N + i. \n\nBut this seems to suggest that for each set S_i, its maximum element m_i must be â‰¤ K - N + i. However, since the sets are arranged in a sequence where each is a child of the next, the maximum elements m_1, m_2, ..., m_N must satisfy m_1 â‰¤ K - N + 1, m_2 â‰¤ K - N + 2, etc. Also, since in the sequence of sets, m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N (as discussed earlier), we can combine these conditions. \n\nBut how does this help us? Well, perhaps this gives us a way to model the problem. Let's think of the maximum elements of the sets in the sequence. Since they must be strictly increasing, and each m_i â‰¤ K - N + i. Also, since m_N is the largest, m_N â‰¤ K - N + N = K. Which is consistent.\n\nMoreover, since the sequence of maxima is m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, and each m_i â‰¤ K - N + i, then the minimal possible m_i is such that m_1 â‰¥ 1, m_2 â‰¥ m_1 + 1, etc. \n\nBut how can we model the possible choices of m_i and the corresponding sets?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows: For each set in the array, regardless of its position in the sequence, the elements it contains must be such that they can be part of a chain leading up to the final set. However, since the array can be reordered, perhaps the sets can be considered independently in terms of their elements, but with some constraints based on the overall chain.\n\nAlternatively, here's a key insight: The entire array of sets can be arranged into a sequence where each set is a child of the next. Therefore, there exists an ordering of the sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_N such that for each i, S_i is a child of S_{i+1}. Now, for this to be possible, the sets must form a chain where each set's elements are \"compatible\" with the next. However, since the order can be any permutation, perhaps the sets can be ordered in such a way that their elements are in a certain structure.\n\nLet me think about the following: For any set S, define its \"level\" as the maximum element in S. Then, for S to be a child of T, all elements in S must be such that their x+1 is in T. This implies that the level of T must be at least the level of S + 1. Because the level of S is the maximum element in S. So, for example, if S has maximum element m, then T must have at least m+1 as an element. Hence, the level of T is at least m+1. Therefore, for S to be a child of T, the level of T must be at least the level of S + 1. \n\nSo, in the ordered sequence of sets, their levels must be strictly increasing by at least 1. Which means that the levels form a strictly increasing sequence where each level is at least the previous one plus 1. However, since the levels are integers, this implies that the levels are strictly increasing by at least 1. Hence, the levels form a sequence of N distinct integers, each increasing by at least 1. Therefore, the levels can be thought of as a sequence of integers l_1, l_2, ..., l_N such that l_1 < l_2 < ... < l_N and l_i â‰¥ l_{i-1} + 1. But since they are strictly increasing, the minimal possible difference between consecutive terms is 1. Hence, the levels are strictly increasing, and each term is at least the previous plus 1. So, the levels are a strictly increasing sequence. Therefore, the levels are just a set of N distinct integers, and they can be arranged in any order as long as they form an increasing sequence. But since the array can be reordered, the actual levels can be any N distinct integers as long as there exists an ordering where they are increasing. Which is always possible as long as they are distinct. Therefore, the conclusion is that the levels of the sets in the array must be N distinct integers. And since each level is between 1 and K, we must have N â‰¤ K. Otherwise, the answer is zero.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that even with distinct levels, the sets might not be able to be arranged into a chain. However, if the levels are distinct, and we arrange them in increasing order, then for each consecutive pair, the level of the first is less than the level of the second. But how does that ensure that the first is a child of the second?\n\nAh, because the level of the first is l_i and the level of the second is l_{i+1} â‰¥ l_i + 1. However, this doesn't necessarily imply that all elements in the first set are such that x+1 is in the second set. For example, if the first set has an element l_i, then x+1 = l_i + 1. Since the second set has level l_{i+1} â‰¥ l_i + 1, but it may not contain l_i + 1. For example, if the first set has level 2 (so contains 2), and the second set has level 3 (contains 3). Then, the first set's element 2 requires that 3 is in the second set. Which is true. So, in this case, it's okay. Wait, but what if the first set contains 1, and the second set contains 3. Then, the first set's element 1 requires that 2 is in the second set. But the second set has level 3, which contains 3, but not necessarily 2. Hence, this would not satisfy the condition.\n\nAh! So the problem arises when the first set has elements that are not directly below the level of the second set. Therefore, the levels being strictly increasing is necessary but not sufficient. There's an additional constraint that for each set S_i with level l_i, all elements x in S_i must satisfy x+1 is present in the next set S_{i+1} (in the ordered sequence). \n\nThis seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that for the sets to be arranged into a chain, each set must be a subset of the elements {1, 2, ..., l_i}, and for the next set, which has level l_{i+1} â‰¥ l_i + 1, the set must contain all elements x+1 for x in the previous set. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if the previous set has elements {1, 2}, then the next set must have 2 and 3. So, the next set must contain 2 and 3. However, the next set's level is l_{i+1} â‰¥ 3. But the next set could have level 3, containing {2,3}, or level 4, containing {2,3,4}, etc. \n\nBut how can we ensure that for all elements x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}? This seems like a dependency that requires that S_{i+1} includes all x+1 for x in S_i. Therefore, the elements of S_{i+1} must include the image of the elements of S_i under x â†’ x+1. \n\nThis seems to suggest that the sets must form a chain where each set is the predecessor of the next. This feels like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming, where we track the possible elements that can be in the sets based on their positions in the chain.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the chain of sets. Suppose we have a sequence of sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_N arranged in order such that each is a child of the next. Let's think of the elements that can be present in each set. \n\nFor S_1, it can contain any subset of elements such that for each x in S_1, x+1 is in S_2. Similarly, for S_2, each x in S_2 must have x+1 in S_3, and so on. \n\nBut since the entire array can be reordered, perhaps we can model this by considering that each set is associated with a certain level (its maximum element), and for the sets to be compatible, the elements of a set with level l must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., l}, and for any set with level l, if it appears before a set with level m â‰¥ l+1, then all elements x in the first set must have x+1 in the second set. \n\nThis seems very abstract. Perhaps we can model the problem by considering that for each set, the elements are a subset of {1, 2, ..., l}, where l is the level of the set. And for any two sets with levels l and m where l < m, the set with level l can be a child of the set with level m if and only if the set with level l contains only elements x such that x+1 is in the set with level m. \n\nBut how do we ensure that across the entire array of sets?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Let's imagine that the chain of sets is ordered in terms of increasing levels. For example, the levels are l_1 < l_2 < ... < l_N. Then, for each set S_i with level l_i, the elements of S_i must be such that for every x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}. Since S_{i+1} has level l_{i+1} â‰¥ l_i + 1, this implies that x+1 â‰¤ l_{i+1} (since x â‰¤ l_i, x+1 â‰¤ l_i + 1 â‰¤ l_{i+1} if l_{i+1} â‰¥ l_i + 1). Therefore, x+1 is within the range of S_{i+1}'s elements. However, the question is whether x+1 is actually present in S_{i+1}.\n\nThis seems to require that for each x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}. Therefore, the set S_{i+1} must contain all elements of the form x+1 for x in S_i. This implies that S_{i+1} must contain the image of S_i under the function f(x) = x+1. \n\nBut since the chain continues, this implies that S_{i+1} must contain all elements that are images of previous sets. For example, S_2 must contain all x+1 for x in S_1. S_3 must contain all x+1 for x in S_2, which includes all x+2 for x in S_1. And so on. Therefore, the elements in S_i are subsets of {1, 2, ..., l_i}, and S_i must contain elements such that their images under x â†’ x+1 are contained in S_{i+1}. \n\nThis seems to suggest that the entire chain of sets must be built in a way that the elements of each set are determined by the elements of the previous sets. For example, the elements of S_1 can be any subset of {1, ..., l_1}, but S_2 must contain all x+1 for x in S_1, and also can have other elements. However, since S_2 has level l_2 â‰¥ l_1 + 1, it must contain l_2. \n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, where for each level, we track the number of ways to choose the sets. However, given the constraints on N and K (up to 2e5), we need an O(N*K) solution or better.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of independent choices for each level. Suppose that the levels of the N sets are l_1, l_2, ..., l_N, which are distinct and ordered in increasing order. For example, l_1 < l_2 < ... < l_N. Then, the total number of ways to choose the sets for this particular sequence of levels is the product of the number of ways to choose each set S_i given the constraints from the previous sets.\n\nBut how do we compute this product?\n\nFor the first set S_1, which has level l_1. The elements of S_1 can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., l_1}, except that S_1 cannot be empty? No, the problem allows sets to be empty. However, for S_1 to be a child of S_2, if S_1 is empty, then there's no constraint on S_2. So, the number of possible sets for S_1 is 2^{l_1} (since each element can be included or not).\n\nBut then, for S_2, which has level l_2 â‰¥ l_1 + 1. The set S_2 must contain all elements x+1 for x in S_1. So, the elements of S_2 must include the image of S_1 under x â†’ x+1. Let's denote this image as S_1'. Then, S_2 can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., l_2} that contains S_1', and also contains l_2 (since the level is l_2). Wait, no. The level of S_2 is l_2, which means that l_2 is in S_2. So, S_2 must contain l_2. So, the set S_2 must contain l_2 and all elements of S_1'.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose S_2 given S_1 is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., l_2} that include l_2 and include all elements of S_1'. \n\nBut since S_1' is the set {x+1 | x âˆˆ S_1}, and S_1 can be any subset of {1, ..., l_1}, then for each choice of S_1, the required elements for S_2 are fixed. However, this seems difficult to model because it depends on S_1. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find for each level l_i, the number of possible subsets that can be chosen, considering the constraints from the previous sets. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a sequence of levels l_1 < l_2 < ... < l_N. For each i-th level l_i, the set S_i must contain l_i (since it's the maximum element), and must contain all elements that are x+1 for x in S_{i-1}. \n\nBut this seems to create a dependency between the choices of S_i and S_{i-1}. However, if we consider that for the entire chain, the elements of S_1 can be any subset of {1, ..., l_1}, then the elements of S_2 must contain {x+1 | x âˆˆ S_1} and l_2. The elements of S_3 must contain {x+1 | x âˆˆ S_2} and l_3, and so on. \n\nThis seems to imply that the elements of S_i are determined by the elements of S_{i-1} plus l_i. However, this seems too restrictive. \n\nAlternatively, think of the entire chain of sets as requiring that the elements of S_i are a subset of {1, ..., l_i}, and that for all j < i, the elements of S_i must include the images of the elements of S_{j} under the function x â†’ x + (i-j). \n\nBut this seems complex. \n\nLet me try to think of the entire chain of sets. For the chain to be valid, the elements of S_1 can be any subset of {1,...,l_1}. The elements of S_2 must include all elements of S_1 + 1 (i.e., x+1 for x in S_1), and must include l_2. The elements of S_3 must include all elements of S_2 + 1 (i.e., x+1 for x in S_2), and must include l_3. And so on. \n\nThis means that for the entire chain, the elements of S_i must include all elements that are x + (i-1) for x in S_1. Because S_2 includes x+1 for x in S_1, S_3 includes x+2 for x in S_1, etc. \n\nBut since the chain has N sets, the elements of S_i must include x + (i-1) for all x in S_1. However, since the maximum element of S_i is l_i, this implies that x + (i-1) â‰¤ l_i. For all x in S_1. \n\nSince x â‰¤ l_1, this implies that l_1 + (i-1) â‰¤ l_i. \n\nBut since the levels are l_1 < l_2 < ... < l_N, this implies that for each i â‰¥ 1, l_i â‰¥ l_1 + (i-1). \n\nSimilarly, for the first level l_1, the maximum element of S_1 is l_1. For the second level l_2, we have l_2 â‰¥ l_1 + 1. For the third level l_3 â‰¥ l_2 + 1 â‰¥ l_1 + 2. And so on. Hence, for the i-th level, l_i â‰¥ l_1 + (i-1). \n\nBut since the levels are strictly increasing, this implies that l_i â‰¥ l_1 + (i-1). \n\nBut since the last level l_N must be â‰¤ K, we have l_1 + (N-1) â‰¤ K. Hence, l_1 â‰¤ K - N + 1. \n\nThis is a key insight! The levels must be chosen such that l_1, l_2, ..., l_N are strictly increasing and l_i â‰¥ l_1 + i-1. \n\nBut since the levels are strictly increasing, l_1 + i-1 â‰¤ l_i â‰¤ K. \n\nBut this suggests that for the entire chain, the levels are determined by l_1, and each l_i = l_1 + i-1. Because if l_i is greater than l_1 + i-1, then there's more flexibility, but the minimal possible l_i is l_1 + i-1. However, this seems to complicate things. \n\nBut perhaps the only way for the chain to be valid is that for each level i, l_i = l_1 + i-1. Because if l_i is larger than this, then the elements of S_1 can have values up to l_1, and for the chain to be valid, the elements of S_i would have to include x + (i-1) for x in S_1. Since x â‰¤ l_1, x + (i-1) â‰¤ l_1 + i-1 = l_i. Hence, if l_i is exactly l_1 + i-1, then x + (i-1) can be up to l_i. If l_i is larger than this, then x + (i-1) is still â‰¤ l_i, so it's allowed. But in this case, the elements of S_i can be any subset of {1, ..., l_i} that contains l_i and the required elements from the previous sets. \n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's think of it this way: For the chain of sets to be valid, the elements of S_1 can be any subset of {1, ..., l_1}, and for each subsequent set S_i, the elements are any subset of {1, ..., l_i} that contains l_i and the elements derived from the previous sets. But how do we count this?\n\nMaybe the answer lies in realizing that for any valid sequence of levels l_1 < l_2 < ... < l_N, the number of ways to choose the sets is equal to the product for each i from 1 to N of (number of subsets of {1, ..., l_i} that contain l_i and are compatible with the previous sets). However, this seems difficult to compute unless there's a pattern.\n\nBut let's think about the compatibility condition. For the chain of sets, the elements of S_2 must include all x+1 for x in S_1. The elements of S_3 must include all x+1 for x in S_2, which includes x+2 for x in S_1, etc. So, for the entire chain, the elements of S_i must include all x + (i-1) for x in S_1. \n\nBut since the maximum element of S_i is l_i, we must have x + (i-1) â‰¤ l_i for all x in S_1.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each set is a child of the next set in the sequence. The key insight is to model the problem using dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics to efficiently compute the result under the given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Child Relationship**: A set A is a child of set B if every element x in A has x+1 in B. This implies that the maximum element of A must be less than the maximum element of B by at least 1.\n2. **Strictly Increasing Levels**: For the sets to be rearranged into a valid sequence, their maximum elements (referred to as levels) must be strictly increasing. This ensures that each set can potentially be a child of the next.\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Combinatorics**: We use dynamic programming to track the number of valid ways to form sets up to a certain level. The number of valid subsets for each level can be computed using powers of 2, adjusted for the constraints of the problem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    if N > K:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute powers of 2 modulo MOD\n    max_pow = K + 1\n    pow2 = [1] * (max_pow + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_pow + 1):\n        pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] * 2) % MOD\n    \n    # The answer is the sum over all possible l_1 of (product_{i=1 to N} (2^{l_i - (l_1 + i -1)} )) ) \n    # where l_i = l_1 + i -1, and l_1 + N -1 <= K\n    # So l_1 ranges from 1 to K - N + 1\n    # For each l_1, the product is product_{i=1 to N} (2^{(l_1 + i -1) - (l_1 + i -1)} ) ?
