    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the task is to count the number of arrays of N sets that can be rearranged such that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"child\" set means here. The definition says that for each element x in A (the child set), there must be an element x+1 in B (the parent set). So, for example, if a set A has {1}, then the parent set B must have 2. If A has {1,2}, then B must have 2 and 3. Wait, but each element in A requires that x+1 is present in B. So, for every x in A, x+1 is in B.\n\nNow, the problem is about finding arrays of N sets where there's some permutation of them such that each consecutive pair satisfies this child-parent relationship.\n\nSo, how do I model this? Let's think about the constraints on the sets. For any valid arrangement, the sets must form a chain where each set is a child of the next. But since we can permute the array, the actual order isn't fixed. However, the problem requires that there exists at least one permutation where the chain is satisfied.\n\nBut how do we model this for counting all possible arrays?\n\nLet me think about the properties that the sets must satisfy collectively. Suppose we arrange them in some order S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N such that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nWhat does that imply about the sets? Let's consider the entire sequence. For each element x in S'_i, there must be x+1 in S'_{i+1}. Then, for S'_i's elements, they must be \"covered\" by the next set. But since this is a chain, perhaps there's a way to model the dependencies between the sets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire collection of sets must form a DAG where there's a topological order that satisfies the child-parent relationships. But since we can arrange the sets in any order, perhaps the problem reduces to some condition on the sets themselves.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any permutation of the array. So, the sets can be ordered in any way as long as there's a chain where each set is a child of the next. But how can we model this?\n\nAnother approach: think of the sets as nodes in a graph. There's a directed edge from A to B if A is a child of B. Then, the problem requires that there's a path of length N-1 in this graph, visiting each node exactly once (since each set is used once in the array). But since the array can be permuted, the question is whether the sets can be arranged into a Hamiltonian path where each step follows the child-parent relationship.\n\nBut considering all possibilities for N up to 2e5, this seems computationally impossible. So there must be a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the properties that each set must have in relation to others. For example, if there's a set S that contains some element x, then in the permutation, there must be a set after S that contains x+1. But since the permutation can be arranged in any order, maybe the sets can be ordered in such a way that their elements are non-decreasing in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sets can be ordered in a way where their elements are \"compatible\" with the chain. Let's think about the entire collection of sets. For any element x present in any set, there must be a set that contains x+1. Otherwise, if there's a set containing x, but no set contains x+1, then in the chain, that set cannot be followed by any other set (because for that set to be a child of the next, the next must contain x+1). But if there's a set with x and no set has x+1, then that set must be the last in the permutation. However, if there's another set that comes after it, which would require that set to contain x+1. So, this suggests that for all elements x in any set, there must be a set containing x+1, except possibly for x=K.\n\nWait, but if K is the maximum value, then there's no x+1 for K. So, any set containing K can be placed as the last set in the permutation. Because if a set contains K, then for it to be a child of the next set, the next set must contain K+1, which doesn't exist. Therefore, such a set cannot be followed by any other set. Hence, in the permutation, any set that contains K must be the last element in the chain.\n\nThis seems like a key insight. Let me formalize this:\n\nFor the entire array of sets, when arranged in some order, each set except the last must not contain any element x where x+1 is not present in some set that comes after it. But since the permutation is arbitrary, maybe the only way to arrange them is that for every element x present in any set, there is at least one set in the array that contains x+1, unless x is K.\n\nWait, but if there's a set with x, and x+1 is not present in any set, then that set must be the last in the permutation. However, if there are multiple such sets (for example, two sets containing K), then they can't all be last. So, in that case, there's no way to arrange them, because you can't have more than one set as the last in the chain. Therefore, the total number of such arrays must have that all elements except possibly K are covered by some set in the array.\n\nWait, but if there's a set containing x (x < K), then there must be at least one set in the array that contains x+1. Otherwise, if there's a set with x, but no set with x+1, then that set cannot be placed in the permutation except as the last element. But if there are multiple such sets, say, two sets with x where x+1 is missing, then they can't both be last. Hence, such an array is invalid.\n\nTherefore, for the array to be valid, the following must hold:\n\nFor every x in 1..K-1, there exists at least one set in the array that contains x+1. Because otherwise, if there's a set with x (where x < K), then there's no set with x+1, and thus that set can't be placed except as the last in the permutation. But if there are multiple such x's, or multiple sets that require being last, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe the array can have some sets that contain elements x where x+1 is not present in any set. But those sets must be the last in the permutation. So, if there are multiple such sets, then the permutation can't be formed. Hence, the array is only valid if there is at most one such set (the last in the permutation) that contains elements x where x+1 is not present in any set. But how do we handle this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire array must satisfy that for every x in 1..K, the number of times x appears in the sets (across all sets) is equal to the number of times x+1 appears. Except for x=K, which can be anything. Wait, maybe not. Because each occurrence of x in a set must be \"covered\" by a set that contains x+1. But since the permutation can arrange the sets, perhaps the total number of x's across all sets must be less than or equal to the number of x+1's across all sets. Because for each x in a set, there's a corresponding x+1 in some other set (possibly the same set? No, because a set can't be a child of itself. Wait, no. The child relationship is between two different sets. So, for example, if a set A contains x, then in the permutation, there must be a set B that comes after A which contains x+1. So, the same set can't be both A and B, since B must come after A. So, for each occurrence of x in any set, there must be at least one occurrence of x+1 in some other set.\n\nWait, but if there's a set that contains x and x+1, then perhaps in the permutation, that set could be followed by a set that contains x+1. But wait, no. Because if a set A contains x, then it needs to be followed by a set B that contains x+1. If the same set A contains x+1, then that's not sufficient. Because the set A can't be followed by itself. So, for each x in any set, there must be at least one other set in the array that contains x+1. Unless x is K.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think about the entire array of sets. When arranged in a certain order, each set S_i (in the permutation) must be a child of the next set S_{i+1}. Which implies that for every x in S_i, there's an x+1 in S_{i+1}.\n\nNow, suppose that the entire permutation is S_1', S_2', ..., S_N'. Then, for each element x in S_1', there must be x+1 in S_2'. For each element x in S_2', there must be x+1 in S_3', etc. So, for any element x in any set S_i', there must be a set that comes after S_i' which contains x+1. So, for all x in any set, there must be some set in the array that contains x+1 (except for x=K, which can be in the last set).\n\nTherefore, the entire array must satisfy that for all x in 1..K-1, the number of times x appears in any set is less than or equal to the number of times x+1 appears in any set. Wait, no. Because for each occurrence of x, there must be at least one occurrence of x+1 in some set. But that's not necessarily the same as the total counts. For example, if x appears once, and x+1 appears once, that's okay. But if x appears twice and x+1 appears once, then that's not possible, because one occurrence of x would need to be covered by x+1, but the second occurrence would have no coverage. Therefore, for all x in 1..K-1, the total number of occurrences of x across all sets must be â‰¤ the total number of occurrences of x+1 across all sets.\n\nBut wait, the total counts can be anything as long as this holds. Because for each occurrence of x, there's some x+1 in some set. But how does that relate to the problem?\n\nBut the problem is not about the counts of elements, but the structure of the sets. However, perhaps this condition is necessary and sufficient for the array to be valid. Let me think: if for all x in 1..K-1, the number of times x appears across all sets is â‰¤ the number of times x+1 appears across all sets, then there exists a permutation of the sets that satisfies the condition. And vice versa, if such a permutation exists, then this condition must hold.\n\nIf that's true, then the problem reduces to counting the number of arrays of N sets (each subset of {1..K}) such that for each x in 1..K-1, the total count of x across all sets is â‰¤ the total count of x+1 across all sets.\n\nBut how to model this? Because each set can have any elements, but the sum over all sets for x must be â‰¤ sum for x+1.\n\nBut how to count that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to the following: the entire collection of elements across all sets must form a chain where each element x (except K) is present in at most as many sets as x+1. Because for each occurrence of x, there's a corresponding occurrence of x+1 in some set.\n\nBut how to model this for the problem?\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of generating functions or dynamic programming. Since each set can be represented as a subset of {1..K}, but with constraints on the counts.\n\nBut even that seems challenging. However, perhaps we can model this per element. For example, for each x from 1 to K, we can think of how many times x appears in the entire array of sets. Let me denote c_x as the total number of times x appears across all N sets. Then, the constraints are that for x < K, c_x â‰¤ c_{x+1}.\n\nBut how does this relate to the actual problem? Because each set is a collection of elements, and the counts c_x are the sum of the elements in each set. For example, if a set contains x, then it contributes 1 to c_x.\n\nBut the problem is to count all possible arrays of N sets, where each set is a subset of {1..K}, and the c_x's satisfy c_x â‰¤ c_{x+1} for all x < K.\n\nWait, but this seems like a possible approach. Because if this condition is satisfied, then there exists a permutation of the sets such that the chain is satisfied. But how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose that for all x < K, c_x â‰¤ c_{x+1}. How can we arrange the sets into a permutation that satisfies the chain condition?\n\nWe can think of the elements as forming a chain. For each x, there are enough x+1's to cover the x's. So, for example, arrange the sets in such a way that for each occurrence of x in a set, there is a later set that contains x+1.\n\nOne way to do this is to arrange the sets in the order of their \"maximum element\". For example, sets with higher elements come later. Then, for any set S that contains x, there must be some set after S that contains x+1. But why?\n\nBecause the total number of x's is â‰¤ the number of x+1's. So, if we arrange the sets in order of their maximum elements, then for any set that contains x, there are enough x+1's in the later sets. But I'm not sure. However, this seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each set is a node. There's an edge from A to B if A is a child of B. Then, the problem requires that there exists a Hamiltonian path in this graph. However, this seems too abstract to model directly.\n\nBut going back to the earlier idea: if the total counts satisfy c_x â‰¤ c_{x+1} for all x < K, then the answer is the product of possibilities for each element. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of each element x. For each occurrence of x in the entire array of sets, there must be an occurrence of x+1. But how does that affect the count of the sets?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the entire array of sets as a collection of elements, and the constraints are that for each x, the number of times x appears in all sets is â‰¤ the number of times x+1 appears in all sets.\n\nIf this is true, then the problem becomes counting the number of arrays of N sets (each being a subset of {1..K}) such that for all x < K, the total number of times x appears in all sets is â‰¤ the total number of times x+1 appears in all sets.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet me think of each element x independently. However, since the choices for different elements are not independent (because a set can contain multiple elements), this might not be straightforward. However, perhaps there's a way to model this with inclusion-exclusion or dynamic programming.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire problem as a product of possibilities for each element. For example, for each element x, the number of times it appears across all sets can be any number, but with the constraint that c_x â‰¤ c_{x+1}.\n\nBut how to model the fact that a set can contain multiple elements. For example, a set can contain both x and y, contributing to both c_x and c_y.\n\nThis seems complex. However, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: For each element x, we can decide how many times it appears across all N sets. Let's denote m_x as the number of times x appears in all sets. Then, the constraints are m_1 â‰¤ m_2 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ m_K.\n\nOnce these m_x's are chosen, how many arrays of sets are there that have exactly m_x occurrences of x?\n\nBut the problem is that the same set can contribute to multiple m_x's. For example, a set containing both x and y contributes 1 to m_x and 1 to m_y. So, the total number of arrays that have m_1, m_2,...,m_K is the number of ways to assign elements to sets such that each element x appears exactly m_x times across all sets. However, this seems difficult to compute directly.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to model this. Let's think of each set as a subset of {1..K}. Each element x can be present or not in a set. However, the total number of times x appears across all sets is m_x.\n\nBut the problem is that the same set can have multiple elements, so the choices are not independent.\n\nHowever, there's a clever way to model this. For each element x, the presence in the sets is independent of other elements. Wait, no. Because the same set can contain multiple elements, but the choices for each element's presence in the sets are not independent. However, if we think of the entire problem as choosing for each element x, how many times it appears across all sets, and then multiply the possibilities for each element, assuming independence. But that's not correct, because the same set can contain multiple elements. However, perhaps there's a way to model this.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each element x, the choice of whether it appears in a particular set is independent of other elements. But that's not true, because the same set can have multiple elements. However, when considering the total number of arrays of sets that have certain m_x counts, perhaps the total is the product over x of the number of ways to choose the positions where x appears in the sets, multiplied by something else. Wait, but that's not correct either.\n\nAlternatively, think of each set as a collection of elements, and each element x can be present in any number of sets. The total number of arrays of N sets where for each x, the total number of times x appears across all sets is exactly m_x is equal to the product for each x of (number of ways to choose which sets contain x) multiplied by ... something? No, because the same set can have multiple elements. However, the presence of x in a set is independent of the presence of y in the same set.\n\nWait, here's a crucial observation: Each set can be considered as a subset of {1..K}. The total number of arrays of N sets where for each x, the number of sets that contain x is exactly t_x is equal to the product for each x of (C(N, t_x)) multiplied by ... no, that's not right. Because the presence of x in a set is independent of other elements. So, for example, the total number of arrays where for each x, x appears in exactly t_x sets is equal to the product for each x of (number of ways to choose which sets contain x) divided by ... no, that's not correct. Because each set can contain any combination of elements. So the total number of arrays is the product for each x of (number of ways to choose which sets contain x) divided by ... nothing. Because for each element x, the choice of which sets contain x is independent of other elements. So, the total number of arrays is the product for each x of (number of subsets of the N sets where x is present in exactly t_x sets). But since each set can have any combination of elements, the choices for different elements are independent. Therefore, the total number of arrays is the product over x of (C(N, t_x)).\n\nWait, this is a key point. For example, suppose that for element x, we decide that it appears in exactly t_x sets. For each of the N sets, the element x can be present or not, but the total number of sets that have x is t_x. The number of ways to choose which sets have x is C(N, t_x). Since the presence of x in a set is independent of the presence of other elements, the total number of arrays is the product over x of C(N, t_x). Because for each element x, we choose which sets include x (t_x sets), and since the choices for different elements are independent, we multiply them.\n\nYes! That's correct. Because each set is a collection of elements. For each element x, the choice of which sets contain x is independent of the choices for other elements. So, the total number of arrays where for each x, x appears in exactly t_x sets is the product of C(N, t_x) for all x. \n\nSo, if we can find all sequences of m_1, m_2, ..., m_K where m_1 â‰¤ m_2 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ m_K, then the answer is the sum over all such sequences of the product for each x of C(N, m_x). \n\nBut wait, no. Because m_x here is the number of sets that contain x. But earlier, we thought of m_x as the total number of occurrences of x across all sets. But in this case, since each occurrence of x in a set is exactly once (since the sets are collections of distinct elements). So, if a set contains x, then it contributes exactly one to the count of x. So, the total number of occurrences of x across all sets is equal to the number of sets that contain x. Therefore, the earlier idea is correct. Thus, the constraints are that for all x < K, the number of sets that contain x (call it t_x) is â‰¤ the number of sets that contain x+1 (t_{x+1}).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of tuples (t_1, t_2, ..., t_K) where 0 â‰¤ t_x â‰¤ N for all x, and t_1 â‰¤ t_2 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ t_K, and then for each such tuple, multiply the product of C(N, t_x) for all x, and sum all those products.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem now is to compute the sum over all non-decreasing sequences (t_1 â‰¤ t_2 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ t_K) of the product of C(N, t_x) for each x.\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me think of dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i][j] as the sum of products for the first i elements, with the i-th element being j. Then, for each i, j, we can transition from dp[i-1][k] where k â‰¤ j. But with K up to 2e5 and N up to 2e5, this would be O(K*N^2) which is way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think of the problem as follows: For each x from 1 to K, the value t_x must be â‰¥ t_{x-1}, and for each x, t_x can be between 0 and N. The total sum is the product of the C(N, t_x) for each x, summed over all non-decreasing sequences.\n\nThis looks similar to the problem of counting the number of non-decreasing sequences with certain weights. For example, for K elements, each can take a value between 0 and N, and the sequence must be non-decreasing. The weight of a sequence is the product of C(N, t_x) for each x.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the first element (x=1), then the second (x=2), and so on. For the first element, t_1 can be any value between 0 and N. For each choice of t_1, the next element t_2 must be â‰¥ t_1, and so on.\n\nLet me think of f(k, v) as the sum of the product of C(N, t_1) * ... * C(N, t_k) for all non-decreasing sequences t_1 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ t_k where t_k = v.\n\nThen, the answer would be f(K, v) summed over all v from 0 to N.\n\nThe recurrence for f(k, v) would be:\n\nf(k, v) = sum_{u â‰¤ v} f(k-1, u) * C(N, v)\n\nBut wait, no. Because for the k-th element, which is v, the previous element must be â‰¤ v. So, the recurrence for f(k, v) is the sum over u from 0 to v of f(k-1, u) multiplied by C(N, v). However, for the base case, when k=1, f(1, v) = C(N, v).\n\nBut this recurrence would allow us to compute f(K, v) for all v. However, the problem is that K can be up to 2e5, and N is up to 2e5. So, for each k, we need to compute for each v up to N. This would be O(K*N) time, which is acceptable for K and N up to 2e5, since 2e5 * 2e5 is 4e10, which is way too big. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm. We need a better way. Let's think about the problem again. The sum we want is the sum over all non-decreasing sequences of t_1 â‰¤ t_2 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ t_K of the product of C(N, t_i). Let's denote this as S.\n\nNote that the sum S is equal to the coefficient of x^something in some generating function. Alternatively, think of the problem as follows: each element x can be considered as a variable that contributes a generating function. Since the sequence is non-decreasing, we can model this with generating functions that account for the constraints.\n\nLet me think of the generating function for a single element. For the first element, the generating function is sum_{v=0}^N C(N, v) * x^v. But for the second element, since it must be â‰¥ the first, the generating function would be the convolution of the previous generating function with itself, but with the constraint that the second term is â‰¥ the first. Wait, but this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, since the sequence is non-decreasing, the problem can be transformed into considering the variables t_1 â‰¤ t_2 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ t_K. This is equivalent to choosing values a_1, a_2, ..., a_K such that a_1 â‰¤ a_2 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ a_K, and each a_i is between 0 and N. The sum we want is the product of C(N, a_i) for all i.\n\nBut this is the same as the sum over all multisets of size K (with elements between 0 and N) of the product of C(N, a_i), where the multiset is sorted. However, the sum can be rewritten as the product of (sum_{v=0}^N C(N, v) * x^v)^{something}? Not sure.\n\nWait, but there's a combinatorial identity here. Let me think about the case when K=1. Then, the sum is sum_{v=0}^N C(N, v) = 2^N. For K=2, the sum is sum_{v1 <= v2} C(N, v1) * C(N, v2). Which is equal to [sum_{v=0}^N C(N, v)]^2 + sum_{v=0}^N C(N, v)^2} / 2? No, wait, the sum over v1 <= v2 of C(N,v1)*C(N,v2) is equal to [ (sum C(N,v))^2 + sum C(N,v)^2 ] / 2. But this seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps there's a generating function approach. Let me think about the generating function for a single element. For each element, the generating function is G(x) = sum_{v=0}^N C(N, v) * x^v = (1 + x)^N. However, since the sequence must be non-decreasing, the problem is to compute the coefficient of x^{something} in the product of generating functions, but with constraints on the exponents.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the non-decreasing sequence t_1 â‰¤ t_2 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ t_K can be represented as a sequence of values where each t_i can be any value between 0 and N, but each subsequent value is at least as large as the previous. This is equivalent to choosing a multiset of K elements with repetition allowed, where each element is between 0 and N. However, the order is enforced to be non-decreasing.\n\nThe sum S is the sum over all such multisets of the product of C(N, t_i) for each element in the multiset. \n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me consider that for each element in the multiset, the contribution is C(N, t_i). Since the multiset is unordered, but we can think of it as ordered in non-decreasing order. However, the sum S is the same as the coefficient of y^K in the generating function product_{v=0}^N (1 + y * C(N, v) + y^2 * C(N, v)^2 + ... ) ?\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Because for each position in the multiset, the choice is to select a value v, and for each such selection, it contributes C(N, v) to the product. But since the multiset can have multiple elements with the same value, the generating function for each value v is sum_{k=0}^\\infty (C(N, v) * y)^k = 1/(1 - C(N, v) y). However, since the elements are non-decreasing, the order is not considered. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the number of non-decreasing sequences of length K with elements between 0 and N is equivalent to the number of ways to choose K elements with replacement, where order doesn't matter. However, the sum S is the sum over all such combinations, multiplied by the product of C(N, v_i) for each element v_i in the combination. \n\nBut this is equivalent to the coefficient of y^K in the product_{v=0}^N (1 + y * C(N, v) + y^2 * C(N, v)^2 + ...) ?\n\nNo, that would be the case if the order didn't matter. Wait, no. Because the generating function for each value v is sum_{k=0}^\\infty (C(N, v) * y)^k. But when you take the product over all v, you get the generating function for the number of multisets where each element can be chosen any number of times. However, the coefficient of y^K would be the sum over all multisets of size K of the product of C(N, v) for each element in the multiset. Which is exactly our S. \n\nBut this is a key insight! So, the sum S is equal to the coefficient of y^K in the product_{v=0}^N (1/(1 - C(N, v) * y )).\n\nBut wait, because for each value v, we can choose to include it any number of times (including zero) in the multiset. However, the product_{v} 1/(1 - a_v y) is the generating function for the sum over all multisets of the product of a_v for each element in the multiset. So yes, this seems correct.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to computing the coefficient of y^K in the product_{v=0}^N [ 1 / (1 - C(N, v) * y) ].\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that N can be up to 2e5, and K is up to 2e5. Let's think about the product.\n\nLet me denote that for each v in 0..N, the term is 1/(1 - c_v y), where c_v = C(N, v). The product is P(y) = product_{v=0}^N 1/(1 - c_v y).\n\nWe need to find the coefficient of y^K in P(y).\n\nBut how can we compute this coefficient? \n\nLet me think about the logarithm of the product, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, note that the product can be written as a generating function, and we can compute it using dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think of the generating function as follows: initially, the generating function is 1. For each term in the product, we multiply it by the current generating function. For example, for each v in 0..N, we multiply the existing generating function by 1/(1 - c_v y). \n\nBut multiplying by 1/(1 - c_v y) is equivalent to adding terms where we can choose to include any number of copies of c_v y. So, the generating function after processing all terms would be the sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k y^k, where a_k is the sum we're trying to compute (for k=K).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? Let's think of dynamic programming. Let dp[k] be the coefficient of y^k in the generating function. Initially, dp[0] = 1, and dp[k] = 0 for k>0.\n\nFor each v in 0..N, we need to update the dp array by multiplying it with 1/(1 - c_v y). This is equivalent to adding to dp[k] the term dp[k - m] * c_v^m for m >= 0. But this seems like a convolution that would take O(K^2) time, which is not feasible for K up to 2e5.\n\nBut there's a smarter way. Multiplying by 1/(1 - c y) is equivalent to taking the generating function F(y) and transforming it into F(y) * sum_{m=0}^\\infty (c y)^m. So, the new coefficient for y^k is the sum_{m=0}^k (old coefficient for y^{k - m} * c^m). \n\nBut this is the same as the recurrence:\n\nnew_dp[k] = old_dp[k] + c * new_dp[k-1]\n\nWait, no. Let's think of the standard way to compute the coefficients when multiplying by 1/(1 - c y). Suppose we have a generating function F(y) = sum_{k} a_k y^k. Then, multiplying by 1/(1 - c y) gives F(y) * sum_{m=0}^\\infty c^m y^m. The coefficient of y^k in this product is sum_{i=0}^k a_i * c^{k - i} }.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the recurrence for dp[k]. For each step, when we process a new term (c_v), the new dp[k] is the sum_{m=0}^k dp_prev[m] * c_v^{k - m} }, which can be rewritten as dp_prev[k] + c_v * dp_new[k-1]. But this seems to suggest that we can compute it in O(K) time per term. However, for each term, this would be O(K) time, and with N+1 terms (from v=0 to N), this would be O(K*N) time, which is O(4e10) for N=2e5. That's way too slow.\n\nBut there's a way to optimize this. Let's note that for each v, the term is 1/(1 - c_v y), and the product of all these terms is the generating function. However, the order in which we multiply these terms doesn't matter. So, perhaps there's a way to find a closed-form formula for this product.\n\nAlternatively, note that the product_{v=0}^N 1/(1 - C(N, v) y) can be simplified. Let's think about what C(N, v) is. For v from 0 to N, C(N, v) is the binomial coefficient. But the product of 1/(1 - C(N, v) y) for v=0 to N is equal to product_{v=0}^N 1/(1 - C(N, v) y). \n\nBut wait, C(N, 0) = 1, C(N, 1) = N, C(N, 2) = N*(N-1)/2, etc. However, I don't see an obvious simplification here.\n\nBut there's another observation: For the product_{v=0}^N (1 - C(N, v) y) = ? Well, it's not clear. However, perhaps we can find a generating function identity that helps here.\n\nWait, but there's a known identity that sum_{k=0}^N C(N, k) x^k = (1 + x)^N. However, our product involves terms of the form 1/(1 - C(N, v) y), which seems unrelated.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way. Let's think about the original problem again. The sum we're trying to compute is the number of arrays of N sets, with the condition that for all x < K, the number of sets containing x is â‰¤ the number of sets containing x+1. \n\nBut earlier, we transformed this into the sum over all non-decreasing sequences of t_1 â‰¤ t_2 â‰¤ ... â‰¤ t_K, with each t_x between 0 and N, and the product of C(N, t_x) for all x. \n\nBut what if K=0? Well, K is given as at least 1 according to the input constraints. \n\nBut how to compute this sum? Maybe there's a way to model it with dynamic programming, but with",
