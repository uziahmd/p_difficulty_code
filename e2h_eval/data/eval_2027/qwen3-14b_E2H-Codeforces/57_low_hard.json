His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores for all participants, but they are not linked to names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b, right? Wait, no. Wait, the input gives two lists: the first list is the first tour points for all participants, and the second list is the second tour points. But the problem says that each participant participated in both tours. However, the way the data is given is that the a's and b's are in arbitrary order. So, for example, the first participant's first tour score is a_1, but their second tour score could be any of the b's. But the problem says that the actual pairing is unknown. So for the purpose of calculating Vasya's possible positions, we can assume that Vasya's total is at least x, and we need to find the best and worst possible ranks he can have.\n\nWait, but the problem says that there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >= x. So Vasya's actual total is at least x. But since the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to Vasya, we have to consider all possibilities where Vasya's total is a_i + b_j (for some i and j) such that this sum is >=x. But how do we model this?\n\nThe problem is to find the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings of a's and b's (each participant must have exactly one a and one b, but the pairing is unknown). However, since the actual pairing is unknown, the teacher needs to consider all possible pairings (so for the best case, we arrange the pairings such that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and for the worst case, as low as possible, but ensuring that his total is at least x).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that Vasya has a total of at least x points. So when considering possible pairings, the actual Vasya's a_i and b_j must be such that their sum is >=x. But the teacher wants to find the best and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings where there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x (and that pair is Vasya's). But since the other participants' pairings can be arranged in any way, as long as each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor the best possible rank, we want to maximize the number of people who have a higher total than Vasya. Wait, no. For the best possible rank, we want to minimize the number of people who have a higher total than Vasya. So, the best possible rank is 1 if we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's total is the maximum possible. For the worst possible rank, we want to maximize the number of people who have a higher or equal total than Vasya (but considering that the jury can assign ranks in case of ties).\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. To find the best possible rank for Vasya:\n\nWe can choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible, and then arrange the rest of the pairings so that as few as possible people have a higher sum than Vasya. So, the best possible rank would be determined by how many people can have a sum greater than Vasya's sum (which is the maximum possible sum he can have).\n\nBut wait, since we can choose the pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya, the best possible scenario is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible. Then, the number of people with a sum strictly greater than that would determine his rank. Because in that case, the best possible rank is 1 + the number of people with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how do we compute that? Because for the best case, we can select the maximum possible sum for Vasya (i.e., the maximum a_i + b_j possible), and then count how many pairs (from the remaining a's and b's) have a sum greater than that. Wait, no. Because in reality, the pairings must be a permutation of the b's. So, the problem is that when you choose a particular a_i and b_j for Vasya, the rest of the pairings are permutations of the remaining a's and b's. However, for the best possible rank, we can arrange the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to determine these ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we assume Vasya's score is the maximum possible sum of any pair from the first and second tours. We then count how many other participants can have a higher score than this maximum, which gives the best rank.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we consider the minimum possible score for Vasya (which is at least x) and count how many participants can have a score greater than or equal to this minimum. This count helps determine the worst possible rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    n, x = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort a and b for efficient processing\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best case: maximize Vasya's total\n    max_vasya = 0\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        # Find the largest bj such that ai + bj is as big as possible\n        # Since b is sorted, take the last element\n        max_vasya = max(max_vasya, ai + b_sorted[-1])\n    \n    # Now count how many pairs have sum > max_vasya\n    # But since we can arrange the pairing, the best case is that only those pairs which can be greater than max_vasya exist\n    # However, since max_vasya is the maximum possible, there are none\n    best_rank = 1\n    \n    # Worst case: minimize Vasya's total (but at least x)\n    # We need to find the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and then count how many pairs can have sum >= this value\n    # However, since we can choose any pair for Vasya with sum >=x, the worst case is when his sum is as small as possible\n    # So find the minimal possible sum >=x\n    # To find this, we can use two pointers approach\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order\n    # Find the minimal sum >=x\n    min_vasya = float('inf')\n    i = 0\n    j = len(b_sorted) - 1\n    while i < len(a_sorted) and j >= 0:\n        s = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j]\n        if s >= x:\n            min_vasya = min(min_vasya, s)\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Now, we need to count the number of pairs that can have sum >= min_vasya\n    # However, since we can arrange the pairings, we need to find the maximum number of pairs that can be >= min_vasya\n    # For the worst case, we want as many people as possible to have sum >= min_vasya\n    # So we need to find how many pairs can have sum >= min_vasya, considering that each a and b is used once\n    # To compute this, we can sort both arrays and use a two-pointer approach to count the number of pairs >= min_vasya\n    \n    # However, since we are looking for the worst case, we need to maximize the number of people with sum >= min_vasya\n    # Which is equivalent to counting the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= min_vasya\n    # But since we can arrange the pairings, the maximum number of such pairs is the number of pairs that can be formed with sum >= min_vasya\n    \n    # To compute this, we can use a two-pointer approach:\n    # Sort a in ascending and b in descending order\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    count = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a_asc[i] + b_desc[j] >= min_vasya:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    \n    # The worst rank is count + 1 (since Vasya is one of them)\n    worst_rank = count + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: We determine the maximum possible score Vasya can achieve by pairing the highest values from both tours. Since this is the highest possible score, no one can have a higher score, making the best rank 1.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: We find the minimum possible score Vasya can have that is still at least x. Using a two-pointer technique, we count how many participants can have scores greater than or equal to this minimum score, which gives the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures we consider all possible pairings to determine the best and worst ranks accurately.",
