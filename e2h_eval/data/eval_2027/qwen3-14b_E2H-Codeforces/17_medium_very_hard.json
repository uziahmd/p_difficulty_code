He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there exists at least one possible string s that fits these assignments.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The answer must be valid in the sense that there's some s that matches the assignments.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The key idea is to find for each possible candidate string s (which is of length n), check if all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes, and then assign P/S accordingly. However, since n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities might be computationally expensive. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, but how many possible s are there? For example, if n is 100, the number of possible strings is 26^100, which is way too big. So brute-forcing all possible s isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: The correct s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input includes all the proper prefixes and suffixes of s, the correct s must be such that for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings: one is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a way to assign each input string as either a prefix or a suffix such that:\n\n- For each length l (from 1 to n-1), exactly one of the two strings of length l is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix of s.\n\nBut how do we find such an assignment?\n\nAnother observation: The full string s must be such that for each l, the prefix of length l is present in the input, and the suffix of length l is also present. However, since the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct s can be determined by looking for the unique string that has all the required prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how to find this s?\n\nWait, let's think about the longest possible prefixes and suffixes. For example, the longest prefix is of length n-1. Similarly, the longest suffix is of length n-1. But the actual string s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 is a string in the input, and the suffix of length n-1 is another string in the input. Then, combining these two, perhaps we can find the possible candidates for s.\n\nFor example, take the two strings of length n-1. One is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix. Let's say the prefix of length n-1 is P, and the suffix of length n-1 is S. Then, the actual string s must be P + last character, but also S's first character must be the same as the first character of s. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf the prefix of length n-1 is P, then s is P followed by a single character. Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 is S, which is the last n-1 characters of s. So, the string s would be the first character followed by S. Therefore, combining these two, the first character of s must be the same as the first character of the prefix P, and the last character of s must be the last character of the suffix S. Also, the first n-1 characters of s are P, so the first n-1 characters of s are P, and the last n-1 characters are S. Therefore, the first character of s is P[0], and the last character of s is S[-1]. Also, the second to nth character of s is S[0] to S[n-2], but since the first n-1 characters are P, then the second character of s is P[1], which must equal S[0], the first character of S. Similarly, the third character of s is P[2], which equals S[1], and so on until the nth character of s is P[n-1], which equals S[n-2].\n\nTherefore, for the two strings of length n-1, say A and B, if we assume that A is the prefix and B is the suffix, then the string s would be A + c, where c is the last character. But also, the suffix of length n-1 is B. Which implies that the string s is c' + B, where c' is the first character of s. Therefore, combining these two, A must be equal to the first n-1 characters of s, which is c' + B[0...n-2]. But since A is the prefix of length n-1, then A[0] = c', and A[1..n-1] = B[0..n-2]. Therefore, A[1..n-1] must equal B[0..n-2], and A[0] is the first character of s. Then, the last character of s is B[-1].\n\nSo, for the two strings of length n-1, if they can be combined in this way, then s can be determined. For example, if A is the prefix and B is the suffix, then s would be A[0] + B. But since A[1..n-1] must be B[0..n-2], then A[1] = B[0], A[2] = B[1], ..., A[n-1] = B[n-2]. Therefore, the concatenation of A[0] and B would be the string s. However, since A is of length n-1, and B is of length n-1, the resulting s would be of length n.\n\nSo, the idea is: for each pair of strings of length n-1, check if they can be combined in this way. If yes, then that gives us a candidate for s. Once we have a candidate s, we can check if all the given strings are prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, for that s, we can assign P/S to the input strings accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all possible candidate strings s by considering the two strings of length n-1. For each pair (A, B), check if A[1:] == B[:-1]. If so, then s could be A[0] + B. Alternatively, if B is the prefix and A is the suffix, then s could be B[0] + A. So for each pair of the two strings of length n-1, we can generate up to two possible candidates for s.\n\n2. Once we have these candidates, for each candidate s, check if all the input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s. If yes, then this s is a valid candidate.\n\n3. Once a valid s is found, then assign P/S to each input string based on whether it's a prefix or suffix of s. However, for each length l, there must be exactly one prefix and one suffix. So for each input string, we need to determine if it's a prefix or suffix of s, and make sure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings of that length is marked as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\nBut how do we handle multiple possible candidates for s?\n\nOnce we find a valid s, we can proceed to generate the answer. Since the problem allows any valid answer, we can pick the first valid s we find and use it to assign P/S.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read the input strings.\n\n- Separate them by their lengths. For each length l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings.\n\n- For the length n-1, get the two strings. Let's call them long1 and long2.\n\n- Generate possible candidate strings s by checking if long1 can be a prefix and long2 a suffix, or vice versa.\n\n- For each possible candidate s generated this way, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. How?\n\nFor example, for the candidate s, collect all the prefixes of s (for each length l from 1 to n-1), and all suffixes of s. Then, compare with the given input strings. For each input string, it must be either in the prefixes or in the suffixes. Also, for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings of that length is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how to check this?\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, generate all the prefixes and suffixes of s. Then, for each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix. However, since there are two strings of each length, for each length l, the two input strings must be exactly one prefix and one suffix.\n\nSo, for the candidate s, collect all prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each input string, check if it's a prefix or suffix. Then, for each length l, check that exactly one of the two input strings of that length is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For each candidate s:\n\n- For each l in 1..n-1, the prefix of s of length l is s[:l], and the suffix is s[-l:].\n\n- Now, the input strings must contain exactly those prefixes and suffixes. However, the input strings may have duplicates. For example, in the second sample input, the input for n=3 is a, aa, aa, a. So for the string \"aaa\", the prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\" and the suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So the input strings include both prefixes and suffixes. However, the input has two strings of length 1 (a and a), and two of length 2 (aa and aa). So for each length, the two input strings are exactly the prefix and suffix of that length.\n\nBut how to check that all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nFor the candidate s, collect all the prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each input string, it must be present in the set of prefixes or the set of suffixes. However, since the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., there exists some s that fits), but when generating possible candidates, we need to check if the candidate s is compatible with the input.\n\nSo, for the candidate s, collect all the prefixes and suffixes (each of length 1..n-1). Then, create a set of all these prefixes and suffixes. Then, check that the input strings are exactly the elements of this set. Because the input has exactly 2n-2 strings, and the set has exactly 2n-2 elements (since for each length l, there are two strings: one prefix and one suffix). However, there's a possibility that two different prefixes or suffixes are the same string. For example, in the second sample input, for the string \"aaa\", the prefixes of length 1 is \"a\", and the suffix of length 1 is \"a\". So the two input strings of length 1 are both \"a\".\n\nSo, for the candidate s, the set of all prefixes and suffixes must exactly match the input strings. So, the steps for checking a candidate s are:\n\n- Generate all prefixes and suffixes for s (each of length 1 to n-1).\n\n- Collect them into a list, then sort them (since the order in the input is arbitrary), and compare to the sorted input list. If they match, then this s is valid.\n\nWait, but the input can have duplicates. For example, if the input has two \"a\" strings of length 1, then the candidate s's prefixes and suffixes must include those two \"a\" strings. So, the way to check is that the multiset of the input strings is equal to the multiset of the prefixes and suffixes of s.\n\nBut how to compare that? Because for the input, we can count the frequency of each string, and compare it to the frequency of each string in the prefixes and suffixes of s.\n\nAlternatively, for the candidate s, collect all the prefixes and suffixes, then create a list, sort it, and compare to the sorted input list. Because the input has exactly 2n-2 strings, and the candidate's prefixes and suffixes also have exactly 2n-2 strings. If they are the same when sorted, then it's a match.\n\nYes, that's a possible approach. So, for the candidate s, generate all the prefixes and suffixes (each of length from 1 to n-1), collect them into a list, sort that list, and compare with the sorted input list. If they match, then this s is valid.\n\nOnce we find such an s, then we can proceed to assign P/S for each input string.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate all possible candidates s, check if any of them is valid, and once found, assign P/S.\n\nBut how to generate the candidates s?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the candidates can be generated by taking the two strings of length n-1 (call them A and B), and checking if A[1:] == B[:-1], then s could be A[0] + B. Also, check if B[1:] == A[:-1], then s could be B[0] + A.\n\nSo for each pair of the two strings of length n-1, we can generate up to two possible s candidates.\n\nBut wait, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. So for example, in the first sample input, the two strings of length 4 (since n=5) are \"abab\" and \"baba\". Let me check:\n\nWait the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n5\nba\na\nabab\na\naba\nbaba\nab\naba\n\nSo for n=5, the two strings of length 4 are \"abab\" and \"baba\".\n\nCheck if abab[1:] == baba[:-1]. abab[1:] is \"bab\", and baba[:-1] is \"bab\". Yes! So that would generate s as A[0] + B. A is \"abab\", so A[0] is 'a', then B is \"baba\", so s is 'a' + 'baba' = 'ababa' (length 5). Which is the correct answer.\n\nSimilarly, if we check the other way around: B is \"baba\", B[1:] is \"aba\", and A[:-1] is \"aba\". So that would generate s as B[0] + A. B[0] is 'b', then A is \"abab\", so s is 'b' + 'abab' = 'babab'. Now, check if this s is valid.\n\nBut for this s, let's generate all prefixes and suffixes. For example, the prefixes would be:\n\nlen 1: 'b'\n\nlen 2: 'ba'\n\nlen 3: 'bab'\n\nlen 4: 'baba'\n\nsuffixes:\n\nlen 1: 'b'\n\nlen 2: 'ab'\n\nlen 3: 'bab'\n\nlen 4: 'abab'\n\nSo the input strings are:\n\nOriginal input strings (sorted for comparison):\n\n['a', 'a', 'ab', 'abab', 'aba', 'ba', 'baba', 'aba']\n\nWait, the original input is:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nWhich is 8 strings (since 2*5-2=8).\n\nSo the input strings are:\n\n[\"ba\", \"a\", \"abab\", \"a\", \"aba\", \"baba\", \"ab\", \"aba\"]\n\nWhen sorted, they would be ordered lexicographically. But for the purpose of comparing with the candidate s's prefixes and suffixes, the sorted input list is compared with the sorted list of all prefixes and suffixes of s.\n\nIn the case of s being 'babab', let's generate all prefixes and suffixes:\n\nprefixes of length 1: 'b'\n\nprefixes of length 2: 'ba'\n\nprefixes of length 3: 'bab'\n\nprefixes of length 4: 'baba'\n\nsuffixes of length 1: 'b'\n\nsuffixes of length 2: 'ab'\n\nsuffixes of length 3: 'bab'\n\nsuffixes of length 4: 'abab'\n\nSo the list of all prefixes and suffixes is:\n\n['b', 'ba', 'bab', 'baba', 'b', 'ab', 'bab', 'abab']\n\nSorting this list gives: ['ab', 'abab', 'ba', 'bab', 'bab', 'b', 'b', 'baba'].\n\nCompare this to the sorted input list.\n\nOriginal input strings after sorting:\n\nOriginal input strings are:\n\n[\"a\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"abab\", \"aba\", \"ba\", \"aba\", \"baba\"]\n\nWait, let me list them all:\n\nOriginal input is:\n\nba (length 2)\n\na (length 1)\n\nabab (length 4)\n\na (length 1)\n\naba (length 3)\n\nbaba (length 4)\n\nab (length 2)\n\naba (length 3)\n\nSo the list is:\n\n[\"ba\", \"a\", \"abab\", \"a\", \"aba\", \"baba\", \"ab\", \"aba\"]\n\nSorting lex order:\n\nLet me list them:\n\n\"a\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"aba\", \"ba\", \"abab\", \"baba\"\n\nSo sorted list is:\n\n['a', 'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'aba', 'ba', 'abab', 'baba']\n\nCompare with the sorted list of prefixes and suffixes of 'babab' which is ['ab', 'abab', 'ba', 'bab', 'bab', 'b', 'b', 'baba'].\n\nThese are not the same. So this candidate s is invalid. Therefore, only the first candidate (ababa) is valid.\n\nThus, the approach of generating candidates based on the two longest strings seems promising.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the given input, collect all the strings, group them by their lengths.\n\n- For the length n-1, get the two strings. Let's call them str1 and str2.\n\n- Generate possible candidates s by checking if str1 can be a prefix and str2 a suffix, and vice versa.\n\n- For each candidate s generated this way, check if the sorted list of all prefixes and suffixes of s matches the sorted input list.\n\nOnce such a candidate s is found, proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string, check if it's a prefix or a suffix of s. Then, for each input string, assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly. However, since there are two strings per length, we need to ensure that for each length, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how to assign the P/S for the input strings?\n\nOnce we have s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s (for some length l) or a suffix of s (for some length l). But since the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nBut how to determine for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix?\n\nFor example, for the input string, check for each possible length l (the length of the input string) if it's equal to the prefix of s of length l, or the suffix of s of length l.\n\nBut since for each length l, there are exactly two input strings: one is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. So for each input string of length l, check if it's equal to the prefix of s of that length. If yes, then it's a prefix (P), else it's a suffix (S).\n\nBut how to handle cases where the same string is both a prefix and a suffix of s for the same length?\n\nFor example, if s is \"aaa\", then for length 1, the prefix and suffix are both \"a\". So in the input, there are two strings of length 1, both \"a\". In that case, for each of these two input strings, how to assign P or S? Well, since the problem says that the answer is acceptable if there exists at least one possible s. So in this case, for the two \"a\" strings, one can be assigned as P and the other as S. However, when generating the answer, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that? For each input string, when we check if it's a prefix or suffix, we can note that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So for the input strings, once we have s, we can create a dictionary mapping each string (for each length) to whether it is a prefix or suffix. However, for strings that are both prefix and suffix (like \"a\" in the case of \"aaa\"), we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nHere's an approach:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check for its length l, whether it's equal to the prefix of s of length l. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut if the input string is equal to both the prefix and suffix of length l, then how to choose between P and S?\n\nBut in that case, since the input has two strings of length l, both equal to the same string. For example, in the case of s = \"aaa\", the two input strings of length 1 are \"a\" and \"a\". For each of them, they are both prefix and suffix. So how to assign P and S?\n\nIn this case, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that in code? Because when checking for a given input string, if it's equal to the prefix, then assign P, else assign S. But in this case, the input string is equal to both. So for the first occurrence, assign P, and for the second, assign S? Or the other way around?\n\nBut how to track which input strings have been assigned as P or S for each length.\n\nAn alternative approach is to, for each length l, collect the two input strings. Then, for each length l, check which of the two input strings is the prefix, and assign P to that one, and S to the other.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, for each length l, the prefix is s[:l], and the suffix is s[-l:]. So for the two input strings of length l, one must be equal to s[:l], and the other must be equal to s[-l:].\n\nSo for each length l, we can check which of the two input strings is the prefix, and assign P to that one, and S to the other.\n\nSo, for each l in 1..n-1:\n\n- Get the two input strings of length l.\n\n- Check which one equals the prefix of s of length l. Assign P to that one.\n\n- The other one is assigned S.\n\nThis way, even if the two input strings are the same (as in the case of \"aaa\"), we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nOnce we have s, for each l in 1..n-1:\n\n- Get the two input strings of that length. Let's call them str_a and str_b.\n\n- Check if str_a equals s[:l]. If yes, then assign P to str_a, else assign S to str_a.\n\nBut then, what if both str_a and str_b are equal to s[:l]? That would mean that the other one (str_b) is equal to s[-l:], which would also be the same as s[:l] (since s[:l] is the same as s[-l:] in that case).\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, in that case, for the two input strings of that length, both are equal to the prefix and suffix. So, for the code, when checking for the first input string, assign P, and for the second, assign S.\n\nBut how to track which input strings belong to which l?\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nOnce s is found, for each input string, we need to determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. However, since the input strings are grouped by length, perhaps we can process them in groups.\n\nBut the problem is that the input is given in arbitrary order. So, for the code, we need to process each input string, and for each, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix of s. However, for the same length l, there are two input strings. For each of them, we can check if it's the prefix or suffix of that length.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For a given input string, say, 'a', of length l, check if it's equal to the prefix of s of length l. If yes, then it's a prefix (P). Else, check if it's equal to the suffix of s of length l. If yes, then it's a suffix (S). But since the input is guaranteed to be valid, this will always be true.\n\nBut for the case where the input string is both a prefix and a suffix of s for that length, how to decide which to assign?\n\nBut in that case, the code can assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second. But how to track which input strings are for which length and which are first or second?\n\nAlternatively, for each length l, collect the two input strings. Then, for each of the two, check which is the prefix and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to collect the two input strings per length?\n\nIn code, perhaps:\n\nWe can create a dictionary that maps each length l to a list of the two input strings of that length. For example, for the input, we can loop through all the input strings, group them by their lengths, and store them as lists.\n\nOnce we have that, for each l in 1..n-1:\n\n- Take the two strings in the list for that l.\n\n- Check which one is the prefix (s[:l]).\n\n- Assign P to that string, and S to the other.\n\nBut how to handle if both are the same as the prefix (i.e., the prefix and suffix are the same string for that l)?\n\nIn that case, both strings are the same. So, for example, if the two input strings are both \"a\" for l=1, and the prefix and suffix are both \"a\", then we can assign P to one and S to the other.\n\nBut how to determine which one to assign P and which S? Well, since the problem allows any valid assignment, as long as for each l, exactly one is P and the other is S. So, for the two identical strings, we can assign P to the first one in the list, and S to the second.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, we need to assign P or S. To do this, for each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n- Get the two strings of that length (say, list_l).\n\n- For the first string in list_l, check if it equals s[:l]. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\n- For the second string in list_l, assign the opposite.\n\nBut how to track which input strings are in which order? Because the input strings are given in arbitrary order, but for the code, the grouping by length can be done, and for each group, the order in which the two strings are stored can be arbitrary. However, when processing the input strings, we need to assign P/S in the same order as the input.\n\nWait, here's the problem. The code needs to output a string of 'P's and 'S's, where the i-th character corresponds to the i-th input string. So, for example, if the input strings are given as [A, B, C, D, ...], then the output string is built in that order.\n\nTherefore, the approach of grouping by length and then processing each group is not sufficient, because we need to know for each input string (in the original order) whether it is a prefix or suffix.\n\nSo, the code needs to process each input string in the original order, and for each, determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how?\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. That is, for the input string's length l, check if the input string equals s[:l]. If yes, then it's a prefix (P). Otherwise, it must be a suffix (S).\n\nBut in the case where the input string is both a prefix and a suffix of s (for that length), then this approach would assign P, but the other string (which is same as this one) would be assigned S.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because for that input string, it's both a prefix and a suffix. However, since the problem requires that exactly one of the two strings of each length is a prefix and the other is a suffix, even if they are the same string, we have to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut in this case, for the input string, how to know which one to assign?\n\nBut the code can't know which one is which, unless we track for each length l, which of the two input strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should first process all the input strings, group them by length, and for each length l, determine which of the two input strings is the prefix (s[:l]) and which is the suffix (s[-l:]).\n\nOnce that is known, for each input string, if it is the prefix of length l, assign P; else, assign S.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\nOnce s is found:\n\nFor each input string in the original input list, we need to determine if it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut for that, we can precompute for each length l, the prefix and suffix strings.\n\nSo:\n\npre = {l: s[:l] for l in 1..n-1}\n\nsuf = {l: s[-l:] for l in 1..n-1}\n\nThen, for each input string, check if it is equal to pre[l], where l is the length of the input string. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut in cases where the input string is equal to both pre[l] and suf[l], which can happen when pre[l] == suf[l], then the code will assign P, but since there are two input strings of that length, one of them will be assigned P and the other S.\n\nBut how does this work? For example, suppose for a certain l, the two input strings are both equal to pre[l], which is also equal to suf[l]. Then, for both input strings, the code will check if they are equal to pre[l], which they are, and assign P. But this would result in two P's for the same length, which is invalid.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because in that case, the code would assign P to both input strings, which is invalid. Therefore, this approach would not work.\n\nSo, the previous idea is flawed. We need a way to assign exactly one of the two input strings of each length as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, how to resolve this?\n\nThe solution is that for each length l, we need to determine which of the two input strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. Then, for each input string, if it is the prefix, assign P, else assign S.\n\nBut how to find which of the two input strings is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nFor each length l, the prefix is pre_l = s[:l], and the suffix is suf_l = s[-l:]. So, among the two input strings of length l, one is pre_l and the other is suf_l. So, for each l, we can check which of the two input strings is equal to pre_l, and assign P to that one, and S to the other.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each length l in 1..n-1:\n\n   pre_l = s[:l]\n\n   suf_l = s[-l:]\n\n   collect the two input strings of length l (say, str1 and str2)\n\n   if str1 == pre_l:\n\n       assign P to str1, S to str2\n\n   elif str2 == pre_l:\n\n       assign P to str2, S to str1\n\n   else:\n\n       # this should not happen, since the input is valid.\n\nSo, this ensures that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is assigned as P, and the other as S.\n\nBut how to implement this, given that the input strings are in arbitrary order, and we need to assign P/S in the original input order?\n\nThe problem is that for each input string, we need to know which of the two (pre or suf) it is for its length.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce s is found, for each input string, we can check if it is the pre or suf for its length. But to do that, we need to know for each length l, which of the two input strings is pre_l and which is suf_l.\n\nBut how to track this for all input strings?\n\nOne approach is:\n\nCreate a dictionary for each length l, storing the two input strings. Then, for each l, determine which is pre_l and which is suf_l, and then for each input string in the original list, check if it's the pre_l or suf_l for its length.\n\nBut how to map each input string to its corresponding l and whether it's pre or suf?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original input list is [A, B, C, D, ...], and for each element, we can process them in order.\n\nBut during processing, for each input string, we can check its length l, and then look up in the dictionary of l's two strings. Then, compare with pre_l and suf_l.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, we can:\n\n- Get its length l.\n\n- Check if the input string equals pre_l (s[:l]). If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut this would work only if for each l, exactly one of the two input strings equals pre_l and the other equals suf_l. Which is guaranteed by the problem's input constraints.\n\nHowever, in the case where pre_l equals suf_l (so both are same), then both input strings would be equal to pre_l, and thus the code would assign P to both, which is invalid.\n\nBut this scenario is possible. For example, s is \"aaa\", and for l=1, pre_l is \"a\" and suf_l is \"a\". The input strings for l=1 are two \"a\" strings. Then, the code would assign P to both, which is invalid.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nIn this case, we need to assign one of the two input strings as P and the other as S. But how to do that?\n\nThe solution is to, for each l, check if the two input strings are the same. If they are, then assign P to one and S to the other. But how to choose which one?\n\nIn this case, since the two input strings are the same, but the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S. However, the code has no way of knowing which one is which, but the problem allows any valid assignment.\n\nTherefore, for the code, when the two input strings of length l are the same, we can arbitrarily assign one as P and the other as S. For example, in the input list, for the first occurrence of the string (for that length), assign P, and for the second occurrence, assign S.\n\nBut how to track which input strings are the first and second occurrence for a given length l?\n\nThis suggests that during the initial grouping by length, we need to keep track of the order in which the input strings were added for each length.\n\nSo, for example, for each length l, store a list of the two input strings in the order they appeared in the original input.\n\nOnce s is determined, for each length l:\n\n   pre_l = s[:l]\n\n   suf_l = s[-l:]\n\n   for the two strings in the list for l:\n\n       if the first string is pre_l:\n\n           assign P to first, S to second\n\n       elif the second string is pre_l:\n\n           assign P to second, S to first\n\n       else:\n\n           # this is impossible, since the input is valid.\n\nBut in the case where pre_l == suf_l, and the two input strings are both equal to pre_l, then the code will assign P to the first string, and S to the second.\n\nThus, this approach handles that case.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nOnce s is determined:\n\n- For each length l from 1 to n-1, collect the two input strings in the order they appear in the original input.\n\n- For each l, check which of the two strings is the prefix (pre_l) of s.\n\n- Assign P to that string, and S to the other.\n\n- Then, for each input string in the original order, determine whether it is the first or second string in its l's group, and whether it was assigned P or S.\n\nBut how to map each input string to its group and position within the group?\n\nThis can be done by creating a dictionary that maps each length l to a list of the two input strings in the order they were encountered in the original input.\n\nFor example, during preprocessing:\n\noriginal_input = list of all input strings.\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor string in original_input:\n\n    l = len(string)\n\n    groups[l].append(string)\n\nOnce groups is built, for each l in groups, groups[l] is a",
