He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the given prefixes and suffixes. And our job is to assign P or S to each input string such that there exists some s that matches.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the correct assignments. Let's think about the possible approach.\n\nLet me think: For a string s of length n, all its prefixes of length 1 to n-1 and all suffixes of length 1 to n-1 are given. But we don't know which is which. However, the original string s must be such that for each of these given strings, they are either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut how do I find which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nAn important observation here is that the entire string s itself is not in the input. But the input contains all the proper prefixes and suffixes. So, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that their combination can form s. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the original string is s. Then the longest prefix (of length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix (of length n-1) is s[1..n-1]. So, if we have both of these, then combining them would give us the entire string s. Because the first n-1 characters of s and the last n-1 characters of s must overlap by n-2 characters. So the only way for both to be present is that the first n-1 characters and the last n-1 characters share the overlapping part. Therefore, the original string s must be the concatenation of the longest prefix and the last character of the longest suffix. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? Let me think again.\n\nFor example, suppose the original string is 'ababa' (like in the first example). The longest prefix of length 4 is 'abab', and the longest suffix of length 4 is 'baba'. So the original string is formed by taking the longest prefix (abab) and adding the last character of the longest suffix (a), which gives ababa. Alternatively, taking the longest suffix (baba) and adding the first character of the longest prefix (a) gives ababa. So the original string is determined by the longest prefix and the longest suffix. But how do I know which one is which?\n\nWait, but in the input, there are two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the longest prefix, and the other must be the longest suffix. So, for the original string s, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that their overlapping parts match. So, for example, the longest prefix (let's call it p) and the longest suffix (call it s) must satisfy that p[0..n-2] and s[1..n-1] are the same. Because the original string is p + [last character], which is also [first character of s] + s.\n\nSo, the original string s must be equal to the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix. Alternatively, it could be the longest suffix plus the first character of the longest prefix. But how do I know which one is the correct way?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that the longest prefix and the longest suffix must overlap. So for example, the longest prefix (p) and the longest suffix (s) must satisfy that p[0...n-2] is the first n-1 characters of s, and the suffix s is the last n-1 characters of s. Therefore, the original string s must be p concatenated with the last character of s. But since s is the suffix of length n-1, then the original string s is s's first character followed by s. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nOriginal string s has length n. The longest prefix is s[0..n-2], which is of length n-1. The longest suffix is s[1..n-1], which is of length n-1. Therefore, the original string can be reconstructed as the longest prefix (s[0..n-2]) plus the last character of the longest suffix (s[n-1]). Alternatively, the original string can be reconstructed as the first character of the longest suffix (s[0]) plus the longest suffix (s[1..n-1]).\n\nBut how do I find which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nAh! So, for the two strings of length n-1 in the input, one must be the prefix (p) and the other the suffix (s). Then, the original string s must be p + (last character of s), and also must be (first character of s) + s. Therefore, combining these two, the p must be equal to the first n-1 characters of (first character of s) + s. Which would be (first character of s) + s[0..n-2]. Wait, but s is of length n-1. So (first character of s) + s is of length n. So the first n-1 characters of that would be (first character of s) + s[0..n-2], which is of length n-1. But p is the prefix of length n-1 of the original string. So p must be equal to (first character of s) + s[0..n-2].\n\nBut since s is the suffix of length n-1, the original string is (first character of s) + s. Therefore, the prefix of length n-1 of the original string is (first character of s) + s[0..n-2]. But this must be equal to p. Therefore, p must be (s[0] + s[0..n-2]) = s[0] + s[0..n-2] ?\n\nWait, s is of length n-1. So s[0..n-2] is the entire string. So the original string is s[0] + s. Then the prefix of length n-1 is the first n-1 characters of that, which is s[0] + s[0..n-2], which is s[0] concatenated with the first n-2 characters of s. So that's a string of length 1 + (n-2) = n-1. So for the original string's prefix of length n-1 (which is p), p must be equal to s[0] + s[0..n-2]. But s is the suffix of length n-1, which is the original string's suffix. So, the original string is s[0] + s. Therefore, the prefix p is the first n-1 characters of that, which is s[0] concatenated with s[0..n-2].\n\nBut then, since p is one of the input strings of length n-1, and s is the other input string of length n-1, we can check if for the two possible pairs (p and s), whether p equals s[0] + s[0..n-2], or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, since the original string is s, and the prefix of length n-1 is p, and the suffix of length n-1 is s, then p must be the first n-1 characters of s, and s must be the last n-1 characters of s. So the original s can be formed by combining p and the last character of s (the suffix). So the original s is p + (suffix's last character). But the original s is also the suffix's first character plus the suffix. So:\n\np + (suffix's last character) = (suffix's first character) + suffix.\n\nSo, the original s must be equal to both expressions. Therefore, the first part of the equation is p + [last char of suffix], the second is [first char of suffix] + suffix. So these two must be the same. Therefore, p must be equal to [first char of suffix] + suffix[0..n-2], which is the same as the first n-1 characters of [first char of suffix] + suffix. Which is the original string's first n-1 characters, which is p.\n\nSo, given two candidates for the longest prefix and suffix (say, A and B), we can check if A is equal to B[0] + B[0..n-2], or if B is equal to A[0] + A[0..n-2]. If so, then that would imply that the original string is A + B[-1] or B + A[-1], respectively.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1 in the input. Let's call them candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n- Check if candidate1 is a prefix of candidate2 + something, or vice versa. Wait, perhaps the correct way is to check if candidate1 can be the prefix and candidate2 the suffix, or vice versa.\n\nFor example, let's say that candidate1 is the prefix (of length n-1), and candidate2 is the suffix (of length n-1). Then, the original string s would be candidate1 + (last character of candidate2). Also, the original string would be (first character of candidate2) + candidate2. Therefore, these two must be equal. So candidate1 + (candidate2[-1]) must be equal to (candidate2[0] + candidate2).\n\nSimilarly, if candidate2 is the prefix and candidate1 is the suffix, then candidate2 + (candidate1[-1]) must be equal to (candidate1[0] + candidate1).\n\nTherefore, for the two candidates of length n-1, we can check these possibilities.\n\nOnce we find which of the two is the prefix and which is the suffix, then we can reconstruct the original string s. Once we have s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s. Then, assign P or S accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all the input strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each possible assignment of one as prefix and the other as suffix, check if the original string can be reconstructed.\n\n3. Once the correct original string is found, then for each input string, check if it's a prefix or suffix of s, and assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how to find which of the two possibilities is correct?\n\nLet's take an example. For the first sample input:\n\nn=5. The input includes \"abab\" (length 4) and \"baba\" (length 4). Let's check both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: candidate1 is prefix (abab), candidate2 is suffix (baba). Then the original string would be abab + (last character of suffix) = abab + a = ababa. Also, the other way: (first character of suffix) + suffix is b + baba = bbaba. Which is not equal to ababa. So this case is invalid. Therefore, the original string would be ababa.\n\nCheck the other case: candidate1 is suffix (baba), candidate2 is prefix (abab). Then the original string is abab + (last character of suffix) is abab + a = ababa. Also, (first character of suffix) + suffix is b + baba = bbaba. Not equal. Wait, but in this case, the original string is supposed to be (first character of the suffix) + suffix. Wait, no. If the suffix is baba (the candidate1), then the original string is (first character of the suffix) + suffix. Wait, but the original string is supposed to be the suffix of length n-1. So, the original string s has a suffix of length n-1 (which is baba). Therefore, s must be the first character of that suffix (b) followed by the suffix (baba). So s would be bbaba. But according to the first case, when we take the prefix as abab and the suffix as baba, the original string would be abab + a = ababa. Which is different from bbaba. So why is that?\n\nAh, because in this case, the original string can be formed in two ways. So the correct way is when the two possibilities agree. So in the first case, when we take the prefix as abab and the suffix as baba, the original string must be abab + a = ababa. But also, the original string must be (first character of the suffix) + suffix = b + baba = bbaba. These are not equal. So this case is invalid. Therefore, the correct assignment is when the other possibility holds. Let's check the other possibility.\n\nSuppose candidate1 is the suffix (baba), and candidate2 is the prefix (abab). Then, the original string would be candidate2 + last character of candidate1 (baba's last character is a) → abab + a = ababa. Also, the original string should be (first character of candidate1) + candidate1 → b + baba = bbaba. Which is not equal to ababa. So that's invalid. Wait, but this seems contradictory. How does the first example work?\n\nWait, in the first example, the correct original string is ababa. So for that string, the longest prefix of length 4 is abab, and the longest suffix of length 4 is baba. So in this case, the original string is ababa. So the longest prefix (abab) is the first four letters, and the longest suffix (baba) is the last four letters. So the original string is ababa. Now, the way to get that from the prefix and suffix is: the original string is the prefix (abab) plus the last character of the suffix (a). Which gives abab + a = ababa. Also, the original string is the first character of the suffix (b) plus the suffix (baba) → b + baba = bbaba. Which is not equal. So why does that work?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because the suffix of length n-1 (4) is the last four characters of the original string. So the original string is s, and the suffix of length 4 is s[1..4] (assuming 0-based indices). So s is of length 5. So s[1..4] is the suffix. So the original string is s[0] + s[1..4]. Therefore, the original string is s[0] + suffix. But the prefix of length 4 is s[0..3], which is the first four characters. So the original string is prefix + s[4], which is the fifth character. So the original string is prefix + (last character of the suffix). So the original string can be constructed in two ways: from the prefix and the suffix.\n\nBut how can we check that the two ways give the same string?\n\nIn this case, the original string is prefix + (last character of suffix) = abab + a = ababa. Also, the original string is (first character of suffix) + suffix → b + baba = bbaba. Which is not the same. So why is that?\n\nWait, that's impossible. There's a mistake here. Because the original string is s = ababa. The suffix of length 4 is s[1..4] = 'baba', which is the string. The first character of the suffix is 'b', and the suffix is 'baba'. Adding them together gives 'b' + 'baba' = 'bbaba', which is not the same as the original string. So why is this happening?\n\nAh! Oh no, I think I messed up the logic. The suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], which for n=5 is s[1..4], which is indeed 'baba' in the original string. But the original string is s[0] + s[1..4], which is 'a' + 'baba' = 'ababa', which is correct. So the original string is formed by taking the first character of the original string (s[0]) and adding the suffix. But the suffix is the last n-1 characters. Therefore, the first character of the suffix is s[1], not s[0]. So the original string is s[0] + (suffix). But the suffix is s[1..4], so the first character of the suffix is s[1], which is 'b'. So the original string is s[0] + suffix, but the first character of the suffix is s[1], which is not the same as s[0].\n\nSo the original string can be formed by taking the prefix (which is s[0..3] = abab) and adding the last character of the suffix (s[4] = a) to get ababa. But the suffix is s[1..4] = baba. So the original string is not formed by taking the first character of the suffix and adding the suffix. That's where my earlier mistake was.\n\nSo the correct way is that the original string is formed by the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. But how does that relate to the suffix being the last n-1 characters? Well, the suffix is the last n-1 characters, so the original string is (prefix) + (last character of the suffix). Which is the same as (prefix) + (last character of the original string). But the prefix is the first n-1 characters of the original string. So the original string is s = prefix + (last character). So the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], which is (prefix[1..n-2] + last character). So the suffix is (prefix[1..n-2] + last character). Therefore, the suffix can be derived from the prefix and the last character.\n\nBut how can we use this to check which of the two candidates is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nLet me rephrase. Suppose that for the two candidates of length n-1, one is the prefix (p) and the other is the suffix (s). Then, the original string is p + (last character of s). Also, the suffix s must be equal to (original string)[1..n-1], which is (p + last_char_s)[1..n-1]. Since p is of length n-1, the original string is length n, so (p + last_char_s)[1..n-1] is p[1..n-2] + last_char_s. So the suffix s must be equal to p[1..n-2] + last_char_s.\n\nBut since s is the suffix, which is of length n-1, we can write:\n\ns = p[1..n-2] + last_char_s.\n\nBut the last_char_s is the last character of s. So:\n\ns = p[1..n-2] + s[-1].\n\nWhich implies that the entire string s is equal to p[1..n-2] concatenated with its last character. Which is always true, because s is of length n-1, and p[1..n-2] is length n-2. Adding one character gives length n-1.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nWell, given that the original string is p + last_char_s, and that s is the suffix (which is the last n-1 characters of the original string), we can derive that s must be equal to (p + last_char_s)[1..n-1] = p[1..n-2] + last_char_s.\n\nSo given p and s, we can check whether s is equal to p[1..n-2] + s[-1].\n\nLet me take the example where p is 'abab' (length 4) and s is 'baba' (length 4). Then, n-1 is 4, so n=5. p[1..n-2] is p[1..3], which is 'bab'. Adding s[-1] (a) gives 'baba', which is exactly s. So this condition holds. Therefore, this assignment is valid. Thus, the original string is p + s[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'.\n\nSo the way to check if a candidate pair (p and s) is valid is to see if s equals p[1..n-2] + s[-1]. Similarly, if we assume that the other candidate is the prefix and the first is the suffix, we can check that.\n\nSo the steps for the two candidates (say, a and b) are:\n\nCheck if a is the prefix and b is the suffix:\n\nCheck if b == a[1..n-2] + b[-1]. If yes, then the original string is a + b[-1].\n\nCheck if b is the prefix and a is the suffix:\n\nCheck if a == b[1..n-2] + a[-1]. If yes, then the original string is b + a[-1].\n\nIf neither is true, then there's a problem. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so at least one of the two possibilities must be correct.\n\nOnce we find the correct original string, then for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\n1. Read all the input strings.\n\n2. Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\n3. For each of the two possible assignments (candidate1 as prefix, candidate2 as suffix; and vice versa), check if the condition holds (as described above). Once the correct assignment is found, construct the original string s.\n\n4. Once s is known, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (if it's a prefix, then assign P) or a suffix (assign S). However, note that some strings may be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second sample input, the string is 'aaa', and all the input strings are 'a', 'aa', etc. So for example, the string 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix. But according to the problem statement, the answer can be any valid assignment as long as there exists at least one s that fits. So for such cases, we can assign P or S as needed, as long as the overall counts are correct.\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, once s is known, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix of s, and/or a suffix. But since the input strings are all the proper prefixes and suffixes of s, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix (or both). However, the problem says that the output must assign each input string as either P or S, such that the assignment is valid for some s.\n\nOnce we have the correct s, we can check for each input string whether it's a prefix or a suffix. However, for those that are both, we can choose either P or S as needed. But since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can just check for each input string and assign P if it's a prefix, else S. But how to handle the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix?\n\nFor example, in the sample input where the string is 'aaa', the input strings include 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'. For the string 'a', it is both a prefix and suffix. However, in the output, we can assign it as P or S. But the problem requires that the number of P and S is equal (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, total 2n-2 strings). So for each input string, the assignment must be such that exactly n-1 are P and n-1 are S.\n\nBut once we have the correct s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then we can assign P. Else, assign S. However, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then we can assign it as P or S. However, we need to make sure that the total counts are correct. But since the input is guaranteed to be valid, and the s is correct, the number of P's and S's will be correct regardless of how we assign in such cases. Because each input string is either a prefix or a suffix (or both), and the counts of prefixes and suffixes are exactly n-1 each.\n\nWait, but the input includes exactly 2n-2 strings, which are all the proper prefixes and suffixes of s. So each of these strings is either a prefix or a suffix. But some may be both. However, the problem requires that the output assigns each of them as either P or S, such that the assignment is valid. So for a string that is both a prefix and a suffix, we can choose to assign it as P or S. However, the total number of P's and S's must be n-1 each.\n\nSo, for example, if there are k strings that are both prefixes and suffixes, then when assigning them as P or S, we can adjust the counts accordingly. But since the input is valid, and the correct s is known, the total number of P's and S's will be correct regardless. Because the input has exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. But when a string is both, it's counted as a prefix and a suffix. However, the output must assign it as either P or S. So, for example, if a string is both, but we assign it as P, then we have to ensure that the number of P's is exactly n-1. But how?\n\nBut since the input is correct, and the correct s is known, the number of input strings that are prefixes of s is exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes. However, some strings may be both. So, the total number of P's required is n-1, and the number of S's required is n-1. Therefore, for each input string, if it is a prefix of s, we can assign it as P. If it is not a prefix, then it must be a suffix, so assign S. However, in cases where a string is both, we can choose to assign it as P or S, but the total counts will be correct.\n\nWait, but if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then it's counted once in the list of prefixes and once in the list of suffixes. However, the input lists all the proper prefixes and suffixes. So, for example, the string 'a' in the case of 'aaa' is a prefix of length 1 and a suffix of length 1. So in the input, there are two strings of length 1 (since n=3, 2n-2=4, and two strings of each length from 1 to 2). So for example, the input may have two 'a's. Each of these is a prefix and a suffix. So when assigning, each of them can be assigned as P or S. But since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, the total number of P's and S's must be n-1 each. So, if some strings are both, we can choose to assign them as P or S as needed to balance the counts.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then we can assign P. Otherwise, assign S. However, in cases where it is both, we can assign P. But this might lead to more P's than allowed. For example, if the input has multiple strings that are both prefixes and suffixes, and we assign them all as P, then the number of P's may exceed n-1. How to avoid that?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. Therefore, the correct s will have exactly n-1 prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) and exactly n-1 suffixes (including those that are also prefixes). Therefore, the total number of input strings that are prefixes is exactly n-1, and the same for suffixes. So, for example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then it is counted in both the prefixes and suffixes. However, in the output, we need to assign each input string as either P or S, such that the total number of P's is n-1 and the total number of S's is n-1.\n\nThus, the approach is: for each input string, if it is a prefix of s, then assign P. If it is not, assign S. However, this may not work in cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if a string is both, then assigning it as P would count towards the P's, but it's also a suffix. But since the input is correct, the number of P's assigned this way will be exactly n-1.\n\nWait, but how? Because the input is guaranteed to have exactly n-1 prefixes. So for each input string, the number of input strings that are prefixes of s is exactly n-1. Therefore, if we assign all such strings as P, and the rest as S, then we will have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. Because the input is correct.\n\nYes! Because the input is exactly all the prefixes and suffixes of s. So the input contains exactly n-1 prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1) and exactly n-1 suffixes. However, some of the input strings may be both. But when you count all the input strings that are prefixes of s, there are exactly n-1 of them. So if you assign each such string as P, and the others as S, then you will have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce s is found, loop through each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string), then assign P, else S.\n\nBut how to check if a string is a prefix of s? For example, for a string t, check if s.startswith(t).\n\nSimilarly for suffix: check if s.endswith(t).\n\nBut in our case, since the input strings are all proper prefixes and suffixes of s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s. So for each input string, exactly one of the two conditions will be true (or both). However, the code can check for prefix first. If it's a prefix, assign P, else assign S.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to find the correct original string s.\n\nSo, back to the steps:\n\nFirst, collect all the input strings. Then, find the two strings of length n-1.\n\nThen, for each of the two possibilities (which is prefix and which is suffix), check if the condition holds.\n\nOnce that is done, the correct s can be built.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the two candidates are 'abab' and 'baba'. Let's check for the first possibility: candidate1 is prefix, candidate2 is suffix.\n\nCheck if candidate2 (baba) equals candidate1[1..n-2] + candidate2[-1]. n is 5, n-2 is 3. candidate1 is 'abab' of length 4. candidate1[1..3] is 'bab' (indices 1, 2, 3). candidate2[-1] is 'a'. So 'bab' + 'a' is 'baba', which is candidate2. So this condition holds. Therefore, the original string is candidate1 + candidate2[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'.\n\nSo that's the correct s.\n\nOnce s is known, for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s. Assign P or S accordingly.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, read n, then read 2n-2 strings. Then, collect all the strings. Then, find the two strings of length n-1.\n\nOnce those are found, try both possibilities for which is prefix and which is suffix.\n\nOnce the correct s is found, proceed.\n\nBut how to find the two strings of length n-1?\n\nWe can iterate through all the input strings and collect those with length n-1.\n\nOnce we have them, say, candidates = [s1, s2], then for each possible assignment (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix, and vice versa), check the condition.\n\nOnce the correct assignment is found, build s.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nIn Python, the code would be something like:\n\nRead n.\n\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2*n - 2)]\n\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\nThen, for the two candidates, check both possibilities.\n\nOnce the correct s is found, then for each string in the original list, check if it is a prefix of s. Assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to check which of the two possibilities is correct?\n\nLet me code this:\n\nfor candidate1, candidate2 in [(candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0])]:\n\n    # check if candidate1 is prefix and candidate2 is suffix\n\n    # compute the required suffix based on candidate1\n\n    # the suffix should be candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1] ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the case where candidate1 is prefix and candidate2 is suffix, the original string is candidate1 + candidate2[-1]. Also, the suffix (candidate2) must be equal to (original string)[1..n-1], which is (candidate1 + candidate2[-1])[1..n-1].\n\nThe original string is of length n. So for n=5, the original string is length 5. The suffix is of length 4. So the original string's suffix is (original string)[1:5], which is the substring starting at index 1, length 4.\n\nWhich is (candidate1 + candidate2[-1])[1:5].\n\nBut candidate1 has length n-1 (4), and candidate2[-1] is one character, so the original string is of length 4+1=5.\n\nSo (candidate1 + candidate2[-1])[1:5] is candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1], which is of length 3 + 1 = 4. Which is the length of candidate2. So candidate2 should be equal to this.\n\nSo, the check is:\n\nif candidate2 == (candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1]):\n\nWait, candidate1[1:] is of length (n-1 - 1) = n-2. Adding candidate2[-1] (one character) gives length n-2 + 1 = n-1, which is correct.\n\nBut candidate2 is already of length n-1. So, in code, for the first possibility (candidate1 is prefix, candidate2 is suffix):\n\nif candidate2 == candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1]:\n\n    then s = candidate1 + candidate2[-1]\n\nSimilarly, for the other possibility (candidate2 is prefix, candidate1 is suffix):\n\nif candidate1 == candidate2[1:] + candidate1[-1]:\n\n    then s = candidate2 + candidate1[-1]\n\nOnce we find which of these is true, we can proceed.\n\nBut wait, in the first case, candidate2 is the suffix. So the suffix should be equal to the original string's suffix, which is (candidate1 + candidate2[-1])[1:]. Which is candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1]. Therefore, the condition is candidate2 == candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1]. But candidate2[-1] is the last character of candidate2, which is the same as the last character of the original string. So this condition must hold.\n\nBut in this case, candidate2 is the suffix, and the original string is candidate1 + candidate2[-1]. Therefore, the suffix of the original string is (original string)[1:] = candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1], which must be equal to candidate2. So the condition is candidate2 == candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1].\n\nBut candidate1[1:] is the substring starting from index 1 of candidate1. For example, if candidate1 is 'abab', then candidate1[1:] is 'bab'.\n\nSo in the first example, candidate1 is 'abab', candidate2 is 'baba'.\n\ncandidate2 == candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1] → 'baba' == 'bab' + 'a' → 'baba' → yes. So this condition holds, so s is 'abab' + 'a' → 'ababa'.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code can proceed with this logic.\n\nOnce s is found, then for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign 'P', else 'S'.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut what if there are multiple possibilities? For example, both possibilities are valid? According to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, but perhaps there are multiple possible s. However, the problem says that we can output any valid assignment. So in such cases, we can choose either of the possibilities.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nFor example, if both possibilities are valid, then we can choose either. But how to check that?\n\nIn code, for the two candidates, check both possibilities. Once a valid s is found, proceed. If both are valid, pick the first one.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nOnce the candidates are found, for each of the two possibilities:\n\nCheck if the condition holds. If yes, then construct s. Once found",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves reconstructing the original string `s` using the given prefixes and suffixes and then classifying each input string accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidates**: Extract the two strings of length `n-1` from the input, as these must be the longest proper prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct Original String**: Check both possible assignments of these candidates (one as a prefix and the other as a suffix) to determine the correct original string `s`. This is done by verifying if the suffix can be derived from the prefix and vice versa.\n3. **Classify Strings**: Once the original string `s` is reconstructed, classify each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\n# Find the two candidates of length n-1\ncandidates = []\nfor s in strings:\n    if len(s) == n - 1:\n        candidates.append(s)\n\n# Try both possibilities for the two candidates\nfound = False\ns = \"\"\nfor i in range(2):\n    if i == 0:\n        candidate1 = candidates[0]\n        candidate2 = candidates[1]\n    else:\n        candidate1 = candidates[1]\n        candidate2 = candidates[0]\n    \n    # Check if candidate1 is prefix and candidate2 is suffix\n    if len(candidate1) == n - 1 and len(candidate2) == n - 1:\n        # Check if candidate2 equals candidate1[1:] + last character of candidate2\n        if candidate2 == candidate1[1:] + candidate2[-1]:\n            s = candidate1 + candidate2[-1]\n            found = True\n            break\n        # Check if candidate1 is suffix and candidate2 is prefix\n        if candidate1 == candidate2[1:] + candidate1[-1]:\n            s = candidate2 + candidate1[-1]\n            found = True\n            break\n\n# Now, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s\nresult = []\nfor t in strings:\n    if s.startswith(t):\n        result.append('P')\n    else:\n        result.append('S')\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `2n-2` strings. These strings are stored in a list.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n3. **Reconstructing `s`**: By checking both possible assignments of these candidates (as prefix and suffix), we determine the correct original string `s` by ensuring the overlap condition between the prefix and suffix is met.\n4. **Classifying Strings**: For each input string, we check if it is a prefix of `s` using the `startswith` method. If it is, we classify it as 'P'; otherwise, it is classified as 'S'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify the original string and classify each input string efficiently, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
