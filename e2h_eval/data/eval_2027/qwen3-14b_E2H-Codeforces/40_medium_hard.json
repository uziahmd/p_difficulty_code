    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to compute this modulo a given mod. The constraints are up to n=500, which is quite big. So I need an efficient approach here.\n\nFirst, let's think about the total number of possible pairs. Since p and q are permutations, and p must be lex smaller than q, the total number of such pairs is (total permutations choose 2) divided by something? Wait, no. For all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly half of them will have p < q lex, and the other half q < p. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q is equal to (total_perms * (total_perms - 1)) / 2. But since the problem counts ordered pairs where p < q lex, that's the count. However, for each such pair, we need to check if inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut directly checking all possible pairs is impossible for n=500. Because the number of permutations is n! which is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. Let's denote for each permutation p, its inversion count as inv(p). We need to find the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet me consider that for all possible pairs of permutations (p, q) where p < q lex, how many of them have inv(p) > inv(q). Let's call this value X. The answer is X modulo mod.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing X. How?\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q lex. Let's denote this as T. Then, for each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). Let's say that A is the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), B where inv(p) < inv(q), and C where they are equal. Then T = A + B + C. Also, since for each pair (p, q) where p < q, there's a corresponding pair (q, p) where q < p. But since inv(p) and inv(q) can be compared in both directions, maybe there's some symmetry here. However, since p and q are distinct, but the lex order is not symmetric.\n\nWait, but for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of ordered pairs where p < q is exactly T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But for each pair (p, q) where p < q, we can compare inv(p) and inv(q). Now, if we can find the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), then that's our answer.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the following: Let's precompute for all possible inversion counts, the number of permutations with that inversion count. Let's denote f[k] as the number of permutations of size n with exactly k inversions. Then, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, inv(p) > inv(q), the total would be the sum over all i and j where i > j of (number of permutations p with inv(p) = i and q with inv(q) = j and p < q lex). But how to compute that?\n\nBut even if we know f[i] and f[j], the problem is that for each pair (i,j) where i > j, we need to know how many pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q lex. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that for any two permutations p and q with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, the number of pairs where p < q lex and i > j is equal to (total_pairs_with_i_and_j) * something. But I don't see how to compute that.\n\nWait, but for all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where p < q lex is exactly (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. So if we can find the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q), that's equal to the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q lex.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to compute the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) regardless of their lex order, and then adjust for the lex order.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we consider all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Let's say that for a pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q or q < p) contributes to the answer. So the total answer X is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is equal to the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the probability that p < q. But since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, then the total number of such pairs is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1/2? No, because for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will be counted in X. So if inv(p) > inv(q), then if p < q lex, it contributes to X, otherwise (q < p lex) it doesn't. But how many of these pairs contribute to X?\n\nWait, for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is counted in the total T (the number of ordered pairs where p < q lex). So, for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will be counted in X if and only if the lex order is such that the permutation with higher inversion count is the first in the pair. So for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), the contribution to X is 1 if p < q lex, else 0. Similarly for inv(p) < inv(q), the contribution is 1 if q < p lex and inv(q) > inv(p), etc.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Suppose that for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q lex is equal to the number of pairs where inv(q) > inv(p) and q < p lex. Because for each such pair, if you swap p and q, the inversions are reversed, and the lex order is also reversed. But wait, the lex order is not symmetric. For example, if p is lex smaller than q, then q is not lex smaller than p. So for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of p < q lex. So the total number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q lex is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the probability that p < q lex among the two permutations. But since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for all unordered pairs {p, q}, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. So if inv(p) > inv(q), then in the case where p < q, it contributes to X. If inv(p) < inv(q), then in the case where q < p (which is equivalent to p < q being false), then it contributes to the count of pairs where inv(q) > inv(p) and q < p. But this seems like it's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q lex. Let's denote this as T. Then, the answer X is equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me consider that for all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(q) > inv(p) if the distribution is symmetric. However, since inv(p) and inv(q) can be anything, but for each pair (p, q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds (assuming inv(p) != inv(q)), then the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). However, this is only true when considering all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q. So for the entire set of ordered pairs, the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs with inv(p) < inv(q). But how does that relate to X?\n\nThe total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q is S = n! * (n! - 1). Let me denote A as the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), B as the number where inv(p) < inv(q), and C as the number where inv(p) = inv(q). Then A + B + C = S. Also, since for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds unless they are equal. Therefore, A = B. Hence, A = (S - C)/2.\n\nNow, the answer X is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). But how can we express X in terms of A and other variables?\n\nWell, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is A. These pairs can be split into two categories: those where p < q lex, and those where p > q lex. Let me denote X as the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), and Y as the number of pairs where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). Then A = X + Y.\n\nBut note that for each pair (p, q) where p < q, the pair (q, p) has p > q. So for each such pair, if inv(p) > inv(q), then in the (q, p) pair, inv(q) < inv(p). But since inv(p) > inv(q) implies inv(q) < inv(p), the Y is the number of pairs where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). Which is equivalent to the number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). Which is the same as the number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). Which is the same as the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(q) < inv(p). Which is the same as X' where X' is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). So Y = X'.\n\nBut since X + X' is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) != inv(q), and since T = (n! * (n! - 1))/2 is the total number of such pairs, then X + X' + C' = T, where C' is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBut since A = X + Y = X + X', and B = X' + X'' (but I think this line of thought isn't helping).\n\nAlternatively, since A = X + Y, and B = X' + Y', but since A = B, and X' = Y, and X = Y'? Not sure.\n\nBut here's another idea: For each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. For each such pair, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) contributes to A. So the total number of such pairs is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). Let's call this U. Then A = U, since each unordered pair contributes exactly once to A. But no, because for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), the pair (p, q) contributes to A if p < q, and (q, p) contributes to B if q < p. But since A = B, then for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs contributes to A and the other to B. Thus, the total U is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). And since A = B, then A = U. But how does that help us?\n\nBut then, X is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Which is exactly the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, then X is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the probability that p < q. But how to find that probability?\n\nIf the lex order between p and q is independent of their inversion counts, then the probability that p < q is 0.5. But that's not necessarily true. However, perhaps for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, the number of pairs where p < q is exactly half of the total number of unordered pairs. Which is true. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of p < q lex. Therefore, the total number of unordered pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2, and the total number of ordered pairs where p < q is T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. So for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in T.\n\nSo, for the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), which is U, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T where inv(p) > inv(q) is exactly equal to the number of such unordered pairs where p < q. Which is equal to U multiplied by the probability that p < q in the unordered pair. But since for each unordered pair, exactly one of the two possibilities holds, then the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T with inv(p) > inv(q) is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the fraction of those pairs where p < q. But how can we compute this fraction?\n\nBut here's the key insight: For any two distinct permutations p and q, the probability that p < q lex is 0.5. So for each unordered pair {p, q}, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T is exactly half of the total number of unordered pairs. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 0.5. Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. So if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of the ordered pairs contributes to X (if p < q) or not (if q < p). So the total X is equal to (number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q)) * 0.5.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that X = U * 0.5, where U is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q). But how do we compute U?\n\nU is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). Let's think about this. Let's denote that the total number of unordered pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Let me denote that the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) = inv(q) is C. Then, the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_unordered_pairs - C) / 2. Because for each unordered pair where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. Hence, the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_unordered_pairs - C) / 2.\n\nThus, X = [ (total_unordered_pairs - C) / 2 ] * 0.5 ?\n\nNo, wait. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q is T_unordered = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2.\n\nAmong these, C is the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nThen, the remaining T_unordered - C pairs have inv(p) != inv(q). For these, exactly half have inv(p) > inv(q), and half have inv(p) < inv(q). Hence, U = (T_unordered - C) / 2.\n\nThen, X is equal to U multiplied by 0.5, because for each of these U unordered pairs, exactly half of them have p < q lex. So X = U * 0.5.\n\nTherefore, X = [ (T_unordered - C) / 2 ] * 0.5 = (T_unordered - C) / 4.\n\nWait, but T_unordered is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. So substituting:\n\nX = [ ( (n! * (n! - 1) ) / 2 - C ) / 2 ] * 1/2 ? No, earlier reasoning said that X is equal to U multiplied by 0.5, where U is (T_unordered - C)/2. So:\n\nX = ( (T_unordered - C) / 2 ) * 1/2 = (T_unordered - C) / 4 ?\n\nBut that would imply that the answer is (T_unordered - C) / 4. But how?\n\nBut let me think again. For each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in T (the set of ordered pairs where p < q). So the number of such ordered pairs in T is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But since for each unordered pair, the probability that p < q is 0.5, then the number is U * 0.5. Hence, X = U * 0.5 = [ (T_unordered - C)/2 ] * 0.5 = (T_unordered - C) / 4.\n\nBut then the answer is (T_unordered - C) / 4 mod mod. However, T_unordered is (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2, and C is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) = inv(q). Let's compute that.\n\nC is equal to sum_{k} (f[k] choose 2), where f[k] is the number of permutations with inversion count k. Because for each k, the number of unordered pairs of permutations with inversion count k is (f[k] choose 2).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nans = [ ( (n! * (n! - 1) ) // 2 - sum_{k} (f[k] * (f[k] - 1) // 2 )) ] // 4 \n\nBut wait, the formula is (T_unordered - C) / 4. But T_unordered is (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2. So substituting:\n\nans = [ ( (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2 - C ) ] / 4 \n\nBut division by 4 may not be straightforward, especially when working modulo mod. However, since the problem requires the answer mod mod, and mod may not be prime, we need to ensure that the divisions are valid. However, perhaps the formula can be rewritten as:\n\nans = (n! * (n! - 1) - 2*C) / 8 \n\nBecause:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nans = [ (T_unordered - C) ] / 4 \n\nBut T_unordered is (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2. So:\n\nans = [ ( (n!*(n!-1)/2 ) - C ) ] / 4 \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2:\n\nans = [ n!*(n!-1) - 2*C ] / 8 \n\nSo, ans = (n!*(n!-1) - 2*C ) / 8 \n\nBut how to compute this? Well, the problem is that for large n (up to 500), n! is a very big number. However, since we need to compute this modulo mod, we can compute all terms modulo mod*8 or something? Wait, but division modulo mod requires that the denominator and mod are coprime. However, since mod may not be prime, and 8 may not be coprime with mod, this approach may not be straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps the original formula can be handled using modular inverses. However, since mod is arbitrary, we need to make sure that 8 divides the numerator. Let me think.\n\nThe answer is (n! * (n! - 1) - 2*C) divided by 8. But since the answer must be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by 8. Therefore, we can compute the numerator modulo (mod * 8), then divide by 8, then take modulo mod. But how to handle this in code?\n\nAlternatively, compute the numerator as (n! * (n! - 1) - 2*C) and then perform integer division by 8. But since n can be up to 500, n! is a huge number, but since we need to compute this modulo mod, perhaps we can compute the numerator modulo (mod * 8), then divide by 8. However, for that, we need to compute the numerator modulo 8 * mod, then divide by 8, and take the result modulo mod.\n\nBut how to compute this? Let's think.\n\nLet me denote the numerator as N = n! * (n! - 1) - 2*C.\n\nWe need to compute N / 8 mod mod.\n\nBut since N is divisible by 8, as per the problem's conditions, we can compute N mod (8 * mod), then divide by 8, and then take mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute N mod (8 * mod) when n is up to 500?\n\nBut for n up to 500, n! can be computed as a big integer, but even for n=500, the factorial is a huge number. However, for n=500, 500! is a number with over 1000 digits, which is impossible to store in a standard integer type. However, since we need to compute N mod (8 * mod), perhaps we can compute the necessary terms modulo 8*mod.\n\nBut wait, for the term n! * (n! - 1), when mod is up to 1e9, 8*mod could be up to 8e9. So for n=500, n! is way larger than 8e9. However, for numbers larger than 8*mod, we can compute n! mod (8*mod) and (n! - 1) mod (8*mod), multiply them, etc. But for n >= some value, say, when n >= 8*mod, n! mod (8*mod) is zero. Because 8*mod is a number, and once n! includes all factors up to 8*mod, then n! mod (8*mod) is zero. But for n up to 500, and mod up to 1e9, 8*mod could be up to 8e9. For example, when mod is 1e9, 8*mod is 8e9. For n=500, 500! is way larger than 8e9. So for n >= 8*mod, n! mod (8*mod) is zero. But for n < 8*mod, we can compute n! mod (8*mod) directly.\n\nBut how to compute n! mod (8*mod) for n up to 500? Well, we can compute it iteratively. For example, for n up to 500, even if 8*mod is up to 8e9, the product can be computed with Python's arbitrary precision integers.\n\nOnce we have n! mod (8*mod), then n! * (n! - 1) mod (8*mod) can be computed. Similarly, for the term 2*C mod (8*mod), we need to compute C mod (8*mod).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute f[k], the number of permutations of n elements with k inversions.\n\n2. Compute C = sum_{k} (f[k] * (f[k] - 1) ) // 2.\n\nBut again, for n up to 500, the maximum inversion count is n*(n-1)/2. For n=500, this is 500*499/2 = 124750. So for each k from 0 to 124750, we need to compute f[k].\n\nBut how to compute f[k]?\n\nThis is a classic dynamic programming problem. The number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions can be computed with DP. The recurrence is:\n\ndp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(k, n-1)} dp[n-1][k - i]\n\nBecause inserting the nth element into a permutation of n-1 elements. When inserting the new element (which is the largest element, say), inserting it at position i (from 0 to n-1) adds i inversions. So for each previous count of inversions, we add the possibilities for inserting the new element.\n\nBut for n=500 and k up to ~125,000, this DP would take O(n^3) time, which is not feasible. Wait, n=500 and k up to 125,000. For each n, the maximum k is n(n-1)/2. So for n=500, the max k is 124750. So for each n, we need to compute dp[n][k] for k up to 124750. The DP recurrence is:\n\ndp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(k, n-1)} dp[n-1][k - i]\n\nBut this recurrence would take O(n^3) time. For n=500, that's 500^3 = 125,000,000 operations. Which might be manageable in Python if optimized properly.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a 2D array and optimize the summation using prefix sums. For example, for each n, dp[n][k] can be computed using the previous row dp[n-1][...], and for each k, the sum from k - (n-1) to k. Wait, more precisely, for each k, dp[n][k] is the sum of dp[n-1][k - i] for i from 0 to min(n-1, k). Which can be rewritten as the sum of dp[n-1][j] for j from max(0, k - (n-1)) to k. But this is the same as the sum of dp[n-1][j] for j from (k - (n-1)) to k, but ensuring that j is >= 0. So for each n, and for each k, the sum can be computed using a sliding window approach with prefix sums. This way, the time complexity can be reduced to O(n^2 * max_k), but since max_k is O(n^2), this would be O(n^4) which is not feasible for n=500.\n\nWait, but the max_k for n is O(n^2). So for each n, the number of k's is O(n^2), and for each k, the sum is O(n) steps. So total time is O(n^3). For n=500, that's 125 million operations. Which is acceptable in Python, perhaps?\n\nBut even with that, we need to think about how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the DP approach. Let's define dp as a 2D array, where dp[i][j] represents the number of permutations of length i with j inversions.\n\nBase case: dp[1][0] = 1. For i=1, there's only one permutation (the single element) with 0 inversions.\n\nFor i > 1, dp[i][j] = sum_{x=0}^{min(j, i-1)} dp[i-1][j - x]. Because inserting the i-th element (the largest) into a permutation of i-1 elements. Inserting it at position x (0-based) adds x inversions.\n\nBut calculating this sum for each j and i directly would be O(n^3) time. However, we can optimize it using prefix sums.\n\nFor each i, when building dp[i][...], we can compute the prefix sums of dp[i-1][...], and then for each j, the sum from j - (i-1) to j can be computed quickly.\n\nLet me explain. For each i, when building dp[i][j], the sum is over x from 0 to min(i-1, j). Which is equivalent to sum_{k = max(0, j - (i-1))}^j dp[i-1][k]. Because x is the number of inversions added by inserting the new element. So for each j, the sum is the sum of dp[i-1][j - x] where x ranges from 0 to min(i-1, j). But j - x can be rewritten as k = j - x → x = j - k. So when x ranges from 0 to m (where m is min(i-1, j)), then k ranges from j - m to j. So the sum is over k from (j - m) to j.\n\nBut m is min(i-1, j). So for each j, the lower bound is max(0, j - (i-1)).\n\nSo for example, for i-th step, the sum for dp[i][j] is sum_{k = max(0, j - (i-1))}^j dp[i-1][k}.\n\nIf we can compute this sum efficiently for all j, then we can reduce the time complexity.\n\nTo compute these sums, we can precompute the prefix sums of dp[i-1][...].\n\nLet me denote prefix[i-1][j] as the sum of dp[i-1][0..j]. Then the sum from a to b is prefix[i-1][b] - prefix[i-1][a-1], if a > 0. Else, it's prefix[i-1][b].\n\nThus, for each j, the sum is:\n\nlower = max(0, j - (i-1))\nupper = j\nsum_val = prefix_prev[upper] - (prefix_prev[lower - 1] if lower > 0 else 0)\n\nSo, for each i, we can compute the prefix sums for dp[i-1], and then for each j, compute dp[i][j] as the sum above.\n\nThis way, for each i, we process all j up to max_k (which is i*(i-1)/2) and for each j, we do O(1) work. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^3) for the DP.\n\nBut for n=500, this would be O(500^3) = 125,000,000 operations. Which should be manageable in Python with optimizations.\n\nOnce we compute the dp table, we can get f[k] = dp[n][k] for all k. Then compute C = sum (f[k] * (f[k] - 1) // 2) for all k.\n\nBut for large n, the values of f[k] can be very large. However, since we need to compute C modulo (8 * mod), we can compute all the f[k] modulo (8 * mod) during the DP steps, and then compute C accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that N = (n! * (n! - 1) - 2*C) must be divided by 8. So, we need to compute N modulo (8 * mod), then divide by 8, then take mod mod. However, for that, we need to compute all the components modulo 8 * mod. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute n! mod (8 * mod). Let's call this fact = n! mod (8 * mod).\n\nThen compute (n! * (n! - 1)) mod (8 * mod). Which is (fact * (fact - 1)) mod (8 * mod).\n\nThen compute C mod (8 * mod), which is sum over k of (f[k] * (f[k] - 1) // 2) mod (8 * mod). But since f[k] can be very large, we need to compute f[k] mod (something). Wait, but for C, we need to compute sum (f[k] * (f[k] - 1) // 2) mod (8 * mod). However, since f[k] can be up to (n!) (since each permutation has a certain number of inversions), but for n=500, even with mod up to 1e9, 8*mod can be up to 8e9, and for n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way larger than 8e9. Therefore, when computing f[k], we need to compute them modulo (8 * mod), so that when we calculate C, we can do it modulo (8 * mod).\n\nBut how to compute the DP for f[k] modulo (8 * mod)?\n\nYes. So during the DP steps, we can compute each dp[i][j] modulo (8 * mod). Because for the purposes of computing C, we need to compute (f[k] * (f[k] - 1) // 2) mod (8 * mod). So, during the DP steps, all operations are done modulo (8 * mod).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute mod_val = 8 * mod.\n\nCompute fact_n_mod = n! mod mod_val.\n\nCompute term1 = (fact_n_mod * (fact_n_mod - 1)) % mod_val.\n\nCompute the DP table for inversion counts, with all values stored modulo mod_val.\n\nOnce we have dp[n][k] for all k, compute C as sum over k of (dp[n][k] * (dp[n][k] - 1) // 2) mod mod_val.\n\nThen compute N = (term1 - 2*C) mod mod_val.\n\nThen, since N must be divisible by 8, we can compute (N // 8) mod mod.\n\nBut why is N divisible by 8? Because the answer is an integer. So the formula must yield an integer. Therefore, N must be divisible by 8. Hence, when we compute N mod (8 * mod), then N is congruent to some multiple of 8, so dividing by 8 gives an integer.\n\nBut how to handle this in code?\n\nIn Python, we can compute N as (term1 - 2*C) mod",
