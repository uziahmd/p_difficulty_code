Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between R Rebel spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. The input gives coordinates for the spaceships and bases, and we have to check if such a matching exists.\n\nFirst, the constraints: R and B are up to 10. So the total number of possible perfect matchings is R! (if R=B). Since R and B are small, maybe up to 10, then 10! is around 3.6 million, which is manageable for a brute-force approach. But wait, for each possible perfect matching, we need to check if all the line segments are non-intersecting. So the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases (if R != B, then it's impossible, so output No immediately).\n2. For each matching, check if any two line segments cross each other.\n3. If any such matching exists where all segments are non-intersecting, output Yes; else No.\n\nBut first, we need to make sure that R equals B. Because the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", which implies that R must equal B. Wait, the input has R and B, but the problem says \"it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So that requires R = B. Otherwise, it's impossible. So first, if R != B, output No.\n\nSo in the code, first check if R != B, then output No. Else, proceed.\n\nNow, for the case when R = B, generate all permutations of the bases (since each spaceship is matched to a base, and the permutation represents which base each spaceship is assigned to). For example, if there are 3 spaceships and 3 bases, each permutation of the bases represents a possible matching. For each permutation, check if all the line segments between the spaceship i and base permutation[i] (or whatever the index mapping is) do not intersect with each other.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nBut note that the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, no three points lie on the same line. Which might help in avoiding some edge cases.\n\nSo, the steps for checking two line segments AB and CD:\n\n- Check if they intersect properly (i.e., cross each other), or if they share an endpoint. Wait, but in our problem, since all points are distinct, and no three points are colinear, then two line segments can't share an endpoint unless they are connected to the same point. However, in our case, each line segment is between a spaceship and a base. Since each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, the line segments are between unique pairs. So two line segments can't share an endpoint. Therefore, for the problem's constraints, the line segments can't share endpoints. So, the only way two segments could intersect is if they cross each other in the middle.\n\nBut the problem says that any two paths (from base to spaceship) must not intersect. So even if two segments cross each other, that's a problem. So, for a given matching, we need to check that none of the line segments intersect each other.\n\nSo, the key is to check for any pair of line segments in the matching whether they intersect.\n\nNow, how to implement the line segment intersection check.\n\nI remember that there's a standard computational geometry approach for this. The steps are:\n\n1. Check if the two segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nThe standard approach involves checking the orientation of points. The steps are:\n\n- First, check if the segments AB and CD intersect by using the orientation method. The algorithm involves checking if the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and similarly for (C, D, A) and (C, D, B). If that's the case, then the segments intersect. Also, need to handle the cases where one of the segments is collinear with the other, but since the problem states that no three points are colinear, this case can't happen. Because if two segments are collinear, then their endpoints would be colinear. But the problem states that no three points are colinear. So, for example, if AB and CD are collinear, then points A, B, C, D would be colinear, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. Therefore, this case can't happen. So, the code can safely assume that two segments can't be collinear. Hence, the check for intersection can be done by checking if the orientations are different.\n\nWait, but for the case where one segment's endpoint lies on the other segment? But since the problem says no three points are colinear, that can't happen. For example, suppose segment AB and segment CD. Suppose point C lies on AB. Then points A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed. So, in our problem, the only possible way for two segments to intersect is if they cross each other in the interior. Therefore, the standard method for checking if two line segments intersect properly (crossing each other) can be used.\n\nSo, the code for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    # returns True if segments AB and CD intersect\n\n    # compute orientation of A, B, C\n\n    # compute orientation of A, B, D\n\n    # compute orientation of C, D, A\n\n    # compute orientation of C, D, B\n\n    # if orientations of (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and orientations of (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different, then they intersect\n\n    # but since no three points are colinear, there's no case where any of the orientations is zero.\n\n    # So, the code can be written as follows.\n\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n\n        # returns 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise, 0 if colinear\n\n        val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n\n        if val == 0:\n\n            return 0\n\n        return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # if o1 and o2 are different, and o3 and o4 are different, then segments intersect\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but this is only for the case where the segments cross each other. What about when one segment's endpoint lies on the other segment? Well, according to the problem statement, that's impossible because no three points are colinear. So, for example, if point C is on AB, then A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed. Hence, in our problem, the above function will correctly return True only when the segments cross each other.\n\nSo, this function should work.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the bases (assuming R = B), we need to check all pairs of line segments in that permutation. If any pair of segments intersects, then that permutation is invalid. If none of the pairs intersect, then it's a valid matching, and we can return \"Yes\".\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output No.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R spaceships' coordinates.\n\nRead B bases' coordinates.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships).\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   For each pair of line segments (i, j) where i < j:\n\n      Check if the segments (spaceship i -> base permutation[i]) and (spaceship j -> base permutation[j]) intersect.\n\n      If any such pair intersects, mark this permutation as invalid.\n\n   If all pairs are non-intersecting, then return \"Yes\".\n\nIf none of the permutations are valid, return \"No\".\n\nBut generating all permutations is O(R!) time. For R=10, that's 3.6 million permutations. For each permutation, checking all pairs of segments: for each permutation, there are R*(R-1)/2 pairs. For R=10, that's 45 pairs per permutation. For each pair, checking the intersection. Each check is O(1) time. So total operations would be 3.6e6 * 45 = 1.6e8 operations. That's acceptable for Python? Maybe. But perhaps for R=10, it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about possible optimizations. However, given that R and B are up to 10, and the code is for a programming competition, perhaps this approach is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen the bases are:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the spaceships are at (0,0), (2,0), (3,1). Bases are (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2).\n\nIn the first example, the answer is \"Yes\" because connecting in order. Let's see:\n\nSpaceship 1 (0,0) to base 1 (-2,1): line from (0,0) to (-2,1).\n\nSpaceship 2 (2,0) to base 2 (0,3): line from (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nSpaceship 3 (3,1) to base 3 (2,2): line from (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nDo these lines cross each other?\n\nLet me check:\n\nCheck between first and second line segments.\n\nFirst segment: (0,0) to (-2,1). Second: (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nWe can compute if they cross. Let me use the orientation method.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to imagine. Alternatively, maybe the sample input's explanation says that connecting in order works. So the code would find that permutation as valid.\n\nAnother example: the second input is:\n\n2 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. So output is No because R != B.\n\nBut the second input in the example is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1', ... ] ?\n\nWait, the sample input is given as two examples. The first input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, the first example input is:\n\n3 3\n\nThen three lines for spaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen three lines for bases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe second example input is:\n\n2 1\n\nThen two spaceships:\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\nThen one base:\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2 and B=1. So output is No.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. But the input is given as a list of strings? Or perhaps the code is supposed to read from stdin. Wait, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. But the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably just for the example. The actual code needs to read from standard input.\n\nSo, the code should read R and B from the first line, then read R lines of spaceship coordinates, then B lines of base coordinates.\n\nBut in Python, the code can read from stdin via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nNow, for the code structure:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No' and exit.\n\nElse, read R spaceships, then B bases.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships).\n\nFor each permutation, check all pairs of line segments for intersection.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output 'Yes'.\n\nElse, output 'No'.\n\nNow, generating permutations. For example, for B=3, the bases are stored as a list. The permutations of the bases would be all possible orderings. For each permutation, the i-th spaceship is assigned to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nBut wait, the spaceships are ordered. For example, the first spaceship is assigned to the first element of the permutation, etc.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nships = list of R points\n\nbases = list of B points\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n\n    check if all pairs of line segments between ships[i] and perm[i] don't intersect.\n\nBut how to check all pairs?\n\nFor each pair of indices (i, j) where i < j:\n\nCheck if the segment between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with the segment between ships[j] and perm[j].\n\nIf any such pair exists, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for the code, for each permutation:\n\nvalid = True\n\nfor i in range(R):\n\n    for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n        if segments_intersect(ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]):\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n\n        break\n\nif valid:\n\n    print(\"Yes\")\n\n    exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none is valid, print \"No\".\n\nNow, the code for segments_intersect.\n\nBut need to implement that function.\n\nBut how to represent points? As tuples of integers.\n\nSo, the code for the orientation function.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be nested. So perhaps, inside the code, define the orientation function.\n\nBut let's code it.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n\n    # p, q, r are tuples (x, y)\n\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n\n    if val == 0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, the val can't be zero. So, in our case, the function can return 1 or 2, but in the code, the function can return 1 or -1, or whatever. But in the code for checking the segments, the function is called with four points, and the code checks whether the orientations are different.\n\nBut the code for segments_intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n\n    # a1, a2 are endpoints of segment 1, b1, b2 endpoints of segment 2.\n\n    # returns True if they intersect.\n\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n\n    # if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4, then they intersect.\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nBut wait, in the case where one segment is entirely contained within the other? But according to the problem's constraints, that's not possible. Because for example, if segment b1-b2 is entirely inside a1-a2, then the endpoints of b1 and b2 would be colinear with a1 and a2. Which is not allowed. So the problem's constraints prevent that.\n\nTherefore, the code above is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when the two segments are overlapping but not colinear? Well, the problem's constraints say that no three points are colinear. So that's not possible.\n\nThus, the code for segments_intersect is correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut in Python, for the permutations, since the bases are read as a list, and permutations are generated from that list.\n\nBut the problem says that the bases are given as B lines. So, for example, in the first sample input, the bases are:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the bases list would be [( -2, 1 ), (0, 3), (2, 2)].\n\nNow, for each permutation of this list, the code checks.\n\nBut the code needs to read the input correctly.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No'.\n\nElse, read R lines of spaceship coordinates, then B lines of base coordinates.\n\nBut how to read them?\n\nIn Python, for example:\n\nimport sys\n\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n\n    idx += 1\n\n    ships = []\n\n    for _ in range(R):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n\n        idx += 1\n\n    bases = []\n\n    for _ in range(B):\n\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n\n        idx += 1\n\n    if R != B:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        return\n\n    # Now generate permutations of bases.\n\n    from itertools import permutations\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n\n        # check all pairs of segments in this permutation.\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(R):\n\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n                # check if segment ships[i] to perm[i] intersects with ships[j] to perm[j]\n\n                a1 = ships[i]\n\n                a2 = perm[i]\n\n                b1 = ships[j]\n\n                b2 = perm[j]\n\n                if segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if valid:\n\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut then, the code needs to have the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be inside functions. So, inside main(), perhaps.\n\nBut also, the orientation function.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n\n    if val == 0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nBut wait, the problem says that no three points are colinear, so the val can't be zero. So, the orientation function can return 1 or 2. But in code, the function can return 1 or -1, but in any case, the code for segments_intersect is correct.\n\nBut perhaps in the code, the segments_intersect function can be optimized. For example, since the problem says that no three points are colinear, the code can ignore the case where any of the orientations is zero.\n\nBut the code for segments_intersect is correct regardless.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, ships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nOne permutation is the same as the order of the bases. So perm is [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nCheck for all pairs:\n\ni=0, j=1: ships[0] (0,0) to (-2,1), ships[1] (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nCheck if these segments intersect.\n\nCompute o1: orientation of (0,0), (2,0), (-2,1). Let's compute:\n\nval = (2-0)*(1 - 0) - (0 - 0)*(-2 - 0) → 2*1 - 0*(-2) = 2 → positive. So o1 is 1.\n\no2: orientation of (0,0), (2,0), (0,3). val = (2-0)*(3-0) - (0-0)*(0-0) → 2*3 - 0 = 6 → positive. So o2 is 1. So o1 == o2 → returns false. So segments_intersect returns false. So no intersection here.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the sample explanation. Wait, but according to the sample explanation, this permutation is valid. So in this case, the code would not find any intersections. So why?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the first segment is from (0,0) to (-2,1). The second segment is from (2,0) to (0,3). Do these two segments cross?\n\nLet me draw them mentally.\n\nThe first line goes from (0,0) to (-2,1). The direction is left and up. The second line goes from (2,0) to (0,3), which is left and up. Do these cross?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they do not cross. So the code would return false for segments_intersect. Then, for the next pair.\n\ni=0, j=2: ships[0] (0,0) to (-2,1) and ships[2] (3,1) to (2,2). Check if they cross.\n\nSimilarly, compute orientations.\n\nFor the first segment (a1, a2) is (0,0) to (-2,1). The second segment is (3,1) to (2,2). So check for b1 = (3,1) and b2 = (2,2).\n\no1 is orientation of a1, a2, b1.\n\nval = (-2 - 0) * (1 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (3 - 0) → (-2)(1) - (1)(3) = -2 -3 = -5 → negative. So o1 is 2.\n\no2 is orientation of a1, a2, b2. b2 is (2,2).\n\nval = (-2 - 0) * (2 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) → (-2)(2) - 1*(2) = -4 -2 = -6 → negative. o2 is 2. So o1 == o2 → returns false. So segments_intersect returns false.\n\nThen i=1, j=2: ships[1] (2,0) to (0,3), and ships[2] (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if these segments cross.\n\nFor a1 = (2,0), a2 = (0,3). b1 = (3,1), b2 = (2,2).\n\nCompute o1: orientation of a1, a2, b1.\n\nval = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) → (-2)*(1) - 3*(1) = -2 -3 = -5 → negative → o1 is 2.\n\no2: orientation of a1, a2, b2. b2 is (2,2).\n\nval = (0-2)*(2 - 0) - (3 - 0)*(2 - 2) → (-2)*(2) - 3*(0) = -4 → negative. o2 is 2. So same as o1 → returns false. So segments_intersect returns false.\n\nThus, in this permutation, all pairs are non-intersecting, so the code returns Yes.\n\nSo the code would work for the first sample.\n\nNow, the second sample input is R=2, B=1. So R != B, output is No.\n\nNow, what about cases where R=B but no permutation is valid?\n\nFor example, if there are two spaceships and two bases arranged such that any matching has crossing lines.\n\nFor example, spaceships at (0,0) and (2,2), bases at (0,2) and (2,0). Then, the two possible permutations:\n\nperm1: [ (0,2), (2,0) ]\n\nCheck segments (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These are vertical lines, which are parallel. No intersection.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lines are (0,0) to (0,2) and (2,2) to (2,0). These are two vertical lines. They don't intersect. So this permutation is valid. So output is Yes.\n\nBut if the bases were arranged such that in any permutation, the lines cross.\n\nFor example, suppose spaceships are at (0,0) and (2,0). Bases are at (1,1) and (1,-1). Then, the two permutations:\n\nperm1: assign first spaceship to (1,1), second to (1,-1). The lines are from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,0) to (1,-1). These lines cross each other?\n\nLet me check. The first line is from (0,0) to (1,1), which is y=x. The second line is from (2,0) to (1,-1), which is y = x - 2. These lines cross at (2, 2) which is not on the segments. Wait, solving y=x and y = x-2. No solution. So they are parallel? No, they have same slope. So they are parallel. So no intersection. Thus, the code would return Yes.\n\nHmm. So perhaps it's hard to find a case where no permutation is valid. But the problem says that in the second example, it's not possible.\n\nBut the code will handle it.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling permutations correctly.\n\n- Reading input correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue is that the code may have a mistake in the segments_intersect function.\n\nLet me think of another test case.\n\nTest case where two segments cross. For example:\n\nShip1 is at (0,0), Ship2 at (3,3). Base1 is at (1,2), Base2 is at (2,1). So the permutation is [Base1, Base2]. The segments are (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute.\n\nSegment AB: (0,0) to (1,2). Segment CD: (3,3) to (2,1).\n\nCompute orientations.\n\nFor AB, check points C and D.\n\nOrientation of AB for C (3,3):\n\nval = (1-0)*(3-0) - (2-0)*(3-0) → (1)(3) - 2*3 = 3-6 = -3 → negative → o1=2.\n\nFor D (2,1):\n\nval = (1-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) → 1*1 - 2*2 = 1-4 = -3 → negative → o2=2. So o1 == o2. So segments_intersect returns false.\n\nBut the segments may cross. Wait, let's see. The lines AB and CD.\n\nLine AB: parametric equations x = t, y = 2t, t in [0,1].\n\nLine CD: parametric equations x = 3 - t, y = 3 - 2t, t in [0,1].\n\nFind if they intersect.\n\nSet equations equal:\n\nt = 3 - s\n\n2t = 3 - 2s.\n\nSubstituting t from first equation into second:\n\n2(3 - s) = 3 - 2s → 6 - 2s = 3 - 2s → 6=3 → impossible. So no intersection.\n\nSo the code returns false, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case where segments cross:\n\nShip1 (0,0), Ship2 (2,2). Bases: (1, 1) and (1, 0). Wait, but the problem says no three points are colinear. So in this case, the base (1,1) is colinear with the two ships? Well, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So this case is invalid as per the problem's input constraints. So the code can assume that no such cases exist.\n\nAnother test case: ships at (0,0), (1, 3). Bases at (1, 1), (0, 2). So the two possible permutations.\n\nPermutation 1: assign ship1 to (1,1), ship2 to (0,2). Segments: (0,0)-(1,1) and (1,3)-(0,2). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute orientations.\n\nSegment AB: (0,0) to (1,1). Segment CD: (1,3) to (0,2).\n\nCheck orientation of AB for C (1,3):\n\nval = (1-0)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) → 1*3 - 1*1 = 3-1=2 → positive → o1=1.\n\nFor D (0,2):\n\nval = (1-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) → 1*2 - 1*0 = 2 → positive → o2=1. So o1 == o2 → returns false. So no intersection.\n\nBut visually, the two lines are (0,0)-(1,1) and (1,3)-(0,2). Let me find if they cross.\n\nLine AB is y = x.\n\nLine CD: from (1,3) to (0,2). Slope is (2-3)/(0-1) = (-1)/(-1) = 1. So equation is y -3 = 1*(x-1) → y = x + 2. So the lines are y=x and y=x+2. They are parallel, so no intersection. So code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: ships at (0,0), (3,3). Bases at (1,2), (2,1). Permutation assigns ship1 to (1,2), ship2 to (2,1). Segments are (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1).\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\nLet me compute the orientations.\n\nAB is (0,0) to (1,2). CD is (3,3) to (2,1).\n\nFor AB, check C (3,3):\n\nval = (1-0)*(3-0) - (2-0)*(3-0) → 1*3 - 2*3 = 3-6 = -3 → o1=2.\n\nFor D (2,1):\n\nval = (1-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) → 1*1 - 2*2 = 1-4 = -3 → o2=2. Same, returns false.\n\nBut the lines: AB is from (0,0) to (1,2). CD is from (3,3) to (2,1). Let me find equations.\n\nAB: parametric equations x = t, y = 2t, t in [0,1].\n\nCD: parametric equations x = 3 - t, y = 3 - 2t, t in [0,1].\n\nSet equal:\n\nt = 3 - s\n\n2t = 3 - 2s.\n\nSubstitute t from first equation into second:\n\n2(3-s) = 3 - 2s → 6 - 2s = 3 - 2s → 6=3 → impossible. So no intersection.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case where the segments cross:\n\nShip1 (0,0), Ship2 (2, 2). Bases: (1, 3), (1, 0). But wait, the problem says no three points are colinear. Here, the base (1,0) is colinear with ship1 and ship2. So this input is invalid. So the code doesn't need to handle it.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, considering that the code uses permutations, which generates all possible assignments. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the permutations function returns tuples of the elements. Since the bases are stored as a list of tuples, the permutations will be tuples of tuples.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for the code, the function segments_intersect is called with a1, a2, b1, b2.\n\nBut in the code, the variables are:\n\nfor each i and j:\n\na1 = ships[i]\n\na2 = perm[i]\n\nb1 = ships[j]\n\nb2 = perm[j]\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the code:\n\nfor each permutation, the i-th spaceship is connected to perm[i], which is the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nSo, the first segment is between ships[i] and perm[i], and the second is between ships[j] and perm[j].\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code needs to read from stdin. Also, note that in the sample input, the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input for the first example is given as a list of strings, but the actual problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. However, the sample input shows two examples, but the code is supposed to process one test case per run. So, the code reads one test case from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, etc. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's for the purpose of showing the outputs. So, the code should read one test case, and output one line.\n\nThus, the code is as written before.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all of the above.\n\nBut in Python, the code may have to import itertools and sys.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code would read R=3, B=3. Read ships as [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases as [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]. Then generate permutations. One of them is the original order. For that permutation, the code checks all pairs and finds no intersections, so returns Yes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nR=2, B=1. So output is No.\n\nThus, the code would output the correct answers.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\nCase where R=B=1. Then, only one possible assignment, and no lines to check. So output Yes.\n\nAnother case where R=B=2. Two ships and two bases arranged such that the two possible permutations are both invalid. For example:\n\nShips: (0,0), (2, 2). Bases: (1, 1), (1, 0). But the problem says no three points are colinear. Here, (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) are colinear, but the bases are (1,1) and (1,0). So the input is invalid. So the code can assume that the input is valid.\n\nBut assuming that the input is valid, then for example:\n\nShips at (0,0), (3,3). Bases at (1,2), (2,1). The two permutations are:\n\nperm1: (1,2), (2,1). Check if segments (0,0)-(1,2) and (3,3)-(2,1) cross. As discussed earlier, they don't.\n\nSo output is Yes.\n\nAnother case: ships at (0,0), (1, 3). Bases at (1, 1), (0, 2). The two permutations:\n\nperm1: (1,1) and (0,2). Check the segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (1,3)-(0,2). Do they cross? As discussed earlier, no.\n\nThus, output Yes.\n\nAnother case where it's impossible. For example, ships at (0,0), (2, 0). Bases at (1, 1), (1, -1). The two permutations:\n\nperm1: assign (1,1) to first ship and (1,-1) to second. Segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,0)-(1,-1). Do",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect in the 2D plane. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R is not equal to B, immediately output \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each possible permutation of the bases, check if the assignment of spaceships to bases in that permutation results in non-intersecting line segments.\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check all pairs of line segments formed by connecting each spaceship to its assigned base. Use a geometric approach to determine if any two line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                a1 = ships[i]\n                a2 = perm[i]\n                b1 = ships[j]\n                b2 = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Orientation Check**: The `orientation` function determines the orientation of three points (clockwise, counterclockwise, or colinear). This helps in checking if two line segments intersect.\n2. **Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the orientation of points to determine if two line segments intersect. If the orientations of the endpoints of one segment relative to the other segment differ, the segments intersect.\n3. **Permutations and Validation**: By generating all permutations of bases and checking each permutation for intersecting line segments, we ensure that we explore all possible perfect matchings. If any permutation is found where no segments intersect, we print \"Yes\"; otherwise, we print \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments using permutations and geometric properties to determine valid non-intersecting paths.",
