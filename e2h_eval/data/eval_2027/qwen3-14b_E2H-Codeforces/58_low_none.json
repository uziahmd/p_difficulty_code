You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the task is to find the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to create an odd-length cycle, and also count the number of ways to do that. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's required. A simple cycle of odd length. Oh right, and each vertex occurs once. So it's a simple cycle, no repeated vertices. Also, the graph is undirected, no loops or parallel edges.\n\nThe problem says that if the graph already contains such a cycle, then t is 0 and w is 1? Or wait, no. Wait, the output requires that if the graph already has such a cycle, then t is 0, and w is the number of ways to add zero edges (which would be 1, since there's only one way to not add any edges). But maybe the problem is that even if there's already an odd cycle, we have to check if there are multiple ways to form it? Wait, no. Because the question is about adding edges to form such a cycle. If the graph already has an odd cycle, then t is 0, and w is 1? Because there's only one way to do nothing. But perhaps there are multiple existing cycles. But the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges. So when t is 0, it's the number of ways to choose zero edges (which is 1) but only if the graph already contains at least one odd cycle. Wait, no. Because the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of odd length. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then adding zero edges would allow that cycle. But how many such ways are there? Well, the problem says that two ways are considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then the number of ways is 1 (since you add zero edges). But maybe there are multiple existing cycles. However, the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add edges to form a cycle. But in this case, adding zero edges would count as a way if there exists at least one such cycle. But how does that affect the count?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that the answer w is the number of ways to add t edges to form a cycle. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then adding zero edges is a valid way. But the question is: how many such ways are there? For example, if there are multiple existing odd cycles, but adding zero edges would count as one way. Because the way is determined by the set of edges added. Since adding zero edges is just one way (the empty set), regardless of how many existing cycles there are. So in this case, if the original graph already has an odd cycle, then t is 0 and w is 1. So the first thing to check is whether the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If yes, then output t=0 and w=1.\n\nSo the first step is to determine if the graph has an odd-length cycle. If it does, then answer is 0 and 1. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal t and count the ways.\n\nBut how to check if the graph has an odd-length cycle? Well, that's equivalent to checking if the graph is bipartite. Because a bipartite graph can't have odd-length cycles. So if the graph is bipartite, then there's no odd cycle. Otherwise, there is. So for each connected component, we can check if it's bipartite. If any component isn't bipartite, then the graph has an odd cycle.\n\nSo first, the plan is:\n\nCheck if the graph has an odd cycle. If yes, then output 0 1.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle.\n\nNow, what's the minimal t? Let's think about the case where the graph is bipartite. Because in that case, all connected components are bipartite.\n\nIn a bipartite graph, any cycle is of even length. So to create an odd cycle, we need to add edges in such a way that creates an odd cycle.\n\nWhat's the minimal number of edges needed?\n\nLet's think about the case when the graph is bipartite. Suppose we have a connected component. Since it's bipartite, it can be divided into two partitions, say A and B. Any edge connects a node in A to B.\n\nTo create an odd cycle, we need to add edges such that there's a cycle with an odd length. How?\n\nWell, if we add an edge between two nodes in the same partition. Because in a bipartite graph, all cycles are even-length. Adding an edge between two nodes",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form an odd-length cycle and count the number of such ways, we can follow this structured approach:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Odd Cycle Detection**:\n   - A graph contains an **odd-length cycle** if and only if it is **not bipartite**.\n   - So, our first step is to check whether the graph is bipartite. If it is not, then there's already at least one odd-length cycle in the graph.\n\n2. **If Already Contains an Odd Cycle**:\n   - Then, the answer is `t = 0` and `w = 1`, since we need to add zero edges and there is exactly one way to do so (by doing nothing).\n\n3. **If the Graph is Bipartite**:\n   - Then, we must add edges to create an odd-length cycle.\n   - Since the graph is bipartite, all cycles are even-length.\n   - The minimal number of edges to add to create an odd-length cycle is **1**.\n   - This is done by adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a connected component (which would make the cycle length odd).\n\n4. **Counting the Ways**:\n   - For each connected component, we can compute the number of possible edges that can be added between nodes in the same partition.\n   - Sum these across all connected components to get the total number of valid ways.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Strategy**\n\n- Use BFS to determine if each connected component is bipartite.\n- For bipartite components, calculate the number of nodes in each partition.\n- The number of possible edges within a partition is $ \\text{count}_A \\times \\text{count}_B $, where `count_A` and `count_B` are the sizes of the two partitions.\n- Multiply the number of such edges across all components (since choosing one such edge from any component suffices to form an odd cycle).\n- If the graph is not bipartite, output `0 1`.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_bipartite(graph, n):\n    color = [-1] * (n + 1)\n    for start in range(1, n + 1):\n        if color[start] == -1:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(start)\n            color[start] = 0\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                for v in graph[u]:\n                    if color[v] == -1:\n                        color[v] = color[u] ^ 1\n                        queue.append(v)\n                    elif color[v] == color[u]:\n                        return False, None\n    return True, color\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    n, m = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        a, b = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n        idx += 1\n\n    is_bipart, color = is_bipartite(graph, n)\n    if not is_bipart:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    # Count the number of ways to add one edge between nodes in the same partition\n    # For each component, calculate the number of edges that can be added\n    # Between nodes in the same partition\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    total_ways = 1\n\n    for start in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[start]:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(start)\n            visited[start] = True\n            partition_counts = [0, 0]\n            partition_counts[color[start]] = 1\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                for v in graph[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        partition_counts[color[v]] += 1\n                        queue.append(v)\n            # Number of ways to add edge within the same partition\n            ways = partition_counts[0] * partition_counts[1]\n            total_ways *= ways\n\n    print(\"1\", total_ways)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Output**\n\n- If the graph is **not bipartite**, it contains an odd cycle already → `t = 0`, `w = 1`.\n- If the graph is **bipartite**, we must add **1** edge to create an odd cycle.
