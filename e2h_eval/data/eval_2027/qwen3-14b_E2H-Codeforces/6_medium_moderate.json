Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the task is to find two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the sum of their costs is as small as possible. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the duration is. Oh right, the duration is ri - li + 1. So for each voucher, we can calculate that. Then, for two vouchers i and j, their durations should sum to x. Also, they must not overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nSo the approach here is to find pairs of vouchers where one has duration d, the other has duration x - d, and they don't overlap. And find the minimum cost among all such pairs.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently? Because n can be up to 2e5, so O(n^2) is impossible. So we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think. For each voucher, if we can find another voucher that has a duration of (x - duration_i), and that doesn't overlap with it. But how?\n\nMaybe we can pre-process vouchers grouped by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time (or start time?), and also track the minimum cost for certain ranges.\n\nWait, but for each voucher with duration d, we need to find a voucher with duration (x - d) that starts after this voucher ends, or ends before this voucher starts.\n\nSo for each voucher i with duration d, we can look for vouchers with duration (x - d). Let's say that x - d is called target_d. Then, for each such voucher i, we need to find the minimum cost of a voucher in target_d that ends before li (so that it's before the current voucher starts), or starts after ri (so that it's after the current voucher ends).\n\nBut how to find those efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Precompute for each duration d, a list of vouchers with that duration. For each such list, sort them by their end time (ri), and also perhaps have a structure that allows us to query the minimum cost for vouchers that end before a certain day. Similarly, sort them by start time (li) and find the minimum cost for vouchers that start after a certain day.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration, we can have two sorted lists: one sorted by end time, and another sorted by start time. Then, for a voucher i with duration d, target_d = x - d. We need to check two possibilities:\n\na) Find a voucher j in target_d that ends before li (so that voucher j ends before voucher i starts). The earliest possible end time would be before li. So for these vouchers, we can find the minimum cost among those ending before li.\n\nb) Find a voucher j in target_d that starts after ri (so that voucher j starts after voucher i ends). For these vouchers, find the minimum cost among those starting after ri.\n\nIf we can find these minima quickly, then for each voucher, we can compute the possible minima and keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor part a: For vouchers in target_d, sorted by their end time, we can binary search for the largest end time that is less than li. All vouchers up to that index would be candidates. Then, we need the minimum cost among those vouchers. So if we have a prefix minimum array for the sorted list, then we can get the minimum cost quickly.\n\nSimilarly, for part b: For vouchers in target_d sorted by their start time, we can binary search for the smallest start time that is greater than ri. All vouchers from that index onwards are candidates. Again, we need a suffix minimum array for these.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, mapping durations to lists of vouchers. For each duration, we'll have two sorted lists:\n\n   - One sorted by end time (ri), and a prefix min array of cost.\n   - Another sorted by start time (li), and a suffix min array of cost.\n\nWait, but for the first case (vouchers ending before li), we need to find the minimum cost among all vouchers in target_d with end <= li-1. So for the sorted list of end times, we can find the largest end time that is <= li-1. Then, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (start time >= ri+1), we can find the first start time that is >= ri+1. Then, the suffix min from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSo the steps for each voucher:\n\nFor voucher i with duration d:\n\n- Check if x - d is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our duration map). If not, skip.\n\n- Then, for target_d = x - d:\n\n   a) Look for vouchers in target_d that end before li. So, in the list sorted by end time, find the max end time <= li-1. If any such vouchers exist, take the min cost from that prefix.\n\n   b) Look for vouchers in target_d that start after ri. So, in the list sorted by start time, find the first start time >= ri+1. If any such vouchers exist, take the min cost from that suffix.\n\n   Then, for both a and b, if any of them exists, add the current voucher's cost to the min found, and track the overall minimum.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nFor each duration d, we have:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by end time (ri). For this list, we also have a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from the first element up to the i-th element in the sorted list.\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by start time (li). For this list, we also have a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from the i-th element to the end of the list.\n\nSo for example, for the sorted by end time list, when we find the index where end time is <= li-1, the prefix_min at that index gives the minimum cost for all vouchers up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted by start time list, when we find the first index where start time >= ri+1, then the suffix_min from that index gives the minimum cost for all vouchers from that index onwards.\n\nSo, for each duration, we need to precompute these sorted lists and their prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nNow, the question is, how to build this structure.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read all vouchers, compute their durations.\n\n2. For each duration d, collect all vouchers with that duration. Then, for each such group, create two sorted lists:\n\n   a) Sorted by end time (ri), and create a prefix_min array.\n\n   b) Sorted by start time (li), and create a suffix_min array.\n\nSo for each duration d, we have:\n\n- sorted_by_end: list of vouchers sorted by ri. Each entry is (ri, li, cost). Wait, no, the voucher's li and ri are needed. Or perhaps we can store the voucher's li, ri, cost. But for the sorted_by_end list, we can sort by ri, and for the prefix_min, we can compute the minimum cost up to each position.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start, sorted by li, and compute the suffix_min.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i, we can process as follows:\n\nCompute d = duration of voucher i. Then, target_d = x - d. If target_d is not present in the duration map, skip.\n\nElse, for the target_d group:\n\nCheck for part a: vouchers that end before li of voucher i.\n\nIn the sorted_by_end list of target_d, find the largest ri that is <= li-1. How? Since the list is sorted by ri, we can perform a binary search for li-1. The bisect module can help here.\n\nOnce we find the insertion point, say pos, then all elements before pos are <= li-1. If pos is 0, then no such vouchers. Else, the prefix_min[pos-1] is the minimum cost.\n\nThen, add this to the current voucher's cost (if any).\n\nFor part b: find vouchers in target_d that start after ri of voucher i. So their li must be >= ri + 1.\n\nIn the sorted_by_start list of target_d, which is sorted by li. We can perform a binary search for the first li that is >= (ri + 1). The bisect_left function gives the first index where this is true. Then, if this index is within the list, the suffix_min for that index gives the minimum cost in the sublist from that index to the end.\n\nSo for example, if the sorted_by_start list is [ (li1, ...), (li2, ...), ... ] sorted in increasing order, then after finding index, the suffix_min[index] is the min cost for vouchers starting at or after that index.\n\nSo combining these two possibilities for each voucher, and then taking the minimum between all possible pairs.\n\nBut wait, for each voucher, we have to consider both possibilities (a and b). Also, note that the voucher j can't be the same as voucher i. However, since the problem says i != j, but in our approach, when we process voucher i, we are looking for j in the target_d group. However, if the target_d is same as d (i.e., x = 2d), then the voucher i could be in the target_d group. But when we look for vouchers in the target_d group, we need to ensure that j is not the same as i. But how?\n\nWait, for example, suppose x=5 and a voucher has duration 2. Then target_d is 3. So no problem. But if x is even, say x=4, and a voucher has duration 2. Then target_d is 2. So when processing this voucher, we look for other vouchers in the same duration group. However, in that case, the code might select the same voucher if it's in the group. But since the problem requires two different vouchers, we need to make sure that when we look for j in the target_d group, we exclude the current voucher i if it's in that group.\n\nBut how can that happen? For example, when target_d is same as d (x=2d). So for a voucher i with duration d, when looking for j in the target_d group, which includes voucher i itself. So, when considering part a or part b, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nThis seems complicated. For example, if we have a voucher i, and during the processing, we check for vouchers in target_d (which may include voucher i itself). So, when we look for vouchers that end before li (voucher i's start), but voucher i's own end is ri. So if voucher i is in the target_d group, then when checking for part a, voucher i's end is ri. But li is the start of voucher i. So, for part a, we are looking for vouchers that end before li. But voucher i's end is ri, which is >= li (since ri >= li). So voucher i cannot be in the list of vouchers that end before li. Therefore, in that case, even if the target_d group contains voucher i, when processing part a, it's not included. Similarly for part b, voucher i's start is li, and we are looking for vouchers that start after ri (voucher i's end). So voucher i's start is li, which is <= ri. So again, voucher i is not in the list. Thus, even if the target_d group includes voucher i, when we check part a and part b, the current voucher i is not considered. Therefore, there's no need to worry about duplicates here. Because when we process voucher i, and check for j in target_d, the j's that are considered are those that are either before i (part a) or after i (part b). Therefore, even if the same voucher is in the target_d group, it's not included in the possible j's. Because for part a, j's end must be before i's start. But i's end is >= i's start. So j can't be i. Similarly for part b. Therefore, we don't have to worry about overlapping j and i. Therefore, the code can proceed without handling that case.\n\nThat's a relief. So no need to worry about that. So the approach is safe.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this.\n\nSo steps to code:\n\nFirst, process all vouchers, compute their duration. Then, group them by duration. For each duration, create two sorted lists:\n\nsorted_by_end: sorted by ri, then for each element, we have (ri, li, cost). Or maybe just store the li, ri, cost, but sorted by ri.\n\nThen, create a prefix_min array for this sorted list. The prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from 0 to i (inclusive).\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_by_start: sorted by li. Then, create a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original list, we can process it as follows:\n\nCompute d = ri - li + 1. Then target_d = x - d. If target_d is not present in the duration map, skip. Else, for the target_d group, check both possibilities (a and b).\n\nFor possibility a:\n\nWe need to find in the target_d's sorted_by_end list, the maximum ri that is <= li - 1 (since voucher j must end before voucher i starts). So, the voucher i's start is li. So j must end before li.\n\nSo, for the sorted_by_end list of target_d, we can perform a binary search for the value li - 1. The bisect_right function gives the insertion point. The number of elements before that is the count. If there are elements, then the prefix_min at (pos-1) gives the minimum cost.\n\nFor example, using the bisect module's bisect_right function on the list of end times (ri's). Let's say the list is sorted in ascending order. So for the list, we can extract the ri's and do a binary search.\n\nSimilarly, for possibility b: find in the target_d's sorted_by_start list, the first li that is >= (ri + 1). The voucher i's end is ri. So j must start after that. So the start of j must be >= ri + 1.\n\nIn the sorted_by_start list (sorted by li), we can use bisect_left to find the first index where li >= (ri + 1). Then, if that index is within the list, the suffix_min for that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we need to check both possibilities, and for each, if possible, add the current voucher's cost to the min found, and track the global minimum.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, grouping by duration. Let's create a dictionary, say duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are tuples of (sorted_by_end_list, prefix_min, sorted_by_start_list, suffix_min).\n\nBut for each duration, we need to generate the sorted_by_end list and sorted_by_start list, and compute their prefix and suffix mins.\n\nLet me think about how to generate these.\n\nFor example, for a group of vouchers with duration d:\n\nsorted_by_end is sorted by ri in ascending order. Then, for the prefix_min array, we can compute it as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = cost of first voucher.\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], cost of voucher at i).\n\nSimilarly for the sorted_by_start list, sorted by li in ascending order. The suffix_min array is computed from the end:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = cost of last voucher.\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], cost of voucher at i).\n\nSo, for each duration group, we need to process these.\n\nNow, in Python, for each group, we can process:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[1]) # since ri is the second element (assuming vouchers are stored as (li, ri, cost))?\n\nWait, the vouchers are given as li, ri, cost. So for each voucher, we can store as a tuple (li, ri, cost). Then, sorted_by_end is sorted by ri, so key=lambda x: x[1].\n\nOnce sorted_by_end is created, we can create the prefix_min array. Let's say the sorted_by_end list is called end_list. Then, prefix_min is a list of the same length as end_list. prefix_min[0] = end_list[0][2]. For i>0, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_list[i][2]).\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start, which is sorted by li. So sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0]). Then, the suffix_min array is computed from the end. For example, suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2] ), starting from the end.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher, we can check for the target_d.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read n lines of li, ri, cost. Compute duration for each voucher as (ri - li + 1).\n\nGroup all vouchers by duration into duration_dict.\n\nFor each duration in duration_dict, process the vouchers into sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that's done, initialize the answer as infinity.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d = duration of voucher.\n\n   target_d = x - d.\n\n   if target_d not in duration_dict, continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      process the target_d group.\n\n      For part a (find vouchers in target_d that end before li):\n\n         get the end_list and prefix_min array of target_d.\n\n         the li is the start of the current voucher.\n\n         we need to find the largest ri in end_list that is <= li - 1.\n\n         To do this, extract the list of end times (each voucher's ri) from end_list, and perform a bisect_right on li-1.\n\n         For example:\n\n         end_times = [v[1] for v in end_list]\n\n         pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li - 1)\n\n         if pos > 0:\n\n             min_cost_a = prefix_min[pos - 1]\n\n             total = current_voucher.cost + min_cost_a\n\n             update the answer if this is smaller.\n\n      For part b (find vouchers in target_d that start after ri):\n\n         get the start_list (sorted_by_start) and suffix_min array of target_d.\n\n         the ri is the end of the current voucher. So we need to find vouchers with li >= ri + 1.\n\n         So, extract the start_times = [v[0] for v in start_list]\n\n         pos = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri + 1)\n\n         if pos < len(start_list):\n\n             min_cost_b = suffix_min[pos]\n\n             total = current_voucher.cost + min_cost_b\n\n             update the answer if this is smaller.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if the answer is still infinity, output -1. Else, output the answer.\n\nBut how to handle the extraction of end_times and start_times for each target_d group?\n\nWell, during preprocessing, for each duration, we can precompute the end_times list and start_times list. Or, during the processing of part a and part b, we can generate them on the fly.\n\nBut generating them on the fly for each target_d group during the processing of each voucher may be expensive. However, considering that for each target_d group, the end_list is already sorted, so the end_times can be generated as [v[1] for v in end_list], but perhaps during preprocessing, we can store these lists as well.\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have:\n\nFor the sorted_by_end list, we can have a list of ri's, and for the sorted_by_start list, a list of li's.\n\nBut perhaps during the processing of part a and part b, we can generate these lists on the fly. For example, for part a, when we have the end_list, we can generate the list of ri's as [v[1] for v in end_list], and then perform the bisect.\n\nBut for large groups, this could be O(k) time where k is the number of vouchers in the group. However, since we are doing this for each voucher, and for each target_d group, this could add up to O(n) time overall. But perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during preprocessing, for each duration group, store the end_list as a list of ri's, and the sorted_by_start list as a list of li's.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to precompute these lists during the initial grouping.\n\nLet me think. For example, during the grouping phase, for each duration, we can have:\n\nsorted_end_list: list of (ri, li, cost) sorted by ri.\n\nend_times: list of ri's, sorted.\n\nprefix_min: list of min cost up to each index.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_start_list: list of (li, ri, cost) sorted by li.\n\nstart_times: list of li's, sorted.\n\nsuffix_min: list of min cost from index onwards.\n\nBut storing these may take more memory, but for Python, it's manageable.\n\nSo during the grouping phase:\n\nfor each duration d in duration_dict:\n\n   vouchers_in_d = list of vouchers with duration d.\n\n   sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n   end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\n   prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n\n   prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n\n   for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n\n       prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n\n   sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n   start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n\n   suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\n   for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n       suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2])\n\n   then, store in duration_dict[d] = (sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_start, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nBut this requires storing a lot of data. But for the purposes of the code, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut maybe we can optimize. For example, during the part a processing, when we have the sorted_end list, we can generate the end_times as [v[1] for v in sorted_end], but this is O(k) time for each group. However, during the initial grouping, we can precompute these lists once.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to generate them on the fly. For example, during part a, when we have the sorted_end list (which is a list of vouchers sorted by ri), we can generate the end_times as [v[1] for v in sorted_end], and then perform the bisect.\n\nBut for each voucher, during processing, when we access the target_d group, we need to generate end_times and start_times each time. However, this would be O(k) per access, which could be expensive if done multiple times. However, for the code's correctness, it's manageable.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps during the initial grouping, it's better to precompute the end_times and start_times lists.\n\nBut for the sake of code simplicity, perhaps during the processing of part a and part b, we can generate the end_times and start_times lists on the fly. However, for large groups, this could be O(k) per query, which may be too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps during the grouping phase, we can precompute these lists.\n\nSo, the code will have for each duration d in duration_dict, the following:\n\n- sorted_end: list of vouchers sorted by ri (so we can get the end times)\n\n- end_times: list of ri's for sorted_end.\n\n- prefix_min: list of prefix minima.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_start: list of vouchers sorted by li.\n\nstart_times: list of li's for sorted_start.\n\nsuffix_min: list of suffix minima.\n\nThus, during the processing of part a and part b, we can directly access the end_times and start_times lists.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read n vouchers. For each voucher, compute duration as (ri - li + 1). Store all vouchers in a list.\n\nThen, create a dictionary, say duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are tuples containing:\n\n(sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_start, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nNow, for each duration d in duration_dict, process as follows:\n\nvouchers_in_d = list of vouchers with duration d.\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[1])\n\nend_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\nprefix_min = compute as before.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher in the original list, process as follows:\n\ncurrent_voucher is (li, ri, cost), duration is d.\n\ntarget_d = x - d.\n\nif target_d not in duration_dict: continue.\n\nelse:\n\n   get the data for target_d: sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_start, start_times, suffix_min.\n\n   part a:\n\n      find the max ri in end_times that is <= li - 1.\n\n      using bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li - 1) gives pos.\n\n      if pos > 0:\n\n          min_a = prefix_min[pos-1]\n\n          current_total = current_voucher.cost + min_a\n\n          update the answer.\n\n   part b:\n\n      find the first li in start_times >= ri + 1.\n\n      using bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri + 1) gives pos.\n\n      if pos < len(start_times):\n\n          min_b = suffix_min[pos]\n\n          current_total = current_voucher.cost + min_b\n\n          update the answer.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these steps.\n\nNow, some edge cases:\n\nWhat if x is zero? Well, according to input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, the input says x is between 2 and 2e5. Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe input says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105)\n\nAh, so x is at least 2. So target_d can be zero? No. Because for a voucher, duration is ri - li + 1 >= 1. So target_d = x - d. Since x >= 2, and d can be 1, then target_d can be x - 1, which is at least 1. So target_d can't be zero. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when x is exactly 2, and each voucher has duration 1. Then, two vouchers with duration 1 each. But they need to be non-overlapping. So for each voucher, check if there's another voucher that ends before its start, or starts after its end.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nImplementing the duration_dict:\n\nWe can use a defaultdict to group vouchers by their duration.\n\nBut in Python, for each duration, we need to process the vouchers. So:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor each voucher in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nOnce that is done, for each duration in duration_dict, we process the data.\n\nBut in Python, we can't have a defaultdict that stores complex structures. So for each duration d, we need to process the vouchers and precompute the sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min, etc.\n\nSo, after grouping, we can create a new dictionary, say, processed_duration_dict, which maps each duration to the necessary data.\n\nBut for code brevity, perhaps during the grouping phase, we can process each duration and store the required data.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to process each voucher.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nBut for the code, the vouchers are stored as a list. So:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, group by duration:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, precompute for each duration in duration_dict:\n\nprocessed = {}\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    # process sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min\n\n    vouchers_in_d = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # sorted by ri\n\n    sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2] )\n\n    # sorted by li\n\n    sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2] )\n\n    # store in processed\n\n    processed[d] = (sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_start, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nOnce this is done, then for each voucher in vouchers:\n\nmin_total = infinity\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li + 1\n\n    target_d = x - d\n\n    if target_d not in processed:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the data for target_d\n\n    sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_start, start_times, suffix_min = processed[target_d]\n\n    # part a: find vouchers in target_d that end before li\n\n    # li is the start of current voucher\n\n    # end_times is list of ri's sorted in increasing order\n\n    # find the largest end_time <= li - 1\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li - 1)\n\n    if pos > 0:\n\n        current_min_a = prefix_min[pos-1]\n\n        total = cost + current_min_a\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\n    # part b: find vouchers in target_d that start after ri\n\n    # ri is the end of current voucher. Need start >= ri + 1\n\n    # start_times is list of li's sorted in increasing order\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri + 1)\n\n    if pos < len(start_times):\n\n        current_min_b = suffix_min[pos]\n\n        total = cost + current_min_b\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, check if min_total is still infinity. If yes, output -1 else output min_total.\n\nBut wait, what about when target_d is same as d? For example, when x is even, and d is x/2. Then, the target_d is same as d. But in this case, the code will check for vouchers in target_d (same as d) that end before li, or start after ri. Which is correct, because those are other vouchers in the same duration group that don't overlap with current voucher.\n\nBut what if there are multiple vouchers in the same duration group?\n\nYes, that's handled.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 0: (1,3,4) duration 3.\n\nvoucher 1: (1,2,5) duration 2.\n\nvoucher 2: (5,6,1) duration 2.\n\nvoucher 3: (1,2,4) duration 2.\n\nx is 5. So for each voucher, target_d is 5 - duration.\n\nFor voucher 0, duration is 3. target_d is 5-3=2. Which exists.\n\nSo, for voucher 0, li=1, ri=3, cost=4.\n\nCheck part a: find vouchers in target_d=2 that end before li=1. li-1=0. So end_times for target_d=2 is the list of ri's of vouchers with duration 2. The vouchers in target_d=2 are vouchers 1,2,3. Their ri's are 2,6,2. sorted_end for target_d=2 is sorted by ri. So sorted_end would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? Wait no, the vouchers are (li, ri, cost). For vouchers 1,2,3:\n\nvoucher 1: (1,2,5) ri=2.\n\nvoucher 3: (1,2,4) ri=2.\n\nvoucher 2: (5,6,1) ri=6.\n\nsorted by ri: the sorted_end list would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? No, because when sorted by ri, the first two have ri=2, then ri=6. So sorted_end is sorted by ri, so the order is vouchers with ri=2, then 6. But when ri is same, the order depends on the rest of the fields, but since we only sort by ri, the order between them may vary. However, for the prefix_min, it's okay as long as the end_times are sorted.\n\nIn this case, end_times would be [2, 2, 6]. So for part a, li-1 is 1-1=0. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0. So pos=0, which is not >0. So no contribution from part a.\n\nThen part b: find vouchers in target_d=2 that start after ri=3. ri+1=4. So start_times for target_d=2 is the sorted_start list, which is sorted by li. The vouchers in target_d=2 are:\n\nvoucher 1: li=1, voucher 3: li=1, voucher 2: li=5. sorted_start is sorted by li. So sorted_start is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. start_times is [1,1,5]. So we are looking for the first li >= 3+1=4. So bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) returns 2. Since 2 < 3 (len is 3), then suffix_min[2] is 1. So total is 4 + 1 = 5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo during processing voucher 0, part b gives 5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nOther vouchers may contribute as well, but the minimum is 5.\n\nAnother example: voucher 2 (5,6,1) has duration 2. target_d = 5-2=3. Are there any vouchers with duration 3? Yes, voucher 0. So for voucher 2, check target_d=3.\n\nFor part a: find vouchers with duration 3 that end before li=5. voucher 0's ri is 3. So end_times for duration 3 is [3]. li is 5, so li-1=4. bisect_right([3], 4) is 1. pos=1>0. prefix_min[0] is 4. total is 1 + 4=5. Which is same as before.\n\nSo this would also contribute 5.\n\nSo the code would find this and set the min_total to 5.\n\nThus, the code works for this case.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all this.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut there's a possible issue: when the target_d is same as d, and the current voucher is part of the group. But as discussed earlier, it's handled correctly.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when the target_d is zero? Well, since x >= 2, and duration is at least 1, target_d can't be zero. Because x - d >= 2 - (some d). For example, if x=2 and d=1, target_d is 1. So it's okay.\n\nNow, code.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nBut in Python, for the processed dictionary, we need to precompute for each duration.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n    \n    # Group by duration\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently finding pairs of vouchers that can potentially sum up to the required duration.\n2. **Preprocess for Efficient Lookup**: For each duration, we sort vouchers by their end time and start time. We also compute prefix minimums for end-sorted lists and suffix minimums for start-sorted lists. This allows us to quickly find the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Querying**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (i.e., `x - duration`). Using binary search, we efficiently determine if there are valid non-overlapping vouchers before or after the current voucher.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess each duration group\n    processed = {}\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_in_d = duration_dict[d]\n        \n        # Sort by end time (ri)\n        sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        # Compute prefix minima for end-sorted list\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n        prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n        \n        # Sort by start time (li)\n        sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        # Compute suffix minima for start-sorted list\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n        suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2])\n        \n        processed[d] = (sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_start, start_times, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        target_d = x - d\n        if target_d not in processed:\n            continue\n        \n        sorted_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_start, start_times, suffix_min = processed[target_d]\n        \n        # Part a: find vouchers in target_d that end before li\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li - 1)\n        if pos > 0:\n            current_min_a = prefix_min[pos - 1]\n            total = cost + current_min_a\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n        \n        # Part b: find vouchers in target_d that start after ri\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri + 1)\n        if pos < len(start_times):\n            current_min_b = suffix_min[pos]\n            total = cost + current_min_b\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick lookups when checking for complementary durations.\n- **Sorting and Preprocessing**: Each group of vouchers is sorted by their end and start times, with corresponding prefix and suffix minimum arrays computed to allow efficient range minimum queries.\n- **Binary Search**: For each voucher, binary search is used to find valid non-overlapping vouchers efficiently, ensuring the solution handles large inputs within acceptable time limits.",
