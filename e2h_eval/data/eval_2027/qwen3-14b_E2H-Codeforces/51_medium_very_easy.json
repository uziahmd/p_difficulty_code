Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input. The first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is: combine the guest and host names into one string, then check if the pile's letters are a permutation of that combined string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest+host string, and compare it with the frequency in the pile string. If they match exactly, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines. Let's call them guest, host, pile.\n2. Combine guest and host into a single string, say combined = guest + host.\n3. Check if the sorted combined string is equal to the sorted pile string. Because when sorted, if they are the same, then the pile is a permutation of the combined string.\n\nWait, that's a simple approach. For example, if combined is \"ABC\" and pile is \"CBA\", sorted both would be \"ABC\".\n\nYes. So the code can be as simple as:\n\nif sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the lengths are different? For example, if the combined length is 5 and the pile is 6 letters. Then the sorted lists would be different lengths, so the comparison would automatically return false. So that's handled.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nLet me test with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nLet me check the lengths. Let's see:\n\nGuest length: len(\"SANTACLAUS\") is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S) — wait, let me count:\n\nS(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), A(5), C(6), L(7), A(8), U(9), S(10). Yes, 10 letters.\n\nHost: DEDMOROZ. Let's count: D E D M O R O Z → 8 letters. So combined is 10+8=18 letters.\n\nPile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". Let me count letters here. Let's see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → Let me count each letter. But maybe the length is 18? Let me check:\n\nOriginal combined is guest + host: SANTACLAUS (10) + DEDMOROZ (8) → 18 letters. The pile must be 18 letters. Let me check the sample input's first case's pile. The third line is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". Let me count the letters here. Let me see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → that's 18 letters. So the sorted combined and sorted pile would be same. So the code would return YES.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nInput lines are:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let me count the letters. Let me check the lengths. Guest is len(\"PAPAINOEL\") = 9 letters. Host is \"JOULUPUKKI\" which is 10 letters. Combined length is 19. The pile is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\". Let me count the letters here. Let me see:\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile. Let me think: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's count letters. Let's see:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → Let me count the letters. Let me check the length. Let me count:\n\nJ (1), O(2), U(3), L(4), N(5), A(6), P(7), A(8), O(9), I(10), L(11), E(12), L(13), U(14), P(15), U(16), K(17), K(18), I(19). So 19 letters. But the combined is 9 + 10 = 19 letters. But according to the note, there's a missing P and an extra L. So when we compare sorted combined and sorted pile, they would differ. So the code would return NO.\n\nThird example: guest is BABBONATALE, host is FATHERCHRISTMAS. Combined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. Let me check the length. Let's see:\n\nBABBONATALE is 10 letters (B A B B O N A T A L E → 11 letters? Wait, let me count again. B A B B O N A T A L E → that's 11 letters. Wait, B (1), A (2), B (3), B (4), O (5), N (6), A (7), T (8), A (9), L (10), E (11). So 11 letters. Host is FATHERCHRISTMAS: F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → let's count letters. F (1), A (2), T (3), H (4), E (5), R (6), C (7), H (8), R (9), I (10), S (11), T (12), M (13), A (14), S (15). So 15 letters. Combined length is 11+15=26. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters here. Let me check the length. Let me see:\n\nThe third line is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\". Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → Let me count. Well, perhaps the length is longer than 26. Let me check:\n\nOriginal combined is 26 letters. The pile is supposed to have an extra L. So the length would be 27. So when sorted, the lengths would be different, so the code would return NO.\n\nSo the code approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nRead three lines. But how? The input is three lines. So in Python, perhaps read via input().strip() three times. But sometimes, when reading from standard input, you have to be careful about trailing newlines, but in programming competition problems, each line is given properly.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead guest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n\nThen check if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile). If yes, print YES else NO.\n\nThat's the code.\n\nBut let me test for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All empty? But according to the problem statement, all lines are not empty. So no problem.\n\nEdge case 2: All same letters. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. If pile is \"BA\" → same.\n\nIf pile is \"AAB\", then sorted combined is [\"A\", \"B\"], sorted pile is [\"A\", \"A\", \"B\"], so lengths differ. So returns NO.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, the sample input given in the problem is a list of three test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nThe input is given as three lines, but the sample input shows something like:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, the actual input for the problem is three lines per test case. Wait, the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. But the sample shows three test cases, each with three lines. So the code needs to process each test case.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code should read three lines from stdin. But in the sample input, there are three test cases, each consisting of three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or is the sample input just a way to show multiple examples?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three lines. The output is one line (YES or NO). The sample shows three input examples and their outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how?\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the input is three lines. So the code reads three lines, processes them once, and outputs one line. The sample input shows three different test cases, each with three lines, and their corresponding outputs. So the code should process one test case, but the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as three lines, but the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as a list of three test cases, each with three lines. The sample output is a list of three answers. But in reality, the code is supposed to read three lines from input (for one test case) and output one line. So perhaps the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but in practice, the code should read three lines from the input, process them, and output one line.\n\nBut how does that fit with the sample input given? For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWhich is three test cases. But the code is supposed to read three lines, which would be one test case. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is presented as three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code is supposed to read three lines, process them once, and output YES or NO.\n\nSo the code is written for one test case. So the sample input shows three test cases, but the code is supposed to process each test case individually. But how is the input given? For example, in programming competition, the code would read from stdin, which for each test case would have three lines. But perhaps the sample input is written as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. Therefore, the code should read three lines, process them once, and output one line.\n\nTherefore, the code is as follows:\n\nRead three lines, guest, host, pile. Then check if sorted(guest + host) equals sorted(pile). Output YES or NO accordingly.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead guest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen check if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile). Print YES or NO.\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nguest + host is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → let's check the combined letters. The pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nWhen sorted, they should be same.\n\nSample output is YES.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nguest is 'PAPAINOEL', host is 'JOULUPUKKI', pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n\nCombined is 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI' → sorted. The pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' → sorted. Let's see:\n\nIn the combined, the letters are:\n\nP, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L, J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nWait, perhaps the count of P is 3? Let me see:\n\nguest is PAPAINOEL → letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → 9 letters. Host is JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → 10 letters. So combined has:\n\nP: 2 (from guest) + 1 (from host) = 3?\n\nYes. In the pile, the third line is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me check the letters. Let me count the P's in the pile. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Breaking it down:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nWait, how many P's? There's a P in 'NAP' part, and another P in 'P...' ?\n\nWait, the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me split into letters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nSo P appears twice. So the combined has 3 P's, but the pile has 2. Hence, the sorted lists would differ, hence output is NO.\n\nSo the code would return NO.\n\nThird test case: guest is BABBONATALE, host is FATHERCHRISTMAS. Combined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. Let me count the letters. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me check the letters. The combined has certain letters, but the pile has an extra L. So when sorted, the pile's length is longer than combined's. So code returns NO.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead three lines. Then check sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile).\n\nSo code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nif sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's the code.\n\nBut wait, what about leading or trailing spaces? The problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So the .strip() is unnecessary? Because input().strip() would remove leading/trailing whitespace. But according to the problem statement, the input lines don't have any leading or trailing whitespace. So perhaps using input().strip() is redundant, but safe. However, in programming competition, sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, the input lines are correct. So perhaps using input().strip() is not needed. But better to use it to avoid any issues.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input lines are not empty and consist of uppercase letters only. So there are no leading or trailing spaces. So input().strip() is not necessary. However, in Python, input() includes the newline character? No. The input() function reads a line from input, including the trailing newline, but the .strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace, including the newline. However, if the input line is correct, then the newline is stripped. But perhaps the problem's input lines are given correctly. So for example, if the input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThen, input().strip() for each line would get the correct strings. But if the input lines have leading or trailing spaces, which the problem says they don't, then the code would be wrong. But according to the problem statement, the input lines are correct. Therefore, perhaps using input().strip() is not needed. However, perhaps the code should read the lines as input().strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespaces, even if the problem says they are not present. Because in practice, sometimes there might be trailing newlines, but the problem says that the lines are correct.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is three lines. So for example, the first line is the guest's name, which is a string of uppercase letters. So using input().strip() is safe.\n\nBut perhaps, for example, if the input is read as input().strip(), then in the case where the input line is empty, but the problem says that all lines are non-empty. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names of the guest and host, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read three lines from the input, which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combined String**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Character Comparison**: Check if the sorted characters of the combined string match the sorted characters of the pile. If they do, the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names; otherwise, it cannot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\nif sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, ensuring that any leading or trailing whitespace is stripped off using `strip()`.\n- **Combining Strings**: By concatenating the guest and host names, we form a single string that represents all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Sorting and Comparing**: Sorting both the combined string and the pile allows us to directly compare if they contain the same characters in the same frequencies. If the sorted versions of both strings are identical, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact character match using sorting, which ensures that the solution is both simple and effective, adhering to the constraints provided.",
