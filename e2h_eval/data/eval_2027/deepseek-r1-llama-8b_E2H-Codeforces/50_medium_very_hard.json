    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting something over a certain set of trees. The trees are edge-weighted with each edge being either 1 or -1. We need to find the sum of d(1,n) for all \"good\" trees.\n\nWait, what's a good tree? Oh right, a good tree is one where for every vertex i, the product of the edge weights adjacent to it is -1. So for each node, the number of -1 edges connected to it must be odd because the product is -1. Because each edge contributes a factor of either 1 or -1. If the product is -1, that means there's an odd number of -1s around the node.\n\nHmm, okay. So each node must have an odd number of -1 edges attached to it.\n\nI remember that in graph theory, trees are connected and have exactly n-1 edges. So for each node in the tree, the degree is at least 1, but here we're talking about the edges' weights, not their existence.\n\nSo the first thing I need to figure out is: under what conditions does a tree become \"good\"? And then, for all such good trees, calculate the sum of d(1,n), which is the sum of the edge weights along the unique path from node 1 to node n.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nEach edge is either 1 or -1. So each edge contributes either +1 or -1 to the path sum. The path from 1 to n is unique because it's a tree.\n\nNow, for each node i (including 1 and n), the product of the edges connected to it is -1. So for each node, the number of edges with weight -1 connected to it is odd.\n\nWait, because (-1)^k = product of k edges, and we want this product to be -1. So k must be odd.\n\nSo, for every node, the number of -1 edges incident to it is odd.\n\nThis seems like a parity condition on each node's edges.\n\nNow, considering the entire tree, perhaps this imposes some structure on the tree. Like, maybe it's a bipartition or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, since each node has an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps the tree is a certain type, maybe a star or something else.\n\nBut wait, maybe we can model this as a system of equations. Each node gives an equation about the sum (mod 2) of the edges incident to it. But since the edges are shared between nodes, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let's model each edge as a variable x_e, which is either 0 (if the edge is 1) or 1 (if it's -1). Then, for each node i, the sum of x_e for all edges e incident to i must be congruent to 1 mod 2. Because the product of x_e is -1, which is equivalent to the sum being 1 mod 2 (since (-1)^k = 1 if k even, -1 if k odd).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all possible assignments of x_e (each x_e is 0 or 1) such that for every node i, the sum of x_e for edges e incident to i is 1 mod 2.\n\nBut each tree is a spanning tree, so it has exactly n-1 edges. Wait, no, in the problem statement, it's an edge-weighted tree, meaning that the underlying tree structure is fixed, and the edges have weights. So each good tree is a tree structure (like a specific set of edges) plus the edge weights assigned as 1 or -1, such that each node has an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nWait no, the problem says that all possible edge-weighted trees are considered. So the tree structures themselves are counted as distinct if their edge sets differ, regardless of the weights. Or wait, according to the note, two trees are distinct if they differ in either the edge presence (i.e., different edges exist between them) or the edge weights differ.\n\nWait, the note says: two trees are distinct if either there's an edge in one that's not in the other, or if both have the same edges but different weights.\n\nSo when considering the count, the total number is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}, which is Cayley's formula times 2^{n-1}.\n\nSo each tree is a pair of (structure, edge weights). The structure is a spanning tree on n nodes, and the edge weights are assigned.\n\nSo for each such tree, we need to check if it's good. A tree is good if for every node, the number of edges incident to it with weight -1 is odd.\n\nSo, given that, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each edge is a variable, and each node imposes a condition on the sum of the variables (edges) connected to it. The constraints are that each such sum is 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, but the edges are connected to two nodes each, except for leaves, which are connected to only one edge.\n\nBut each edge variable appears in exactly two equations (for its two endpoints). So the system is a system of n equations (one per node) with n-1 variables (edges). But n can be up to 5e5, so standard Gaussian elimination isn't feasible. So there must be some pattern or property that can be exploited.\n\nLet me consider the sum of all equations. Each edge x_e is included in exactly two equations (for its two endpoints). So the sum of all left-hand sides is equal to twice the sum of all x_e, which is 0 mod 2. The sum of all right-hand sides is n mod 2 (since each equation requires the sum to be 1 mod 2, and there are n equations). So:\n\nSum of LHS: 2 * sum(x_e) ≡ 0 mod 2.\n\nSum of RHS: n * 1 ≡ n mod 2.\n\nSo 0 ≡ n mod 2. Which implies that n must be even for the system to be solvable. Because otherwise, 0 ≡ 1 mod 2 is impossible.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So if n is odd, then the system has no solution. That means, for n odd, there are zero good trees. So the answer would be zero in such cases.\n\nBut wait, for n=1, the condition is trivially satisfied because there are no edges. So d(1,1) is zero, and the sum is zero.\n\nSo, for n=2: the tree is just a single edge. The condition for node 1: the edge must be -1 (so that the product is -1). Similarly for node 2: the edge must be -1. So both conditions require the edge to be -1. So the sum is -1 for the path from 1 to 2. So the output is -1 mod MOD, which is 998244352.\n\nBut back to the general case. For n even, the system is solvable. So let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo when n is even, the system has solutions. How many?\n\nWait, the number of solutions depends on the rank of the system. Since the sum of all equations is 0 ≡ n mod 2, which for n even is 0≡0, so it's consistent.\n\nSo the system has a solution space of dimension (n-1) - r, where r is the rank of the matrix. Hmm, but how to compute the rank?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system is always consistent and has exactly 2^{n-2} solutions when n is even. Or perhaps another exponent.\n\nWait, let's think about small n.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nWe have two equations, one for each node. Each equation requires the single edge to be 1 mod 2 (since 1 is -1, which is 1 mod 2). So the edge x is 1. So there's exactly one solution. So the number of good trees is 1. Which is 2^{n-1} / 2^something? Not sure.\n\nWait, for n=2, the number of possible trees is 2^{n-1} = 2, since each tree is a single edge. But only those trees where the edge is -1 satisfy the condition. So for n=2, the count is 1.\n\nSo 2^{n-1} is 2, but the number of good trees is 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the number of good trees is 2^{(n-1)(n-2)/2}? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the number of good trees is 2^{(n/2 -1)} or something similar. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of good trees is 2^{(n-2)}, but for n=2, that's 1, which fits. For n=4, perhaps 2^{2}=4.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nEach edge is a variable x_e, 0 or 1. The conditions are that for each node, the sum of x_e's around it is 1 mod 2.\n\nSo the system is a set of n equations with n-1 variables. It's a homogeneous system if we subtract 1 from each equation.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase: for each node i, sum_{e∋i} x_e ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nSo the system is:\n\nA x = b,\n\nwhere A is the incidence matrix, and b is the vector of all 1's.\n\nThe incidence matrix of a tree has rank n-1. So the system has a solution iff b is in the column space of A.\n\nIn our case, b is a vector of all ones. So whether this is in the column space depends on the properties of the tree.\n\nWait, but for any tree, the incidence matrix has rank n-1. So the system will have a solution if and only if the sum of the rows of A multiplied by the vector of all ones equals the sum of the entries in b modulo 2.\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting too abstract. Maybe we can find that the number of solutions is 2^{k}, where k is the dimension of the null space of A - b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is 2^{c}, where c is the number of connected components in the bipartition induced by the system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when n is even, the system has exactly 2^{n-2} solutions. Because for n=2, it's 1 = 2^0, which is 2^{2-2}.\n\nWait, for n=4, would it be 2^{4-2}=4 solutions? Let's see.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of n=4.\n\nConsider a star-shaped tree with center at node 1. So edges are between 1-2, 1-3, 1-4. Each edge is x_1, x_2, x_3.\n\nThe conditions are:\n\nFor node 1: x1 + x2 + x3 ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nFor nodes 2,3,4: x_i ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nSo solving this:\n\nx2 = 1, x3 = 1, x4 = 1.\n\nThen, x1 = 1 - x2 -x3 -x4 mod 2.\n\nWait, no, the equation for node 1 is x1 + x2 + x3 ≡1.\n\nSo substituting x2=1, x3=1, x4=1, we get x1 + 1 +1 =1 → x1 =1 -2 → x1= -1 ≡1 mod 2.\n\nSo x1 is 1, x2=1, x3=1, x4=1.\n\nSo in this case, the solution is unique. So the number of good trees for this structure is 1.\n\nBut wait, the edge weights are fixed. So for this particular structure, there is only one way to assign the weights to make it good.\n\nBut the question counts all possible trees, each with their own edge assignments.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the number of possible trees is 4^{2} * 2^{3} =16*8=128. But the good trees are those that satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, Cayley's formula is for labeled trees, which is n^{n-2}. So for n=4, it's 16 trees. Each tree can have 2^{3} edge weight assignments. So total is 16*8=128.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the sum over all good trees of d(1,4). So for each tree, determine if it's good, and if so, add d(1,4) to the sum.\n\nSo, how do we model the sum?\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of enumerating all possible trees and checking each, which is impossible for large n, perhaps find a mathematical pattern or formula that can be computed efficiently.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's think about the sum S(n) we need to compute. S(n) is the sum of d(1,n) across all good trees.\n\nd(1,n) is the sum of edge weights along the path from 1 to n.\n\nEach edge in the path contributes either +1 or -1. So d(1,n) is the sum of the x_e's along the path, where x_e is 1 if the edge is -1, and 0 otherwise. Because x_e is 1 when the edge is -1.\n\nWait, no. Because x_e is 1 when the edge is -1. So the contribution to d(1,n) is x_e. So d(1,n) is the sum of x_e's along the path from 1 to n.\n\nSo the sum S(n) is the sum over all good trees T of (sum_{e on path(1,n)} x_e(T)).\n\nWe can exchange the order of summation: S(n) = sum_{e} x_e * (number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n and the tree is good).\n\nSo, for each edge e, we compute how many good trees have e on the path from 1 to n, and then multiply by x_e (which is either 0 or 1). But since x_e is part of the variables, perhaps we can model this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nFor each edge e, let’s denote by C(e) the number of good trees where e is present in the tree (as part of the structure) and lies on the path from 1 to n, and the edge's weight is -1.\n\nThen, the sum S(n) is the sum over all edges e of C(e).\n\nBecause for each edge e, in how many good trees is e on the path and its weight is -1. Each such occurrence contributes 1 to the sum.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n and is assigned weight -1.\n\nBut how to compute C(e) for each edge e.\n\nWait, but edges in a tree are part of the structure. So perhaps for each possible edge e in any tree, we can compute how often it's on the path from 1 to n and is assigned -1 in a good tree.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: Since each good tree must satisfy the condition on the edges, perhaps the assignment of the edge weights is determined uniquely once the tree structure is fixed. Or perhaps the assignment is constrained in a certain way.\n\nWait, for a fixed tree T, how many edge weight assignments result in T being a good tree?\n\nIf the tree is fixed, then the conditions are that for each node i, the sum of the edge weights (as x_e variables) is 1 mod 2.\n\nBut each edge is a variable. So for a fixed T, the number of valid assignments is 2^{k}, where k is the number of free variables after satisfying the constraints.\n\nWait, but for a fixed tree T, the system of equations may have dependencies. For example, earlier we saw that the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, which is consistent when n is even.\n\nSo for a fixed tree T, the number of valid assignments is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1 - r)} }, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the incidence matrix has rank n-1, and the system is A x = b, where b is all 1's, the solution space is the set of x's such that x = x0 + t * v, where v is in the null space of (A | b).\n\nWait, perhaps the solution space has dimension 1 when n is even, leading to 2 solutions.\n\nWait, for n=2, the system has one solution, so 2^1=2? No, for n=2, the solution is unique, so 1=2^0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the number of solutions for a fixed tree is 2^{(n-2)}. Because for n=2, it's 1=2^0, which fits.\n\nWait, for n=4, perhaps each fixed tree has 2^{(4-2)}=4 solutions.\n\nBut that's unclear. Let me think again.\n\nEach fixed tree T has a certain number of edge assignments that make it good. For n even, the system is consistent, so the solution space has a certain dimension.\n\nSince the system has n equations and n-1 variables, the maximum rank is n-1. So the solution space is non-empty only if the system is consistent, which for n even, it is.\n\nThe number of solutions is 2^{d}, where d is the dimension of the null space.\n\nThe null space is the set of vectors x such that A x = 0. But our system is A x = b, so the solution is x = x_p + x_h, where x_p is a particular solution and x_h is in the null space of A.\n\nSo the number of solutions is equal to the size of the null space of A, which is 2^{(n-1 - rank(A))} }.\n\nBut the rank of A is n-1, so the null space has dimension 1. So the number of solutions is 2^1=2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for any tree T where n is even, the number of valid edge assignments is exactly 2.\n\nSo, for each tree T, if n is even, it contributes 2 edge assignments that make it good. Otherwise, it contributes 0.\n\nSo, now the problem becomes: compute the sum over all trees T of [sum_{e on path(1,n)} x_e] * 2, but only when n is even. Because each good tree contributes 2 assignments, each with a certain value of d(1,n).\n\nWait, no. Because each tree T can have multiple edge assignments. For each such assignment, the d(1,n) is the sum of x_e on the path. So the total contribution of T to the sum is 2 * (average d(1,n) across the two assignments).\n\nWait, no, because for each T, each of the two possible assignments could have different d(1,n) values. So the sum for T is the sum of d(1,n) over both assignments.\n\nSo for each T, the sum is (d1 + d2), where d1 and d2 are the two possible d(1,n) values.\n\nSo the overall sum S(n) is the sum over all T of (d1 + d2).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, for each tree T, if n is even, it contributes (d1 + d2) to the sum, where d1 and d2 are the d(1,n) values of the two valid edge assignments.\n\nBut perhaps for all trees T, the sum (d1 + d2) is equal to the number of edges on the path from 1 to n in T multiplied by 2.\n\nWait, because for each edge e on the path, x_e can be either 0 or 1, depending on the assignment. So for the two assignments, the sum of x_e's is the sum of the two possibilities.\n\nWait, no, because x_e can be either 0 or 1 in the two solutions. So for each e on the path, the sum of x_e across the two solutions is the number of times x_e is 1 in the two solutions.\n\nBut since the two solutions are distinct, for each e on the path, x_e can be 0 in one solution and 1 in the other, or 1 in both.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let's think: for each e on the path, the two solutions may have x_e as 0 and 1, or both 1, or both 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e on the path, the sum of x_e over the two solutions is equal to 1. Because in the two solutions, exactly one of them has x_e =1.\n\nWait, because for the two solutions, x_e can be either 0 or 1, but they must satisfy the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each e on the path, the sum of x_e across the two solutions is 1.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Let me think for n=2.\n\nIn n=2, the path has one edge. The two solutions are both with x_e=1. So sum is 1+1=2.\n\nWait, but in this case, for n=2, the sum is 2*1=2, which is 2*(sum x_e). So the average is 1 per solution.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem statement, for n=2, the sum is -1 mod MOD, which is 998244352.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the x_e variables and the actual weight.\n\nWait, the x_e is 1 if the edge is -1, and 0 otherwise.\n\nSo d(1,n) is the sum of x_e on the path.\n\nSo for each edge e on the path, each solution contributes x_e (0 or 1). So for each e, across the two solutions, the sum is the number of times e is assigned -1.\n\nSo for each e on the path, in the two solutions, how many times is x_e=1?\n\nIf the two solutions differ in exactly one edge on the path, then for each e on the path, exactly one solution has x_e=1 and the other has x_e=0. So the sum across the two solutions is 1 for each e.\n\nIf the two solutions have the same x_e for all edges on the path, then for each e, both solutions contribute x_e, so the sum is 2x_e.\n\nBut in that case, the two solutions would have the same d(1,n), which would imply that the two assignments are the same, which is not possible unless the system has only one solution.\n\nWait, but for n even, the system has two solutions. So in the case where all edges on the path have x_e=1 in both solutions, that's possible only if the system has a unique solution. But earlier analysis said that for n even, the system has exactly two solutions.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nSuppose that for each tree T, the two solutions for the edge assignments have d(1,n) equal to k and l. Then, the sum for T is k + l.\n\nBut perhaps for each T, the sum k + l is equal to the number of edges on the path times 1.\n\nBecause for each edge e on the path, exactly one of the two solutions assigns x_e=1. So the sum of x_e across the two solutions is 1 for each e on the path. So the total sum is (number of edges on the path) * 1.\n\nThus, for each T, the sum of d(1,n) across the two solutions is equal to the length of the path from 1 to n in T.\n\nSo S(n) = sum_{T is good} len(path(1,n)).\n\nWait, but len(path(1,n)) is the number of edges on the path, which is (depth of n in T) perhaps? Or more accurately, it's the number of edges in the path, which is (distance between 1 and n in T, which is the number of edges).\n\nWait, no, the distance is the number of edges on the path. So yes, len is the number of edges.\n\nSo, if this holds, then S(n) = sum over all good trees T of the number of edges on the path from 1 to n in T.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating this sum.\n\nNow, the question is: what is the sum of the path lengths (in terms of edges) from 1 to n over all good trees T.\n\nSo, for each tree T, if it's good, add the number of edges on the path from 1 to n to the sum.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nBut wait, for each tree T, the path from 1 to n is unique. So the sum S(n) is the sum of the path lengths across all good trees.\n\nSo, the key is to compute the sum of the path lengths in all good trees.\n\nNow, the problem becomes: for all good trees, sum the number of edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the good trees.\n\nEarlier, we found that for n even, each good tree T has exactly two edge assignments that make it good. And for each T, the sum of d(1,n) across the two assignments is equal to the length of the path in T.\n\nSo, for each good tree T, the contribution to S(n) is len(path(T)).\n\nSo, S(n) is the sum of len(path(T)) for all good trees T.\n\nSo, S(n) = sum_{T is good} len(path(T)).\n\nSo, the task is to find this sum.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting, for all good trees, the sum of the path lengths from 1 to n.\n\nNow, how to compute this.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of the good trees.\n\nGiven that each node has an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps the tree must form a certain kind of structure. Maybe it's a chain with certain properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree is a caterpillar tree or some other specific structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the good trees are exactly the trees where the path from 1 to n is a central path, and other edges form a star around it.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the good trees are exactly those trees where the path from 1 to n is a straight line (i.e., the tree is a straight chain), and all other edges form a star around this path. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the good trees form a bipartite structure.\n\nWait, but for n=4, earlier analysis shows that for each tree, there are two possible assignments, but each contributes a certain path length. But perhaps the sum can be computed combinatorially.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be expressed in terms of the number of trees, multiplied by the expected path length, multiplied by 2 (since each tree contributes two assignments, but the sum is the same as the path length). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is equal to 2^{n-2} * (n-1) * (n-2)^{n-3} }, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n in a random good tree is proportional to something.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sum over all good trees of the path length is equal to the sum over all edges e of the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the number of times e is part of the path in those trees.\n\nWait, no. Because each tree contributes exactly one path, so each edge is either on the path or not.\n\nSo, for each edge e, let f(e) be the number of good trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nThen, S(n) is the sum over all edges e of f(e).\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because for each tree T, the path may include multiple edges, and each edge is counted in S(n) for that tree.\n\nSo, S(n) is equal to the sum over all trees T of the number of edges on the path from 1 to n in T, for T being a good tree.\n\nBut this can also be represented as the sum over all edges e of the number of good trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n in T.\n\nSo, S(n) = sum_{e} f(e), where f(e) is the number of good trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nSo, the problem now is to compute f(e) for each edge e.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach edge e connects two nodes u and v. To be on the path from 1 to n, e must lie on some path from 1 to n.\n\nBut in a tree, any two nodes have exactly one path connecting them.\n\nSo, for an edge e=(u, v), it lies on the path from 1 to n if and only if the subtree rooted at u (when e is considered as separating the tree into two parts) contains n, or vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps for edge e=(u, v), if in the tree T, the component containing u when e is removed contains n, then e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nWait, no. Because in a tree, removing e splits the tree into two components. So, for e to be on the path from 1 to n, one component must contain 1 and the other must contain n. Or wait, no. Because the path from 1 to n must pass through e.\n\nSo, for edge e=(u, v), e is on the path from 1 to n if and only if 1 and n are in different components when e is removed.\n\nSo, for a given tree T, the edge e is on the path from 1 to n iff the two subtrees separated by e contain 1 and n, respectively, or vice versa.\n\nSo, for each edge e=(u, v), the number of good trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of good trees T where 1 is in one subtree of e and n is in the other.\n\nSo, f(e) is the number of good trees T where 1 and n are in different components when e is removed.\n\nSo, how to compute f(e).\n\nEach edge e is part of many trees. For each tree T that includes e, and where e is on the path from 1 to n, we count it.\n\nSo, for each edge e, we can compute the number of good trees T that include e and where 1 and n are in different components when e is removed.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for each edge e=(u, v), the number of good trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of good trees T where e is present, and in T, 1 is in one side of e and n is in the other.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the number of such trees is equal to the number of ways to split the tree into two parts, one containing 1 and the other containing n, multiplied by the number of valid edge assignments that satisfy the good tree conditions.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path is equal to the product of the number of ways to choose the subtree sizes and the number of valid edge assignments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path is equal to 2^{n-2} multiplied by the probability that e is on the path.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the sum S(n) can be expressed in terms of the number of good trees multiplied by the average path length.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think for small n.\n\nCase n=2:\n\nOnly one good tree. The path has 1 edge. So S(2) =1.\n\nWhich matches the sample input.\n\nCase n=4:\n\nThe sample says that there are 16 good trees (but wait, according to the note, for n=4, the number of good trees is 16. So S(4) = sum of path lengths across all 16 trees.\n\nEach tree's path length is added once.\n\nWait, no, for each tree, the two edge assignments contribute their path lengths. So for each tree, the sum is len(path) + len(path') where path' is the same path, but with edge assignments swapped.\n\nWait, no, because the two edge assignments are different, but the path is the same. So for each tree, the sum is len(path) * 2.\n\nBecause for each edge e on the path, in each of the two assignments, x_e can be 0 or 1, but the sum across the two assignments is 1 for each e. So the total sum for the tree is len(path).\n\nWait, earlier conclusion was that for each tree, the sum across the two edge assignments is len(path). So S(n) is the sum of len(path) for each good tree.\n\nSo for n=4, the sample says that the sum is -10 mod 998244353, which is 998244343.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, the sample says that for n=4, there are 16 good trees. Each contributes d(1,4) which can be -2, -1, 0, or 1. The sum is 2*(-2)+8*(-1)+4*0 + 2*(1) = -10.\n\nBut according to our current understanding, for each tree, the two edge assignments contribute len(path) * 1 each, so the sum is len(path). So for each tree, the sum of d(1,4) is len(path). So the total sum S(n) would be the sum of len(path) across all 16 trees.\n\nBut the sample's sum is -10, which is the sum of d(1,4) across all 16 trees.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, each tree contributes a certain d(1,4), which is the sum of x_e on the path. So the sum over all trees is the sum of d(1,4) for each tree.\n\nBut for each tree, there are two edge assignments. So each tree contributes two values of d(1,4). So the total sum is the sum of d(1,4) for all 32 edge assignments across all 16 trees.\n\nBut the sample says that for n=4, the sum is -10. Which is the sum of d(1,4) for all 16 trees, each contributing their two edge assignments. So, for each tree, the sum is len(path) (since each edge on the path is summed once across the two assignments).\n\nSo, the total sum is sum_{T} len(path(T)).\n\nWhich is the same as S(n) = sum_{T} len(path(T)).\n\nSo, for n=4, the sum is the sum of len(path) across all 16 trees.\n\nBut the sample shows that the sum is -10, which is 2*(-2)+8*(-1)+4*0+2*1=-10.\n\nSo, perhaps each tree contributes len(path) as the sum of the two d(1,4) values.\n\nWait, but in the sample, for each tree, the sum of d(1,4) across the two edge assignments is len(path). So for 16 trees, the sum is 16 * len(path).\n\nBut the sample shows the sum is -10.\n\nSo, for n=4, the sum is -10.\n\nBut according to my earlier reasoning, the sum is sum_{T} len(path(T)), which for n=4 is 16 * average len(path(T)).\n\nBut the sample's sum is -10.\n\nHmm, perhaps the len(path(T)) varies per tree. So the sum is the sum of len(path(T)) for all 16 trees, each contributing len(path(T)).\n\nSo, for each tree T, len(path(T)) is added to the sum.\n\nSo, for n=4, the sum is 16 * len(path(T)) for some trees, but the sample says it's -10.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, the sample for n=4 says:\n\nThere are 16 good trees.\n\nEach tree's d(1,4) can be -2, -1, 0, or 1.\n\nThe sum is 2*(-2) + 8*(-1) +4*0 +2*(1) = -4 -8 +0 +2 =-10.\n\nSo, the sum is -10.\n\nSo, for each tree, the sum of the two edge assignments' d(1,4) is len(path(T)).\n\nSo, for each tree, the two edge assignments contribute a total of len(path(T)).\n\nSo, the total sum is sum(len(path(T))) for all 16 trees.\n\nWhich for n=4 is 16 trees, each contributing len(path(T)).\n\nBut the sample sum is -10.\n\nSo, sum(len(path(T))) = -10.\n\nSo, how much is the average len(path(T))?\n\n-10 /16 = -5/8.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps for each tree T, the len(path(T)) is the number of edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\nNow, for each tree T, the number of edges on the path is equal to the depth of n minus 1, assuming 1 is the root.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed in terms of the number of edges in the tree and their positions.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the problem is difficult, perhaps look for a pattern in the sample outputs.\n\nSample Input: ['2', '1',",
