    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How do we calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nEach ring is the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter in terms of cells would be 2*(width + height) - 4. Because for a rectangle with width W and height H, the perimeter (number of cells) is 2W + 2H -4. Because the corners are counted twice when adding the four sides, so we subtract 4.\n\nFor example, a 3x3 square has perimeter 3*2 + 3*2 -4 = 6+6-4=8, which matches the first sample input.\n\nSo for each ring i, from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle at that stage, and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, what if the current width or height is less than 2? Then the ring can't exist. Because each ring requires at least a 3x3 area to form a proper ring. Wait, no. Because for the first ring, it's the outermost edge. For the second ring, the inner rectangle must be at least 3x3, but the initial plate can be larger. Wait, no: after the first ring, the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). So for the second ring to exist, w-4 must be >= 3, and h-4 must be >=3. Because otherwise, the inner rectangle is too small to have another ring.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's see the constraints in the input. The input says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So it's guaranteed that the rings can be formed as per the problem statement.\n\nSo, for each ring i, the current width is w_i = w - 4*(i-1), and height h_i = h -4*(i-1). And for each such ring, the perimeter is 2*(w_i + h_i) -4.\n\nSo the total number of cells is the sum of perimeters for each ring from 1 to k.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - Compute w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   - Compute h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n   - Compute perimeter = 2*(w_i + h_i) -4\n   - Add this to the total sum.\n\nSo the steps are straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 3 3 1\n\nw_i = 3, h_i =3.\n\nPerimeter = 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example:\n\n7 9 1.\n\nw_i=7, h_i=9.\n\nPerimeter: 2*(7+9)-4= 32-4=28. Output is 28.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2.\n\nRing 1: 7x9 → 2*(16)-4=32-4=28.\n\nRing 2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 3x5 → perimeter is 2*(8) -4=16-4=12.\n\nTotal is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: What if k is such that w_i or h_i becomes 0 or negative? But according to the problem statement, the input ensures that k is within the allowed range, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo now, the plan is to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of successively smaller rectangles inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells on each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is determined by the perimeter of the current rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h) - 4`, which accounts for the corners being counted twice.\n3. **Summing Up**: We sum the perimeters of all `k` rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle after accounting for the reduction due to previous rings.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each current dimension, compute the perimeter and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that all edge cases are handled within the constraints provided.",
