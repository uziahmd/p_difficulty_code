    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, z. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem says that x, y, z are the sides of a triangle, and they must satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x, y, z are in order (x ≤ y ≤ z), the key condition is x + y > z. Because if that holds, then the other conditions (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically hold because z is the largest.\n\nHmm. So the main condition is x + y > z. And z can be as large as D, but also it's at least C. So for each possible z in [C, D], I need to find how many pairs (x, y) satisfy x ≤ y, with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without iterating through every possible z. Let me think about the variables.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- x ranges from A to B.\n- y ranges from B to C.\n- z ranges from C to D.\n\nBut since z is part of the condition, perhaps for each possible z, we can calculate the number of valid (x, y) pairs where x ≤ y and x + y > z.\n\nBut considering that z can be up to 5e5, and for each z, the computation might take O(1) time, the total complexity could be manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each z from C to D:\n    count the number of (x, y) pairs where A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, x ≤ y, and x + y > z.\n\nSum all these counts over z.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute this count efficiently for each z.\n\nLet's think about the constraints on x and y.\n\nGiven z, for x in [A, B], y must be ≥ max(B, x) (since y ≥ B and y ≥ x). But also, y must be ≥ (z - x + 1), because x + y > z → y > z - x → y ≥ (z - x + 1).\n\nWait, no. Because y must be an integer. So y needs to be greater than (z - x), so the minimal y is (z - x + 1).\n\nBut y also has to be at least B, and at least x (since x ≤ y). So the lower bound for y is the maximum of B, x, (z - x + 1).\n\nAdditionally, y cannot exceed C. So the upper bound for y is min(C, ...? Well, C is fixed for y, so y can't exceed C.\n\nSo for each x, the valid y's are those that satisfy:\n\ny >= max(B, x, z - x + 1)\nand\ny <= C.\n\nIf the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound, then the count for this x is (C - lower_bound + 1). Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo for a given z, the total number of (x, y) pairs is the sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, C - lower_bound + 1), where lower_bound is the maximum of B, x, z - x + 1.\n\nBut wait, for each x, we have to compute this.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently for each z?\n\nWait, maybe we can precompute some functions or find a mathematical way to represent this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a fixed z, the region of x is [A, B]. For each x, we can find the minimum y that satisfies y >= max(B, x, z - x + 1), and y <= C.\n\nSo for each x, the y's are between lower = max(B, x, z - x + 1) and C.\n\nIf lower > C, then no contribution. Else, contribution is (C - lower + 1).\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each z, compute the sum for x from A to B of max(0, C - max(B, x, z -x +1) + 1).\n\nHmm. Let's try to model this function for x.\n\nLet me try to find the range of x where the various terms influence the lower bound.\n\nCase 1: z - x + 1 ≤ B.\n\nIn this case, the lower bound for y is B.\n\nSo for x such that z - x + 1 ≤ B → x ≥ z - B + 1.\n\nBut x has to be at least A.\n\nSo x ranges from max(A, z - B + 1) to B.\n\nIn this case, for each x in this interval, the lower bound is B, and the contribution is max(0, C - B + 1), but only if B ≤ C.\n\nWait, but if B > C, then no contribution. But according to the input constraints, B ≤ C, so B <= C always holds. So for x in this interval, the contribution is (C - B + 1), but only if C >= B.\n\nWhich it is, so for each x in this interval, the count is (C - B + 1) if z - x + 1 ≤ B.\n\nBut wait, what is the condition for this case? It's when z - x + 1 ≤ B → x ≥ z - B + 1.\n\nSo for x >= z - B + 1, the lower bound is B.\n\nSo for this part of x, the number of x's is the number of x in [max(A, z - B + 1), B].\n\nIf max(A, z - B + 1) > B, then no contribution.\n\nElse, the count is (B - max(A, z - B + 1) + 1) * (C - B + 1).\n\nWait, no. Because for each x in that interval, the contribution is (C - B + 1) if the lower bound is B.\n\nYes, because for each x in that interval, the lower bound is B, and y can be from B to C, as long as y >= x and >= B, but since B >= x (since x <= B), then y is just from B to C, provided that B <= C.\n\nSo the count for this case is the number of x's in the interval multiplied by (C - B + 1), but only if the lower bound for y is B.\n\nWait, but what if x is larger than B? No, because x is in [A, B], so x can't be larger than B.\n\nWait, no, x is from A to B, inclusive. So x can be equal to B.\n\nSo in this case, for x >= z - B + 1, the lower bound for y is B.\n\nSo the number of x's is max(0, B - (z - B + 1) + 1) ) but only if x starts at A.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the range of x where the lower bound is B.\n\nSo for x >= s, where s = z - B + 1.\n\nSo the x's in [s, B], but also within [A, B].\n\nSo the lower x is max(A, s), and the upper x is B.\n\nIf lower_x > B, then this case contributes nothing.\n\nElse, the number of x's is (B - lower_x + 1).\n\nAnd for each such x, the contribution is (C - B + 1).\n\nSo the total for this part is (B - lower_x + 1) * (C - B + 1).\n\nCase 2: z - x + 1 > B.\n\nIn this case, the lower bound for y is max(x, z - x + 1).\n\nBut since x <= B <= C, and z can be up to D, which is >= C.\n\nSo for x < s (where s is z - B + 1), the lower bound is the maximum between x and (z - x + 1).\n\nSo for x < s, the lower bound is max(x, z - x + 1).\n\nWe need to find for each x in [A, s-1], whether max(x, z -x + 1) <= C.\n\nBut wait, for each x in [A, s-1], the lower bound is either x or (z -x + 1), whichever is larger.\n\nBut since x is less than s = z - B +1, then z -x + 1 >= B.\n\nSo for x < s, z - x +1 >= B.\n\nBut x can be up to s-1, which is z - B.\n\nSo for x < s, z -x +1 > B.\n\nSo the lower bound for y is the maximum of x and (z -x +1).\n\nSo now, for each x in [A, s-1], we have y >= max(x, z -x + 1), and y <= C.\n\nSo the contribution for each x is max(0, C - max(x, z -x + 1) + 1).\n\nBut calculating this for each x is O(1) per x, but for large B and D, this could be expensive.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find a way to model this as a function over x and find the sum analytically.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find the point where x and (z -x +1) cross, i.e., where x = (z -x +1) → 2x = z +1 → x = (z+1)/2.\n\nSo for x <= (z+1)/2, (z -x +1) >= x. So the maximum is (z -x +1).\n\nFor x > (z+1)/2, the maximum is x.\n\nSo the sum can be broken into two parts: x from A to m, where m is floor((z+1)/2), and x from m+1 to s-1.\n\nWait, but s is z - B +1, which could be less than m, or greater than m, depending on B.\n\nThis might complicate things.\n\nAlternative approach: For each x in [A, s-1], find the lower bound as max(x, (z -x +1)), and see if this is <= C.\n\nIf yes, add (C - lower_bound + 1) to the count; else, add zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find the sum for x in [A, s-1] of max(0, C - max(x, (z -x +1)) + 1).\n\nBut computing this for each x would be O(s) per z, which could be too slow when D is up to 5e5.\n\nSo we need a way to compute this sum more efficiently.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet me define t = z - x + 1.\n\nSo for x in [A, s-1], t decreases as x increases.\n\nAt x = A, t is z - A + 1.\n\nAt x = s-1, t is z - (s-1) +1 = z - s + 2.\n\nWait, s is z - B + 1, so substituting s into t:\n\nt = z - (s-1) +1 = z - (z - B) +1 = B + 1.\n\nSo for x = s-1, t = B+1.\n\nSo for x < s, t >= B +1.\n\nWhich is because s = z - B +1 → x < s → x <= s-1 → t = z -x +1 >= z - (s-1) +1 = z - (z - B) +1 = B +1.\n\nSo for x < s, t is at least B+1, which is >= B.\n\nSince B <= C, t can be up to z - A +1.\n\nBut for each x, the lower bound is the maximum of x and t.\n\nSo for x in [A, m], where m is (z+1)//2, the maximum is t.\n\nFor x in [m+1, s-1], the maximum is x.\n\nSo for each z, the sum can be split into three parts:\n\n1. x in [A, min(m, s-1)] → lower is t.\n2. x in [max(m+1, A), s-1] → lower is x.\n3. Any x beyond s-1 is handled in case 1 earlier.\n\nWait, but s is z - B + 1, which may be larger than m or not.\n\nSo for each z, we need to compute:\n\nsum_case1: x in [A, s1], where s1 is min(s-1, m).\n\nsum_case2: x in [s2, s-1], where s2 is max(m+1, A).\n\nPlus, we have to make sure that these intervals are valid.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, compute s = z - B + 1.\n\nThen, compute m = (z + 1) // 2.\n\nSo for x < m, max(x, t) is t.\n\nx >= m, max(x, t) is x.\n\nBut x has to be <= s-1, which is z - B.\n\nSo the first interval is x from A to min(m, s-1).\n\nThe second interval is x from max(m+1, A) to s-1.\n\nWait, but s could be <= m. So in that case, the first interval is empty, and the second interval is from m+1 to s-1, but s-1 could be less than m+1, making the interval invalid.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to split the x's into two regions based on whether x is <= m or x > m.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: for the x's in [A, s-1], the lower bound for y is the maximum of x and t.\n\nSo the sum can be written as the sum for x in [A, s-1] of max(0, C - max(x, t) + 1), where t = z -x +1.\n\nBut t is z -x +1, which for x in [A, s-1] is >= B+1.\n\nSo for each x in this range, the lower bound is the maximum of x and t.\n\nSo, for x <= m, t >= x → lower is t.\n\nFor x > m, x > t → lower is x.\n\nBut t = z -x +1.\n\nSo for x <= m, t >= x → x <= (z -x +1) → 2x <= z +1 → x <= (z+1)/2.\n\nWhich is exactly the definition of m.\n\nSo for x <= m, lower is t.\n\nFor x > m, lower is x.\n\nSo now, the sum becomes:\n\nsum_{x=A to s-1} max(0, C - max(x, t) + 1) \n\n= sum_{x=A to s-1} [ if x <= m: max(0, C - t + 1) else max(0, C - x + 1) ]\n\nBut t = z -x +1.\n\nSo for x <= m:\n\ncontribution is max(0, C - (z -x +1) + 1) = max(0, C - z + x).\n\nWait, because C - (z -x +1) +1 = C - z +x.\n\nSimilarly, for x > m, contribution is max(0, C - x + 1).\n\nSo now, the sum can be split into two parts:\n\nsum_part1: x from A to min(m, s-1) → contribution is max(0, C - z + x)\n\nsum_part2: x from max(m+1, A) to s-1 → contribution is max(0, C -x +1)\n\nSo now, for each z, the sum is sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\nBut how to compute these sums quickly.\n\nLet me handle sum_part1 first.\n\nsum_part1 is for x in [A, min(m, s-1)].\n\nEach term is max(0, C - z + x).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (C - z + x) if C - z + x >=0, else 0.\n\nSo, for each x in this interval, we need to check if (C - z + x) >=0.\n\nSo x >= (z - C).\n\nBecause C - z +x >=0 → x >= z - C.\n\nBut since x >= A, which could be >= z - C or not.\n\nSo, for sum_part1, the x's are in [A, X], where X is min(m, s-1).\n\nWe need to find how many x's in this interval are >= (z - C).\n\nIf (z - C) > X → no contribution.\n\nElse, the contributing x's are from max(A, z - C) to X.\n\nThe number of such x's is X' = max(A, z - C).\n\nIf X' > X → no contribution.\n\nElse, the count is X - X' + 1, and the sum is sum_{x=X'}^{X} (C - z + x) = sum_{k= (C - z + X')}^{(C - z + X)} k.\n\nWhich is an arithmetic series.\n\nThe sum of consecutive integers from a to b is (b*(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)*a/2).\n\nSo, sum_part1 can be computed as follows:\n\nCompute start = max(A, z - C).\n\nend = min(m, s-1).\n\nif start > end → sum_part1 = 0.\n\nelse:\n\nif (C - z) + end < 0 → sum_part1 = 0.\n\nelse:\n\nsum_a = C - z + start\n\nsum_b = C - z + end\n\nif sum_a <0 → sum_part1 = 0.\n\nelse:\n\nnumber_of_terms = end - start + 1\n\nsum_part1 = (sum_a + sum_b) * number_of_terms // 2.\n\nSimilarly for sum_part2.\n\nsum_part2 is for x in [Y, s-1], where Y = max(m+1, A).\n\nEach term is max(0, C - x + 1).\n\nWhich is (C -x +1) if x <= C+1.\n\nWait, because C -x +1 >=0 → x <= C+1.\n\nBut x is in [Y, s-1].\n\nSo for sum_part2, the x's are in [Y, Z], where Z = s-1.\n\nWe need to find how many x's in this interval are <= C+1.\n\nSo the starting point is Y, ending at min(Z, C+1).\n\nIf Y > C+1 → no contribution.\n\nElse:\n\nstart_part2 = Y\n\nend_part2 = min(Z, C+1)\n\nif start_part2 > end_part2 → sum_part2 = 0.\n\nelse:\n\nsum is sum_{x=start_part2}^{end_part2} (C -x +1).\n\nWhich is sum of (C+1 -x) from x=start_part2 to end_part2.\n\nThis is equivalent to summing from (C+1 - end_part2) to (C+1 - start_part2), but that's if start_part2 <= end_part2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nEach term is (C -x +1) = (C +1) - x.\n\nSo the sum is (C +1)*(end_part2 - start_part2 +1) - sum_{x=start_part2}^{end_part2} x.\n\nSum x from a to b is (b*(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)*a/2).\n\nSo:\n\nsum_part2 = (C+1)*(end_part2 - start_part2 +1) - (end_part2*(end_part2 +1)/2 - (start_part2-1)*start_part2/2)\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nSo for each z, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute s = z - B + 1.\n\n   If s < A → no x satisfies x >= s, so case 1 contributes 0.\n\n   Else, x runs from max(A, s) to B, and for each x, the contribution is (C - B + 1), provided that B <= C.\n\n   So the count for case 1 is (B - lower_x + 1) * (C - B +1), where lower_x is max(A, s).\n\n   But wait, earlier I thought that for x >= s, the lower bound for y is B. So the number of x's is max(0, B - max(A, s) + 1), and each contributes (C - B + 1).\n\n   So the contribution is (number of x's) * (C - B + 1).\n\n   So for case 1, compute:\n\n   lower_x = max(A, s)\n\n   if lower_x > B → 0.\n\n   else → cnt = B - lower_x + 1 → contribute cnt * (C - B + 1).\n\n2. Compute m = (z +1) // 2.\n\n   Then, for case 2, compute the sum for x in [A, s-1] as sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\n   But wait, s-1 can be less than A, in which case case 2 contributes 0.\n\n   So for case 2:\n\n   Compute x_start = A.\n\n   x_end = s-1.\n\n   if x_start > x_end → sum_part1 and sum_part2 are 0.\n\n   else:\n\n       compute sum_part1 and sum_part2 as described above.\n\n   Then, the total for case 2 is sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\n3. The total for z is case1 + case2.\n\n4. Sum this across all z from C to D.\n\nBut wait, for each z in C to D, we have to perform these calculations. Since D can be up to 5e5, and for each z, the computations are O(1), this should be manageable.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this efficiently in Python.\n\nBut before writing code, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nSample Output: 4.\n\nLet's compute for each z.\n\nz ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nz=3:\n\nCase 1: s = 3 -2 +1=2.\n\nlower_x = max(1, 2)=2.\n\nx ranges from 2 to 2.\n\nNumber of x's: 1.\n\nContribution: 1 * (3 -2 +1) = 1*2=2.\n\nCase 2:\n\ns-1 =2.\n\nm=(3+1)/2=2.\n\nSo x ranges from A=1 to s-1=2.\n\nsum_part1:\n\nstart = max(A, z - C) → z is 3, C is 3.\n\nz-C=0. So start is max(1,0)=1.\n\nend = min(m, s-1) = min(2, 2) =2.\n\nsum_part1 is sum of (3-3 +x) for x=1,2.\n\nWhen x=1: 3-3 +1=1 → valid.\n\nx=2: 3-3 +2=2 → valid.\n\nSo sum_part1 is 1+2=3.\n\nsum_part2:\n\nY = m+1=3, but x_end is 2. So Y> x_end → sum_part2=0.\n\nSo case2 contributes 3.\n\nTotal for z=3: case1(2) + case2(3) =5.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, for z=3, the possible x and y are:\n\nLooking back, the sample explanation says the triangles are:\n\n(1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4).\n\nWait, but for z=3, why isn't (2,3,3) included? Oh, because z=3.\n\nWait, but the sample includes (2,3,3) as a triangle, but for z=3, x can be 2, y can be 3.\n\nSo for z=3, the case1 is when x >= s=2, so x=2, y >= B=2. So y can be 2 or 3.

Or perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, the sample output for '1 2 2 5' is 3. So what's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back, in the second sample, the input is '1 2 2 5'.\n\nWait, the variables are A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo x can be from 1 to 2.\n\ny can be from 2 to 2.\n\nz can be from 2 to5.\n\nSo the possible triangles are:\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\ny can be 2.\n\nz can be 2,3,4,5.\n\nBut wait, because y is fixed at 2, x can be 1 or 2.\n\nSo for each z, the condition is x + y > z → x + 2 > z.\n\nSo for z=2: x can be 1 or 2. 1+2>2 is true (3>2). 2+2>2 is true.\n\nSo z=2: 2 triangles.\n\nz=3: x+2>3 → x>1 → x=2. So 1 triangle.\n\nz=4: x+2>4 → x>2 → but x can be at most 2. So no triangles.\n\nz=5: same as z=4.\n\nSo total triangles: 2+1=3.\n\nSo why in my earlier calculation, for z=5, I found 2?\n\nAh, because I think I messed up the case1 and case2 calculations.\n\nLet me re-examine for z=5.\n\ns =5-2+1=4.\n\ncase1: x >=4.\n\nx can be 4 to 2, which is invalid. So case1 contributes 0.\n\ncase2: x runs from 1 to 3.\n\nsum_part1: x starts at max(1,5-2)=3.\n\nend is min(3,3) →3.\n\nso x=3.\n\nt=5-3+1=3.\n\nmax(x, t) is 3.\n\nso contribution is 2-3 +3= 2.\n\nsum_part1 is 2.\n\nsum_part2: x starts at 4, but x_end=3. No contribution.\n\nso case2 contributes 2.\n\nBut in reality, for z=5, x can be 2, y=2, but 2+2>5 is 4>5 → false. So no triangles for z=5.\n\nSo my calculation is wrong.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nWait, for z=5, x can be 1 or 2.\n\ny is 2.\n\nx + y must be > z → x+2>5 → x>3.\n\nBut x is at most 2. So no triangles.\n\nSo the contribution for z=5 is 0.\n\nBut according to the code logic, case2 is contributing 2.\n\nSo where's the bug?\n\nLooking back, for z=5, case2 computes sum_part1 and sum_part2.\n\nsum_part1: x=3.\n\nt=5-3+1=3.\n\nmax(3,3)=3.\n\ncontribution is 2-3 +3=2.\n\nBut x=3 is not in the x's allowed range, because x is supposed to be <= B=2.\n\nAh! That's the issue. Because in this scenario, x can't be 3.\n\nSo in the code logic, when computing case2, x must be in [A, B], but in our earlier analysis, I didn't account for this.\n\nWait, no. In case2, x is in [A, s-1], but s-1 is z-B.\n\nFor z=5, B=2, s-1=5-2=3.\n\nBut x can be up to 2.\n\nSo for case2, x can be from A=1 to min(s-1, B)=2.\n\nSo in the code, during case2 processing, x must be within [A, B], but in the code logic, for case2, x is in [A, s-1], but s-1 could be larger than B.\n\nSo in the code, when computing case2, x must be <= B.\n\nSo the code logic is incorrect because it allows x beyond B.\n\nThis is a major oversight.\n\nSo the initial approach is flawed because for case2, x is in [A, s-1], but s-1 can be larger than B.\n\nThus, in case2, x can't exceed B.\n\nSo during case2 processing, x is in [A, min(s-1, B)].\n\nSo for each step, in case2, x is in [A, min(s-1, B)].\n\nSo in the sample where B=2, s-1=3, but x can only be up to 2.\n\nSo for case2, the x ranges are adjusted to [A, min(s-1, B)].\n\nSo the code logic needs to be modified accordingly.\n\nThis changes everything.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor case1:\n\nx is in [max(A, s), B], where s = z - B +1.\n\nBut s can be less than A, in which case case1 contributes 0.\n\nFor case2:\n\nx is in [A, min(s-1, B)].\n\nBecause x can't be larger than B.\n\nSo, for each case, the x ranges are adjusted.\n\nSo, this correction is crucial.\n\nSo, in the previous example where z=5:\n\ncase1: s=4.\n\nx ranges from max(A=1,4)=4 to B=2 → invalid, so case1 contributes 0.\n\ncase2: x runs from A=1 to min(s-1=3, B=2) → x from 1 to 2.\n\nm = (5+1)/2=3.\n\nsum_part1: x from A=1 to min(m=3, 2)=2.\n\nstart = max(A, z - C) → z=5, C=2 →5-2=3.\n\nstart = max(1,3)=3.\n\nend = min(2,2)=2.\n\nso start > end → sum_part1=0.\n\nsum_part2: x starts at m+1=4, but x_end=2 → no contribution.\n\nso case2 contributes 0.\n\nThus, for z=5, case1=0, case2=0 → total 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in code, the case2 processing must ensure that x doesn't exceed B.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nFor each z from C to D:\n\n   s = z - B + 1\n\n   # Case1:\n\n   lower_x_case1 = max(A, s)\n\n   if lower_x_case1 > B:\n\n       case1 =0\n\n   else:\n\n       num_x_case1 = B - lower_x_case1 + 1\n\n       if B > C:\n\n           case1 = num_x_case1 * (C - B +1)\n\n       else:\n\n           case1 =0\n\n   # Case2:\n\n   x_max_case2 = min(s-1, B)\n\n   if x_max_case2 < A:\n\n       case2 =0\n\n   else:\n\n       m = (z +1) //2\n\n       # Now, x is in [A, x_max_case2]\n\n       # For x in [A, x_max_case2], compute sum_part1 and sum_part2.\n\n       # sum_part1: x <= m.\n\n       x_min_part1 = A\n\n       x_max_part1 = min(m, x_max_case2)\n\n       if x_min_part1 > x_max_part1:\n\n           sum_p1 =0\n\n       else:\n\n           # compute start = max(A, z - C)\n\n           start = max(A, z - C)\n\n           if start > x_max_part1:\n\n              ",
