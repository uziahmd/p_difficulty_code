The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to unlock as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that for a key j and chest i, a_i + b_j must be odd. Also, each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked at most once.\n\nHmm, right. So the main thing here is that each key can only be used once. So we need to pair keys and chests such that their sum is odd, and maximize the number of chests opened.\n\nLet me think about the parity. Because for a_i + b_j to be odd, one must be even and the other odd. So, for each key, depending on whether it's even or odd, it can unlock a chest that is of the opposite parity.\n\nSo the first step is to separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the condition is that a_i + b_j is odd. So if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd. And if a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\nSo, for all the chests, let's count how many have even a_i and how many have odd a_i. Similarly, for the keys, count how many are even and how many are odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between:\n\n- The number of even a_i chests and the number of odd b_j keys. Because each even a_i needs an odd key.\n\nPlus the minimum between:\n\n- The number of odd a_i chests and the number of even b_j keys. Because each odd a_i needs an even key.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because each key can be used once. So for the even a_i chests, each requires an odd key. So the maximum number of even a_i chests we can open is the minimum of the count of even a_i and the count of odd keys.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum number of odd a_i chests is the minimum of the count of odd a_i chests and the count of even keys.\n\nSo the total maximum is the sum of these two minima.\n\nBut wait, that's only true if the sum of those two doesn't exceed the total number of chests. Hmm, but actually, since each key is used once, the two minima can't both exceed m because the sum could potentially be more than n, but that's not possible because each chest uses one key. So the sum of the two minima can't exceed n, because you can't have more chests opened than the total.\n\nWait, no. Let's see. Suppose you have 3 even a_i chests and 4 odd b_j keys. Then, you can use 3 keys (odd) for the even chests, leaving 1 key (odd) unused. Then, for the odd a_i chests, say you have 2, and you have 5 even b_j keys. So you can use 2 even keys for them. So total is 3+2=5 chests. But if you have 10 even a_i and 10 odd keys, you can take 10 from the even and 0 from the odd, totaling 10.\n\nSo the approach is correct: the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minima of the two pairs.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (even_a, odd_a).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (even_b, odd_b).\n3. The maximum chests is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\na_i's: 9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\nSo even_a = 3 (14,6,2), odd_a = 2.\n\nb_j's: 8 even,4 even,7 odd,20 even.\nSo even_b = 3, odd_b=1.\n\nSo min(even_a, odd_b) is min(3,1)=1. min(odd_a, even_b) is min(2,3)=2. Total 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na_i: 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb_j:5 → odd. So even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nSo min(even_a, odd_b)= min(5",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest only if the sum of the key's number and the chest's number is odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Parity Condition**: For a key `b_j` and a chest `a_i`, their sum must be odd. This means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n2. **Categorize the Data**: Separate the chests into even and odd based on their numbers. Similarly, separate the keys into even and odd.\n3. **Count the Parities**: Count how many chests are even (`even_a`) and how many are odd (`odd_a`). Similarly, count how many keys are even (`even_b`) and how many are odd (`odd_b`).\n4. **Calculate Maximum Opened Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = 0\nodd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_a += 1\n    else:\n        odd_a += 1\n\neven_b = 0\nodd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_b += 1\n    else:\n        odd_b += 1\n\nmax_even = min(even_a, odd_b)\nmax_odd = min(odd_a, even_b)\n\nprint(max_even + max_odd)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Parity Separation**: By categorizing the chests and keys into even and odd, we can efficiently determine which keys can unlock which chests.\n- **Efficient Counting**: We count how many even and odd numbers exist in both chests and keys, which allows us to quickly compute the maximum possible unlocked chests using simple arithmetic operations.\n- **Summing the Minimums**: The solution leverages the fact that each even chest needs an odd key and each odd chest needs an even key. By taking the minimum of these pairs, we ensure that we do not exceed the available keys of either parity, thus maximizing the number of unlocked chests.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine the maximum number of chests Neko can open, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
