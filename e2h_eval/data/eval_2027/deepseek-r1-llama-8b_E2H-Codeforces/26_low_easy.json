Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, z. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem says that x, y, z are the sides of a triangle, and they must satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x, y, z are in order (x ≤ y ≤ z), the key condition is x + y > z. Because if that holds, then the other conditions (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically hold because z is the largest.\n\nHmm. So the main condition is x + y > z. And z can be as large as D, but also it's at least C. So for each possible z in [C, D], I need to find how many pairs (x, y) satisfy x ≤ y, with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without iterating through every possible z. Let me think about the variables.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- x ranges from A to B.\n- y ranges from B to C.\n- z ranges from C to D.\n\nBut since z is part of the condition, perhaps for each possible z, we can calculate the number of valid (x, y) pairs where x ≤ y and x + y > z.\n\nBut considering that z can be up to 5e5, and for each z, the computation might take O(1) time, the total complexity would be manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each z from C to D:\n    count the number of (x, y) pairs where A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, x ≤ y, and x + y > z.\n\nSum all these counts over z.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute this count efficiently for each z.\n\nLet's think about the constraints on x and y.\n\nGiven z, for x and y to satisfy x + y > z, and x <= y, what is the range of x and y?\n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\nFor each possible x in [A, B], y must be >= max(B, x) and also >= (z - x + 1). Because x + y > z → y > z - x → since y is integer, y >= (z - x + 1).\n\nBut also, y cannot exceed C.\n\nSo for a fixed x, the lower bound for y is max(x, B, (z - x + 1)), and the upper bound is min(C, ...). Wait, but wait: y must be ≥ max(B, x) because y starts from B and x is ≤ y.\n\nSo for each x, the minimum y is the maximum between (z - x + 1) and (max(B, x)).\n\nAnd the maximum y is C.\n\nSo the number of y's for a particular x is the number of integers y in [y_min, C], where y_min is max(max(B, x), (z - x + 1)).\n\nIf y_min > C, then no y satisfies the condition for this x.\n\nSo for each x, we can compute the lower bound y_low = max(max(B, x), z - x + 1). Then the number of valid y's is max(0, C - y_low + 1).\n\nWait, but wait: y has to be ≥ max(B, x) because y is chosen such that B ≤ y ≤ C and y ≥ x (since x ≤ y). So for a given x, y must be at least the maximum of B and x.\n\nSo for each x, the starting point for y is y_start = max(B, x). Then, y also needs to be > (z - x), so y >= (z - x + 1). So the effective y_low is the maximum of y_start and (z - x + 1).\n\nSo the count for y is the number of integers y where y_low ≤ y ≤ C. If y_low > C, then zero.\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is max(0, C - y_low + 1).\n\nThus, for each z, the total is the sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, C - y_low + 1), where y_low is as above.\n\nBut computing this for each z in [C, D] directly would be O(D - C + 1) * O(B - A + 1), which could be up to (5e5) * (5e5) = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter",
