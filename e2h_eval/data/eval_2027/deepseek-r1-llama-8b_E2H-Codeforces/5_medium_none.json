Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves.

It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks.

The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And also, output these pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nWe have n left boots and n right boots. Each boot has a color, which is a lowercase letter or a '?'. Two boots can be paired if their colors are compatible.\n\nCompatibility rules:\n- If both are specific letters, they must be the same.\n- If one is '?' and the other is any (specific or '?'), then they are compatible.\n- If both are '?', they are compatible.\n\nSo, for example, 'a' and 'a' are compatible. 'a' and '?' are compatible. 'a' and 'b' are not.\n\nThe task is to pair each left with a right boot, making sure that each left and right is used at most once. We need the maximum number of such pairs.\n\nThe output should be the count, followed by the list of pairs in any order.\n\nNow, the input gives us two strings: l for left boots and r for right boots. Each character represents a boot's color.\n\nMy plan is to model this as a bipartite graph where edges represent compatible pairs. Then, we need to find the maximum matching in this graph. But wait, n can be up to 150,000, so a standard maximum matching algorithm like Hopcroft-Karp would be O(E√V), but building such a graph is impossible because E could be O(n^2), which is way too big for n=1.5e5.\n\nThat's way beyond what we can handle directly. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to count the pairs without explicitly checking all possibilities.\n\nMaybe group the left and right boots based on their color types and compute the maximum possible matches between these groups.\n\nEach left boot can be in one of four categories:\n1. Fixed color (e.g., 'a')\n2. Wildcard ('?')\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to categorize each boot into its color type. For each left boot, determine whether it's fixed or wildcard. Same for each right boot.\n\nWait, but how do we pair them optimally?\n\nI think the key is to process the left and right boots, counting how many have fixed colors and how many have wildcards.\n\nLet me consider the possible scenarios:\n\nCase 1: Both left and right are fixed. Only possible to pair if their colors match.\n\nCase 2: Left is fixed, right is wildcard. These can be paired, as the wildcard can match any left color.\n\nCase 3: Left is wildcard, right is fixed. Also compatible.\n\nCase 4: Both are wildcards. They can be paired.\n\nAdditionally, the wildcards can be used flexibly.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy is:\n\n- First, match as many fixed pairs as possible. That is, for each color c, take the minimum of the count of lefts with c and rights with c.\n\n- Then, use the remaining left wildcards and rights to form pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a better way. Because some left fixed may not get matched, allowing more overall pairs by using wildcards elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal approach is to:\n\n1. Compute the number of left fixed and right fixed.\n\n2. Compute the number of wildcards in left and right.\n\nThen, the total possible pairs would be:\n\npairs = min(number of left fixed + number of right fixed, ... )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach is to:\n\n- For each fixed left color, find how many right boots have that color. The sum of these is the number of fixed-fixed pairs possible.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (both may have wildcards and possibly some fixed that couldn't pair), see how many can be paired.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n- For all left and right, create frequency tables of their colors. For left, count how many are '?'; same for right.\n\n- Then, calculate the maximum possible pairs from fixed pairs. For each color c, the number of pairs is the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c]. Summing over all c gives the fixed-fixed pairs.\n\n- Then, the remaining left and right can be considered as wildcards. The total possible from these is the minimum of remaining_left_wild + remaining_right_wild, but wait, no. Because any left can be paired with any right, but each can be used only once.\n\nWait, perhaps after using the fixed-fixed pairs, the remaining left and right can be paired as follows:\n\nThe remaining left can have some fixed (those that couldn't find a matching right) and some wildcards.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining right can have fixed (unmatched) and wildcards.\n\nThe number of possible additional pairs is the minimum of:\n\n- The number of remaining left wildcards plus the number of remaining right wildcards, because any left can pair with any right.\n\nPlus the minimum of the remaining left fixed and right fixed (but wait, after fixed-fixed pairs, any remaining left fixed can't pair with any right fixed except if the right was a wildcard, which we've already accounted for).\n\nWait, no. Because after the initial fixed-fixed pairs, the remaining left fixed can only pair with right wildcards, and vice versa.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each color c, compute the number of lefts and rights with color c. The fixed-fixed pairs for c is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Sum this across all c to get S.\n\n2. Subtract S from the left and right counts.\n\n3. Now, the remaining lefts and rights can be either fixed or wildcards.\n\n4. The remaining lefts can be:\n\n   - L_fixed_remaining: sum of left_counts[c] - min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c.\n\n   Similarly, R_fixed_remaining: sum of right_counts[c] - min(...) for all c.\n\n   Wait, no. Because for each c, left_counts[c] - right_counts[c] is the excess lefts for that color, which cannot form fixed pairs anymore.\n\n   Alternatively, after step 1, for each c, the lefts and rights that were fixed are used up to their min. The remaining lefts for c are left_counts[c] - min(...). These are lefts that couldn't find a matching right.\n\n   So, L_fixed_remaining = sum over c (left_counts[c] - min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]))\n\n   Similarly, R_fixed_remaining = sum over c (right_counts[c] - min(...))\n\n5. Now, the total possible pairs after step 1 is S.\n\n6. Now, for the remaining lefts and rights:\n\n   The remaining lefts can be:\n\n   a) L_fixed_remaining: lefts that are fixed but couldn't find a matching right.\n\n   b) L_wild: the number of lefts that were '?'.\n\n   Similarly, the remaining rights can be:\n\n   a) R_fixed_remaining: rights that are fixed but couldn't find a matching left.\n\n   b) R_wild: the number of rights that are '?'.\n\n7. Now, the remaining can form pairs as follows:\n\n   Any left (fixed_remaining or wild) can pair with any right (fixed_remaining or wild).\n\n   Wait, but fixed_remaining can only pair with wild rights, and wild lefts can pair with any rights.\n\n   So, the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum between the total remaining lefts and the total remaining rights.\n\n   Because each left can pair with any right, regardless of their types.\n\n   So, total_pairs = S + min( (L_fixed_remaining + L_wild), (R_fixed_remaining + R_wild) )\n\n   But wait, let's make sure.\n\n   Suppose after step 1:\n\n   L_fixed_remaining is the number of lefts that are fixed but couldn't find a matching right.\n\n   R_fixed_remaining is similar.\n\n   L_wild is the number of lefts that are '?'\n\n   R_wild is the number of rights that are '?'.\n\n   Then, any combination is allowed:\n\n   - L_fixed can pair with R_wild.\n\n   - L_wild can pair with any R (fixed_remaining or R_wild).\n\n   Similarly, R_fixed can pair with L_wild.\n\n   So, the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum of (total remaining lefts, total remaining rights).\n\n   Because for each additional pair, we can match a left (fixed or wild) with a right (fixed or wild), but we have to ensure that each is used once.\n\n   So, the total additional is min( (L_fixed_remaining + L_wild), (R_fixed_remaining + R_wild) )\n\n   So, the overall maximum is S + min( L_total_remaining, R_total_remaining ), where L_total_remaining is L_fixed_remaining + L_wild, R_total_remaining is R_fixed_remaining + R_wild.\n\nWait, but wait—what's L_total_remaining?\n\nIt's the number of lefts that are not yet paired. Similarly for R.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the total additional pairs is the minimum of the two, since each pair requires one left and one right.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCompute:\n\nS = sum over c of min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])\n\nL_fixed_remaining = sum(l_counts[c] - min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])) for all c\n\nR_fixed_remaining = sum(r_counts[c] - min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])) for all c\n\nL_wild = number of '?' in l\n\nR_wild = number of '?' in r\n\nAfter that:\n\nadditional = min( (L_fixed_remaining + L_wild), (R_fixed_remaining + R_wild) )\n\nTotal pairs: S + additional\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when you have L_fixed_remaining, those can only pair with R_wild, since their color is fixed but the right is either fixed (already considered in S) or wild.\n\nSimilarly, R_fixed_remaining can only pair with L_wild.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose:\n\nLeft has 2 'a's and 1 '?'\n\nRight has 1 'a' and 3 '?'\n\nIn S, min(2,1) is 1, so S=1.\n\nThen, L_fixed_remaining is 2-1=1 'a's.\n\nR_fixed_remaining is 0.\n\nL_wild is 1.\n\nR_wild is 3.\n\nSo, the remaining lefts are 1 'a' and 1 '?': total 2.\n\nRemaining rights: 0 fixed, 3 wild: total 3.\n\nSo, the additional is min(2,3) = 2.\n\nSo, total pairs is 1+2=3.\n\nBut wait, can the 'a's on left pair with the wild rights? Yes, because a is fixed and right is wild.\n\nSo, the 'a' can pair with any of the 3 wild rights, but each right can only be used once.\n\nSo, in this case, the 'a' can pair with one wild right, and the left '?' can pair with another wild right.\n\nSo, 2 more pairs.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nLeft has 3 'a's, right has 2 'a's and 1 '?'.\n\nIn S, min(3,2)=2, so S=2.\n\nL_fixed_remaining: 3-2=1.\n\nR_fixed_remaining: 0.\n\nL_wild: 0.\n\nR_wild: 1.\n\nAdditional is min(1+0, 0+1)=1.\n\nSo, total pairs 3.\n\nWhich is correct: two a's are paired, the third a can't, but the right wild can pair with it.\n\nWait, but in this case, L_fixed_remaining is 1, R_wild is 1. So, yes, one more pair.\n\nSo, the method works.\n\nAnother test case: when some left and right are '?', but others are fixed.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the counts for each color in l and r.\n\n2. For each color c, add the minimum of l_counts[c] and r_counts[c] to S.\n\n3. Compute L_fixed_remaining as sum(l_counts[c] - min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])) for all c.\n\n   Similarly for R_fixed_remaining.\n\n4. Compute L_wild and R_wild.\n\n5. The additional pairs is min(L_fixed_remaining + L_wild, R_fixed_remaining + R_wild).\n\nWait, but L_wild is the number of '?' in l, and R_wild is '?' in r.\n\nWait, but in the initial steps, the '?' are considered as wild.\n\nSo, for the additional step, any left can pair with any right.\n\nSo, the additional is the minimum of (remaining lefts) and (remaining rights).\n\nBecause each left can be paired with any right, but each can be used once.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Calculate for each color c, the number of pairs as min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\n- Sum these to get S.\n\n- The remaining lefts are l_counts[c] - min(...) summed for all c, plus the number of '?' in l.\n\nWait, no. Because the '?' in l and r are part of the remaining.\n\nWait, no: l_counts includes the '?'. So, when we compute l_counts[c], it doesn't include the '?', because in our initial processing, for each c in l, it's a fixed color. So, the '?' are separate.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the way we built the counts: l_counts includes all fixed colors, but not the '?'. So, the '?' are a separate category.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to structure it differently.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nFor the left string l:\n\n- For each character c in l, if c is not '?', we count it as l_counts[c].\n\n- The number of '?' in l is l_wild.\n\nSimilarly for r.\n\nThen, for each c in l_counts, the number of possible fixed-fixed pairs is min(l_counts[c], r_counts.get(c, 0)).\n\nSumming this gives S.\n\nThen, for the remaining:\n\n- L_fixed_remaining = sum over c (l_counts[c] - min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]))\n\n- R_fixed_remaining = sum over c (r_counts[c] - min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]))\n\nThen, the remaining lefts are L_fixed_remaining + l_wild.\n\nThe remaining rights are R_fixed_remaining + r_wild.\n\nThe additional pairs is the minimum of these two numbers.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, now, the plan is:\n\nRead the input: n, l, r.\n\nCompute l_counts as a dictionary where key is the character, value is the count of that character in l, excluding '?'.\n\nSimilarly for r_counts.\n\nCompute S as the sum over c of min(l_counts[c], r_counts.get(c, 0)).\n\nCompute L_fixed_remaining = sum for c in l_counts: (l_counts[c] - min(l_counts[c], r_counts.get(c, 0)))\n\nCompute R_fixed_remaining similarly.\n\nCompute l_wild = number of '?' in l.\n\nr_wild = number of '?' in r.\n\nadditional = min( (L_fixed_remaining + l_wild), (R_fixed_remaining + r_wild) )\n\nTotal pairs is S + additional.\n\nBut wait, what if S + additional exceeds n? Because each left and right can be used once.\n\nNo, because in the process:\n\nAfter S is the maximum fixed-fixed pairs, then the additional is the maximum possible from the remaining.\n\nWait, but suppose S is 10, and the additional is 15, but n is 10. That can't happen.\n\nWait, no, because S is the number of fixed-fixed pairs, which uses up some left and right boots.\n\nThe remaining left and right is (n - S) each, but the additional can't exceed n - S.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nThe maximum possible pairs is n, since each left can be paired with exactly one right.\n\nBut in the way we compute S and additional, could S + additional exceed n?\n\nNo, because:\n\nS is the fixed-fixed pairs, which is ≤n.\n\nThen, additional is the maximum possible given the remaining lefts and rights.\n\nBut the sum S + additional can be up to n.\n\nBecause after S, the remaining lefts are (n - S) and the same for rights.\n\nSo, the additional can be up to min(n - S, n - S) = n - S.\n\nThus, the total pairs is S + (n - S) = n.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the actual pairs.\n\nOnce we have S and the additional, the problem is to find which specific pairs contribute to the additional.\n\nSo, for the additional part, we need to find as many pairs as possible between the remaining lefts and rights.\n\nThe way to do this is:\n\n- All lefts that are fixed and couldn't find a right (L_fixed_remaining) can pair with any of the R_wild.\n\n- Then, the lefts that are wild can pair with any of the remaining rights.\n\nBut how to manage this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\nFirst, assign as many as possible L_fixed_remaining to R_wild.\n\nEach L_fixed can be paired with a R_wild.\n\nThe number of such pairs is min(L_fixed_remaining, R_wild).\n\nThe remaining L_fixed_remaining after that is max(L_fixed_remaining - R_wild, 0).\n\nThen, the remaining rights are R_fixed_remaining + R_wild - min(L_fixed_remaining, R_wild).\n\nWait, maybe not. Maybe it's better to first process the L_fixed_remaining against R_wild.\n\nLet me think:\n\n1. For each L_fixed in L_fixed_remaining, we can pair it with a R_wild.\n\n   The number of such pairs is min(L_fixed_remaining, R_wild).\n\n   So, we subtract this from both.\n\n   Now, L_fixed_remaining becomes L_fixed_remaining - x, where x is the number of such pairs.\n\n   R_wild becomes R_wild - x.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining L_fixed_remaining (if any), they can pair with R_fixed_remaining.\n\n   But wait, L_fixed can only pair with R_wild. No, because R_fixed_remaining is the rights that couldn't find a left.\n\n   So, R_fixed_remaining is the rights that are fixed but couldn't find a matching left.\n\n   So, these can't be paired with any L_fixed_remaining, because their colors are fixed.\n\n   So, the L_fixed_remaining can't pair with R_fixed_remaining.\n\n   Thus, after step 1, the L_fixed_remaining will have 0.\n\n3. Then, the remaining lefts are L_fixed_remaining (0) and L_wild.\n\n   The remaining rights are R_fixed_remaining and R_wild.\n\n   Now, we can pair L_wild with any of the remaining rights.\n\n   But the L_wild can pair with any right, including those that are fixed.\n\n   So, the number of such pairs is min(L_wild, total_remaining_rights).\n\n   Where total_remaining_rights is R_fixed_remaining + R_wild.\n\n   So, the number is min(L_wild, R_fixed_remaining + R_wild).\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm complicating things.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nThe additional pairs can be formed as follows:\n\nEach L_fixed_remaining can only pair with R_wild.\n\nEach L_wild can pair with any remaining right (fixed or wild).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\na) Pair as many L_fixed_remaining with R_wild as possible.\n\n   Let x = min(L_fixed_remaining, R_wild).\n\n   Add x pairs.\n\n   Subtract x from L_fixed_remaining and R_wild.\n\nb) Now, L_fixed_remaining is 0.\n\nc) Now, pair L_wild with any remaining rights (R_fixed_remaining + R_wild - x).\n\n   Let y = min(L_wild, R_fixed_remaining + R_wild - x).\n\n   Add y pairs.\n\n   Subtract y from L_wild and the corresponding rights.\n\nBut wait, how do we track which rights are used?\n\nHmm, this seems tricky because we need to track the exact positions.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to output the actual pairs, which is more complex.\n\nSo, perhaps, instead of trying to find the maximum count, we also need to find the actual pairs that contribute to it.\n\nThis complicates things, because the order in which we pair certain elements affects which pairs are selected.\n\nWait, but the problem says that any optimal solution is acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps, for the purpose of generating the pairs, we can find a way that allows us to collect the maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut implementing this correctly is challenging.\n\nAlternative idea: for the additional pairs, first, pair as many L_fixed_remaining with R_wild as possible. Then, pair L_wild with the remaining rights.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Precompute all the necessary counts.\n\n2. Compute S and the remaining counts.\n\n3. For the additional pairs:\n\n   a. Find all L_fixed_remaining and R_wild.\n\n      The number of pairs is x = min(L_fixed_remaining, R_wild).\n\n      Assign each L_fixed_remaining[i] to a R_wild[j].\n\n      How? Well, perhaps we can keep track of the indices.\n\n      But wait, the L and R may have multiple fixed and wild.\n\n      So, perhaps, for L_fixed_remaining, we can collect the indices of the L boots that are fixed and couldn't find a matching right.\n\n      Similarly, for R_wild, collect the indices of R boots that are '?'.\n\n      Then, for x pairs, we can pair the first x L_fixed_remaining with the first x R_wild.\n\n      Then, mark those R_wild as used.\n\n   b. Then, for the remaining L_wild and R_fixed_remaining and R_wild, we can pair as much as possible.\n\n      For the L_wild, collect their indices.\n\n      For the remaining R's (R_fixed_remaining and R_wild that weren't used in step a), collect their indices.\n\n      Then, pair as many as possible between the L_wild and these Rs.\n\n      Again, taking the first y pairs.\n\n4. Now, collect all the pairs: S pairs from fixed-fixed, x from step a, and y from step b.\n\nBut how to track the indices.\n\nThis is getting complicated, especially for large n.\n\nBut perhaps, we can proceed as follows:\n\n- For S, the fixed-fixed pairs: for each color c, find the overlapping counts.\n\n   For each c, the number of pairs is m = min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\n   Then, for each c, we need to select m left indices and m right indices.\n\n   But how to choose which ones? Perhaps, for each c, the left and right are in order, so pairing the first m lefts with the first m rights.\n\n   But this may not always yield the maximum possible pairs, but for the purpose of the problem, any correct pairing is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the order in which we process the colors can affect the selection.\n\nBut perhaps, for the sake of the problem, we can process the colors in some order, say, alphabetical.\n\nBut for the purposes of the code, perhaps it's easier to collect all the S pairs first.\n\nBut for n=150,000, it's not feasible to process each pair individually.\n\nThus, perhaps, we can model the S pairs as a list, then collect the additional pairs.\n\nBut let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can precompute for each color c, the list of left indices where l[i] == c.\n\nSimilarly, for each color c, the list of right indices where r[i] == c.\n\nThen, for each c, the number of pairs is m = min(len(left_list[c]), len(right_list[c])).\n\nWe take the first m left indices and first m right indices for c, and add them to the pairs.\n\nBut wait, the order in which we process the colors matters. For example, processing 'a' before 'b' might result in different pairs being selected.\n\nBut as per the problem statement, any correct pairing is acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps, processing the colors in alphabetical order is acceptable.\n\nThus, for the code:\n\n- Create a list for left and right, noting for each position whether it's fixed or wild.\n\n- For each color c in l_counts, collect the indices where l[i] == c.\n\n   Similarly for r_counts.\n\n- For each c in sorted order, process the min(m) pairs.\n\n   Take the first m from left_list[c] and first m from right_list[c], and add to the S_pairs.\n\nOnce S_pairs is collected, then process the additional pairs.\n\nBut for large n, this is manageable.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code outline is:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nCompute l_counts: a dictionary mapping each non-'?' character to a list of indices where it appears in l.\n\nSimilarly, r_counts.\n\nCompute S_pairs:\n\n   for c in sorted(l_counts.keys()):\n\n       if c not in r_counts or len(r_counts[c]) == 0:\n\n           continue\n\n       m = min(len(l_counts[c]), len(r_counts[c]))\n\n       for i in range(m):\n\n           s_pairs.append( (l_counts[c][i], r_counts[c][i]) )\n\nCompute S = len(s_pairs)\n\nCompute L_fixed_remaining: for each c in l_counts, subtract the number of pairs added.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute it as sum for each c in l_counts: len(l_counts[c]) - m.\n\nWait, no. Because for each c, the number of fixed pairs is m_c = min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\nSo, L_fixed_remaining += (l_counts[c] - m_c).\n\nSimilarly for R_fixed_remaining.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to track for each c, how much was taken.\n\nBut perhaps, it's easier to compute L_fixed_remaining as sum over c (len(l_counts[c]) - min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])).\n\nSame for R_fixed_remaining.\n\nThen, compute l_wild and r_wild.\n\nCompute x = min(L_fixed_remaining, r_wild)\n\nAdd x pairs, each consisting of a left from L_fixed_remaining and a right from r_wild.\n\nThen, for the remaining, y = min(l_wild, R_fixed_remaining + (r_wild - x)).\n\nAdd y pairs, each consisting of a left from l_wild and a right from the remaining.\n\nBut how to track the indices.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: for the additional pairs, collect all possible candidates.\n\nFor the L_fixed_remaining and R_wild, we can collect all possible left indices and right indices.\n\nThen, pair as many as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the L_wild and R_remaining.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for the additional pairs:\n\nCreate a list of available lefts for additional:\n\n   lefts = [ (i, l[i]) for i in range(n) if (l[i] is not '?') and (i not in S_pairs) ]\n\nWait, no, because the S_pairs may have taken some of the fixed lefts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following:\n\nThe additional pairs consist of:\n\n1. Fixed-left (not in S_pairs) paired with wild-right.\n\n2. Wild-left paired with any right (fixed or wild).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\na) For each left that is fixed and not used in S_pairs, add it to a list of available_fixed_lefts.\n\nb) For each right that is wild, add it to a list of available_wild_rights.\n\nPair as many as possible from available_fixed_lefts and available_wild_rights.\n\nTake the min of the two lengths.\n\nFor each such pair, add (left_index, right_index) to the additional_pairs.\n\nThen, mark those right indices as used.\n\nThen, for the remaining rights (wild and fixed):\n\nCollect all remaining right indices.\n\nCollect all wild lefts.\n\nPair as many as possible from wild lefts and remaining rights.\n\nAgain, take min of the two lengths.\n\nAdd those pairs.\n\nBut how to track the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCompute all the S_pairs as before.\n\nThen, for the additional pairs:\n\navailable_fixed_lefts = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and (i not in S_pairs)]\n\navailable_wild_rights = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?']\n\nx = min(len(available_fixed_lefts), len(available_wild_rights))\n\nadditional_pairs = []\n\nfor i in range(x):\n\n    left_i = available_fixed_lefts[i]\n\n    right_j = available_wild_rights[i]\n\n    additional_pairs.append( (left_i, right_j) )\n\nThen, for the remaining:\n\nremaining_lefts = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?']  # Wait, no, because available_fixed_lefts are the fixed ones not in S_pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reevaluate.\n\nWait, the available_fixed_lefts are the fixed lefts not used in S_pairs.\n\navailable_wild_lefts are the wild lefts.\n\navailable_fixed_rights are the fixed rights not used in S_pairs.\n\navailable_wild_rights are the wild rights.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\n- Collect all the indices of left and right that are involved in the S_pairs.\n\n- Then, for the additional pairs:\n\n   1. Pair the remaining fixed lefts with wild rights.\n\n   2. Pair the wild lefts with any remaining rights.\n\nBut to implement this, we need to have lists of the available lefts and rights.\n\nSo:\n\nused_left = set()\n\nused_right = set()\n\nFor S_pairs:\n\n   for each pair in S_pairs:\n\n       used_left.add(left_i)\n\n       used_right.add(right_j)\n\nThen, available_fixed_lefts = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and i not in used_left]\n\navailable_fixed_rights = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] != '?' and j not in used_right]\n\navailable_wild_lefts = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?']\n\navailable_wild_rights = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?']\n\nThen, the additional pairs are:\n\nx = min( len(available_fixed_lefts), len(available_wild_rights) )\n\nfor i in range(x):\n\n   additional_pairs.append( (available_fixed_lefts[i], available_wild_rights[i]) )\n\nThen, update used_right by adding the x right indices.\n\nremaining_available_wild_rights = [j for j in available_wild_rights if j not in used_right]\n\nThen, y = min( len(available_wild_lefts), len(remaining_available_wild_rights + available_fixed_rights) )\n\nWait, no. Because available_fixed_rights are the fixed rights not used in S_pairs.\n\nWait, the remaining rights are:\n\nall rights not in used_right.\n\nWhich includes:\n\navailable_fixed_rights (fixed, not used in S_pairs) and available_wild_rights (wild, not used in S_pairs).\n\nSo, the remaining rights are:\n\nremaining_rights = [j for j in range(n) if j not in used_right]\n\nThus, the available wild lefts can pair with any of these remaining rights.\n\nSo, y = min( len(available_wild_lefts), len(remaining_rights) )\n\nThen, for i in range(y):\n\n   pick the first available_wild_left and first available remaining right.\n\nBut to implement this, perhaps:\n\ncurrent_available_wild_left = 0\n\nfor j in available_wild_lefts:\n\n   if current_available_wild_left >= len(remaining_rights):\n\n       break\n\n   additional_pairs.append( (available_wild_lefts[current_available_wild_left], remaining_rights[current_available_wild_left]) )\n\n   current_available_wild_left += 1\n\nBut how to get the remaining_rights in order.\n\nAlternatively, just collect the remaining_rights as a list, and then for each available_wild_left, take the first available right.\n\nBut this could be done in code.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently, considering that n is up to 1.5e5.\n\nBut in Python, even for 1.5e5 elements, it's manageable.\n\nSo, steps for the code:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read l and r.\n\n3. Precompute for each c, the list of left indices where l[i] == c.\n\n   Similarly for r.\n\n4. Compute S_pairs:\n\n   for c in sorted(l_counts.keys()):\n\n       if c not in r_counts or len(r_counts[c]) < len(l_counts[c]):\n\n           continue\n\n       m = min(len(l_counts[c]), len(r_counts[c]))\n\n       for i in range(m):\n\n           s_pairs.append( (l_counts[c][i], r_counts[c][i]) )\n\n5. Compute used_left and used_right sets.\n\n6. Compute available_fixed_lefts: left indices that are not in used_left and are fixed.\n\n7. Compute available_fixed_rights: right indices that are not in used_right and are fixed.\n\n8. Compute available_wild_lefts: indices where l[i] is '?'.\n\n9. Compute available_wild_rights: indices where r[i] is '?'.\n\n10. Compute x = min( len(available_fixed_lefts), len(available_wild_rights) )\n\n    For each i in x, add (available_fixed_lefts[i], available_wild_rights[i]) to additional_pairs.\n\n    Update used_right to include these x indices.\n\n11. Compute remaining_rights: all rights not in used_right.\n\n12. Compute y = min( len(available_wild_lefts), len(remaining_rights) )\n\n    For each i in 0..y-1:\n\n        add (available_wild_lefts[i], remaining_rights[i]) to additional_pairs.\n\n13. Collect all pairs from s_pairs, additional_pairs.\n\n14. Sort the additional_pairs as needed.\n\nWait, but the order in which the pairs are added may affect which specific pairs are chosen.\n\nBut the problem allows any optimal solution, so it's acceptable.\n\nBut, to output the pairs correctly, perhaps we can process them as above.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing this.\n\nBut handling the indices correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- When collecting available_fixed_lefts, we have to make sure that the indices are not in used_left.\n\n- When collecting available_wild_lefts, it's straightforward as l[i] == '?'.\n\nSimilarly for rights.\n\nBut for large n, creating these lists may take time, but it's manageable.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces → length 10.\n\nr = abaca?b → length 10.\n\nWait, but the sample input is written as:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual l and r are:\n\nl is \"codeforces\"\n\nr is \"abaca?b\"\n\nBut in the sample input, the lines are wrapped as strings.\n\nSo, the code needs to read n, then l, then r.\n\nBut in the code, when reading via input().split(), the lines may contain newlines.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line: l of length n.\n\nThird line: r of length n.\n\nSo, in the code, perhaps:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nl = input().strip()\n\nr = input().strip()\n\nThen, proceed.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut for the code:\n\nImplement the steps.\n\nBut for the S_pairs:\n\nWe need to collect, for each color c, the list of left and right indices.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn = int(input())\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\n# Preprocess left and right\nleft_counts = defaultdict(list)\nfor i, c in enumerate(l):\n    if c != '?':\n        left_counts[c].append(i)\n\nright_counts = defaultdict(list)\nfor i, c in enumerate(r):\n    if c != '?':\n        right_counts[c].append(i)\n\n# Compute S_pairs\ns_pairs = []\nfor c in sorted(left_counts.keys()):\n    if c not in right_counts:\n        continue\n    m_left = len(left_counts[c])\n    m_right = len(right_counts[c])\n    m = min(m_left, m_right)\n    for i in range(m):\n        s_pairs.append( (left_counts[c][i], right_counts[c][i]) )\n\nused_left = set()\nused_right = set()\nfor a, b in s_pairs:\n    used_left.add(a)\n    used_right.add(b)\n\n# Compute additional pairs\navailable_fixed_lefts = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if l[i] != '?' and i not in used_left:\n        available_fixed_lefts.append(i)\n\navailable_fixed_rights = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    if r[j] != '?' and j not in used_right:\n        available_fixed_rights.append(j)\n\navailable_wild_lefts = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?']\navailable_wild_rights = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?']\n\nx = min(len(available_fixed_lefts), len(available_wild_rights))\nadditional_pairs = []\nfor i in range(x):\n    left_i = available_fixed_lefts[i]\n    right_j = available_wild_rights[i]\n    additional_pairs.append( (left_i, right_j) )\nfor a, b in additional_pairs:\n    used_right.add(b)\n\nremaining_rights = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    if j not in used_right:\n        remaining_rights.append(j)\n\ny = min(len(available_wild_lefts), len(remaining_rights))\nfor i in range(y):\n    left_i = available_wild_lefts[i]\n    right_j = remaining_rights[i]\n    additional_pairs.append( (left_i, right_j) )\n\n# Combine all pairs\nall_pairs = s_pairs + additional_pairs\n\n# Output\nprint(len(all_pairs))\nfor a, b in all_pairs:\n    print(a+1, b+1)\n\nWait, but the code may have issues.\n\nWait, for example, when collecting available_fixed_lefts, it's appending all i where l[i] is not '?' and not used.\n\nBut in the s_pairs, the indices are from the left_counts and right_counts, which are the indices of the fixed colors.\n\nBut in the s_pairs, the indices are the original 0-based indices, and when used_left is built, it's adding",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot has a color, which can be a specific letter or a wildcard '?'.
