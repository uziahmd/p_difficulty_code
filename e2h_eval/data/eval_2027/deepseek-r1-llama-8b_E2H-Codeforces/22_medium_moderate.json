After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. We have n students and m subjects. Each student has m marks, each from 1-9. For each subject, I need to find out which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in any subject. The count of such students is what we need to output.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line gives n and m. Then, there are n lines, each representing a student's marks for m subjects. These lines are strings of digits, no spaces. So for example, '223' represents three subjects where the student got 2, 2, 3.\n\n2. For each subject across all students, determine the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if in any subject they have the maximum mark. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nWait, but how do I structure this? Let's think about data structures.\n\nMaybe for each subject, keep track of the maximum value and which student(s) achieved it. But wait, for a subject, the maximum is unique because it's per subject. No, wait, no: multiple students can have the same maximum. But for the purpose of being the best, you just need to be among those with the maximum. Because if someone else has a higher, then you're not the best. So for each subject, the best is the maximum mark, and any student who has that mark is considered the best for that subject.\n\nWait, no. Wait the definition says a student is the best at a subject if there's NO student with a higher mark. So if two students have the same maximum, say 9, then both are best in that subject.\n\nSo for each subject, the best marks are the maximum of that subject. All students who have that maximum in that subject are considered best for that subject.\n\nSo for each subject, collect all students who have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they are in any of these sets (for any subject). If yes, count them as successful.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each subject, find the maximum mark.\n- Collect all students who have that maximum for that subject.\n- For each student, check if they are present in any of these collections for any subject.\n\nNow, how to represent this?\n\nI think for each subject, we can compute the maximum and then for each student, see if they have that maximum.\n\nBut since a student could be the best in multiple subjects, we need to check all subjects for each student.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each student, we can track whether they are the best in any subject by checking each subject.\n\nWait, another approach: for each student, iterate through each subject they have, and check if their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum for that subject. If for any subject, it is, then the student is successful.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read all the student data into a list of strings, each string representing their marks for each subject.\n\n2. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark among all students for that subject.\n\n3. For each student, iterate through each subject:\n   a. Check if the student's mark in that subject equals the maximum for that subject.\n   b. If any subject meets this condition, increment the successful count.\n\nSo the key is to precompute the maximum for each subject, then for each student, check if they have at least one maximum in any subject.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nLet's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nThe first line is n and m. Then n lines follow, each is a string of m characters, each character is a digit.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nEach line is a string of length 3.\n\nWe can read these lines and store them as a list of strings, say students = [line.strip() for line in ...].\n\nThen, for each subject index (0 to m-1), compute the maximum.\n\nmax_marks = [0]*m\nfor i in range(m):\n    max_mark = max(students[j][i] for j in range(n))\n    max_marks[i] = int(max_mark)\n\nWait, but in code, for each subject, we can loop through all students and find the maximum.\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student, check if any position in their string is equal to the corresponding max_marks.\n\nIf yes, count them.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Compute max for each subject\nmax_marks = []\nfor subject in range(m):\n    max_val = max(students[i][subject] for i in range(n))\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor s in students:\n    found = False\n    for i in range(m):\n        if s[i] == str(max_marks[i]):\n            found = True\n            break\n    if found:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but wait! What if the max_marks[i] is stored as an integer, and s[i] is a string. So comparing a string to an int would fail. So in the code, when comparing, I should compare s[i] (a character) to the max_marks[i] as a string.\n\nSo in the code above, max_marks should be a list of strings, not integers.\n\nSo let me adjust that.\n\nIn the max_marks step:\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor subject in range(m):\n    # get all the marks for this subject across all students\n    marks = [students[i][subject] for i in range(n)]\n    current_max = max(marks)\n    max_marks.append(current_max)\n\nWait, no. Because current_max is a string, since it's a character. For example, if all are '5', then current_max is '5'. So, for each subject, max_marks will have the maximum as a string.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject matches the max for that subject.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor subject in range(m):\n    # Get all the marks for this subject across all students\n    max_str = ''\n    for student in students:\n        if student[subject] > max_str:\n            max_str = student[subject]\n    max_marks.append(max_str)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for subject in range(m):\n        if student[subject] == max_marks[subject]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, no. Because for each subject, we need to see if the student's mark is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, then the student is successful.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each student, once any subject has a match, we increment count and break. So the count is the number of students who have at least one subject where they are the best.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait: the code above initializes count to zero, and for each student, if any subject matches, increments count by 1. So the final count is the number of successful students.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the max_marks is a list of strings, same length as m.\n\nEach student is a string of length m.\n\nSo for each subject, the student's mark is compared to the max for that subject.\n\nThat should work.\n\nTesting with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nStudents are ['223', '232', '112']\n\nFor subject 0 (first character):\nAll students' marks are '2', '2', '1'. Max is '2'.\n\nSubject 1 (second): '2', '3', '1' → max is '3'.\n\nSubject 2 (third): '3', '2', '2' → max is '3'.\n\nmax_marks is ['2', '3', '3'].\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: '223'\n\nCheck subject 0: '2' vs '2' → yes → count increases.\n\nStudent 1: '232'\n\nCheck subject 0: '2' vs '2' → yes.\n\nSubject 1: '3' vs '3' → yes.\n\nStudent 2: '112'\n\nCheck subject 0: '1' vs '2' → no.\n\nSubject 1: '1' vs '3' → no.\n\nSubject 2: '2' vs '3' → no.\n\nSo count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 5\n91728\n11828\n11111\n\nWait, the sample input in the problem says:\n\nInput is ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], but the output is ['2','3'].\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the sample. Let me see.\n\nWait, no. In the note, the second sample test case is:\n\nEach student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nSo for each student, they have at least one subject where their mark is the maximum.\n\nSo in code, all three students are counted.\n\nSo the code should return 3.\n\nLet me see.\n\nStudents are ['91728', '11828', '11111'].\n\nCompute max_marks for each of the 5 subjects.\n\nSubject 0: '9', '1', '1' → max is '9'.\n\nSubject 1: '1', '1', '1' → max is '1'.\n\nSubject 2: '7', '8', '1' → max is '8'.\n\nSubject 3: '2', '8', '1' → max is '8'.\n\nSubject 4: '8', '8', '1' → max is '8'.\n\nSo max_marks = ['9', '1', '8', '8', '8'].\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: '91728'\n\nCheck each subject:\n\nSubject 0: '9' == '9' → yes. So count +=1.\n\nStudent 1: '11828'\n\nCheck subject 0: '1' != '9' → no.\n\nSubject 1: '1' == '1' → yes. So count +=1.\n\nStudent 2: '11111'\n\nCheck subject 0: '1' != '9' → no.\n\nSubject 1: '1' == '1' → yes. So count +=1.\n\nSo total count is 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, m=1.\n\nOnly one student and one subject. So he is the best. Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudent 1: '99'\nStudent 2: '99'\n\nFor each subject, both have 9. So both students are best in each subject. So count is 2.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudent 1: '91'\n\nStudent 2: '19'\n\nFor subject 0: max is '9' (student1). So student1 is best.\n\nSubject 1: max is '9' (student1). So student1 is best in both.\n\nSo student1 is successful. Student2: in subject 0, he has '1' <9, subject1, he has '9' which is equal to max. So student2 is also successful.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nWait, but in this case, for subject 1, both have 9? Or no, wait:\n\nWait, student1's subject1 is '1', student2's subject1 is '9'.\n\nSo for subject1, the max is '9' (from student2).\n\nSo student2 is best in subject1.\n\nStudent1 is best in subject0, student2 is best in subject1.\n\nSo both are successful.\n\nSo the code counts both.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: all students have the same marks in all subjects.\n\nLike n=3, m=2, all students have '11'.\n\nThen for each subject, the max is '1'.\n\nAll students are best in both subjects. So each is successful. So count is 3.\n\nAnother case: n=3, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n'19', '21', '31'.\n\nSubject0: '3' is max (from third student).\n\nSubject1: '3' is max (from third student).\n\nSo only the third student is best in both, but others are not. So count is 1.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 1.\n\nI think the code handles all cases.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, stripping each as a string.\n\nCompute for each subject, the max as a string.\n\nThen for each student, check each subject: if any mark equals the max for that subject, count them.\n\nSo the code is as I wrote earlier.\n\nWait, but in the code, when computing the max for each subject, I'm looping through each student and comparing their mark at that subject to find the max. That's O(m*n^2) time, but given that n and m are up to 100, 100*100^2=1e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, could I compute the max for each subject in a more efficient way?\n\nYes, but for the constraints given, it's not necessary.\n\nSo the code should handle everything.\n\nAnother thing: ensure that each student's string is exactly m characters long. But according to the problem statement, each line contains m characters, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
