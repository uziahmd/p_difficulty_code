She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two types of actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right, but within the currently available tabs. So if a tab is already closed, she can't move beyond it.\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. For example, if she closes to the left, all tabs before her current position (but not including the current one) are closed.\n\nI need to model the process and find the minimal steps required.\n\nHmm. So the key is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closures that leads to the desired state with the fewest steps.\n\nFirst, let's think about what needs to be done:\n\n- Any tabs to the left of l must be closed.\n- Any tabs to the right of r must be closed.\n\nSo the initial state is all tabs open. We need to end up with only [l, r] open.\n\nSo, the first step is to determine which tabs are outside [l, r] and need to be closed. That would be 1..(l-1) and (r+1)..n.\n\nWait, but perhaps some of these are already closed due to the movement? No, initially, all are open. So we have to close all tabs outside [l, r].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the strategy:\n\nOption 1: Move to the leftmost position in [l, r], then close all to the left. Then move to the rightmost, close all to the right. But perhaps there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to close either left or right first, depending on where 'pos' is located.\n\nWait, let's consider the initial position of the cursor, pos.\n\nIf pos is inside [l, r], then we can proceed. Otherwise, perhaps we need to adjust.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial position could be outside [l, r], but after moving, it can enter.\n\nWait, the initial position might be in the middle of the desired segment or not.\n\nLet me think through an example.\n\nTake the first sample input: 6 3 2 4.\n\nSo n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to leave 2,3,4 open. So she needs to close 1 and 5,6.\n\nHow does she do it?\n\nIn the sample explanation, she moves from 3 to 2 (1 second), then closes left (all tabs left of 2, which is just 1). Then she moves from 2 to 3 (second move?), wait, no—she's at 2, closing left would take her to 3, because after closing, the available tabs are 2,3,4. So she's now at 2, but after closing, the next move would be to 3, then to 4, then close right.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the sample:\n\nThe sample says: shift to 2 (1s), close left (all tabs left of 2, which is 1, so that's one second). Now, the cursor is at 2, but the available tabs are 2,3,4,5,6? Or does closing left affect the available tabs for movement?\n\nWait, when you close tabs to the left, all tabs to the left of the cursor (i.e., less than i) are closed. So after closing, the new 'a' (minimum index) becomes i. Similarly for closing to the right.\n\nSo in the first step, she moves to 2 (cost 1 sec). Then she closes left (cost 1 sec). Now, the available tabs are 2,3,4,5,6? No, because when you close left, all tabs before 2 are closed. So the available tabs become 2,3,4,5,6. Wait, but 2 was the position, so after closing, the left side is gone.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement constraints. Let me clarify:\n\nAfter each closure, the available tabs change, affecting where the cursor can move.\n\nFor example, suppose we're at position i, and we decide to close the left. Then all tabs less than i are closed. So the new a is i, meaning that the cursor can't move left anymore beyond i.\n\nSimilarly, closing the right would set b to i, so the cursor can't move right beyond i.\n\nSo the available tabs are determined by the current a and b, which are the min and max of the remaining open tabs.\n\nSo during the process, a and b change as tabs are closed.\n\nTherefore, the problem is dynamic, and each action affects the future possible movements.\n\nThis makes it a bit tricky.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the state as (current position, a, b), and the steps taken so far. We can model this as a BFS problem, where each state is a node, and each action (move left, move right, close left, close right) is an edge leading to another state.\n\nThe goal is to reach a state where a = l and b = r.\n\nThe minimal steps would be the shortest path from the initial state (pos, 1, n) to (any position within [l, r], l, r).\n\nSo, the plan is to model this as a graph and perform BFS.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, and the state includes a, b, and current position, the number of possible states is manageable.\n\nWait, but a and b can vary based on previous actions. So the state is (current_pos, a, b). But for our problem, we can note that a is the minimum of the open tabs, and b is the maximum. So each time you close some tabs, a and/or b may change.\n\nWait, but when you close left, a becomes the current position. Similarly for closing right.\n\nSo, the state can be represented by (current position, a, b). The initial state is (pos, 1, n).\n\nOur goal is to reach any state where a >= l and b <= r, and all tabs outside [l, r] are closed. Wait, actually, once a is l and b is r, then all tabs outside [l, r] are closed. So the goal is to reach a state where a = l and b = r.\n\nWait, but perhaps the tabs could have been closed in a way that a is l and b is r, but there are some tabs in between that are still open. No, because the problem requires that exactly the tabs from l to r are open. So yes, a must be l and b must be r.\n\nSo the target state is (x, l, r), where x is any position between l and r.\n\nNow, each action can change the state.\n\nLet me outline the possible actions:\n\n1. Move left: current_pos can be decreased by 1, but not below a.\n\n   So, new_pos = max(current_pos - 1, a)\n\n   Steps taken: 1.\n\n2. Move right: current_pos can be increased by 1, but not above b.\n\n   new_pos = min(current_pos + 1, b)\n\n   Steps taken: 1.\n\n3. Close left: All tabs to the left of current_pos are closed. So, a becomes current_pos.\n\n   new_a = current_pos\n\n   new_b remains the same.\n\n   Steps taken: 1.\n\n4. Close right: All tabs to the right of current_pos are closed. So, b becomes current_pos.\n\n   new_b = current_pos\n\n   new_a remains the same.\n\n   Steps taken: 1.\n\nEach of these transitions represents an action that can be taken in one second.\n\nWe need to model all possible states reachable via these transitions and find the shortest path to (x, l, r), where x is between l and r.\n\nSo, the algorithm is to perform BFS, keeping track of the visited states to avoid revisiting them.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Initialize a queue with the starting state (pos, 1, n), steps = 0.\n\n- For each state in the queue, explore all four possible actions.\n\n- For each action, compute the new state.\n\n- If the new state hasn't been visited before, add it to the queue with steps + 1.\n\n- If the new state is the target state (a == l and b == r), return the steps taken.\n\n- Continue until the target is found.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 100, the possible a and b values are up to 100 as well. So the number of possible states is 100 (positions) * 100 (a) * 100 (b) = 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nWe can represent the visited states with a 3D array or a dictionary.\n\nBut in Python, using a dictionary might be more efficient, or perhaps a 3D list.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent each state as a tuple (current_pos, a, b). We'll use a queue to manage the BFS, and a set to track visited states.\n\nNow, for each state, we generate the next possible states by applying the four actions.\n\nLet's see an example.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4.\n\nInitial state is (3, 1, 6), steps=0.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n1. Move left to 2 (since a=1, current_pos=3). New state (2, 1, 6), steps=1.\n\n2. Move right to 4 (since b=6, current_pos=3). New state (4, 1,6), steps=1.\n\n3. Close left: new a=3. State (3,3,6), steps=1.\n\n4. Close right: new b=3. State (3,1,3), steps=1.\n\nWait, but after closing right, the b is 3. So any tabs beyond 3 are closed, but in the initial state, the tabs were 1-6. So after closing right at 3, the open tabs are 1-3. But according to the problem statement, the required is l=2, r=4. So this action isn't sufficient.\n\nSo, the first sample's optimal path is:\n\nMove to 2 (step 1), close left (step 2). Now a=2, so open tabs are 2-6.\n\nThen move to 3 (step 3), move to 4 (step4), close right (step5). Now, the open tabs are 2-4. So total steps 5.\n\nSo the BFS would find this path.\n\nSo, the BFS approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nWe'll read n, pos, l, r from input.\n\nWe need to handle cases where l == r, which means no tabs need to be closed. In that case, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nImplement BFS:\n\nInitialize a queue with the initial state (pos, 1, n), steps 0.\n\nUse a visited set to track seen states.\n\nFor each state, apply all four possible actions.\n\nFor each action, calculate the new state.\n\nIf the new state is (x, l, r), return steps + 1.\n\nElse, if the new state hasn't been visited, add it to the queue.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nWe can represent the queue as a deque, handling each state in BFS order.\n\nNow, some corner cases:\n\nCase 1: l == r. Then no action needed. Output 0.\n\nCase 2: pos is already in [l, r]. So she can start moving towards l and r, and close the necessary tabs.\n\nCase 3: pos is outside [l, r]. She needs to move into the [l, r] segment, then close the necessary tabs.\n\nAnother case: l > pos. She needs to move to l, then close left.\n\nOr, perhaps, move to some point, close right, then move to l, then close left.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to move to l and then close left, which would require closing all tabs to the left of l. Then, she can move to r, and close right.\n\nBut sometimes, it's better to close one side first, then the other.\n\nSo, the BFS will explore all possibilities and find the minimal steps.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nRead the inputs:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nIf l == r:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   proceed with BFS.\n\nImplement BFS:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\nvisited = set()\n\nqueue = deque()\n\nstart_state = (pos, 1, n)\n\nqueue.append( (start_state[0], start_state[1], start_state[2], 0) )\n\nWait, or perhaps, represent each state as (current_pos, a, b), and steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to store the current_pos, a, b, and steps.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nEach element in the queue is a tuple (current_pos, a, b, steps).\n\nSo, the initial state is (pos, 1, n, 0).\n\nThe visited set will contain tuples (current_pos, a, b).\n\nSo, for each state, we'll explore all four possible actions.\n\nLet's code this:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == r:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # BFS setup\n\n    queue = deque()\n\n    visited = set()\n\n    initial_a = 1\n\n    initial_b = n\n\n    initial_pos = pos\n\n    queue.append( (initial_pos, initial_a, initial_b, 0) )\n\n    visited.add( (initial_pos, initial_a, initial_b) )\n\n    found = False\n\n    while queue:\n\n        current_pos, a, b, steps = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if this state is the target\n\n        if a == l and b == r:\n\n            print(steps)\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n        # Generate all possible next states\n\n        # Action 1: move left\n\n        new_pos = max(current_pos - 1, a)\n\n        new_a = a\n\n        new_b = b\n\n        if (new_pos, new_a, new_b) not in visited:\n\n            visited.add( (new_pos, new_a, new_b) )\n\n            queue.append( (new_pos, new_a, new_b, steps + 1) )\n\n        # Action 2: move right\n\n        new_pos = min(current_pos + 1, b)\n\n        new_a = a\n\n        new_b = b\n\n        if (new_pos, new_a, new_b) not in visited:\n\n            visited.add( (new_pos, new_a, new_b) )\n\n            queue.append( (new_pos, new_a, new_b, steps + 1) )\n\n        # Action 3: close left\n\n        new_a_close = current_pos\n\n        new_b_close = b\n\n        new_pos_close = current_pos # after closing, the cursor is at current_pos\n\n        if (new_pos_close, new_a_close, new_b_close) not in visited:\n\n            visited.add( (new_pos_close, new_a_close, new_b_close) )\n\n            queue.append( (new_pos_close, new_a_close, new_b_close, steps + 1) )\n\n        # Action 4: close right\n\n        new_a_close = a\n\n        new_b_close = current_pos\n\n        new_pos_close = current_pos\n\n        if (new_pos_close, new_a_close, new_b_close) not in visited:\n\n            visited.add( (new_pos_close, new_a_close, new_b_close) )\n\n            queue.append( (new_pos_close, new_a_close, new_b_close, steps + 1) )\n\n    if not found:\n\n        # This should not happen as per the problem statement, but just in case\n\n        print(-1)\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that l and r are within 1..n, and pos is also in that range. So the initial state is valid.\n\nBut what if the initial state is (pos, 1, n), and l and r are such that a and b cannot reach l and r? Like, for example, l=5, r=7, and n=8, but pos is 3. So she needs to close 1-4 and 8.\n\nBut in the BFS, she can move to 5, close left (tabs 1-4 closed), then move to 7, close right (tab 8 closed). So it's possible.\n\nWait, but in the code above, when she closes left at 5, the a becomes 5. Then, she can move right to 7, but the b is initially 8. After closing right at 7, the b becomes 7, so the tabs 8 are closed.\n\nSo the code should correctly model that.\n\nTesting the code against the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4.\n\nThe code should find the steps as 5.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 4-6.\n\nIn the initial state, a=1, b=6. pos=3.\n\nShe can choose to close right (tabs 4-6), which takes 1 step. So the state becomes (3,1,3). a=1, b=3, which is l=1, r=3. So steps=1.\n\nSample Input 3:5 2 1 5. So she doesn't need to close anything. Output 0.\n\nSo the code should handle these correctly.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=5. She needs to close nothing, so steps 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=5. So she needs to close tabs 1-2.\n\nWhat's the minimal steps?\n\nShe can close left, which is at 3. That's 1 step. So the answer is 1.\n\nYes, because after closing left, a=3, which is within [3,5], and the desired a is 3 and b is5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1-2 and 6-7.\n\nShe can:\n\n1. Close right (tabs 6-7 closed, steps 1). Now, b=5.\n\nThen, she needs to close tabs 1-2.\n\nShe is at 4, but a is 1. So she can move to 3 (step 2), then close left (step3). So total steps 3.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nShe can move to 3 (steps 2), then close left (step3), then close right (step4). So 4 steps.\n\nSo the minimal is 3 steps.\n\nSo the BFS should find that.\n\nIn code, the BFS would explore all possibilities and find the minimal steps.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The initial code may not correctly model the new a and b after each action.\n\nWait, in the code, when she performs an action, the new a and b are computed correctly.\n\nLike, when she closes left, new_a is current_pos, but new_b remains the same as before.\n\nSimilarly, when she closes right, new_b is current_pos, a remains the same.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother potential issue is whether the movement is correctly constrained by a and b.\n\nFor example, after some closures, the cursor can't move beyond a or b.\n\nYes, the code correctly uses max and min when moving.\n\nWait, for moving left: new_pos is max(current_pos -1, a). Because a is the current minimum, so you can't go below a.\n\nSimilarly for moving right: new_pos is min(current_pos +1, b).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4.\n\nThe code will find the steps as 5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:6 3 1 3.\n\nSteps:1.\n\nSample3:\n\nInput:5 2 1 5.\n\nSteps:0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=5.\n\nDesired steps:1.\n\nIn code:\n\nStart state (3,1,5,0).\n\nCheck if a=1 ==3? No.\n\nThen, possible actions:\n\n1. Move left: 2, a=1, b=5, steps 1.\n\nBut that's not helpful.\n\n2. Move right:4, steps 1.\n\n3. Close left: new state (3,3,5, 1). Now a=3, which is equal to l=3. So when this state is added to the queue, when it's processed, the code will check if a == l and b == r. Since r is 5, and b is 5, yes. So steps=1 is output.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The approach involves using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible states and actions efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Luba can either move the cursor left or right within the current range of open tabs or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Each action takes one second. The goal is to leave only the tabs from l to r open.\n2. **State Representation**: Each state is represented by the current position of the cursor, the minimum index of an open tab (a), and the maximum index of an open tab (b). The initial state starts with the cursor at position `pos`, with all tabs open (a=1, b=n).\n3. **BFS Algorithm**: We use BFS to explore all possible states. Each state transition corresponds to one of four possible actions: moving left, moving right, closing all tabs to the left, or closing all tabs to the right. Each transition takes one second.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The BFS terminates when we reach a state where the minimum and maximum indices of open tabs are exactly l and r, respectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == r:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    queue = deque()\n    visited = set()\n    \n    initial_a = 1\n    initial_b = n\n    initial_pos = pos\n    \n    queue.append((initial_pos, initial_a, initial_b, 0))\n    visited.add((initial_pos, initial_a, initial_b))\n    \n    found = False\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_pos, a, b, steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if a == l and b == r:\n            print(steps)\n            found = True\n            break\n        \n        # Move left\n        new_pos = max(current_pos - 1, a)\n        if (new_pos, a, b) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_pos, a, b))\n            queue.append((new_pos, a, b, steps + 1))\n        \n        # Move right\n        new_pos = min(current_pos + 1, b)\n        if (new_pos, a, b) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_pos, a, b))\n            queue.append((new_pos, a, b, steps + 1))\n        \n        # Close left\n        new_a = current_pos\n        if (current_pos, new_a, b) not in visited:\n            visited.add((current_pos, new_a, b))\n            queue.append((current_pos, new_a, b, steps + 1))\n        \n        # Close right\n        new_b = current_pos\n        if (current_pos, a, new_b) not in visited:\n            visited.add((current_pos, a, new_b))\n            queue.append((current_pos, a, new_b, steps + 1))\n    \n    if not found:\n        print(-1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start from the initial state where the cursor is at `pos`, with all tabs open (a=1, b=n).\n- **BFS Queue**: Each element in the queue holds the current position, the minimum and maximum indices of open tabs, and the number of steps taken so far.\n- **State Transitions**: For each state, we generate new states by considering all possible actions (moving left, moving right, closing left, closing right). Each new state is checked for whether it has been visited before.\n- **Termination Check**: If we reach a state where the open tabs are exactly [l, r], we print the number of steps taken and terminate.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the shortest path (minimum steps) to achieve the desired state efficiently using BFS.",
