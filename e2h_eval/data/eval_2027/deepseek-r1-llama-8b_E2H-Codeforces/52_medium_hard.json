Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for exactly one hour and then goes out. But the smart part is that he can collect the burned-out candles and trade them in. Specifically, he can make 'b' of these gone candles into a new one. So, each time he has enough gone candles, he can create more and burn them, thus extending the total hours.\n\nMy task is to compute the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit by optimally managing the candles.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The initial step is straightforward: he burns all 'a' candles, which gives 'a' hours and 'a' gone candles.\n\nBut then, for every 'b' gone candles, he can make one new candle. So, after the initial burn, he can convert some of the gone candles into new ones, which when burned, add to the count, and also increase the number of gone candles again.\n\nThis seems like a loop where we keep track of the remaining candles and the gone ones, and each time, we convert as many as possible from gone to new candles.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with total_hours = a.\n2. Start with leftover = a (since all a candles are used and gone).\n3. While leftover >= b:\n   a. Convert leftover // b to new candles. Add this number to total_hours.\n   b. Update leftover: (leftover % b) + (new_candles) because those new candles, once burned, will become gone again.\n4. Repeat until leftover < b.\n\nWait, wait. Because each new candle, when burned, adds 1 hour and becomes a gone candle. So, for example, if you have x new candles, you can burn each for an hour, adding x hours, and then you'll have x new gone candles.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\n- We take the leftover, divide by b to get how many new candles we can make.\n- Add that number to total_hours.\n- Then, the leftover becomes the remainder of (leftover // b) * b plus the new candles made because they will now be gone.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you make new_candles from leftover, you spend b per new candle. So, the new_candles is leftover // b. The leftover becomes (leftover % b). But then, when you burn the new_candles, each contributes 1 hour and becomes a gone candle. So the new leftovers are (leftover % b) + new_candles.\n\nAh, right. That's why the process continues.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 4 2\n\nInitial total_hours =4. Leftover=4.\n\nLoop:\nleftover >=2.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total_hours +=2 →6.\n\nLeftover becomes (4%2)+(2)=0+2=2.\n\nNext iteration: 2>=2.\n\nnew_candles=1. total_hours +=1→7.\n\nLeftover becomes (2%2)+(1)=0+1=1.\n\nNow, 1 <2, so loop ends.\n\nTotal is 7, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 6 3.\n\nInitial: 6, total=6, leftover=6.\n\n6//3=2. total becomes 8.\n\nLeftover: (6%3)+(2)=0+2=2.\n\n2<3, loop ends. Total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nGreat, so the logic works for samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: a=1, b=1000. So he burns 1 hour, gets 1 gone. Can't make any new, so total is 1.\n\nCase 2: a=5, b=5.\n\nBurn 5, get 5 gone. Make 1 new (5//5=1), burn it, adding 1 hour. Now, leftover is (5%5=0) +1=1. No more.\n\nTotal:5+1=6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nBurn 10, left=10.\n\n10//3=3, total becomes 13. Leftover:10%3=1 +3=4.\n\n4//3=1, total 14. Leftover:4%3=1 +1=2.\n\n2<3. So total is 14.\n\nYes, because 10 +3 +1=14.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead two integers a and b from input.\n\nCompute the total as per the steps above.\n\nBut wait, what if b is 1? Oh, but according to the problem statement, b is at least 2. So we don't need to handle that case.\n\nSo, code structure:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nleftover = a\n\nwhile leftover >= b:\n\n    new = leftover // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    leftover = (leftover % b) + new\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now write the code.\n\nIn Python, read from stdin. Since the input comes as a single line, perhaps split into a and b.\n\nLike:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, proceed.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, but in the sample, the input is ['4 2', '6 3'] and output is ['7', '8']. So, perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nLooking back: the problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" The input is \"the single line contains two integers a and b\".\n\nSo, the input is a single line with two integers. So, the code reads a and b from that line.\n\nSo, the code should read a and b, compute the total, and print it.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me write it.\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute as per the steps.\n\nPrint the total.\n\nTesting the code with the samples:\n\nSample 1: 4 2 →7.\n\nSample 2:6 3→8.\n\nWhich works.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5 →6.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: a=10, b=3→14.\n\nYes.\n\nEdge case a=1, b=2→1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2.\n\nInitial total=2, leftover=2.\n\nnew=1, total=3. Leftover=0 +1=1. Loop ends.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, the Python code is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a, leftover = a.\n\nLoop while leftover >=b:\n\n   new = leftover //b\n\n   total += new\n\n   leftover = (leftover %b ) + new\n\nPrint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is simple.\n\nNow, writing it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can create new candles from the stubs of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`, which will burn for exactly `a` hours.\n2. **Recycle Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. For every `b` stubs, Vasily can create a new candle. This process continues until the number of stubs is less than `b`.\n3. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Use a loop to repeatedly convert stubs into new candles and burn them. Each time new candles are created, add the number of hours they will burn to the total. Update the count of stubs accordingly by considering both the remainder of the division and the new stubs created from burning the newly formed candles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nleftover = a\n\nwhile leftover >= b:\n    new = leftover // b\n    total += new\n    leftover = (leftover % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.\n- **Initialization**: The total hours start with `a` because each candle burns for exactly one hour.\n- **Loop**: While there are enough stubs (`leftover`) to create at least one new candle, the loop continues. In each iteration, calculate how many new candles can be made, add these to the total hours, and update the stub count to include both the remainder from the division and the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n- **Termination**: The loop exits when there are not enough stubs to make another new candle, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iteratively recycling stubs until it's no longer possible, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
