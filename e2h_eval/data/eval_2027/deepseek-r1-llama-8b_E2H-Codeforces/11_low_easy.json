A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on these resources.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nWe have n friends. They bought k bottles of drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nFor salt, they have p grams.\n\nEach toast per friend needs nl milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast. So for each toast, all friends take some amount. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, wait. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt for each toast. So for one toast, each friend requires these amounts. So for a total of t toasts, each friend will have t * nl ml, t * 1 slice, and t * np grams.\n\nBut since there are n friends, the total resources needed would be:\n\nTotal drink required: t * n * nl\nTotal lime slices: t * n (since each friend uses one per toast)\nTotal salt: t * n * np\n\nSo the maximum t is constrained by the available resources divided by their respective usages.\n\nSo let's compute each resource's contribution to the maximum possible t.\n\nFirst, total drink: k * l. The maximum toasts based on drink is (k*l) / (n * nl). Because each toast requires n * nl ml (since each of the n friends takes nl).\n\nSimilarly, the total lime slices are c*d. Each toast requires n slices (each friend one), so maximum based on limes is (c*d) / n.\n\nSalt: p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum based on salt is p / (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l.\n2. Calculate max_toast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl). But we have to use integer division because you can't have a fraction of a toast.\n3. Calculate total_lime = c * d.\n4. max_toast_lime = total_lime // n. Again, integer division.\n5. Calculate max_toast_salt = p // (n * np).\n6. The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's see:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. Total drink is 20ml.\n\nEach toast per friend needs 3ml. So per toast, total drink needed is 3*3=9ml.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend uses nl=3ml. So per toast, n friends use n * nl ml. So 3*3=9ml per toast.\n\nSo 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (n=3). 80/3=26.666 → 26. But in the note, it says 80 toasts. Wait, wait, no. Wait in the note, it says the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts. Oh wait, perhaps I misunderstood the lime part. So each toast only needs one slice per friend, but how is that? Wait no, each friend needs a slice per toast. So for t toasts, each friend has t slices. But the total limes used is t * n.\n\nSo the total limes is c*d = 10*8=80. So for t toasts, each friend uses t slices, so total slices used is t * n. So t must be <= 80 / (n) → 80 /3 is about 26.666, so 26 toasts based on limes.\n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait wait, no. Let me re-examine the note:\n\nIn the first sample, the friends have 4*5=20ml of drink. 20 /3 (nl=3ml per friend",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Constraints**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - One slice of lime per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters.\n   - Total lime slices available is `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available is `p` grams.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts per Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: The maximum number of toasts based on drink is `(total_drink) // (n * nl)`, where `n * nl` is the total drink required per toast.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The maximum number of toasts based on lime slices is `(total_limes) // n`, as each toast requires one slice per friend.\n   - **Salt**: The maximum number of toasts based on salt is `p // (n * np)`, where `n * np` is the total salt required per toast.\n\n4. **Compute the Result**: The result is the minimum value derived from the above calculations, as it represents the limiting factor for the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoasts_lime = total_lime // n\n\ntoasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: Compute the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n- **Maximum Toasts Calculation**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be made based on the available quantity and the required amount per toast.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the three calculated values gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all constraints are satisfied.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of toasts by considering each resource constraint individually and then taking the minimum, which ensures no resource is overutilized.",
