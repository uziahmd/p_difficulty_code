And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So doing something O(n^2) would probably be too slow.\n\nWait, let's think about what a week is. A week is any k consecutive days in the list of n days. For example, if n=3 and k=2, there are two weeks: days 1-2 and 2-3.\n\nSo the total number of weeks is (n - k + 1). For each of these weeks, I need to sum their sleep times and then find the average.\n\nBut wait, if I do this naively by sliding a window of size k and adding each time, that would be O(n*k), which is not feasible when n is 2e5 and k is 2e5 as well. That would be 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nI need a smarter approach. Oh right! There's a sliding window technique where you can compute the sum of each window in O(1) time after the initial computation. This way, the total time complexity becomes O(n), which is manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the first window (the first k elements).\n2. Add this sum to a running total.\n3. Then, slide the window one element at a time: subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element entering.\n4. For each new window, add its sum to the running total.\n5. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of weeks to get the average.\n\nThat makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n- Read n and k from input.\n- Read the list of a_i.\n- Compute the initial sum of the first window.\n- Add this to the total.\n- For each i from k to n-1:\n   - Subtract a[i-k] from the current sum.\n   - Add a[i] to the current sum.\n   - Add the current sum to the total.\n- Finally, compute the average by dividing the total by (n - k + 1).\n\nWait, but wait. Wait no—the initial sum is the first window. Then, for each step, we slide by one, adding the next element and subtracting the one before. So for the second window, which is days 2..k+1, we do sum = sum - a[1] + a[k+1], right?\n\nYes. So that logic will correctly compute each window's sum.\n\nOnce I have the total sum, I just divide by the number of weeks (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nNow, about handling the output: the average needs to be printed with at least six decimal digits. So I'll format it accordingly.\n\nLet me think about some test cases.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nFirst case:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe two weeks are [3,4] sum 7 and [4,7] sum 11. Total 18, average 9. So output 9.000000...\n\nSecond case:\n\n1 1\n\n10 → only one week, sum is 10.\n\nThird case:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nWait, n=8, k=2. So number of weeks is 8-2+1=7.\n\nEach window:\n\n[1,2] →3\n\n[2,4] →6\n\n[4,100000] →100004\n\n[100000, 123] →100123\n\n[123,456] →579\n\n[456,789] →1245\n\n[789,1] →790\n\nWait, let me compute each sum:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nSumming all these:\n\n3 +6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201960; +790=202,750.\n\nWait, 3+6 is 9, plus 100004 is 100,013. Plus 100,123 is 200,136. Then add 579: 200,715. Add 1245: 201,960. Add 790: 202,750.\n\nTotal sum is 202,750.\n\nDivide by 7: 202750 /7",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks of k consecutive days from a given list of sleep times for n days. The solution must be efficient and handle large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each week's sleep time. This allows us to maintain an O(n) time complexity.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first window of k days.\n3. **Window Sliding**: For each subsequent window, update the sum by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the new element that is entering the window.\n4. **Total Sum Accumulation**: Keep a running total of all window sums.\n5. **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sum by the number of weeks to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    \n    if k == n:\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(sum(a) / 1))\n        return\n    \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total = current_sum\n    for i in range(k, n):\n        current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n        total += current_sum\n    \n    avg = total / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string split into parts, which is then parsed into integers and lists.\n- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first window of k elements is computed.\n- **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by subtracting the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element.\n- **Total Sum and Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is maintained, and the average is computed by dividing this total by the number of weeks.\n- **Output**: The result is formatted to ensure it meets the precision requirement of six decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
