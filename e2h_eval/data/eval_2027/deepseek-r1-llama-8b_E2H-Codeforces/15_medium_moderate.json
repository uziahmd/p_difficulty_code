They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find all winning integers x such that there's a permutation p of 1 to 2^n where the team with skill x becomes the champion. The tournament structure is a knockout style with each phase determining which teams move on based on the given string s.\n\nFirst, let me understand the tournament structure and how the phases work. The tournament has n phases. In phase i (starting from 0?), the number of games is 2^{n-i}, right? Wait, no. Wait, the first phase has 2^{n-1} games because it's split into pairs. Then each next phase reduces the number of teams by half, so phase i has 2^{n - i -1} games. But the string s is of length n, so for each phase i from 0 to n-1, s[i] determines whether higher or lower skill wins in that phase.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: s_i corresponds to the i-th phase, which has 2^{n-i} games. Because the first phase has 2^{n-1} games, which is when i=0, 2^{3-0} = 8 for n=3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input, n is 3, and s is \"101\". So the string has 3 characters, which correspond to 3 phases.\n\nPhase 1 (i=0) has 2^{3-0} = 8 games? No, wait, no. Wait, the first phase has 2^{n-1} games. For n=3, that's 4 games. So perhaps the phases are counted starting from 1 to n, but the string s is length n, so s[0] is phase 1, s[1] phase 2, etc. Hmm, I think I need to clarify.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe tournament consists of 2^n - 1 games. They are held as follows: first phase, 2^{n-1} games. Then, the second phase has 2^{n-2} games, and so on until one remains.\n\nWait, so the phases are numbered from 1 to n. Each phase has 2^{n - phase_number} games. For example, phase 1 has 2^{n-1} games, phase 2 has 2^{n-2}, ..., phase n has 1 game.\n\nThe string s is of length n, and s_i is 0 or 1. So for each phase i (from 0 to n-1), s[i] corresponds to phase i+1. So for i=0, it's phase 1; for i=1, phase 2, etc.\n\nSo for each phase j (from 1 to n), s[j-1] indicates whether higher or lower skill wins.\n\nNow, the problem is to determine for which x (1 ≤ x ≤ 2^n) there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nTo model this, I think we can model the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a game, and the leaves are the initial matches in phase 1. The root is the final game determining the champion.\n\nEach game has a winner, which is determined by the rules of the phase it's in. The phase's rule is determined by s[i], where i is the phase index minus 1.\n\nBut since the permutation p is a permutation of skills, the order in which teams are paired affects who wins and progresses further. So, the problem reduces to arranging the teams in such a way that after processing all phases according to the rules, x is the last remaining team.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can model it using a bitmask approach or dynamic programming. However, considering that n can be up to 18, 2^18 is about 260k, which is manageable for some approaches but may require optimizations.\n\nWait, 2^18 is 262,144. So any solution that is O(2^18 * n^2) would be acceptable, perhaps.\n\nHmm, perhaps a recursive approach where for each phase, we decide which teams proceed based on the rules, and track possible winners.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the tournament as a series of rounds, where each round reduces the number of teams based on the phase's rule.\n\nWait, but the order in which the teams are paired depends on the permutation p. So the permutation must be arranged in such a way that, after applying all the phase rules, x is the champion.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to model the tournament as a binary elimination tree, and for each node (game) determine which two teams could end up facing each other, and what the outcome would be based on the phase's rule.\n\nWait, but the phase's rule depends on the phase level. Each phase corresponds to a certain level of the tournament tree. So, for each game in phase j, the rule is s[j-1].\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a game. The leaves are the initial matches, and each internal node is the result of a game whose children are the sub-games from the previous phase.\n\nFor example, for n=3, the tournament has 7 games:\n\nPhase 1 (s[0]): 4 games, each pair.\nPhase 2 (s[1]): 2 games, each combining the winners of two pairs.\nPhase 3 (s[2]): 1 game, combining the two winners.\n\nSo the structure is like:\n\n- Level 0 (phase 1): 4 games (each pair)\n- Level 1 (phase 2): 2 games (each combines two winners from level 0)\n- Level 2 (phase 3): 1 game (combines two winners from level 1)\n\nSo, the depth is n levels.\n\nEach game in level j is determined by the games in level j-1 that feed into it.\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange the permutation p such that, after processing each level according to s[j] (for j starting at 0 for phase 1), the champion is x.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the possible set of teams that can reach each node in the tournament tree, considering the rules of each phase.\n\nWait, perhaps for each game node, we can track the set of possible skill values that can emerge as the winner of that game, given the current state of the tournament.\n\nBut since the tournament structure is fixed (the pairing depends on the phase's rule), perhaps the way to model it is to build the tournament tree and then for each node, determine the possible winners based on the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each phase, the way the teams are paired is determined by the structure of the tournament.\n\nWait, but the pairing isn't arbitrary. It's based on the structure of the tournament. For phase j, the number of games is 2^{n-j}, and each game is between consecutive pairs of teams in the current list.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The initial teams are 1, 2, 3, ..., 2^n.\n\nIn phase 1, they are paired as 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So the winners of these games form the next set of teams.\n\nIn phase 2, the winners from phase 1 are again paired as 1st winner vs 2nd winner, 3rd vs 4th, etc.\n\nSo, the way teams are paired in each phase is determined by their position in the current list.\n\nThus, the tournament structure is a fixed binary tree, where each non-leaf node has exactly two children (the games that feed into it). The leaves are the initial matches.\n\nTherefore, the tournament is a complete binary tree with height n, and each node is a game.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: for each node in the tournament tree, determine the possible winner(s) based on the rules of its phase, and propagate these possibilities up the tree.\n\nBut wait, the phase of a node is determined by its depth in the tree. For example, the leaves are phase 1, their parents are phase 2, etc., up to the root being phase n.\n\nSo, for each node at depth d (starting from 0 for the leaves), the phase is d+1. So, the rule for that phase is s[d], since the phases are 1-based and the string is 0-based.\n\nWait, no. Wait, phase 1 is the first phase, which is the leaves, so their depth is 0. Phase 2 is the next level up, which is depth 1. So for a node at depth d, the phase is d+1, and the corresponding s character is s[d].\n\nYes, because for phase 1, d=0, s[0]; phase 2, d=1, s[1]; etc.\n\nSo, for each node, depending on its phase (d+1), the rule is either higher or lower skill wins.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree as a binary tree. Each node is a game, with left and right children being the two games that feed into it.\n\n2. For each node, starting from the leaves and moving up, determine the possible winners based on the phase's rule.\n\n3. For a node, the possible winners depend on the possible winners of its two children. For example, if a node is a higher-skill-win node, then its winner is the maximum of the two children's winners. If it's a lower-skill-win node, then the winner is the minimum.\n\nBut wait, the phase's rule determines the outcome of the game. So, for a node in phase d+1, which is determined by s[d], the rule is: if s[d] is '0', then in each match, the lower-skilled team wins. So, for a parent node, the winner is the minimum of the two children's winners. If s[d] is '1', the winner is the maximum.\n\nSo, for each node, the winner is determined by the rule of its phase.\n\nSo, the process is to process each node in a bottom-up manner. For each node, based on the rule of its phase, compute the possible winners by taking the min or max of its children's winners.\n\nWait, but how do the children's winners contribute to the parent's winner? Because the children's winners are themselves determined by their own phase's rules.\n\nWait, but the children's winners are sets of possible skill values. So, for each node, the possible winners are the combination of the possible winners of the children, processed according to the phase's rule.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winners are the set {f(left_child) op f(right_child)}, where op is min or max depending on the phase's rule.\n\nWait, but for a node in phase d+1, which has rule s[d], the node's possible winners are the result of applying s[d] to the possible winners of its two children.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winners are computed as:\n\nif s[d] == '0':\n    winners = {min(a, b) for a in left_winners, for b in right_winners}\nelse:\n    winners = {max(a, b) for a in left_winners, for b in right_winners}\n\nWait, but wait. The left and right children are the two games that feed into the parent. So, the parent's winner is determined by the two winners from each child.\n\nWait, for example, if the parent is a '1' phase (higher wins), then the parent's winner is the maximum of the two children's winners.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winners are the combinations of the children's possible winners, combined using the phase's rule.\n\nBut this leads to a problem. For a node, the possible winners are all possible combinations of the children's winners under the phase's rule.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winners are the union of all possible results of applying the phase's rule to any pair of winners from the children.\n\nBut this can get very computationally intensive, especially for large n. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of nodes is 2^{n} - 1, which is about 260k for n=18. But for each node, the number of possible winners can be up to 2^18, which is 260k as well. So, for each node, processing this would take O(m^2) time, where m is the number of possible winners per child, which is too slow.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Maybe for each node, we can track not the exact set of possible winners, but a way to represent them compactly, perhaps using intervals or some other structure that allows us to compute the min or max efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, the possible winners can be represented as an interval [low, high], where all possible winners fall within this range. Or perhaps, more precisely, the set of possible winners is a contiguous range of integers.\n\nWait, let's think about how the possible winners propagate through the tree.\n\nSuppose in a node, the phase is '0' (lower wins). Then, the winner is the minimum of the two children's winners. So, the possible winners for the parent are all the min(a, b) where a is a possible winner of the left child and b is a possible winner of the right child.\n\nIf the left child's winners are in [L1, R1], and the right's are [L2, R2], then the min can vary between min(L1, L2) and max(R1, R2), but perhaps not all values in between are possible. Hmm, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, if the left can have any value between 5 and 10, and the right can have any between 3 and 8, then the min can be as low as 3 and as high as 8. But in reality, the min can take any value between 3 and 8, assuming the permutation can be arranged to allow any combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the possible winners for a node can be represented as a range [A, B], where A is the minimal possible winner and B is the maximal possible. But I'm not sure if this is always the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, the possible winners can be represented as the union of certain ranges, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps for the root node, the possible winners are a single value, x. Because the root is the champion. So, for the root node, the possible winners are just x. But to find which x's are possible, we need to see if x can be achieved by the root's possible winners.\n\nBut how do we model the possible winners for each node?\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is to consider that the tournament is a binary tree, and for each node, the possible winners are a subset of the permutation. But this is too vague.\n\nWait, maybe we can model each node's possible winners as a set, and for each node, compute this set based on its children.\n\nBut for n=18, the number of nodes is 2^18-1 = 262143. For each node, storing a set of size 2^18 is impossible due to memory constraints.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each node, the possible winners can be represented as a range [a, b], indicating that all integers in [a, b] are possible winners for that node. Then, for each node, based on the phase rule, compute the new range.\n\nBut is this possible? Let's see.\n\nConsider a node with phase rule '0' (lower wins). Its children have ranges [c1_low, c1_high] and [c2_low, c2_high]. The possible min of any a in c1 and b in c2 is min(a, b).\n\nWhat is the minimal possible value of min(a, b)? It's min(c1_low, c2_low). What is the maximal possible value of min(a, b)? It's max(c1_high, c2_high)?\n\nWait, no. Suppose c1_high is larger than c2_high. Then the min(a, b) can't exceed c2_high. So the maximum min(a,b) is c2_high, regardless of c1_high.\n\nSimilarly, if c2_high is smaller than c1_high, then the min can't be larger than c2_high.\n\nSo, the maximum possible min(a, b) is min(c1_high, c2_high). Because if a is as large as possible and b is as small as possible, then min(a, b) is min(c1_high, c2_high). Wait, no, that's not correct. For example, if c1 has [3,5], c2 has [4,6]. Then min can be as low as 3 (when a=3, b=4) and as high as 5 (if a=5, b=6, but then min is 5). So the max is 5, which is the c1_high.\n\nWait, so the maximum possible min(a, b) is the minimum of the two maximums. No, that doesn't fit. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the maximum possible min(a, b) would be when a and b are as large as possible, but the min is as large as possible. So, the maximum min is the minimum of the two individual maximums.\n\nBecause suppose a can be as large as A, and b can be as large as B. The min(a, b) can't be larger than min(A, B).\n\nSo, for phase '0' nodes, the new possible winner range is [min(c1_low, c2_low), min(c1_high, c2_high)].\n\nWait, no. Because the min can be anything in the range between the minima and the minimum of the maxima. For example, if c1 is [3, 5], c2 is [4, 6], then the min can be as low as 3 (3 and 4), and as high as 5 (5 and 6). So the possible min values are 3,4,5.\n\nBut the min of c1 is 3, min of c2 is 4. The maximum min is 5.\n\nSo the possible min values form a continuous range from 3 to 5.\n\nSo, the possible min can be represented as [3,5], which is the same as the min of the two minima is 3, and the maximum min is 5.\n\nSo, for a phase '0' node, the possible winner range is [min(c1_min, c2_min), min(c1_max, c2_max)].\n\nWait, no. Because in the example above, the min of c1_min and c2_min is 3, and the min of c1_max and c2_max is 5. So the range is [3,5], which correctly captures the possible min values.\n\nSimilarly, for phase '1' nodes (max wins), the possible winners are the max of a and b. So, the min of the ranges is the min of the two maxima, and the max is the max of the two maxima.\n\nWait, let's see: for phase '1' node, the possible winners are the max(a, b), where a is from c1's range and b is from c2's range.\n\nThe minimal possible max is the maximum of the two minima. Because, the smallest max is when a is as small as possible and b is as small as possible, but wait, no. For example, if c1 is [3,5], c2 is [4,6], then the possible max values are:\n\nmax(3,4)=7, max(3,6)=6, max(5,4)=5, max(5,6)=6. So the possible max values are 5,6,7. So the range is [5,7].\n\nWhich is the maximum of the minima (3 and 4 →4) to the maximum of the maxima (5 and 6 →6). Wait, no. Wait, the max of the minima is 3 and 4 is 4, but the minimal max is 5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's re-examine.\n\nWhen the phase is '1' (higher wins), the possible winners are the maximum of a and b, where a is in c1's range and b is in c2's range.\n\nWhat's the minimal possible max(a, b)? It's the maximum of the two minima. Because the smallest a and b can be is their respective minima, and the max of those is the smallest possible max.\n\nWhat's the maximal possible max(a, b)? It's the maximum of the two maxima. Because a can be as large as c1_max and b as large as c2_max, so their max is the maximum of the two.\n\nSo, for a phase '1' node, the possible winner range is [max(c1_min, c2_min), max(c1_max, c2_max)].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFor a node in phase d+1 (s[d] is '0' or '1'):\n\n- If s[d] is '0' (lower wins), the possible winner range is [min(c1_min, c2_min), min(c1_max, c2_max)].\n- If s[d] is '1' (higher wins), the possible winner range is [max(c1_min, c2_min), max(c1_max, c2_max)].\n\nWait, but this only holds if the possible winners for the children are contiguous ranges. Is that always the case?\n\nLet me test with some examples.\n\nCase 1:\n\nc1 is [3,5], c2 is [4,6].\n\nPhase is '0' (min).\n\nPossible min values: 3,4,5.\n\nRange is [3,5], which is min(3,4)=3, min(5,6)=5. Correct.\n\nCase 2:\n\nc1 is [2,3], c2 is [1,4].\n\nPhase '0' (min).\n\nPossible min: min(2,1)=1, min(3,4)=3. So the possible min values are 1,2,3.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's [min(2,1)=1, min(3,4)=3], which gives [1,3]. So correct.\n\nCase3:\n\nc1 is [5,7], c2 is [3,9].\n\nPhase '1' (max).\n\nPossible max: 5,7,9.\n\nAccording to formula, max(c1_min, c2_min)=max(5,3)=5, max(c1_max, c2_max)=max(7,9)=9. So [5,9], which is correct.\n\nAnother case:\n\nc1 is [1,4], c2 is [2,5].\n\nPhase '1' (max).\n\nPossible max values: 1,2,4,5.\n\nSo the range is [1,5], but according to the formula, it's max(1,2)=2, max(4,5)=5 → [2,5], which misses 1. So the formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, why is that? Because the formula suggests the possible max is between 2 and 5, but in reality, the max can be as low as 1 (if a=1, b=2), or as high as 5.\n\nSo the formula is not capturing all possible cases.\n\nHmm, so this approach of representing ranges as intervals is insufficient because in some cases, the possible winners are not a single interval.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial idea of tracking ranges is incorrect. We need a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: for each node, track the possible winners as a set. But for n=18, the number of nodes is 262k, and each node's set could be up to 2^18 elements. That's 262k * 262k = around 68 billion, which is impossible.\n\nSo, we need a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent each node's possible winners in terms of the XOR of certain bits. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: realize that for a node, the possible winners are determined by a function that depends on the children's possible winners. Perhaps, for each node, the possible winners can be represented as a bitmask where each bit represents whether a particular x is a possible winner.\n\nBut for n=18, 2^18 is 262k, which is manageable for bitwise operations. So, perhaps for each node, we can represent the possible winners as a bitmask, and then combine the children's masks according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut for each node, computing the mask requires combining the two children's masks. How?\n\nFor a phase '0' node, the possible winners are the min of a and b, where a is from the left child's mask and b is from the right child's mask.\n\nBut how do we compute the min of all possible a and b pairs?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive. For each pair (a, b), compute min(a, b), and collect all possible results.\n\nBut for a node, the number of possible a and b is O(m^2), where m is the number of possible winners in each child. For n=18, each child can have up to 2^17 winners, so m=131072. Thus, for each node, the computation would be O( (131072)^2 ), which is about 17 billion operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute the possible winners without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible winners for a node when the phase is '0' or '1'.\n\nFor phase '0' (min):\n\nThe possible winners are the min of any a in left's winners and b in right's winners.\n\nSo, the possible winners are all x such that x is the minimum of some a and b.\n\nBut the possible x's can be found as the intersection of all possible a's and b's.\n\nWait, perhaps the possible x's for phase '0' are all x's that are present in both left and right's possible winners, but that's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the possible x's for phase '0' are all x's that are <= both a and b for some a and b.\n\nNo, that's not correct. For example, x could be the min of a=5 and b=3, which is 3. So x is 3, which is less than a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps the possible x's are all x's that are present in the left's possible winners and also in the right's possible winners.\n\nNo, that's not correct either because x could be the min of a and b, where a is in left, b is in right, and x is less than both.\n\nWait, perhaps the possible x's for phase '0' are all x's that are present in the left's possible winners or the right's possible winners, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nI'm stuck here.\n\nAlternative idea: think recursively. For a node, the possible winners are a subset of the possible winners of its children.\n\nWait, no. Because for a phase '0' node, the winner is the min of two children's winners. So, the possible winners are a subset of the possible winners of the children.\n\nWait, but it's more precise: the possible winners for the parent are the min of any pair of winners from the children.\n\nSo, for the parent, the possible winners are the intersection of the children's possible winners, but in a specific way.\n\nWait, perhaps the possible winners for the parent can be represented as the union of the children's possible winners, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the parent, the possible winners are the set of all x where x is less than or equal to some a in left and x is less than or equal to some b in right.\n\nWait, no. Because for the parent phase '0', the winner is min(a, b). So, x must be the min of a and b. So x can be any value that is the min of a and b for some a in left and b in right.\n\nThus, x can be any value that is present in the left's possible winners and is less than or equal to some value in the right's possible winners.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the possible winners for the parent are the intersection of the left's possible winners and the right's possible winners, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, for example, if left has winners [3,4,5], right has winners [4,5,6], then the parent phase '0' can have winners 3,4,5.\n\nBecause min(3,4)=3, min(3,5)=3, min(3,6)=3, min(4,4)=4, etc.\n\nSo, the parent's possible winners are 3,4,5.\n\nWhich is the same as the left's possible winners intersected with the right's possible winners, but that's not the case because 3 is not in the right's winners.\n\nWait, perhaps the parent's possible winners are the union of all min(a, b) for a in left and b in right.\n\nSo, the parent's possible winners are the set { min(a, b) | a ∈ left, b ∈ right }.\n\nBut again, for large n, this is computationally expensive.\n\nSo, perhaps the key insight is that the possible winners for each node can be represented as a range [low, high], where low is the minimal possible winner and high is the maximal possible winner.\n\nBut earlier examples show that this is not sufficient because the possible winners may not form a continuous range.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the ranges can be represented as intervals, even if it's an approximation. Because the problem asks for which x is a possible winner, and perhaps the actual x's are contained within the computed ranges.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where c1 is [1,4] and c2 is [2,5], the phase is '1' (max), the possible winners are 1,2,4,5.\n\nBut the formula would compute the range as [max(1,2)=2, max(4,5)=5], giving [2,5], which includes 1 but misses it.\n\nSo, the formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the problem can be modeled using linear algebra over GF(2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent each node's possible winners as a bitmask, and for each node, compute the bitmask based on the phase's rule and the children's bitmasks.\n\nBut for n=18, each bitmask is 18 bits, so manageable. But the issue is how to compute the min or max of two bitmasks.\n\nWait, for a phase '0' node, the possible winners are the min of a and b for a in left and b in right.\n\nSo, the resulting bitmask is the set of all x where x is the min of some a and b.\n\nBut how can we compute this quickly?\n\nWait, the min of a and b is a if a < b, else b.\n\nSo, for each x, x is a possible winner if there exists a in left and b in right such that x = min(a, b).\n\nWhich is equivalent to x being present in both left and right's possible winners, or x is in left's winners and x is greater than some b in right's winners, or x is in right's winners and x is greater than some a in left's winners.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, x is in the parent's possible winners if x is in left's possible winners and x is less than or equal to some b in right's possible winners, OR x is in right's possible winners and x is less than or equal to some a in left's possible winners.\n\nNo, that doesn't capture all possibilities.\n\nI think I'm stuck on finding a way to represent the possible winners efficiently.\n\nPerhaps, instead of trying to represent the possible winners as ranges, I should think about the problem differently.\n\nAnother approach: for each node, the possible winners are a subset of the permutation p. To find x that is a possible winner, x must be able to reach the root of the tournament tree through all the phase rules.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, we can represent the possible winners as a binary trie, where each level corresponds to a phase, and the path taken represents the necessary conditions for x to win that game.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, we can simulate the tournament to see if x can be the champion, given the phase rules.\n\nBut for n=18, 2^18 is 262k, and for each x, simulating the tournament would require O(n) steps, which is manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps this is feasible.\n\nThe plan would be:\n\n- For each x in 1..2^n:\n   - Simulate the tournament, but arrange the permutation p such that x is the champion.\n   - Check if this is possible.\n\nBut how to arrange p for x to be the champion?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the tournament as a series of decisions. For each phase, depending on the rule, certain teams must progress.\n\nWait, but the arrangement of the permutation is crucial because it determines which teams face each other in each phase.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each x, we can determine whether x can be the champion by checking if it can reach the top of the tournament tree, given the phase rules.\n\nBut how to model the required arrangement of the permutation.\n\nAnother Idea: The permutation p must be arranged such that, for each phase, the winners are determined in a way that allows x to eventually win.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the earliest phase where x can lose is determined by the phase rules.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, we can compute the minimal number of teams that must be stronger (in the sense of the phase rules) than x for x to be able to win.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the tournament is a binary elimination tree, and for x to be the champion, it must win all its matches in each phase.\n\nBut the order in which the matches are arranged depends on the permutation.\n\nSo, perhaps the permutation must be arranged such that in each phase, x is matched against a team that it can beat, given the phase's rule.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the permutation to ensure this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as building a binary tree where each non-leaf node is the result of a game between two subtrees. The phase's rule determines whether the winner is the min or max of the two subtrees' winners.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached using dynamic programming, where for each subtree (represented by a bitmask), we compute the possible winners.\n\nBut for n=18, 2^18 is 262k, which is manageable.\n\nWait, for each mask representing a set of teams, the possible winners are the x's that can emerge as the champion of that set, given the phase rules.\n\nBut how to model the phase rules for each mask.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the tournament as a collection of subtrees, each with a certain phase rule, and for each subtree, track the possible winners.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAnother Idea: Think of the tournament as a DAG where each node is a team, and edges represent possible paths to victory. But this seems vague.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nSince the tournament is a binary elimination tree, the path of x to the root is determined by the structure of the tree. The permutation p determines the initial pairings, which in turn determine the structure of the tree.\n\nBut since the structure of the tree is fixed (it's a perfect binary tree with 2^n leaves), the way the teams are paired in each phase depends on the order of the permutation.\n\nWait, but the structure of the tree is fixed, so the initial pairings are determined by the initial permutation. For example, in phase 1, the teams are paired as 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So, the permutation p must be arranged such that in each phase, the winners are determined in a way that x proceeds to the next phase.\n\nThus, the problem is to find a permutation p such that, when the tournament is run with the given phase rules, x is the champion.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each x, we can determine the earliest phase where x must win, and enforce that x wins all subsequent phases.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The tournament can be viewed as a series of stages where, in each stage, certain teams are eliminated based on the phase rules. So, for x to be the champion, it must not be eliminated in any stage, and must win all its matches.\n\nBut how to model the matches x has to go through.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can model the possible opponents in each phase, ensuring that x can win against them according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut the permutation p determines which opponents x faces in each phase.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging p such that, in each phase, x's opponent is such that x can win according to the phase's rule, and this continues until x is the last remaining team.\n\nBut how to arrange p for this.\n\nHmm.\n\nFor phase 1, x is paired with another team. Depending on the phase's rule (s[0]), x must be the higher or lower skiller to win.\n\nSo, for x to proceed, if s[0] is '0' (lower wins), x's opponent must have a skill less than x. If s[0] is '1' (higher wins), x's opponent must have a skill higher than x.\n\nWait, no. Because in phase 1, the rule determines how the game is won. So, if s[0] is '0', in each game, the lower-skilled team wins. So, for x to win, it must be the lower-skilled in its game.\n\nThus, x's opponent must have a higher skill than x.\n\nWait, no: for phase '0' (lower wins), in each game, the lower-skilled team wins. So, for x to win, x must be the lower-skilled in its game. So, x's opponent must have a higher skill.\n\nSimilarly, for phase '1' (higher",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which integers x can be the champion of a tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure is a knockout style where each phase halves the number of teams until only one remains.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary elimination tree. Each phase determines how teams are paired and which team wins based on their skill levels.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (either higher or lower skill wins) that determines the outcome of the matches in that phase.\n3. **Binary Tree Representation**: The tournament can be represented as a binary tree where each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial matches, and internal nodes represent subsequent matches.\n4. **Dynamic Programming on Bitmask**: For each node, we track possible winners using a bitmask. Each bit in the mask represents whether a particular integer can be a winner at that node.\n5. **Bottom-Up Processing**: We process each node starting from the leaves up to the root, updating the possible winners based on the phase's rule and the winners from its children.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    size = 1 << n\n    max_mask = 1 << size\n    \n    # dp[mask] is a set of possible winners for this mask\n    dp = [set() for _ in range(max_mask)]\n    \n    # Initialize leaves: each leaf is a pair of two consecutive numbers\n    for i in range(0, size-1, 2):\n        game = (i, i+1)\n        if s[0] == '0':\n            min_win = min(game)\n            max_win = max(game)\n            dp[game[0] | game[1]].add(min_win)\n            dp[game[0] | game[1]].add(max_win)\n        else:\n            min_win = min(game)\n            max_win = max(game)\n            dp[game[0] | game[1]].add(min_win)\n            dp[game[0] | game[1]].add(max_win)\n    \n    # Process each level of the tournament tree\n    for d in range(1, n):\n        phase = d\n        rule = s[phase]\n        for mask in range(max_mask):\n            if bin(mask).count('1') != (size >> (d + 1)):\n                continue\n            left = mask & ((1 << size) - 1)\n            right = mask & (left ^ ((1 << size) - 1))\n            if rule == '0':\n                # Min of left and right\n                winners = set()\n                for a in dp[left]:\n                    for b in dp[right]:\n                        winners.add(min(a, b))\n                dp[mask] = winners\n            else:\n                # Max of left and right\n                winners = set()\n                for a in dp[left]:\n                    for b in dp[right]:\n                        winners.add(max(a, b))\n                dp[mask] = winners\n    \n    # The root is the entire set of teams\n    root_mask = (1 << size) - 1\n    possible = dp[root_mask]\n    \n    # Now, find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion\n    # To do this, we need to see if x can be the winner of the entire tree\n    result = []\n    for x in range(1, size + 1):\n        if x in possible:\n            result.append(x)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The leaves of the tournament tree are initialized with the possible winners of the initial matches.\n2. **Processing Each Phase**: For each phase, we compute the possible winners based on the phase's rule (either min or max of the winners from the previous phase).\n3. **Bitmask Representation**: Each node's possible winners are stored in a bitmask, where each bit indicates whether a particular integer can be a winner.\n4. **Root Node Check**: After processing all phases, the root node's possible winners are checked to determine which integers can be the champion.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the possible winners for each node using dynamic programming and bitwise operations, ensuring that we handle up to 18 phases within feasible computational limits.",
