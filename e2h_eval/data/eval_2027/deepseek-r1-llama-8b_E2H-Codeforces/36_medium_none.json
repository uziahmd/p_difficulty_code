The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns arranged on a coordinate line. There are n+2 towns, numbered 0 to n+1. We build towers in towns 1 through n, each with a probability of 1/2, independently. Then, we need to assign signal powers to these towers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n2. Each of the towns 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nThe goal is to calculate the probability that such an assignment is possible after the towers are built. The probability should be output modulo 998244353, expressed as x * y^{-1} mod MOD, where x/y is the reduced fraction.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to figure out what configurations of built towers allow for such a signal assignment. Then, compute the number of such valid configurations divided by the total possible (which is 2^n), and find the probability.\n\nLet me think about the structure required for the signals.\n\nEach town must be covered by exactly one tower, and towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered. Also, the signal from a tower at i with power p covers all c where |c-i| < p. So the range is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] since c can't be equal to i-p or i+p because it's strict inequality.\n\nWait, no. Because |c -i| < p means that c can be from i-p+1 to i + p-1, inclusive. Because, for example, if p=2, then c can be i-1 and i+1.\n\nSo each tower's coverage is a range of length 2*(p-1) + 1. Because it includes i-p+1, i-p+2,..., i, ..., i+p-1.\n\nNow, the key is that the entire set of towns 1..n must be covered exactly once, and 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nThis reminds me of tiling or covering intervals without overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the configuration of towers must form a certain kind of partition. Like, each tower's coverage interval must exactly cover a part of the line without overlapping, and collectively they cover all 1..n.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: think about the arrangement of the towers as points, and their assigned powers as covering ranges. For the coverage to be non-overlapping and complete, the way the ranges are placed must form a perfect partitioning.\n\nSo, the coverage ranges must form a partition of the line segments between 0 and n+1, such that each segment is exactly covered by one tower.\n\nThis feels similar to a domino tiling problem, but with varying lengths.\n\nWait, maybe the valid configurations are those where the built towers form a certain kind of independent set, but more specifically, perhaps a specific kind of structure like a \"non-overlapping\" set where each tower's coverage interval doesn't overlap with others, and together they cover exactly the 1..n towns.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any assignment of powers as long as the constraints are met. So perhaps the set of built towers must form a structure that allows for such an assignment. So what's the necessary condition on the built towers?\n\nLet me think about the coverage intervals. For each tower, its coverage is [a, b], where a = i - (p-1) and b = i + (p-1). Since p must be at least 1, the minimal coverage is just the tower itself (p=1, so a=i, b=i).\n\nEach town must be covered exactly once. So the union of all [a, b] intervals must be exactly [1, n], and the intervals must not overlap except at their endpoints.\n\nWait, but the intervals can touch but not overlap. Because the coverage is up to i+p-1, which is the end. So two adjacent intervals can meet at a point without overlapping.\n\nFor example, a tower at 2 with p=2 covers [1,3], and another at 4 with p=1 covers [4,4]. Then, the coverage is 1-3 and 4-4, which together cover 1-4, and no overlaps.\n\nWait, but in this case, town 3 is covered by the first tower, and 4 by the second. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo the coverage intervals must form a non-overlapping partition of [1, n], with the union being exactly [1, n].\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of a \"domino tiling\" or \"perfect matching\", but in a linear arrangement.\n\nWait, but each interval is determined by the tower's position and power. How do these intervals relate?\n\nPerhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node represents a possible starting point of a tower's coverage, and edges represent compatible next intervals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the built towers must form a certain kind of structure, like a set of positions where each tower's coverage starts exactly after the previous one's coverage ends.\n\nWait, for example, if a tower is placed at position i, and has a coverage of length l, then the next tower must be placed at i + l, and so on.\n\nBut that's assuming that the coverage is as large as possible, but perhaps the coverage can be adjusted by varying p.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to choose p for each tower. So for each tower, we can choose p such that the coverage fits into the overall partition.\n\nHmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern or a recurrence relation that can model this.\n\nLet me think about small examples to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nExample 1: n=1\n\nTowns 0,1,2.\n\nWe have to build a tower in town 1. Then, assign p=1. Then, town 1 is covered, 0 and 2 are not. That's valid.\n\nSo the probability is the probability that tower 1 is built, which is 1/2.\n\nWait, but let me check. If the tower is built, then p can be 1, covering only 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nIf the tower is not built, then there's no way to cover town 1, so it's invalid.\n\nSo the number of valid configurations is 1 (build 1). Total possible is 2^1=2. So probability is 1/2.\n\nBut wait, the sample input for n=2 is 748683265, which is 1/4 mod 998244353. Hmm, because 1/4 is 0.25.\n\nWait, but for n=1, the probability is 1/2, which is 499122177 mod 998244353.\n\nBut according to the sample input provided, when n=2, the answer is 748683265, which is 1/4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the first example, when n=2, the valid configurations are when both 1 and 2 are built. Then, set p=1 for both. Then, town 0 is not covered, 1 and 2 are covered by themselves, and town 3 is not covered. So that's valid.\n\nAlternatively, if only one tower is built, say in 1: then the coverage would be [1,1], but town 2 is not covered. So you can't cover 2. So that's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if only tower 2 is built: coverage is [2,2], leaving town 1 uncovered. So invalid.\n\nOnly if both are built can you assign p=1 to each, thus covering exactly 1 and 2.\n\nSo the number of valid configurations is 1 (only one subset {1,2}). So the probability is 1/(2^2) = 1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nHmm. So for n=1, the probability is 1/2.\n\nSo what's the general condition on the subset of built towers S?\n\nThe set S must allow for a partitioning of [1,n] into intervals, each of which is covered exactly once by a tower in S.\n\nEach interval [a, b] must be covered by exactly one tower, which is placed somewhere inside [a, b], and the power p is such that the coverage of that tower is exactly [a, b].\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage is determined by p. So for a given interval [a, b], the tower's position i must satisfy a = i - (p-1) and b = i + (p-1). Which implies that the length of the interval is 2*(p-1)+1. So the length is always odd.\n\nWait, the length of [a, b] is b -a +1. So for the tower's coverage to exactly match this interval, the length must be 2*(p-1) +1, which is odd.\n\nSo for any interval used in the coverage, its length must be odd.\n\nMoreover, the tower must be placed such that the interval is exactly [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)], meaning that the tower is at the center of the interval.\n\nWait, no. Because the interval could be any length, but the tower's position must be such that i - (p-1) = a and i + (p-1) = b. Solving these, we get i = (a + b + 1)/2. And p = (b - a + 1 + 1)/2 = (b -a + 2)/2.\n\nWait, that's only possible if (a + b + 1) is even, because i must be an integer. So the sum a + b + 1 must be even, which implies that a + b is odd. So the sum of a and b must be odd.\n\nWhich implies that a and b have different parity.\n\nSo the length of the interval (b -a +1) must be even? Because if a and b have different parity, then b -a is odd, so length is even.\n\nWait, for example: a=1, b=2. Length is 2, which is even. Then i=(1+2+1)/2=2, p=(2-1+2)/2= (3)/2? Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, wait, let's recalculate.\n\nWait, the coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)]. So the length is 2*(p-1) + 1.\n\nSo for the coverage to exactly cover [a, b], we have:\n\ni - (p-1) = a\n\ni + (p-1) = b\n\nAdding these equations: 2i = a + b â†’ i = (a + b)/2.\n\nSubtracting: 2(p-1) = b - a â†’ p-1 = (b -a)/2 â†’ p = (b -a)/2 + 1.\n\nSo for this to be possible, (a + b) must be even, so a and b must have the same parity.\n\nWait, no, wait: 2i = a + b â†’ i must be an integer, so a + b must be even. So a and b must have the same parity.\n\nAnd p must be an integer â‰¥1, so (b -a)/2 must be â‰¥0, which it is because b >=a.\n\nSo for a coverage interval [a,b], the tower must be placed at i = (a + b)/2, and p = (b -a + 2)/2.\n\nSo the length of the interval is (b -a +1) = 2*(p-1) +1 â†’ which is odd.\n\nSo for any coverage interval [a, b], its length must be odd.\n\nWhich brings us back to the fact that each coverage interval must have an odd length.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding a partition of [1, n] into consecutive intervals, each of odd length, and each interval's center corresponds to a tower in S.\n\nSo the built towers must form a set such that for each interval in the partition, there's a tower at the center of the interval.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to choosing a subset S of {1, 2, ..., n}, such that S can be used to create a partition of [1, n] into intervals of odd length, each centered at a tower in S.\n\nWait, but each interval is determined by the centers. So the centers must be spaced such that their coverage intervals don't overlap and exactly cover [1, n].\n\nSo the centers must be placed in such a way that the distance between consecutive centers is even, because each interval is of odd length.\n\nWait, for example, if two consecutive centers are at positions x and y, then the coverage of x is [x - (p_x - 1), x + (p_x -1)], and similarly for y. But since the intervals are non-overlapping, the end of x's coverage is y-1, and the start of y's coverage is y.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo the spacing between two consecutive centers must be exactly 2*(p_y - 1) + 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the distance between centers is 2k for some k, which allows for the coverage intervals to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the positions of the centers must form a sequence where each next center is exactly 2 steps away from the previous, but that's probably not the case for all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, the centers can be placed anywhere, as long as the coverage intervals are non-overlapping and together cover [1, n].\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nThis seems like a combinatorial problem where the subsets S correspond to certain kinds of binary strings or arrangements.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to selecting a subset S where the elements can be arranged in order as a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, such that a_1 - 0 is even, a_{i+1} - a_i is even, and a_k - (n+1) is even.\n\nBecause, considering the coverage intervals:\n\n- The first interval starts at 1, ends at a_1 -1 (since the coverage is up to a_1 -1, and the next starts at a_1).\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage of a_1 is [a_1 - (p_1 -1), a_1 + (p_1 -1)]. So the end of this coverage is a_1 + (p_1 -1) = (a_1 + (a_1 -1 +1))/2 -1 + ... Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming.\n\nLetâ€™s consider dp[i] as the number of valid subsets S for the first i towns, such that the conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model the transitions.\n\nWait, another thought: the problem resembles the Fibonacci sequence. Because for each position, you can decide whether to place a tower or not, and the decision affects the next positions.\n\nWait, for example, if you place a tower at position i, then the coverage must extend to some j, and then the next tower must be placed at j+1.\n\nBut this is vague. Let me think more carefully.\n\nSuppose we have built a tower at position i. Then, the coverage from this tower must be such that it covers a certain interval, say, [a, b], and the next tower is placed at b+1.\n\nBut the length of the interval is determined by the power p assigned to i.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal case is when the tower's coverage ends at i + p - 1. The next tower must be placed at i + p, and so on.\n\nBut then, the placement of the next tower depends on the power chosen for i.\n\nThis seems difficult to model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as tiling the line with certain blocks. Each block is determined by a tower's coverage, and each block is of length 2k+1 for some k.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible ways to cover [1, n]. For each position, either it's a tower or not. But the constraints are quite tight.\n\nWait, perhaps the valid subsets S are those that form a certain kind of binary string where each '1' (tower present) is followed by a certain number of '0's (no towers) that form the coverage interval.\n\nBut the exact pattern isn't clear.\n\nAnother angle: since each coverage interval must be of odd length, the entire [1, n] can be broken down into such intervals. The sum of their lengths must be n.\n\nBut the sum of m odd numbers is m if n is odd, or m+1 if n is even. Wait, no: the sum of k odds is k if k is even, and k mod 2 if k is odd. Wait, actually, the sum of any number of odd numbers is odd if the count is odd, and even if the count is even.\n\nSo for [1, n], the total length is n. So the sum of the lengths of the intervals must be n. Each interval contributes an odd length, so the number of intervals must be such that the sum is n.\n\nSo, the number of intervals can vary. For example, for n=5, you can have one interval of 5 (odd), or three intervals of 1,1,3 (sum 5), etc.\n\nBut each interval must be centered at a tower, which requires that the length is 2*(p-1)+1, so for an interval of length L, L must be odd, and the center is at (a + b)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to the number of ways to tile the line [1, n] with tiles of odd lengths, and each tile's center is a tower.\n\nBut how does that translate to the subsets S?\n\nWait, perhaps each tile of length L (odd) requires exactly one tower at position (a + b + 1)/2, where a and b are the ends of the tile.\n\nBut then, for the entire [1, n], the subset S must consist of exactly the centers of these tiles.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets S such that the centers of the tiles form a subset S where each tile is exactly covered by one tower, and the tiles are non-overlapping and cover the entire [1, n].\n\nSo, the question is: how many such subsets S exist for a given n?\n\nOnce we have the count, the probability is count / 2^n, modulo 998244353.\n\nSo, our task is to compute this count.\n\nNow, the problem becomes counting the number of ways to partition [1, n] into intervals of odd lengths, and for each interval, include its center in S.\n\nThus, the number of such subsets S is equal to the number of such partitions.\n\nWait, but the order of the partitions matters because each partition defines exactly one subset S.\n\nSo, the count is the number of possible partitions of [1, n] into intervals of odd lengths.\n\nBut each partition corresponds to exactly one subset S, which is the set of centers of the intervals.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition [1, n] into intervals of odd lengths.\n\nSo, for each possible partition, we have one subset S.\n\nThus, the count is equal to the number of such partitions.\n\nSo, now the problem is to find the number of ways to partition a line of length n into intervals, each of odd length.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nThis sounds familiar. It's similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nBecause for the first position, we can choose to end the first interval here, and the next intervals must sum to n - current length, or not.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Let f(n) be the number of ways to partition [1, n] into intervals of odd lengths.\n\nBase cases:\n\n- f(0) = 1 (empty partition)\n- f(1) = 1 (only one interval of length 1)\n\nFor n > 1:\n\nAt position 1, the first interval can end at 1, 2, 3, etc., but the length must be odd.\n\nWait, no. Because the first interval can start at 1 and end at any position k, as long as k - 1 + 1 is odd, i.e., k is odd.\n\nWait, wait, the length is k-1 +1 = k, which must be odd. So the first interval can end at 1, 3, 5, etc.\n\nWait, for example, n=3:\n\nPossible partitions:\n\n- [1], [2], [3]: but this is invalid because the intervals must be contiguous. So, it's not allowed. So I think I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no. The intervals must be contiguous and non-overlapping, and together cover [1, n].\n\nSo, the first interval can be of length 1 (ends at 1), 3 (ends at 3), etc.\n\nWait, for n=3:\n\nCase 1: First interval is of length 1 (covers 1). Then the remaining is 2,3. So the next interval can be of length 2, but that's even. So this is invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because each interval must be of odd length. So the remaining length is 2, which can't be partitioned into odd-length intervals. So this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: First interval is of length 3 (covers 1,2,3). Then, no more intervals needed. So this is valid.\n\nSo for n=3, f(3)=1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought f(3) would be more than that. Let me see other possibilities.\n\nWait, another way to partition: [1,2], [3]. But [1,2] has length 2, which is evenâ€”invalid.\n\nOr [1], [2,3]: again, [2,3] is even length.\n\nSo, for n=3, the only valid partition is [1,3], which is length 3 (odd). So f(3) =1.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because another option is to have a partition into [1], [2], [3], but that's three intervals, each of length 1, which is allowed. Oh wait, no, because that would require the intervals to be [1], [2], [3], but that's not contiguous. No, that's not a valid partition because the intervals must be contiguous and non-overlapping, covering the entire [1,3] without gaps.\n\nSo the correct way is to have each interval being a single continuous block.\n\nSo for n=3, the only possible partitions are:\n\n- [1,3]\n\n- [1], [3]\n\nWait, no. Because [1] is a single interval of length 1, and [3] is another interval of length 1. But the sum is 2, which is less than 3. So that's not valid.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently. The intervals must be contiguous and non-overlapping, and their union is [1, n], and each has odd length.\n\nSo for n=3, the possible partitions are:\n\n1. One interval of length 3 (covers 1-3).\n2. Two intervals: the first of length 1 (covers 1), the second of length 2 (covers 2-3). But 2 is even, so invalid.\n3. Or three intervals: each of length 1 (1-1, 2-2, 3-3). But that's not contiguousâ€”each is a single point, but the entire [1,3] isn't covered. So this is invalid.\n\nSo the only valid partition is the first one, f(3)=1.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat about n=4?\n\nWe need to partition [1,4] into intervals of odd lengths.\n\nPossible options:\n\n- One interval of length 4 (even) â†’ invalid.\n- One interval of length 1, and the rest 3. But 3 can be split into a single interval of 3 â†’ total 1+3=4. So the partition is [1], [2,4]. But [2,4] is length 3, which is allowed. So that's valid. So this is one way.\n\n- Alternatively, [1,3], [4]. Both are length 3 and 1 â†’ sum is 4. Valid. So another way.\n\n- Another option: [1], [2], [3], [4]. But each is length 1. The sum is 4, but the way they are placed is [1], [2], [3], [4], which are not contiguous. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because the intervals must be contiguous. So [1], [2,4] is allowed. [1,3], [4] is allowed. Are there any other possibilities?\n\nAnother possibility: [1, 2, 3], but that's length 3, but then the next interval would have to be [4], which is length 1. Sum is 4. So yes, that's another way.\n\nWait, so for n=4, how many partitions are there?\n\nOption 1: [1], [2,4]\nOption 2: [1,3], [4]\nOption 3: [1,2,3], [4]\nOption 4: [1,4] (length 4, invalid)\nOption 5: [1], [2], [3], [4] (invalid because not contiguous)\nSo total valid partitions: 3.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nWait, the interval [2,4] has length 3 (2,3,4), which is allowed. So that's a valid partition.\n\nSimilarly, [1,3] is length 3, and [4] is length 1.\n\n[1,2,3] is length 3, and [4] is length 1.\n\nSo that's three partitions.\n\nSo f(4) = 3.\n\nWait, but is there another way?\n\nWhat about [1], [2,3,4]. Wait, [2,3,4] is length 3, which is allowed. So that's another partition.\n\nSo that's four.\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused. Let me list all possible valid partitions for n=4.\n\nEach partition is a set of intervals, each of odd length, covering [1,4], non-overlapping, and contiguous.\n\nPossible partitions:\n\n1. [1], [2,3,4]\n   - [1] is length 1, [2,3,4] is length 3.\n\n2. [1,3], [4]\n   - [1,3] is length 3, [4] is 1.\n\n3. [1,2,3], [4]\n   - [1,2,3] is length 3, [4] is 1.\n\n4.

So that's another partition.\n\nWait, this is a new one.\n\n7. [1], [2,4] â†’ [2,4] is length 3.\n\n8. [1], [2], [3], [4] â†’ invalid.\n\n9. [1,4] â†’ invalid.\n\n10. Other possibilities?\n\nSo perhaps I've missed some.\n\nSo perhaps the correct count is 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a better approach to count all possible partitions.\n\nAn alternative way is to model it as follows:\n\nf(n) is the number of ways to partition [1, n] into intervals of odd lengths.\n\nThen, for each possible k (the end of the first interval), which must be odd (since the first interval's length is k-1 + 1 = k, which must be odd), and then the remaining is f(n -k).\n\nSo, f(n) = sum_{k=1,3,5,... â‰¤n} f(n -k), with f(0)=1.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nf(1) = f(0) = 1.\n\nn=2:\n\nk can be 1.\n\nf(2) = f(2-1) = f(1) =1.\n\nn=3:\n\nk can be 1,3.\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(0) =1 +1=2.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggested f(3) was 1. So perhaps my initial analysis was wrong.\n\nWait, let's see for n=3:\n\nWith the recursive formula, f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 +1=2.\n\nSo according to this, there are two partitions for n=3.\n\nWhich would be:\n\n1. [1], [2,3] â†’ [2,3] is length 2 (invalid, so this is not a valid partition. Wait, but according to the recursive formula, it's counted. Hmm, this suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the way the recursion works.\n\nWait, no. Because for the first interval ending at k=1, the remaining is n-k=2, which needs to be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths. But 2 can't be done, because 2 is even. So f(2) is 1, but that counts a partition that's impossible for the remaining part.\n\nWait, perhaps the recursive approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is that f(n) is the number of ways to partition [1, n] into intervals of odd lengths, regardless of the order of the intervals.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the way we split the first interval may leave an even length, which can't be further split.\n\nHmm, perhaps the recursive formula is correct, but the base cases are different.\n\nWait, perhaps for n=0, f(0)=1.\n\nn=1: can only split into [1], so f(1)=1.\n\nn=2: can split into [1], and then the remaining is 1. So the partition is [1], [2]. But [2] is length 1, which is allowed. So that's a valid partition. So f(2)=1.\n\nn=3: possible splits:\n\n- [1], [2], [3]: each is length 1. So that's a valid partition.\n\n- [1,3]: length 3. So that's another partition.\n\nSo f(3) = 2.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier approach, the recursive formula gives f(3) = f(2) + f(0) =1+1=2, which aligns with this.\n\nSo perhaps my initial confusion was due to a wrong assumption about the way the intervals are structured.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is correct.\n\nThus, f(n) can be computed as f(n) = sum_{k=1,3,5,...}^n f(n-k), with f(0)=1.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets S is equal to f(n), because each partition corresponds to exactly one subset S, which is the set of centers of the intervals.\n\nWait, but wait. For each partition, the subset S consists of the centers of the intervals.\n\nFor example, in the partition [1], [2,4], the centers are at 1 and at (2+4)/2 = 3. So the subset S is {1,3}.\n\nSimilarly, for the partition [1,3], [4], the centers are at 2 and 4. So S is {2,4}.\n\nEach such subset S is unique for each partition.\n\nThus, the number of subsets S is equal to f(n), as defined by the recurrence.\n\nSo, the count is f(n), and the probability is f(n) / 2^n.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to computing f(n), and then calculating (f(n) * inverse(2^n)) mod 998244353.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute f(n) efficiently for n up to 2e5.\n\nLet's look at the recurrence:\n\nf(n) = sum_{k=1,3,5,... â‰¤n} f(n -k)\n\nWe can model this as:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut for n up to 2e5, a straightforward O(n) solution would be too slow. So we need a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet's think about the generating function.\n\nLet F(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty f(n) x^n.\n\nFrom the recurrence:\n\nf(n) = sum_{k=0}^{m} f(n - (2k+1)), where 2k+1 <=n.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nf(n) = sum_{k=0}^floor((n-1)/2)} f(n - (2k+1)).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to find a closed-form expression for f(n).\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the recurrence in terms of even and odd indices.\n\nLetâ€™s denote E(k) = f(2k) and O(k) = f(2k+1).\n\nWe can express the recurrence for even and odd terms separately.\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\nf(2k) = f(2k-1) + f(2k-3) + f(2k-5) + ... \n\nBut 2k-1 is 2(k-1)+1, which is O(k-1). Similarly, 2k-3 is O(k-2), etc.\n\nSo f(2k) = sum_{i=1 to k} O(k-i)\n\nBut O(k-i) = f(2(k-i)+1) = O(k-i).\n\nWait, perhaps this can be represented in terms of E and O.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2k+1:\n\nf(2k+1) = f(2k) + f(2k-2) + ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence can be rewritten as:\n\nFor n >=1:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nWhich for even and odd n can be expressed as:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\nf(2k) = f(2k-1) + f(2k-3) + ... + f(1)\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nf(2k+1) = f(2k) + f(2k-2) + ... + f(0)\n\nSo, for E(k) = f(2k):\n\nE(k) = sum_{i=1 to k} O(i-1) + O(k-1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for n=2k:\n\nf(2k) = f(2k-1) + f(2k-3) + ... + f(1)\n\nEach term is f(2m-1), where m ranges from 1 to k.\n\nWhich is the same as sum_{m=1 to k} O(m-1) + O(k)?\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, for n=2k:\n\nf(2k) = sum_{i=1 to k} O(k - i + 1)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to write the recurrence in terms of E and O.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor n=2k:\n\nf(2k) = sum_{m=1 to k} f(2k - (2m-1)) \n= sum_{m=1 to k} f(2(k - m) +1)\n= sum_{m=1 to k} O(k - m + 1 - 0) ? \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write in terms of E and O.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2k+1:\n\nf(2k+1) = sum_{m=0 to k} f(2k+1 - (2m+1))\n= sum_{m=0 to k} f(2(k -m) )\n= sum_{m=0 to k} E(k - m)\n\nNow, let's try to find a recurrence for E and O.\n\nLetâ€™s define:\n\nE(k) = f(2k)\nO(k) = f(2k+1)\n\nFor n=2k:\n\nf(2k) = O(k) + O(k-1) + ... + O(1) \n\nBecause for m=1 to k, 2k - (2m-1) = 2(k -m) +1 = 2(k - m) +1, which is O(k - m + 1) when m ranges from 1 to k.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nf(2k) = sum_{i=1 to k} O(k - i + 1) \n\nWhich is O(k) + O(k-1) + ... + O(1) \n\nSo E(k) = O(k) + E(k-1)\n\nBecause E(k-1) = O(k-1) + O(k-2) + ... + O(1)\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nE(k) = O(k) + O(k-1) + ... + O(1) \n\nE(k-1) = O(k-1) + O(k-2) + ... + O(1)\n\nSo E(k) = E(k-1) + O(k)\n\nSimilarly, for n=2k+1:\n\nf(2k+1) = sum_{m=0 to k} E(k - m) \n\n= E(k) + E(k-1) + ... + E(0)\n\nE(0) is f(0) =1.\n\nSo O(k) = sum_{i=0 to k} E(i) \n\nBecause O(k) = E(k) + E(k-1) + ... + E(0)\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nE(k) = E(k-1) + O(k)\nO(k) = sum_{i=",

The probability should be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the valid configurations of built towers form a partition of the towns into intervals of odd lengths. Each interval must be centered at a tower, meaning the tower's position is the midpoint of the interval. This problem can be modeled using dynamic programming with a recurrence relation.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:\n   - Let `E(k)` be the number of ways to partition the first `2k` towns.\n   - Let `O(k)` be the number of ways to partition the first `2k + 1` towns.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relations**:\n   - For even indices: `E(k) = E(k-1) + O(k)`\n   - For odd indices: `O(k) = sum_{i=0 to k} E(i)`\n\n3. **Base Cases**:\n   - `E(0) = 1` (empty partition)\n   - `O(0) = 1` (single tower at position 1)\n\n4. **Efficient Computation**:\n   - Use dynamic programming to compute `E` and `O` up to `n/2`.\n   - Compute the result as `f(n) / 2^n`, where `f(n)` is derived from the DP results.\n\n5. **Modulo Arithmetic**:\n   - Use modular inverses to handle division under modulo 998244353.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 0:\n    print(1)\n    exit()\n\nmax_k = (n + 1) // 2\nE = [0] * (max_k + 1)\nO = [0] * (max_k + 1)\n\nE[0] = 1\nO[0] = 1\n\nfor k in range(1, max_k + 1):\n    E[k] = (E[k-1] + O[k]) % MOD\n    O[k] = 0\n    for i in range(k + 1):\n        O[k] = (O[k] + E[i]) % MOD\n\nif n % 2 == 0:\n    res = E[n//2]\nelse:\n    res = O[n//2]\n\npow2n = pow(2, n, MOD)\ninv_pow2n = pow(pow2n, MOD-2, MOD)\nresult = (res * inv_pow2n) % MOD\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of valid configurations.
