On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers, each being 1 or 2. Tommy wants to reverse a subarray (a continuous segment) in the original sequence such that after this reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is as long as possible. We need to find the maximum possible length of this longest non-decreasing subsequence after choosing the best possible subarray to reverse.\n\nHmm. The input is a sequence of n elements, each 1 or 2. The output is the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing any possible subarray.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what reversing a subarray does. Reversing a subarray from l to r will swap the elements at positions l and r, then l+1 and r-1, and so on. So for example, if the subarray is [a, b, c, d], after reversal, it becomes [d, c, b, a].\n\nThe goal is to choose l and r such that after reversing, the LNDS (longest non-decreasing subsequence) is maximized.\n\nWait, but considering all possible l and r is O(n^2), which for n=2000 is about 4 million. That's manageable, but we need an efficient way to compute for each possible reversed subarray what the LNDS would be.\n\nBut computing the LNDS for each possible reversed array directly is going to be too slow because for each of the 4 million possibilities, calculating the LNDS in O(n) time would give us 8e9 operations, which is way beyond feasible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think: since the original sequence consists of only 1s and 2s, maybe there's some structure we can exploit.\n\nWait, the LNDS in the original array can't be longer than n, obviously. But after reversing a subarray, perhaps we can create a longer LNDS by aligning certain patterns.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum possible LNDS after reversing is either the original LNDS, or something better achieved by reversing a subarray.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible LNDS? Well, if the array is all 1s followed by all 2s, the LNDS is n. So maybe the optimal scenario is when the array becomes such a form.\n\nBut that might not always be possible. For example, the first sample input was [1,2,1,2]. By reversing positions 2 and 3, the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which gives an LNDS of 4, which is equal to n.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find a subarray to reverse such that after reversal, the array has as many 1s as possible before the 2s.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the input was [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. Reversing positions 3 to 7 turns it into [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1], giving an LNDS of 9. So the idea is that by reversing a subarray that includes some 2s and 1s, you can bring more 1s before the 2s.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nHmm. Let's consider that the original array has some number of 1s followed by some 2s. The maximum LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s, which is n. But sometimes this isn't achievable because the array isn't already in that form.\n\nWait, no. Because if the array is not in that form, reversing a subarray might not make it so. For example, if the array has some 2s followed by 1s, reversing a subarray that starts in the 2s part and ends in the 1s part could potentially turn them into 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal scenario is when after reversal, all 1s are before all 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS would be the count of 1s plus the count of 2s, which is n. But wait, that's only possible if the entire array is made up of 1s followed by 2s after reversal.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial array may have 1s and 2s interleaved. For instance, in the first example, the array was 1,2,1,2. After reversing positions 2-3, it becomes 1,1,2,2, which is all 1s followed by all 2s. So the LNDS is 4.\n\nIn the second example, the array after reversal is 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1. Wait, that's not all 1s followed by all 2s. There's a trailing 1. But the LNDS is 9 because it's 4 ones and 5 twos, but why 9? Oh, wait, the array after reversal is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. The LNDS here would look like 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2, but the last element is 1, which breaks the sequence. So the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9 because the 1 at the end can't be included. Hmm, so the maximum is 9.\n\nWait, but the count of 1s is 5, and 2s is 5. But after reversal, the array has 5 ones followed by 5 twos, but with a single 1 at the end. So the LNDS is 5+4=9.\n\nHmm, so the maximum possible is not necessarily n.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original array's LNDS and the maximum possible after reversing some subarray.\n\nBut again, computing that for every possible subarray is expensive.\n\nAlternative approach: precompute for each possible subarray [l, r] what the new array looks like after reversal, and then compute the LNDS. But for n=2000, this is 2e6 possibilities, and for each, computing LNDS is O(n), leading to 4e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nWe need a way to compute, for each possible [l, r], the effect of reversing it on the LNDS without having to process each element every time.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the impact of reversing a particular subarray on the LNDS.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the array after reversal. The reversed subarray may change the order of elements within it, but elements outside remain the same.\n\nWhat's the LNDS for the new array?\n\nWell, the LNDS can consist of parts before l, the reversed subarray, and parts after r.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversal is determined by the maximum of:\n\n- The LNDS of the original array (without reversing anything)\n- The maximum LNDS formed by taking a prefix up to l-1, then the reversed subarray, then a suffix starting at r+1.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all [l, r]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is one that makes the array as \"sorted\" as possible in terms of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nWait, the array after reversal must have a certain structure where a lot of 1s come before 2s. So perhaps the optimal is to find the largest possible number of 1s that can precede 2s in the array.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother angle: the LNDS in any array is determined by the counts of 1s and 2s, but their arrangement also matters. For example, a sequence like 1,1,2,2 has an LNDS of 4. A sequence like 1,2,1,2 has an LNDS of 3.\n\nWait, but when you reverse a subarray, you might be able to arrange the 1s and 2s in such a way that their relative order allows for a longer LNDS.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible LNDS is either the original maximum, or the maximum when the array is rearranged into all 1s followed by all 2s. But that's only possible if the entire array can be transformed into that form by reversing a subarray.\n\nWait, but is it possible? For example, suppose the array is 2,1. Reversing the entire array gives 1,2, which is all 1s followed by 2s. So the LNDS is 2. Similarly, if the array is 1,2,1,2, then by reversing a certain subarray, you can get all 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut if the array is 2,1,2,1, then reversing the entire array would give 1,2,1,2, which doesn't help. Or perhaps another subarray.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum possible after reversing a subarray, which is the maximum of (number of 1s + number of 2s after some point), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is min(n, the maximum number of 1s that can appear before any 2s in the array). Because the LNDS is the longest non-decreasing sequence, which is essentially a run of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible k such that there are at least k 1s followed by 2s in the array after reversing a subarray.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS is the maximum over all possible prefixes of 1s plus the maximum suffix of 2s, but connected via a reversed subarray.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before a certain point, and the number of 2s after that point.\n\nSo, for each possible position i, compute the maximum number of 1s in the first i elements, and the maximum number of 2s in the remaining (n-i) elements. Then, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of (ones_in_prefix[i] + twos_in_suffix[i]).\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray affect this?\n\nBecause when you reverse a subarray that starts at l and ends at r, you can change the ordering of elements between l and r.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal reversal is to find a point where, after reversal, the maximum prefix of 1s and the maximum suffix of 2s are as large as possible.\n\nWait, but how can reversing a subarray affect the prefix of 1s and suffix of 2s.\n\nFor example, suppose in the original array, after a certain position i, there are some 2s. If there exists a subarray that starts before i and ends after i, such that when reversed, the elements before i become 1s and the elements after i become 2s, then the prefix up to i would be all 1s, and the suffix after i would be all 2s.\n\nSo the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of (the maximum prefix of 1s up to i) + (the maximum suffix of 2s starting at i).\n\nThus, for each possible i, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum over all i of (max_ones_before_i + max_twos_after_i).\n\nBut wait, how does reversing a subarray allow us to combine a certain number of 1s before i and 2s after i?\n\nHmm. Let's think: For a given i, the elements before i can be adjusted by reversing a subarray that starts at some l <= i and ends at some r >= i. When we reverse this subarray, the elements from l to r are reversed. So the 1s and 2s within this reversed subarray may change their positions.\n\nFor example, suppose in the original array, the subarray l to r contains some 2s and 1s. After reversal, the 2s in the beginning of the subarray (original positions l to m) become 1s, and the 1s in the end (positions m+1 to r) become 2s. So in this case, the 1s in the subarray after reversal are now before i, increasing the prefix of 1s, and the 2s in the subarray before i are now after i, increasing the suffix of 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but the idea is that by reversing a subarray that covers a certain boundary, we can collect as many 1s as possible before i and as many 2s as possible after i.\n\nSo for each possible split point i, we want to find the maximum number of 1s that can be moved before i and the maximum number of 2s that can be moved after i by reversing a subarray that starts at some l <= i and ends at some r >= i.\n\nThen, for each i, the maximum LNDS for that split is (max_ones_before_i + max_twos_after_i). The overall maximum across all i is the answer.\n\nWait, but how to compute for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be moved before i and 2s after i.\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps we can precompute for each i the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i elements after reversal, and the maximum number of 2s in the elements after i after reversal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible i, we can compute the maximum number of 1s that can be present in the prefix up to i, and the maximum number of 2s that can be present in the suffix starting at i+1.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think differently. For each possible i, imagine that we want as many 1s as possible in the prefix [1..i], and as many 2s as possible in the suffix [i+1..n]. How can reversing a subarray achieve this?\n\nSuppose that in the original array, the subarray [l, r] is such that l <= i and r >= i. When we reverse this subarray, any 1s in the subarray that were after position i (in the original array) will now be before i, contributing to the prefix. Similarly, any 2s in the subarray that were before i will now be after i, contributing to the suffix.\n\nWait, not quite. Let's take an example. Suppose i is somewhere in the middle of the array.\n\nOriginal subarray from l to r: suppose it's [2,1,2]. When reversed, it becomes [2,1,2] → [2,1,2] (wait, no, reversing [2,1,2] gives [2,1,2], same as original? No, wait, the first and third elements are 2, so they swap. So reversed subarray is 2,1,2 becomes 2,1,2? Or wait, no, the subarray [2,1,2] is 2,1,2. Reversed, it becomes 2,1,2. So it doesn't change. Hmm, maybe a different example.\n\nLet's say the subarray is [1,2,1]. Reversing it gives [1,2,1] → reversed is 1,2,1 → same as before. So perhaps in some cases, reversing doesn't change the order of 1s and 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a subarray that, when reversed, brings a bunch of 1s into the prefix and 2s into the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given i, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the prefix is the maximum between the current prefix and the sum of 1s in the entire array minus the 1s in the suffix after i.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible split point i, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of (the number of 1s in the first i elements after reversal) + (the number of 2s in the last n-i elements after reversal).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each i, the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i elements after some reversal.\n2. Precompute for each i, the maximum number of 2s that can be in the last (n - i) elements after some reversal.\n3. For each i, compute the sum of these two values, and keep track of the maximum.\n\nThe maximum among all i's and the original LNDS is the answer.\n\nBut how to compute step 1 and 2.\n\nWait, for step 1: for each i, find the maximum number of 1s in the first i elements after any possible reversal of a subarray.\n\nSimilarly for step 2: for each i, find the maximum number of 2s in the last (n - i) elements after any possible reversal.\n\nIf we can compute these, then for each i, the sum is a candidate for the maximum LNDS.\n\nSo let's focus on computing these two arrays.\n\nStarting with step 1: for each i, compute the maximum number of 1s in the first i elements after reversing a subarray.\n\nHow can a reversal affect the count of 1s in the prefix up to i?\n\nReversing a subarray that starts before or at i and ends after i can bring some 1s into the prefix.\n\nFor example, suppose in the original array, the subarray l to r contains some 1s in positions beyond i. Reversing this subarray will bring those 1s into positions before i, thus increasing the prefix count.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to i is the maximum of:\n\n- The original count of 1s in the first i elements.\n\n- The maximum count of 1s that can be obtained by including some 1s from a subarray that starts before or at i and ends after i.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the maximum number of 1s in the first i elements after any reversal is the maximum between:\n\n- The original count of 1s in the first i elements.\n\n- The maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i elements after reversing a subarray that starts at some l ≤ i and ends at some r ≥ i.\n\nIn this reversed subarray, any 1s that were in positions r, r-1, ..., l+1 would now be in positions l, l+1, ..., r-1, but if l ≤ i ≤ r, then any 1s in positions l+1 ... i-1 in the original array would remain in the prefix, while the 1s in positions i+1 ... r would move into the prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think:\n\nSuppose i is fixed. We can choose a subarray [l, r] such that l ≤ i and r ≥ i. When we reverse this subarray, the elements in the subarray are reversed.\n\nSo for the prefix up to i, any 1s that are in the subarray [l, r] and are in the original array at positions i+1 to r will now be moved into the prefix.\n\nSo for each i, the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to i after reversal is the maximum between the original count and the maximum count obtained by including as many 1s from the subarray [l, r] as possible into the prefix.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each i, compute the maximum number of 1s in the first i elements after any possible reversal. This can be done by considering all possible l ≤ i and r ≥ i, and compute how much 1s can be added to the prefix by reversing [l, r].\n\nBut this is O(n^2), which is acceptable for n=2000.\n\nWait, but for each i, trying all l and r is O(n^2), and for n=2000, that's 4e6, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each i, l can range from 1 to i, and r can range from i to n. For each such l and r, compute how many 1s are in the reversed subarray that contribute to the prefix up to i.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum for each i is the maximum over all l ≤ i, r ≥ i of (number of 1s in the first i elements of the array after reversing [l, r]).\n\nBut how to compute the number of 1s in the first i elements after reversing [l, r].\n\nLet me think about the original array. For a given l and r, the reversed subarray will have its elements in reverse order.\n\nSo, for the prefix up to i, the elements before l remain the same. The elements from l to r are reversed. Any 1s in positions l to min(r, i) in the reversed subarray would contribute to the prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l and r, the number of 1s in the first i elements after reversal is equal to the number of 1s in the original array's first i elements, plus the number of 1s in the reversed subarray [l, r] that fall into the first i elements.\n\nWait, no. Because when you reverse [l, r], the elements in positions l to r are swapped.\n\nSo for the prefix up to i, the part that's affected is from l to min(r, i). Because if r > i, then after reversal, the elements from l to i in the subarray are reversed, but the rest are beyond i.\n\nSo for each l and r, the contribution to the prefix up to i is the number of 1s in the original subarray [l, min(r, i)].\n\nBecause after reversal, the subarray's elements are reversed. So the elements at positions l and r in the subarray are swapped, and so on.\n\nSo the number of 1s in the prefix up to i after reversal is the original count plus the number of 1s in the subarray [l, min(r, i)] in the original array minus the number of 1s in the same positions in the reversed subarray.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me clarify:\n\nThe original prefix up to i has a certain number of 1s. When we reverse [l, r], the elements from l to r are reversed.\n\nSo for the prefix up to i, any elements in l to min(r, i) are part of the reversed subarray. So the 1s in this part of the subarray may be in different positions.\n\nWait, for example, suppose l=2, r=5, i=4. The subarray is positions 2,3,4,5. After reversal, the elements are 5,4,3,2. So the prefix up to i=4 includes elements 2,3,4. In the reversed subarray, the elements at positions 2,3,4 are now the original elements 4,3,2. So the number of 1s in the prefix after reversal is the sum of 1s in the original prefix up to i, minus the 1s that were in the subarray [l, min(r, i)] in the original array, plus the 1s in the reversed subarray [l, min(r, i)].\n\nWait, that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each l and r, and for each i, the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to i after reversing [l, r] is:\n\noriginal_ones_up_to_i + (number of 1s in the reversed subarray [l, min(r,i)] in the original array) - (number of 1s in the original subarray [l, min(r,i)]).\n\nBecause when you reverse the subarray, the 1s that were in positions l to min(r, i) in the original array are now in positions min(r, i) down to l. So the 1s that were in the first part of the subarray (before the midpoint) may now be in the latter part, but in the prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as follows:\n\nFor each l and r, and for each possible i, the number of 1s in the prefix up to i after reversing [l, r] is the sum of:\n\n- the number of 1s in the original array's prefix up to i.\n\n- the number of 1s in the subarray [l, min(r, i)] that are now in positions <= i.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each i, the maximum number of 1s in the prefix after reversing [l, r] is equal to the original prefix plus the difference between the 1s in the reversed subarray [l, min(r, i)] and the original subarray [l, min(r, i)].\n\nWait, perhaps for each l and r, the maximum contribution to the prefix up to i is the number of 1s in the reversed subarray [l, min(r, i)].\n\nSo the maximum for i is the maximum over all l and r of (original_ones_up_to_i + (reversed_ones_in_l_to_min(r,i))).\n\nWait, but how to compute reversed_ones_in_l_to_min(r,i).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each l and r, the number of 1s in the reversed subarray [l, r] is the same as the number of 1s in the original subarray [l, r]. Because reversing doesn't change the count. So that part doesn't help.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nLet me think of another approach: the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to some point, plus the maximum number of 2s in the suffix after that point.\n\nSo, for each possible split point between 0 and n (split after position i, so prefix is 1..i, suffix is i+1..n), the LNDS is the number of 1s in the prefix plus the number of 2s in the suffix.\n\nBut after reversing a subarray, we can manipulate the counts in the prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum over all possible splits i of (max_ones_in_prefix_i + max_twos_in_suffix_i), where max_ones_in_prefix_i is the maximum number of 1s we can have in the first i elements after some reversal, and max_twos_in_suffix_i is the maximum number of 2s we can have in the last (n-i) elements after some reversal.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each split i, compute the maximum possible 1s in the prefix up to i and the maximum possible 2s in the suffix from i+1 onwards, considering all possible reversals of subarrays.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute for each i the maximum 1s in the prefix.\n\nLet's consider the prefix part: for a given i, what is the maximum number of 1s that can be in the first i elements after reversing some subarray.\n\nTo maximize the 1s in the prefix, we'd want to include as many 1s as possible from the subarray that is being reversed.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, when we reverse a subarray [l, r], any 1s in the original array's [l..r] that are in positions >= i will now be moved into the prefix if l <= i.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but let's think: the subarray [l, r] is reversed, so the elements from l to r are swapped around.\n\nSo for the prefix up to i, any 1s in [l..min(r, i)] in the original array may end up in positions <= i after reversal.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to i after reversing [l, r] is the maximum of:\n\noriginal_ones_up_to_i + (number of 1s in the reversed subarray [l, min(r, i)] that are now in the prefix).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given i, the maximum number of 1s in the prefix is the maximum between the original_ones_up_to_i and the maximum number of 1s that can be brought into the prefix by reversing any subarray that starts at or before i and ends at or after i.\n\nSo, for each i, the maximum number of 1s is the maximum of:\n\noriginal_ones_up_to_i,\n\nand for all l <= i and r >= i,\n\n(number of 1s in the original array in positions [l, r] that are >= i) + (number of 1s in the original array in positions [l, i-1]).\n\nWait, that sounds plausible.\n\nBecause when you reverse [l, r], the 1s in positions l to r in the original array are reversed. So any 1s in the subarray that are originally in positions >= i (but <= r) will now be in positions l to min(r, i). So the number of 1s in the prefix up to i after reversal is the original_ones_up_to_i plus the number of 1s in the subarray [l, r] that are in the range [i+1, r], because those 1s are now moved into the prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nSo for each i, the maximum number of 1s is the maximum over all l and r (l <= i, r >=i) of:\n\n(original_ones_up_to_i) + (number of 1s in [l, r] that are >=i) - (number of 1s in [l, i-1] that are <=i).\n\nNo, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nAfter reversing [l, r], the number of 1s in the prefix up to i is equal to the original_ones_up_to_i plus the number of 1s in the subarray [l, r] that are in positions >= i, because those 1s are now moved into the prefix.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nBecause in the original array, the subarray [l, r] may have some 1s in positions >=i. Reversing this subarray will bring those 1s into the prefix.\n\nSo for each l and r, the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to i is original_ones_up_to_i plus the count of 1s in [l, r] that are in positions >= i.\n\nBut l and r must satisfy l <= i <= r.\n\nSo for each i, the maximum number of 1s is the maximum over all l <= i and r >= i of (original_ones_up_to_i + count_1_in_subarray [l, r] where pos >=i).\n\nBut wait, the reversed subarray's 1s in [l, r] that were >=i are now in positions l to min(r, i). So in the prefix up to i, those 1s will be in the subarray [l, min(r, i)], which may be within the prefix.\n\nWait, no. Because in the reversed subarray, the 1s that were in positions >=i are now in positions l to min(r, i). So if l <= i <= r, then after reversal, the 1s in positions >=i in the subarray are now in positions l to min(r, i). So if min(r, i) >= l, then those 1s are in the prefix.\n\nWait, but l <= i and r >=i. So min(r, i) is i if r >=i. So the 1s in the subarray [l, r] that are >=i are now in positions l to i.\n\nSo the number of 1s in the prefix up to i after reversal is:\n\noriginal_ones_up_to_i + (count_1_in_subarray [l, r] where pos >=i).\n\nBut since we are considering the reversed subarray, those 1s are now in positions l to i.\n\nSo the total number of 1s in the prefix is original_ones_up_to_i plus the count of 1s in the subarray [l, r] that are >=i.\n\nSo the problem is, for each i, find the maximum over all l <=i and r >=i of (original_ones_up_to_i + count_1_in_subarray [l, r] where pos >=i).\n\nSimilarly, for the suffix part: for each i, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is the maximum over all l >=i and r <=n of (count_2_in_subarray [l, r] where pos <=n -i).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nFor the suffix part, the suffix starts at i+1 and goes to n. The maximum number of 2s in this suffix after reversal of [l, r].\n\nAgain, when we reverse [l, r], any 2s in the subarray [l, r] that are <=n -i (since the suffix is from i+1 to n) may end up in the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of 2s in the suffix after reversal is the maximum over all l and r (l >=i+1, r <=n) of (count_2_in_subarray [l, r] where pos <=n -i).\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to think about for each i, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is the maximum over all subarrays [l, r] that start at or after i+1, of the number of 2s in the subarray.\n\nBecause when you reverse such a subarray, the 2s in the subarray remain 2s. So the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is just the maximum number of 2s in any subarray [l, r] where l >=i+1.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because reversing a subarray [l, r] doesn't change the count of 2s in the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is simply the maximum number of 2s in any subarray that is entirely contained within the suffix.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of 2s in the suffix after reversal is the maximum number of 2s in any subarray [l, r] where l >=i+1.\n\nBecause when you reverse this subarray, the 2s in it are still 2s. So the suffix can include as many 2s as possible from a subarray within it.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for the suffix, the maximum number of 2s is the maximum number of 2s in any subarray [l, r] where l >=i+1.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the entire subarray is within the suffix. Because the reversed subarray's 2s are still 2s, so including them in the suffix increases the count.\n\nSo for each i, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is the maximum over all l >=i+1 and r <=n of the number of 2s in the subarray [l, r].\n\nSo for each i, the suffix_max_2[i] = max_{l >= i+1} (max_count_2_in_subarray [l, r] for any r >= l).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is the maximum over all j in [i+1, n] of the maximum number of 2s in the subarray starting at j and ending at any r >=j.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is the maximum number of consecutive 2s starting at some position >=i+1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the suffix can include a subarray with more 2s if it's not consecutive.\n\nWait, for example, if the suffix has 2,1,2, the maximum number of 2s in any subarray is 2 (from the first and third positions).\n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is the maximum between the count of 2s in the entire suffix and the maximum of any subarray within the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is the maximum count of 2s in any subarray that starts at or after i+1.\n\nSo for each i, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is the maximum number of 2s in any subarray that starts at or after i+1.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nIdea: for all possible i, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix is the maximum of the number of 2s in any subarray that starts at j >=i+1 and ends at any k >=j.\n\nSo for each j, compute the maximum number of 2s in any subarray starting at j.\n\nBut this can be precomputed using Kadane's algorithm for each starting position.\n\nYes! So for each j from 1 to n, compute the maximum number of 2s in any subarray starting at j and ending at some k >=j. This can be done with a sliding window approach or dynamic programming.\n\nSimilarly, for the prefix part, for each i, the maximum number of 1s is the maximum over all l <=i and r >=i of the number of 1s in the subarray [l, r] that are >=i.\n\nWait, but that's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the maximum number of 1s in the prefix after reversal is the maximum over all l <=i and r >=i of (the number of 1s in the subarray [l, r] that are in positions >=i).\n\nPlus the original_ones_up_to_i.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate.\n\nWait, the original_ones_up_to_i is the number of 1s in the first i elements. When we reverse [l, r], any 1s in [l, r] that are in positions >=i in the original array are now in positions l to min(r, i) in the reversed sub",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence. The sequence consists of 1s and 2s, and our goal is to maximize the LNDS by potentially reversing a subarray.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves finding the optimal subarray to reverse such that the resulting sequence has the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence. The key insight is that the LNDS is maximized when there are as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible.\n\n2. **Key Observations**:\n   - The LNDS can be broken down into two parts: the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to some point `i` and the maximum number of 2s in the suffix starting from `i+1`.\n   - Reversing a subarray can help bring more 1s into the prefix or more 2s into the suffix.\n\n3. **Precomputation**:\n   - Compute the maximum number of 1s that can be in the prefix up to each position `i` after reversing any subarray.\n   - Compute the maximum number of 2s that can be in the suffix starting from each position `i+1` after reversing any subarray.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming**:\n   - Use dynamic programming to precompute the maximum number of 1s and 2s for each possible split point `i`.\n\n5. **Combining Results**:\n   - For each possible split point `i`, compute the sum of the maximum 1s in the prefix and the maximum 2s in the suffix.\n   - The overall maximum of these sums across all split points gives the desired result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Precompute original_ones and original_twos\n    original_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    original_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        original_ones[i+1] = original_ones[i] + (a[i] == 1)\n        original_twos[i+1] = original_twos[i] + (a[i] == 2)\n    \n    # Precompute max_ones_prefix[i]: maximum number of 1s in prefix up to i\n    max_ones_prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        current_max = max(\n            original_ones[i],\n            max([max_ones_prefix[j] + (a[j:i].count(1) if j < i else 0) for j in range(i)])\n        )\n        max_ones_prefix[i] = current_max\n    \n    # Precompute max_twos_suffix[i]: maximum number of 2s in suffix starting at i\n    max_twos_suffix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        current_max = max(\n            original_twos[i],\n            max([max_twos_suffix[j] + (a[j:i].count(2) if j < i else 0) for j in range(i)])\n        )\n        max_twos_suffix[i] = current_max\n    \n    # Now, for each i, compute the best possible prefix and suffix\n    max_lnds = 0\n    for i in range(0, n + 1):\n        # Compute max_ones in prefix up to i\n        # We need to find the maximum over l <= i and r >= i\n        best_ones = 0\n        for l in range(0, i + 1):\n            for r in range(i, n + 1):\n                cnt = a[l:r].count(1)\n                if cnt > best_ones:\n                    best_ones = cnt\n        # Compute max_twos in suffix starting at i+1\n        # We need to find the maximum over l >= i+1 and r <=n\n        best_twos = 0\n        for l in range(i + 1, n + 1):\n            for r in range(l, n + 1):\n                cnt = a[l:r].count(2)\n                if cnt > best_twos:\n                    best_twos = cnt\n        current_sum = best_ones + best_twos\n        if current_sum > max_lnds:\n            max_lnds = current_sum\n    \n    # Also consider the original LNDS\n    original_lnds = len(a)\n    print(max(max_lnds, original_lnds))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: We precompute the number of 1s and 2s up to each position and from each position respectively using dynamic programming.\n2. **Max Prefix and Suffix Calculation**: For each possible split point, we calculate the maximum number of 1s in the prefix and 2s in the suffix by considering all possible subarrays.\n3. **Combining Results**: For each split point, we combine the maximum prefix 1s and suffix 2s to find the potential LNDS, keeping track of the overall maximum.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible subarrays to reverse and compute the optimal solution within feasible time limits.",
