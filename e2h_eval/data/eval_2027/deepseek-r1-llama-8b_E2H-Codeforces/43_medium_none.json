He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A creates a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So after this step, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C then appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both). \n\nOur task is to determine whether a given string S could have been formed through this process.\n\nHmm, so the string must follow the order: all 'a's first, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So any string that doesn't have this order is automatically invalid.\n\nSo first, I need to check the structure of the string. It should consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's, with no other characters in between. If any 'a' comes after a 'b' or 'c', it's invalid. Similarly for 'b's after 'c's.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, I need to check the counts.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nStep 1: Check the order of the string.\n\n- The string must start with some 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n- So, the first character must be 'a', and the last must be 'c'.\n- All 'a's are before any 'b's, which are before any 'c's.\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, output is NO.\n\nStep 2: Check the counts.\n\nAfter the structure is confirmed, let's count the number of 'a's (count_a), 'b's (count_b), and 'c's (count_c).\n\nThe key condition is that count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b (or both).\n\nBut wait, what about the constraints from A and B?\n\nA created the initial string, which has some 'a's. Then B appended 'b's, so count_b is at least 1. So count_a is >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nC appends 'c's such that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, the necessary conditions are:\n\n- The string is of the form a...ab...bc...c.\n- count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but what about cases where count_c is equal to both? Like, if count_a = count_b, then count_c would be equal to both. That's allowed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form a followed by b followed by c. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\n3. Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. If yes, return YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, how to implement step 1.\n\nHow to check the order:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and ensure that once we encounter a 'b', we don't see any 'a's after that. Similarly, once we see a 'c', no 'a's or 'b's should come after.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nAnother approach is to find the indices where the transitions happen.\n\nFor example, the first transition from 'a' to 'b' (if any) should occur after all 'a's. The next transition from 'b' to 'c' (if any) should occur after all 'b's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to track the current allowed characters.\n\nInitialize state as expecting 'a's. Once a 'b' is encountered, switch to expecting 'b's. Then, upon encountering a 'c', switch to expecting 'c's. Any deviation from this order is invalid.\n\nSo, for each character in the string:\n\n- If current expected is 'a':\n   - if char is 'a': continue\n   - if char is 'b': switch expected to 'b'\n   - if char is 'c': invalid, return NO\n- Else if expected is 'b':\n   - if char is 'b': continue\n   - if char is 'a': invalid\n   - if char is 'c': switch expected to 'c'\n- Else if expected is 'c':\n   - if char is 'c': continue\n   - else: invalid\n\nThis way, we can track the allowed transitions.\n\nLet me test this logic on some examples.\n\nExample 1: 'aaabccc'\n\n- Starts with 'a's. Then 'b's, then 'c's. So transitions correctly.\n\nExample 2: 'bbacc'\n\n- First char is 'b'. Expected is 'a', but we get 'b' here. So invalid. So the string is invalid because the order is wrong.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' — wait, wait, the third input is 'aabc'? Wait, no, according to the note, the third example is 'aabc'?\n\nWait, the sample input shows ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], and the outputs are YES, NO, YES.\n\nWait, for 'aabc':\n\nLooking at the string: 'aabc' — first three letters are 'a','a','b', then 'c'.\n\nWait, the string is 'a a b c'. So the order is a followed by b, followed by c. But the 'b' is before 'c', but after 'a's. So the order is correct.\n\nSo the structure is a followed by b followed by c.\n\nCount a: 2, b:1, c:1.\n\nSo count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So condition is satisfied. So output is YES.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbbc' — valid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcb' — after 'a's, we have 'b's, but then 'c' comes, then 'b' again. So during processing, when 'c' is encountered, the expected is 'c'. Next character is 'b' which is not allowed. So this string is invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'acbbbc' — first character is 'a', then 'c' — invalid.\n\nSo the logic should correctly identify the order.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nIn Python, read the string S.\n\nCheck that the string is non-empty and consists only of 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nThen, track the expected characters.\n\nImplement the state machine.\n\nInitialize expected_char as 'a'.\n\nIterate through each character in S:\n\n   if current_char == expected_char:\n       continue\n   elif current_char == next possible (e.g., after 'a' is 'b'):\n       expected_char becomes 'b'\n   else:\n       return 'NO'\n\nWait, but after 'a' comes 'b' or 'c'? No, because after 'a's, only 'b's can come, and after 'b's, only 'c's can come.\n\nWait, the transitions are:\n\nFrom 'a' -> only 'a' or 'b' can come.\n\nWait, no: the process is that A gives B the string, who appends 'b's. So after the 'a's, only 'b's can be present. Then, C appends 'c's, so after 'b's, only 'c's can be present.\n\nSo, during the state checking:\n\n- Once a 'b' is encountered, the next allowed characters are 'b's until a 'c' appears, which then allows only 'c's.\n\nSo the state transitions are:\n\n- Start: expecting 'a'\n\n- After seeing a 'b', expecting 'b's\n\n- After seeing a 'c', expecting 'c's\n\nSo, in code:\n\nstate = 0 # 0: a, 1: b, 2: c\n\nfor c in S:\n\n    if state == 0:\n\n        if c == 'a':\n\n            continue\n\n        elif c == 'b':\n\n            state = 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # c is 'c' but state is a, which is invalid.\n\n            print('NO')\n\n            exit()\n\n    elif state == 1:\n\n        if c == 'b':\n\n            continue\n\n        elif c == 'c':\n\n            state = 2\n\n        else:\n\n            # c is 'a' in state 1: invalid.\n\n            print('NO')\n\n            exit()\n\n    elif state == 2:\n\n        if c != 'c':\n\n            print('NO')\n\n            exit()\n\nSo, this loop will check the order.\n\nIf the loop completes without exiting, then the order is correct.\n\nNext, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nBut wait: in the state machine, state 0 is 'a's, state 1 is 'b's, state 2 is 'c's.\n\nBut after state changes, the counts are:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in state 0.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's in state 1.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's in state 2.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncount_a = 0\n\ncount_b = 0\n\ncount_c = 0\n\nstate = 0\n\nfor c in S:\n\n    if state == 0:\n\n        if c == 'a':\n\n            count_a += 1\n\n        elif c == 'b':\n\n            state = 1\n\n            count_b += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # invalid\n\n            print('NO')\n\n            exit()\n\n    elif state == 1:\n\n        if c == 'b':\n\n            count_b += 1\n\n        elif c == 'c':\n\n            state = 2\n\n            count_c += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # invalid\n\n            print('NO')\n\n            exit()\n\n    elif state == 2:\n\n        if c == 'c':\n\n            count_c += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # invalid\n\n            print('NO')\n\n            exit()\n\nWait, but during the first state (state 0), the 'b's are being added, but they are part of the initial 'a's plus 'b's. So perhaps it's better to collect the counts as we go.\n\nWait, in the code above, for each character:\n\n- When in state 0, if it's 'a', add to count_a.\n\nIf it's 'b', transition to state 1 and add to count_b.\n\nSimilarly, when in state 1, 'b's add to count_b, 'c's add to count_c and transition.\n\nWhen in state 2, 'c's add to count_c.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nOnce the entire string is processed, we have count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nThen, we need to check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, what about the constraints that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1? Because A adds at least one 'a', B adds at least one 'b'.\n\nSo, if the string is just 'ac', it's invalid because count_b is 0.\n\nSo, in our code, after counting, we should also check that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nBecause, according to the problem statement, after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nSo, even if the structure is correct, if count_a is zero or count_b is zero, it's invalid.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the string is 'abc'—count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1. So it's valid.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc'—count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1. count_c is 1, which is not equal to count_a or count_b. So it's invalid.\n\nWait, in that case, since count_c is 1, it's not equal to 2 or 2, so it's invalid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nafter counting, check:\n\nif count_a <1 or count_b <1:\n\n    print('NO')\n\nelse:\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print('YES')\n\n    else:\n\n        print('NO')\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: 'a'\n\nNo, because after B appends, there must be at least one 'b'.\n\nSo, our code will have count_b=0, which is invalid.\n\nSo, output is 'NO'.\n\nTest case 2: 'ab'\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=0. So count_c is zero, which is invalid.\n\nOutput is 'NO'.\n\nTest case 3: 'abc'\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c equals both a and b. So output 'YES'.\n\nTest case 4: 'aabba'\n\nWait, no, because after the 'a's come 'b's, but then 'a' again. So the state machine will detect 'a' after 'b's, which is invalid. So output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc'\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2. So count_c equals both. Output 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbbc' → count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=1. count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' → invalid due to order.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's proceed to write the code.\n\nRead S from input.\n\nHandle empty string? Well, the problem says the string is at least length 1.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to consist of a, b, c only.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead S as input().strip()\n\nThen, perform the state machine.\n\nInitialize state=0, count_a=0, count_b=0, count_c=0.\n\nLoop through each character in S:\n\n   if state == 0:\n\n      if c == 'a':\n\n          count_a +=1\n\n      elif c == 'b':\n\n          state = 1\n\n          count_b +=1\n\n      else:\n\n          print('NO')\n\n          exit()\n\n   elif state ==1:\n\n      if c == 'b':\n\n          count_b +=1\n\n      elif c == 'c':\n\n          state =2\n\n          count_c +=1\n\n      else:\n\n          print('NO')\n\n          exit()\n\n   elif state ==2:\n\n      if c == 'c':\n\n          count_c +=1\n\n      else:\n\n          print('NO')\n\n          exit()\n\nAfter processing all characters:\n\nCheck if count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nIf not, print 'NO'.\n\nElse, check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf yes, print 'YES', else 'NO'.\n\nSo, the code in Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nstate = 0\ncount_a = 0\ncount_b = 0\ncount_c = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n    if state == 0:\n        if c == 'a':\n            count_a +=1\n        elif c == 'b':\n            state = 1\n            count_b +=1\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif state == 1:\n        if c == 'b':\n            count_b +=1\n        elif c == 'c':\n            state = 2\n            count_c +=1\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif state == 2:\n        if c == 'c':\n            count_c +=1\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nif count_a <1 or count_b <1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nTesting this against the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nProcessing:\n\nstate starts at 0.\n\nAll 'a's until 'b' appears. Then state becomes 1, count_b increases.\n\nThen more 'b's.\n\nThen 'c's, state becomes 2.\n\ncount_a is 3, count_b is 2, count_c is 3.\n\ncount_c is 3, which equals count_a (3). So output YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc'\n\nFirst character is 'b' when state is 0 → invalid. So output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → 'a','a','b','c'\n\nstate 0: 'a'→ count_a=1.\n\n'a' again: count_a=2.\n\nThen 'b' → state=1, count_b=1.\n\nThen 'c' → state=2, count_c=1.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So output YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → count_c=1, which equals a and b (both 1). So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabba' → the 'a' after 'b's is invalid. So code returns NO.\n\nWhat about 'acb' → first character is 'a' → state 0. Second 'c' is invalid. So NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → after 'a's, 'b's come. Then 'a' again → invalid. So NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabbc' → after 'a's, 'b's, then 'a's again → invalid.\n\nI think this should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific process involving appending characters in a particular order. The string must be formed by first appending 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's, with the number of 'c's being equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must strictly follow the order 'a's followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. This means that once a 'b' is encountered, no 'a' should appear after it, and once a 'c' is encountered, no 'a' or 'b' should appear after it.\n2. **Count Characters**: After ensuring the correct order, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' (as per the problem constraints). Additionally, check if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nstate = 0\ncount_a = 0\ncount_b = 0\ncount_c = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n    if state == 0:\n        if c == 'a':\n            count_a += 1\n        elif c == 'b':\n            state = 1\n            count_b += 1\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif state == 1:\n        if c == 'b':\n            count_b += 1\n        elif c == 'c':\n            state = 2\n            count_c += 1\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif state == 2:\n        if c == 'c':\n            count_c += 1\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code uses a state machine to track the expected characters. It starts expecting 'a's, transitions to expecting 'b's upon encountering the first 'b', and transitions to expecting 'c's upon encountering the first 'c'.\n2. **Character Counting**: As it processes each character, it keeps count of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's according to the state transitions.\n3. **Validation**: After processing the entire string, it checks if there are at least one 'a' and one 'b'. It then checks if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's, printing \"YES\" if true and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThis approach ensures that the string meets both the structural and count requirements specified in the problem.",
