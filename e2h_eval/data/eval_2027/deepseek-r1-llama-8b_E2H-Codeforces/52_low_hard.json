Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for exactly one hour and then goes out. But the smart part is that he can collect the burned-out candles and trade them in. Specifically, he can make 'b' of these gone candles into a new one. So, each time he has enough gone candles, he can create more and burn them, thus extending the total hours.\n\nMy task is to compute the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit by optimally managing the candles.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The initial step is straightforward: he burns all 'a' candles, which gives 'a' hours and 'a' gone candles.\n\nBut then, for every 'b' gone candles, he can make one new candle. So, after the initial burn, he can convert some of the gone candles into new ones, which when burned, add to the count of gone candles again.\n\nThis seems like a loop where we keep track of the remaining candles and the extra ones that can be made from the leftovers.\n\nLet me break it down with an example. Suppose a=4, b=2.\n\nHe burns 4 candles: 4 hours. Now he has 4 gone candles.\n\nHe can exchange 4 // b = 2 new candles. So he burns 2 more, adding 2 hours (total now 6), and now he has 2 gone candles from those plus 0 leftover because 4 mod 2 is 0.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. After making 2 new candles from 4, he uses them. So they each burn for 1 hour, giving 2 more gone candles. So total gone is 2 from the new ones plus any remaining? No, because 4 divided by 2 is 2, which leaves 0 remainder. So after burning those 2, he has 2 gone candles.\n\nNow, he has 2, which is equal to b=2, so he can make another candle. Burn it for 1 hour, now he has 1 gone candle.\n\nSo total hours: 4 + 2 + 1 =7.\n\nThat makes sense as per the example.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\nInitial burn:6h, 6 gone.\n\n6//3=2 new candles. Burn them: 2h, total 8, and adds 2 gone. So now, 6-6=0, but then he has 2 new gone. So 2 <3, can't make more.\n\nTotal is 6+2=8.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Start with total_hours = a.\n2. left_candles = a.\n3. While left_candles >= b:\n   a. new_candles = left_candles // b\n   b. total_hours += new_candles\n   c. left_candles = (left_candles % b) + new_candles\n\nWait, no. Because after creating new_candles, he burns each of them, which adds new_candles to the total, and each contributes to the left_candles. Also, the remainder is left over.\n\nWait, correct process:\n\nEach iteration:\n\n- Calculate how many new candles can be made: new = left // b.\n- Add new to total_hours.\n- The new candles are burned, so they produce 'new' gone candles.\n- The left_candles after this step is (left % b) + new.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize total = a.\n\ncurrent_gone = a.\n\nwhile current_gone >= b:\n\n    new = current_gone // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    current_gone = (current_gone % b) + new\n\nContinue until current_gone < b.\n\nThat should give the correct total.\n\nTesting on sample 1:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ncurrent_gone=4.\n\nnew=2. total becomes 4+2=6. current_gone = (4%2=0) +2=2.\n\nNext iteration: 2 >=2.\n\nnew=1. total 7. current_gone =0 +1=1 <2. Loop ends.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2.\n\nInitial:5h, current_gone=5.\n\nnew=2 (since 5//2=2). total=7.\n\ncurrent_gone=5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nLoop continues.\n\n3 >=2: new=1, total=8.\n\ncurrent_gone=3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nLoop again: new=1, total=9.\n\ncurrent_gone=2%2=0 +1=1 <2. Stop.\n\nTotal is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can create new candles from the remains of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`, which will burn for `a` hours, producing `a` burned-out candles.\n2. **Candle Recycling**: For every `b` burned-out candles, Vasily can create a new candle. This process can be repeated until the number of burned-out candles is less than `b`.\n3. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Continuously convert burned-out candles into new ones as long as there are enough to form a new candle. Each new candle burns for an additional hour and then becomes another burned-out candle that can potentially be recycled again.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Burn all initial candles to get `a` hours and `a` burned-out candles.\n2. Use a loop to repeatedly convert the remaining burned-out candles into new ones until there aren't enough to make another candle.\n3. Keep track of the total hours by adding the hours from each newly burned candle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n    new = current // b\n    total += new\n    current = (current % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by burning all `a` candles, which gives us `a` hours and `a` burned-out candles.\n- **Recycling Process**: In each iteration of the loop, we calculate how many new candles can be made from the current number of burned-out candles. Each new candle adds to the total hours and also contributes to the count of burned-out candles.\n- **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until the number of burned-out candles is less than `b`, at which point no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iteratively converting and burning candles, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
