His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have in an Olympiad based on his total points. The teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x points. The input gives us two lists: one for the first tour scores and another for the second tour, but they're not sorted or linked to specific participants. Our task is to determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could achieve.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem: each participant has a score from the first tour and a score from the second tour. The sum of these two determines their rank. If two people have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order, which affects the rank. So, for the best rank, we want as few people as possible with a higher sum than Vasya's, and for the worst rank, as many as possible.\n\nWait, but Vasya's own sum is fixed? Or no—wait, no. Because the first and second tour points are given, but the teacher doesn't know which participant (i.e., which combination of a_i and b_j) is Vasya. So the actual sum for Vasya could vary depending on which a_i and b_j he has. But the problem states that his total is at least x. So, to find the best and worst possible positions, we need to consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >= x, and then compute the best and worst ranks across all such possibilities.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So the actual sum s = a_i + b_j is >=x. But the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j it is. So, for our calculation, we need to consider all possible pairs where a_i + b_j >=x, and for each such pair, determine what would be the best and worst possible ranks.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to model it as: find all possible s = a_i + b_j >=x, and for each s, determine what is the maximum number of participants who could have a sum greater than s, and the minimum number. Then, the best rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > s, and the worst is the position when as many as possible have sum <= s.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the sum s could vary. So for each possible s (which is a_i + b_j and >=x), we can calculate how many participants have a sum greater than s, and how many have a sum less than or equal to s. Then, the best possible rank for Vasya is the minimal (best case) rank, which would be 1 + the count of sums strictly greater than s. The worst possible rank would be the maximal (worst case) rank, which would be the count of sums <= s plus 1.\n\nWait, no. Because in the worst case, as many participants as possible have a sum <= s. So for a particular s, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum <= s plus 1. But wait, if s is Vasya's sum, then all participants with sum < s will have lower ranks, and those with sum == s can be either above or below, depending on how the jury arranges them.\n\nBut since the jury can choose the order among ties, to maximize the worst rank for Vasya, we need to assume that all participants with sum > s come before him, and all participants with sum <= s come after him. Or wait, no. Because in the worst case, Vasya is placed as low as possible. So for the worst rank, we want as many participants as possible to have sum >= s, but arranged in a way that Vasya is as low as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor a given s (Vasya's sum), the best possible rank is 1 + the number of participants whose sum is > s. Because the jury can place Vasya before all others with sum > s, making him rank 1 among those.\n\nThe worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum <= s plus 1. Because in the worst case, all those participants are placed above Vasya, pushing him to the end.\n\nWait, but wait: if there are k participants with sum > s, then the best possible rank is k + 1. For example, if Vasya's sum is s, and 2 participants have sum greater than s, then he can be placed first, so his rank is 1. That makes sense.\n\nIn the worst case, all participants with sum <= s are placed before him, and those with sum > s can be placed after. So the worst rank would be the number of participants with sum <= s plus the number of participants with sum == s (but in the worst case, all sum <= s are before him, including those with sum equal). Wait, no. Because for participants with sum equal to s, the jury can choose to place them before or after him. So in the worst case, Vasya is placed as low as possible, so all participants with sum <= s are placed before him, including those with sum equal to s. So the worst possible rank is (number of participants with sum <= s) + 1.\n\nYes, because participants with sum > s are all placed after him. Those with sum <= s are placed before. So the worst case is when Vasya is last among all participants with sum <= s.\n\nSo, for each possible s that could be Vasya's sum (s = a_i + b_j, s >=x), we can compute the best and worst ranks.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the sum can be any possible s that is a_i + b_j and s >=x. So, to find the best possible overall rank, we need to find the minimal possible best rank across all possible s. Similarly, for the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible worst rank across all possible s.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, the best and worst ranks are different. We need to find the overall best possible rank Vasya can have (the smallest possible rank), and the overall worst possible rank (the largest possible rank). So for all possible s (all pairs where a_i + b_j >=x), compute for each s the best and worst ranks, then take the minimum of all best ranks and the maximum of all worst ranks.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, the best rank is the minimal possible (like 1), and the worst is the maximal possible (like n). But for other s's, the best rank may be worse. So, to find the overall best possible rank, we pick the s that gives the best (lowest) best rank. Similarly for the worst.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible s = a_i + b_j where s >=x. For each such s, compute:\n\n   a. The number of participants (k) with sum > s. The best possible rank for this s is k + 1.\n\n   b. The number of participants (m) with sum <= s. The worst possible rank for this s is m + 1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The best possible rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > s. Because all those with sum > s can be placed before him, so he is next, hence rank k+1.\n\nThe worst possible rank is (number of participants with sum <= s) + 1. Because all those with sum <= s can be placed before him, and all with sum > s can be placed after. So he is at the end of the participants with sum <= s, hence m + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, the participants with sum == s can be arranged either before or after him. So in the best case, they are placed before, which would make Vasya's rank better. In the worst case, they are placed after, which would make Vasya's rank worse.\n\nWait, no. Because for the best rank, we can arrange the participants such that all those with sum > s are before Vasya, and those with sum == s are also before him, making Vasya's rank as high as possible. For the worst rank, we can arrange all those with sum <= s before him, and those with sum > s after him, making Vasya's rank as low as possible.\n\nSo, for each s, the best possible rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > s.\n\nThe worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum <= s plus 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose there are 3 participants:\n\nParticipant A: sum 5\n\nParticipant B: sum 5\n\nParticipant C: sum 6\n\nIf Vasya's sum is 5.\n\nThen, the best possible rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum >5) = 1 +1=2.\n\nBecause participant C has sum 6, so he is placed before Vasya, and then Vasya is next, so rank 2.\n\nWait, but in the best scenario, can't Vasya be placed first? No, because participant C has a higher sum. So in the best case, Vasya can be placed after C, but before A and B. So his rank is 2.\n\nIn the worst case, all participants with sum <=5 are placed before him. So A and B have sum 5, which is equal to Vasya's. So in the worst case, the jury can arrange them before him, making his rank 3.\n\nSo for s=5, the best rank is 2, the worst is 3.\n\nAnother example: let's say s=4.\n\nParticipants:\n\nA:4\n\nB:5\n\nC:6\n\nSo, for s=4, the best possible rank is 1 + number of participants with sum>4 → 2 (B and C). So best rank is 3.\n\nThe worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum <=4 (only A) +1=2.\n\nWait, but in the worst case, all participants with sum <=4 are placed before him. So A is before him, and B and C are after. So Vasya's rank is 2.\n\nSo yes, the best and worst are computed as described.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor all possible s (sums a_i + b_j where s >=x), compute:\n\nbest_rank = 1 + (number of participants with sum > s)\n\nworst_rank = (number of participants with sum <= s) + 1\n\nWe need to find the minimal best_rank across all possible s, and the maximal worst_rank across all possible s.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, the best_rank is the best possible for that s, but the overall best possible is the minimal among all possible s's best_ranks.\n\nSimilarly, the worst_rank is the worst possible for that s, and the overall worst is the maximum among all s's worst_ranks.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible s by considering all a_i + b_j, ensuring s >=x.\n\n2. For each such s:\n\n   a. Compute the number of participants with sum > s. Let's call this count_gt.\n\n      best_rank = count_gt + 1.\n\n   b. Compute the number of participants with sum <= s. Let's call this count_le.\n\n      worst_rank = count_le + 1.\n\n3. Among all possible s, find the minimum best_rank and the maximum worst_rank.\n\n4. Output the minimum best_rank and the maximum worst_rank.\n\nBut wait, how do we generate all possible s?\n\nBecause for each participant, their a_i and b_j can be combined. But wait, each participant is represented by exactly one (a_i, b_j) pair. So for all participants, their sum is a_i + b_j. But the problem says that the first and second tour results are given in arbitrary order. So each (a_i, b_j) is a possible pair for a participant, but the same a_i and b_j can appear multiple times across different participants.\n\nWait, no. Each participant has exactly one a_i and one b_j. So the list of a's and b's are both of length n, but they are not necessarily aligned. For example, the first a is for some participant, and the second b is for another.\n\nWait, no. Each participant has a score in the first tour and a score in the second tour. So the a's and b's are lists of n elements each, but each element corresponds to a participant. But the a's and b's are not necessarily in any particular order.\n\nSo, for each participant, their total is a_p + b_p, where a_p is the p-th a and b_p is the p-th b. But since the a's and b's are in arbitrary order, the way the data is given is that for each i, a_i is the first tour score of the i-th participant, and b_i is the second tour score of the same i-th participant.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says:\n\n\"The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an — the participants' points in the first tour.\"\n\n\"The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn — the participants' points in the second tour.\"\n\nSo, for each participant, their first tour score is a_i, and their second tour score is b_i. So the sum for the i-th participant is a_i + b_i.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point! So each participant's total is a_i + b_i. So the list of sums is simply the sum of each a_i and b_i.\n\nSo the initial step is to compute all the participants' sums as a_i + b_i.\n\nThen, for Vasya, his sum is one of these s = a_i + b_i, and s must be >=x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's sum is >=x. So the actual sum s of Vasya is one of the a_i + b_i, and s >=x.\n\nSo, the possible s values are the a_i + b_i where a_i + b_i >=x.\n\nSo, the first step is to compute all possible s values that are the sum of a_i and b_i, and are >=x.\n\nOnce we have all such s, for each s, we can compute the number of participants with sum >s (count_gt) and the number with sum <=s (count_le).\n\nWait, but for a given s, the count_gt is the number of participants whose sum is > s, and count_le is the number of participants whose sum is <= s.\n\nWait, but if s is the sum for a particular participant, then for all other participants, their sum could be anything. So for each s in the set of possible sums (each s is a_i +b_i, s >=x), we need to compute:\n\ncount_gt(s) = number of participants with sum >s.\n\ncount_le(s) = number of participants with sum <=s.\n\nSo, for each s in the list of possible sums (each a_i +b_i >=x):\n\n   best_rank(s) = 1 + count_gt(s)\n\n   worst_rank(s) = count_le(s) +1.\n\nThen, among all s, find the minimal best_rank(s), and the maximal worst_rank(s).\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Read n, x.\n\n2. Read a list and b list.\n\n3. Compute all possible s = a_i + b_i. Collect them into a list S.\n\n4. For each s in S:\n\n   a. Compute count_gt: number of participants with sum >s.\n\n   b. Compute count_le: number of participants with sum <=s.\n\n   c. Compute best_rank = count_gt +1.\n\n   d. Compute worst_rank = count_le +1.\n\n5. Among all best_rank values, find the minimal one.\n\n6. Among all worst_rank values, find the maximal one.\n\n7. Output the minimal best_rank and maximal worst_rank.\n\nWait, but why can Vasya's sum be any of the a_i +b_i that are >=x? Because the problem states that Vasya was present, so there exists at least one such s.\n\nSo, the steps above should work.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, compute all a_i + b_i, collect into a list sums.\n\nThen, for each s in sums:\n\nCompute count_gt as the number of elements in sums that are >s.\n\ncount_le is the number of elements <=s.\n\nWait, but note that for a particular s, the count_gt and count_le are the same as the number of participants with sum >s and sum <=s, respectively.\n\nSo, for each s, count_gt is len([y for y in sums if y > s]).\n\ncount_le is len([y for y in sums if y <= s]).\n\nBut this can be time-consuming if n is large. However, n is up to 105, so it's manageable.\n\nSo, in Python, for each s in sums:\n\ncount_gt = sum(1 for y in sums if y > s)\n\ncount_le = sum(1 for y in sums if y <= s)\n\nThen, best_rank = count_gt +1.\n\nworst_rank = count_le +1.\n\nWait, but wait. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nsums are all 2.\n\nSo for each s=2, count_gt is 0, best_rank is 1.\n\ncount_le is 5, worst_rank is 6.\n\nBut in the sample output, the worst_rank is 5.\n\nWait, wait, no.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the output is '1 5'.\n\nWait, according to our method, for each s=2:\n\ncount_gt=0 → best_rank=1.\n\ncount_le=5 → worst_rank=6.\n\nBut the sample expects the worst_rank to be 5.\n\nHmm. That indicates that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's happening here.\n\nIn the sample input, all participants have sum 2. So for any s=2:\n\ncount_gt=0 → best_rank=1.\n\ncount_le=5 → worst_rank=5+1=6.\n\nBut the sample expects the worst rank to be 5.\n\nSo why is that?\n\nAh, because the problem allows the jury to arrange participants with the same sum arbitrarily. So in the worst case, all participants with sum <=s are placed before Vasya, but for participants with sum equal to s, the jury can choose to place them after him, thus increasing his rank.\n\nWait, no. For the worst possible rank, we want to maximize the number of participants that come before him. So for participants with sum <=s, including those with sum equal to s, can be placed before him. So, for s=2, count_le=5, so worst_rank=5+1=6.\n\nBut the sample output is 5.\n\nThis suggests that my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nIt says: the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points (descending). If two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order.\n\nSo, the rank is determined by the sum in descending order, but for ties, the order is arbitrary.\n\nSo, for the purpose of computing the rank, for participants with the same sum, their relative order can be chosen.\n\nSo, in the first sample, all participants have sum 2. So, the jury can arrange them in any order. So, in the best case, Vasya is first, in the worst case, he is last.\n\nThus, for the best rank, it's 1, for the worst, it's 5.\n\nBut according to my previous approach, for each s=2:\n\ncount_gt=0 → best_rank=1.\n\ncount_le=5 → worst_rank=6.\n\nWhich contradicts the sample.\n\nSo, my approach is wrong.\n\nWhat is the correct way to compute the best and worst ranks?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe best possible rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > s.\n\nThe worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >=s, because the jury can arrange all participants with sum >=s before him, and those with sum <s after.\n\nWait, no. Because in the worst case, the participants with sum >=s are arranged in such a way that as many as possible come before him.\n\nSo for a given s, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >=s minus the number of participants with sum > s, plus 1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, for a given s, the participants are divided into:\n\n- those with sum >s: can be placed before him.\n\n- those with sum ==s: can be placed either before or after.\n\nIn the worst case, all participants with sum >=s are placed before him.\n\nSo, the worst_rank is (number of participants with sum >=s) +1.\n\nWait, no. Because for participants with sum ==s, the jury can arrange them after him, which would increase his rank.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the worst rank for Vasya is when as many as possible participants are placed before him. So, for participants with sum >s, they are definitely before him. For participants with sum ==s, the jury can choose to place them after him, which would minimize the number of participants before him.\n\nWait, no, wait. To maximize his rank, we want to minimize the number of participants before him.\n\nNo, wait. To get the worst possible rank, we want as many participants as possible to be placed before him. So, for participants with sum >s, they are before him. For participants with sum ==s, we can choose to place them after him, so that they don't add to the count before him.\n\nWait, but if you can place them after, then the number of participants before him is just the count_gt.\n\nBut that's not correct because for the worst case, we want as many as possible before him.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me re-express the problem.\n\nEach participant's sum is s_p.\n\nWe have a particular s (Vasya's sum).\n\nThe participants are sorted in decreasing order of s_p.\n\nThose with higher s_p come before those with lower.\n\nFor participants with the same s_p, their order is arbitrary.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, all participants with s_p > s are placed before Vasya, and those with s_p ==s are placed before him. So, the best rank is count_gt + 1.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, all participants with s_p >s are placed before Vasya, and those with s_p ==s are placed after him. So, the worst rank is (count_gt + 1) + (count_eq) = (count_gt + count_eq) +1.\n\nWait, but count_eq is the number of participants with s_p ==s.\n\nWait, no. Because in the worst case, the participants with s_p ==s can be placed after him, so the number of participants before him is count_gt, and the participants with s_p ==s are after.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is count_gt + 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, let's take the first sample:\n\nAll participants have sum 2.\n\ncount_gt = 0.\n\ncount_eq =5.\n\nIn the worst case, the jury can arrange them such that Vasya is last. So his rank is 5.\n\nBut according to count_gt +1, it's 1.\n\nSo, my approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: the worst possible rank is the maximum between the best possible and the worst possible for each participant.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the minimal possible when all participants with sum >=s are placed before him.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, for each s, the worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can be placed before him.\n\nWhich depends on how many participants have sum >=s.\n\nBecause for participants with sum >s, they must be placed before him. For participants with sum ==s, the jury can choose to place them before or after him.\n\nSo, in the worst case, all participants with sum >=s are placed before him, except for those with sum ==s that are placed after.\n\nWait, no. To get the worst possible rank, we want as many participants as possible before him. So, for sum >s, they are definitely before. For sum ==s, if we can arrange them after, then the number of participants before him is count_gt. Thus, his rank is count_gt +1.\n\nBut in the first sample, count_gt is 0, so his rank is 1. But in reality, the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum ==s that are placed before him.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nWait, in the first sample, all 5 participants have sum 2.\n\nIn the worst case, the jury can arrange them in such a way that Vasya is last. So his rank is 5.\n\nIn this case, count_gt=0, count_eq=5.\n\nSo, the worst rank is count_eq.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum possible number of participants that can come before him, which is the number of participants with sum >=s, but minus the number of participants with sum >s, because those with sum >s are before him, and the ones with sum ==s can be placed after or before.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: for each s, the best possible rank is 1 + count_gt.\n\nThe worst possible rank is the maximum between (count_gt +1) and (count_le).\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum ==s, and then plus 1.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the count_gt + count_eq +1.\n\nBut that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum of the number of participants that can be placed before him, which is count_gt + min(count_eq, ... )\n\nI'm stuck. Let me look for another way.\n\nAlternative idea: for the worst possible rank, the number of participants before Vasya is the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum ==s who are placed before him.\n\nSince the jury can choose, in the worst case, the maximum number of participants before him is count_gt + count_eq.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is count_gt + count_eq + 1.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, count_gt is 0, count_eq is5. So 0+5+1=6, which is not matching the sample.\n\nSample expects worst rank 5.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum possible number of participants that can be placed before him, which is count_gt + count_eq.\n\nBut then, in the first sample, 0+5=5, plus 1 gives 6. Which is not correct.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the participants with sum 2 can be arranged before or after him. So in the worst case, all 5 are before him, making his rank 6. But the sample expects 5.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nWait, the sample says that in the worst case, Vasya can be ranked fifth.\n\nBut according to the logic, all 5 participants can be placed before him, giving him rank 6.\n\nBut the sample says the worst rank is 5.\n\nSo perhaps the problem statement counts the participants with sum ==s as being able to be placed after him, thus not contributing to the count before him.\n\nWait, perhaps in the worst case, the number of participants before him is count_gt + 0.\n\nBecause the participants with sum ==s can be placed after him.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is count_gt +1.\n\nIn the first sample, count_gt is 0, so worst rank is 1.\n\nBut the sample expects 5.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nThe total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\nSo, the participants are sorted in non-increasing order of their sum. Participants with the same sum can be ordered in any way.\n\nThus, for the worst possible rank, Vasya can be placed as far down as possible. So, all participants with sum >s are placed before him. Participants with sum ==s can be placed either before or after him.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of participants before him, we need to arrange as many as possible before him.\n\nWhich implies that participants with sum ==s can be placed before him. So, the number of participants before him is count_gt + count_eq.\n\nThus, his rank is count_gt + count_eq +1.\n\nBut in the first sample, this gives 0+5+1=6, which is not the sample output.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the participants with sum ==s are considered as a group. So, for the worst case, all participants with sum >s are placed before him, and all participants with sum ==s are placed after him. So, the number of participants before him is count_gt, and the number after is count_eq.\n\nThus, his rank is count_gt +1.\n\nIn the first sample, count_gt=0, so rank is 1.\n\nBut the sample expects 5.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the participants with sum ==s can be placed before him, but only if it's beneficial for the worst case.\n\nWait, no. Because in the worst case, you want as many participants as possible to come before him. So participants with sum ==s can be placed before him.\n\nThus, the number of participants before him is count_gt + count_eq.\n\nSo, rank is count_gt + count_eq +1.\n\nBut in the first sample, that would be 0+5+1=6, which is not matching.\n\nBut the sample says the worst rank is 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let's look at the sample explanation.\n\nIn the first sample, all participants earn 2 points each. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get first or last.\n\nSo, in the best case, he is first (rank 1), in the worst case, he is fifth (rank 5).\n\nSo, for the worst case, the number of participants before him is 4.\n\nWhich suggests that the number of participants before him is count_gt + (some of the count_eq).\n\nWait, but in this case, count_gt is zero. So how can 4 participants be before him?\n\nOnly if 4 participants with sum ==s are placed before him.\n\nBut there are 5 participants with sum ==s.\n\nSo, the number of participants before him is 4, leading to a rank of 5.\n\nHow?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that in the worst case, the number of participants before him is the maximum possible, which is count_gt + count_eq -1.\n\nBecause in the worst case, the jury can arrange all but one of the count_eq participants before him.\n\nWait, no. That doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum of the number of participants that can come before him, which is the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum ==s, but the jury can arrange all participants with sum ==s after him, thus minimizing the number of participants before him.\n\nWait, no. That would give the best case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum possible number of participants that can be placed before him, which is the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum ==s.\n\nBut in the first sample, that is 5, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, for the worst case, the number of participants before him is count_gt + count_eq.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, count_gt is 0, count_eq is5. So 0+5=5 participants before him, so his rank is 6.\n\nBut the sample says 5.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try to compute for each s, the best and worst possible rank, and see how it aligns with the sample.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nsums = [2,2,2,2,2]\n\nFor each s=2:\n\ncount_gt = 0.\n\ncount_le =5.\n\nSo, according to the initial approach:\n\nbest_rank =1.\n\nworst_rank=5+1=6.\n\nBut sample expects worst_rank=5.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: For the worst case, the number of participants before him is the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum <s.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum between (count_gt +1) and (count_le).\n\nWait, in the first sample, count_gt=0, count_le=5.\n\nSo, max(1,5) is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nHmm, that seems promising.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor each s, the worst possible rank is the maximum between count_gt +1 and count_le.\n\nIn the first sample, the worst possible rank is max(1,5)=5.\n\nIn the second sample, let's see.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=6, x=2.\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nsums are:\n\n4+8=12\n\n3+6=9\n\n5+0=5\n\n6+4=10\n\n4+3=7\n\n4+4=8\n\nSo sums are [12,9,5,10,7,8].\n\nSo for each s in sums >=2.\n\nNow, for each s:\n\nCompute count_gt and count_le.\n\nFor example, s=12:\n\ncount_gt: number of participants with sum >12 → 0.\n\ncount_le: 0.\n\nworst_rank = max(0+1,0)=1.\n\nWhich is the best possible.\n\nAnother example, s=5:\n\ncount_gt: number of sums >5 is 5 (12,9,10,7,8).\n\nso worst_rank = max(5+1, 1) → 6.\n\nSo, for each s, the worst possible rank is the maximum between count_gt+1 and count_le.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nWhich comes from when s=7.\n\nLet me see:\n\ns=7:\n\nsums >7 are 12,9,10,8 → count_gt=4.\n\ncount_le: number of sums <=7: 5 (sums 5,7, etc.).\n\nSo worst_rank is max(4+1=5,5) →5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor each s in sums:\n\nbest_rank = 1 + count_gt.\n\nworst_rank = max(count_gt +1, count_le).\n\nThus, the worst possible rank for Vasya is the maximum between (count_gt +1) and (count_le).\n\nSo, for each s, compute best_rank and worst_rank as:\n\nbest_rank = count_gt +1.\n\nworst_rank = max(count_gt +1, count_le).\n\nThen, for all s, find the minimal best_rank and the maximal worst_rank.\n\nWait, let's test this with the first sample.\n\nsums = [2,2,2,2,2].\n\nFor s=2:\n\ncount_gt =0.\n\ncount_le=5.\n\nbest_rank=1.\n\nworst_rank= max(1,5) =5.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample, when s=7, worst_rank is5.\n\nWhich is the sample's expected output.\n\nSo, this seems to work.\n\nSo, the revised approach is:\n\nFor each s in sums:\n\ncount_gt = number of participants with sum >s.\n\ncount_le = number of participants with sum <=s.\n\nbest_rank = count_gt +1.\n\nworst_rank = max(count_gt +1, count_le).\n\nThen, the overall best possible rank is the minimal best_rank across all s.\n\nThe overall worst possible rank is the maximal worst_rank across all s.\n\nSo, this seems to align with the samples.\n\nSo, the steps now are:\n\n1. Compute all sums s = a_i + b_i.\n\n2. For each s:\n\n   a. count_gt = number of participants with sum >s.\n\n   b. count_le = number of participants with sum <=s.\n\n   c. best_rank = count_gt +1.\n\n   d. worst_rank = max(count_gt +1, count_le).\n\n3. Find the minimal best_rank across all s.\n\n4. Find the maximal worst_rank across all s.\n\n5. Output these two numbers.\n\nSo, let's implement this.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nsums = [2,2,2,2,2].\n\nFor each s=2:\n\ncount_gt=0 → best_rank=1.\n\ncount_le=5 → worst_rank = max(1,5)=5.\n\nSo, minimal best_rank is 1, maximal worst_rank is5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nsums = [5,5,5].\n\nFor s=5:\n\ncount_gt=0 → best_rank=1.\n\ncount_le=3 → worst_rank = max(1,3)=3.\n\nSo, minimal best_rank is1, maximal worst_rank is3.\n\nSo, in this case, the worst possible rank is3.\n\nWhich makes sense because in the worst case, all three participants are placed before him.\n\nBut wait, in this case",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points. The problem involves analyzing the points from two tours and determining the possible ranks considering the constraints provided.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Each participant's total score is the sum of their scores from two tours. The goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya given that his total score is at least `x`.\n\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the total score for each participant by summing their scores from both tours.\n\n3. **Determine Ranks**:\n   - **Best Rank**: For each possible total score `s` (where `s >= x`), calculate how many participants have a higher total score than `s`. The best rank is determined by placing Vasya just after these participants.\n   - **Worst Rank**: For each possible total score `s`, consider both the number of participants with higher scores and those with the same score. The worst rank is the maximum of the number of participants who can be placed before Vasya, either by having higher scores or being tied.\n\n4. **Compute Results**: For each possible total score, compute the best and worst ranks and then find the minimum best rank and maximum worst rank across all possible scores.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsums = [a[i] + b[i] for i in range(n)]\n\nmin_best = float('inf')\nmax_worst = 0\n\nfor s in sums:\n    if s < x:\n        continue  # Skip since s must be >=x\n    count_gt = 0\n    count_le = 0\n    for total in sums:\n        if total > s:\n            count_gt += 1\n        elif total <= s:\n            count_le += 1\n    best_rank = count_gt + 1\n    worst_rank = max(count_gt + 1, count_le)\n    if best_rank < min_best:\n        min_best = best_rank\n    if worst_rank > max_worst:\n        max_worst = worst_rank\n\nprint(f\"{min_best} {max_worst}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the scores from the two tours.\n- **Total Scores Calculation**: Compute the total score for each participant by summing their scores from both tours.\n- **Rank Calculation**: For each possible total score `s` (>= `x`), determine how many participants have higher scores (`count_gt`) and how many have scores less than or equal to `s` (`count_le`). Use these counts to determine the best and worst ranks.\n- **Determine Minimum Best and Maximum Worst Ranks**: Iterate through all possible scores to find the smallest best rank and the largest worst rank.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required ranks by leveraging the properties of the sums and their relative positions.",
