For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about binary strings and choosing certain values for each string such that a multiset of these strings is 'beautiful'. And we need to count the number of ways to choose these c_s values so that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nWe are given n, k, f. We consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to n. For each such string s, we choose c_s from 0 to k. Then, the multiset is beautiful if for every string s (of any length), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. \n\nWait, but the multiset itself is of strings of length exactly n. So when considering s of length less than n, their prefixes would be longer strings. Wait no—no, wait, the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So for example, if s is \"0\", then any string in the multiset that starts with \"0\" will contribute to s's count. Because for s being a prefix, the strings in the multiset must have s as a prefix. So if the multiset contains \"00\", \"01\", etc., they all start with \"0\".\n\nSo for each string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix cannot exceed c_s.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of ways to assign c_s for all s (length 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how is the maximum size determined based on the c_s choices? Because for each s, the count is limited by c_s, which in turn affects how many longer strings can be included.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by considering all possible s, and for each s, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is constrained by c_s. So the total number of strings that can be added without violating any constraints is the minimum over all s of c_s multiplied by something?\n\nNo, maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nFor a given assignment of c_s, the maximum beautiful multiset's size is the maximum number of strings of length n that can be chosen such that for every prefix s of any string t in the multiset, the count of t's that have s as a prefix does not exceed c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the problem using the concept of the trie data structure. Each node in the trie represents a prefix, and the edges represent adding a 0 or 1 bit.\n\nThe maximum number of strings of length n that can be in the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints on the counts for each node. Each edge contributes to the count of its parent nodes. So for each node (prefix s), the number of times a string passes through s (i.e., has s as a prefix) is the sum of the counts of its children.\n\nWait, no. Each time a string is added to the multiset, it contributes to the counts of all of its prefixes. For example, adding \"010\" increases the count for \"0\", \"01\", and \"010\".\n\nBut the constraint is that for each s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, for a given set of c_s, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the maximum number of strings of length n that can be chosen such that for every s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but this is similar to ensuring that for each prefix s, the number of times s appears as a prefix in the multiset is at most c_s.\n\nThis feels a lot like building a trie where each node s has a limit c_s on the number of times its subtree (including itself) can be used. The maximum number of strings is determined by the minimum capacity along some path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a problem where we can model the constraints as a directed acyclic graph and compute the maximum flow.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Each string of length n contributes to all of its prefixes. So, for each string t of length n, the count for each of its prefixes s (s is a prefix of t) is incremented by 1. So, the constraints are that for each s, the sum of all t's that include s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut the problem is to find the number of assignments of c_s such that the maximum possible multiset size is exactly f.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the assignment of c_s determines the constraints, and the maximum possible size is the largest possible number of strings of length n that can be chosen without exceeding any c_s for any",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign values to each binary string such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The solution involves understanding the constraints on the counts of each prefix and using combinatorial methods to count valid assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to count the number of valid assignments of `c_s` for each binary string such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. A beautiful multiset is defined by constraints on the number of times each prefix can appear as a prefix in the strings of the multiset.\n\n2. **Trie Representation**: Each binary string can be represented in a trie structure where each node corresponds to a prefix. The constraints on the counts of each prefix translate into capacity constraints on the nodes of the trie.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming with State Compression**: We use dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of valid states as we build the trie. Each state represents a set of constraints met so far, and we transition between states by adding new prefixes while respecting the constraints.\n\n4. **Modulo Operations**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo 998244353.\n\n5. **Combinatorial Counting**: We use combinatorial methods to count the valid assignments by considering the possible ways to distribute the counts among the prefixes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Precompute powers of 2 up to n\n    pow2 = [1] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        pow2[i] = pow2[i-1] * 2 % MOD\n    \n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial mod MOD\n    max_k = max(n, k)\n    fact = [1] * (max_k + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_k+1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_k + 1)\n    inv_fact[max_k] = pow(fact[max_k], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_k-1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    def comb(a, b):\n        if a < 0 or b < 0 or a < b:\n            return 0\n        return fact[a] * inv_fact[b] % MOD * inv_fact[a - b] % MOD\n    \n    # Generate all possible masks for the bits\n    from itertools import product\n    bits = ['0', '1']\n    all_masks = list(product(bits, repeat=n))\n    \n    dp = {}\n    dp[tuple()] = 1  # initial state: no bits set\n    \n    for mask in all_masks:\n        s = ''.join(mask)\n        m = len(s)\n        if m > n:\n            continue\n        \n        # Current state is the set of prefixes considered so far\n        current_state = tuple(sorted(list(dp.keys())))\n        for prev in dp:\n            if s in prev:\n                continue  # already processed\n            \n            new_state = list(prev)\n            new_state.append(s)\n            new_state.sort()\n            new_state_tuple = tuple(new_state)\n            \n            # Calculate the number of ways to add this state\n            # Each new_state's c_s must be at least the number of times it's added\n            # But since we're building the trie, the constraints are additive\n            # For each node along the path from root to s, the count increases\n            # So for each step, the capacities must be sufficient\n            \n            # Compute the number of paths that reach this state\n            # The contribution is based on the number of ways to assign c_s for the new state\n            # This is a bit tricky;
