You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and also counting the number of ways to do this. The cycle must have more than one vertex, and each vertex in the cycle can appear at most once. Also, we can't add any loops or parallel edges.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to do is think about what conditions allow us to form such a cycle with the least edges added.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. **Graph Structure**: The given graph has n vertices and m edges. It's undirected, no loops, no multiple edges.\n\n2. **Cycle Requirements**:\n   - The cycle must be odd-length.\n   - It's a simple cycle (no repeated vertices).\n   - The cycle must consist of more than one vertex, so the minimal cycle we're looking for is a triangle (3 nodes).\n\n3. **Adding Edges**: We can add edges, but they must not create loops or duplicates. So each new edge connects two distinct, previously disconnected vertices.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal t, the number of edges needed to be added, and w, the number of ways to add t edges to form such a cycle.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nI think the key is to look for connected components in the graph because adding edges within a component might not require as many edges as connecting different components.\n\nWait, but the cycle could span multiple components. Hmm, maybe not. Because if a cycle spans multiple components, that implies that there are existing paths between them through other components, which isn't possible if the components are disconnected. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if two components are connected via some other way, but wait, in an undirected graph, if two components are not connected, then any path between them would go through another node, which only exists if there's an edge between them. So if the graph has two disconnected components, you can't form a cycle that uses nodes from both unless you add an edge between them.\n\nSo perhaps the problem can be decomposed based on the connected components of the graph.\n\nLet me think: For each connected component, determine whether it already contains an odd-length cycle, or whether it can form one by adding edges.\n\nWait, but the cycle can be formed across multiple components if they are connected via some edges. So maybe the minimal t depends on whether the graph has certain structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of edges to add is determined by the presence of certain subgraphs.\n\nWait, let me think differently. To form a cycle of odd length, what's required?\n\nA cycle requires that every node in the cycle has degree at least 2, but that's not sufficient. Wait, no. For example, in a tree, all nodes except the leaves have degree >=2, but trees don't contain cycles.\n\nBut in our case, the graph is undirected and may have multiple connected components.\n\nAnother angle: For the graph to have a cycle, it must be at least 2-connected, but that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be broken down into considering each connected component and determining whether it can contribute to forming a cycle when combined with others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is the minimal number of edges to add such that the union of the existing edges and the added ones forms a cycle of odd length.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the sample input to get some intuition.\n\nSample Input 1:\n4 4\nEdges: 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3.\n\nLooking at this, the graph has two connected components: the first three nodes (1,2,3) form a triangle, and node 4 is connected to 2 and 3. Wait, no, 4 is connected to 2 and 3, so the entire graph is connected. Wait, 1 is connected to 2 and 3, 2 is connected to 4, and 3 is connected to 4. So all four nodes are in the same connected component.\n\nWait, but the connected component is 1,2,3,4.\n\nIn this component, is there a cycle? Yes, 1-2-4-3-1 is a cycle of length 4, which is even. But we need an odd-length cycle.\n\nIs there any existing cycle of odd length? Well, 1-2-3-1 is a triangle (length 3), which is odd. So no edges need to be added. So t is 0, and the number of ways is 1.\n\nWait, but the sample output says the first case's output is '1 2'. Wait, no, looking back, the sample input provided is actually three test cases. Oh right, the initial input is three test cases. So in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and count the number of ways to achieve this. The cycle must consist of more than one vertex and each vertex can appear at most once in the cycle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Analysis**: First, analyze the given graph to identify its connected components. Each connected component is treated separately.\n2. **Cycle Check**: For each connected component, check if it already contains an odd-length cycle. If it does, no edges need to be added.\n3. **Component Contribution**: If a component can form an odd-length cycle by adding some edges, calculate how many edges are needed and how many ways this can be done.\n4. **Inter-component Cycles**: Consider cycles that span multiple components by adding edges between them. This might provide a shorter path to forming an odd-length cycle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    t = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    cases = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input[ptr])\n        m = int(input[ptr+1])\n        ptr +=2\n        edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n        for __ in range(m):\n            a = int(input[ptr])\n            b = int(input[ptr+1])\n            ptr +=2\n            edges[a].append(b)\n            edges[b].append(a)\n        \n        visited = [False]*(n+1)\n        components = []\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                q = deque([i])\n                visited[i] = True\n                comp = []\n                while q:\n                    u = q.popleft()\n                    comp.append(u)\n                    for v in edges[u]:\n                        if not visited[v]:\n                            visited[v] = True\n                            q.append(v)\n                components.append(comp)\n        \n        odd_cycles = []\n        min_edges = float('inf')\n        ways = 0\n        \n        for comp in components:\n            if len(comp) < 2:\n                continue\n            \n            has_cycle = False\n            for node in comp:\n                degree = len(edges[node])\n                if degree >= 2:\n                    pass\n                else:\n                    continue\n                visited_nodes = set()\n                stack = [(node, 0)]\n                while stack:\n                    u, depth = stack.pop()\n                    if depth == 0:\n                        if u in visited_nodes:\n                            continue\n                        visited_nodes.add(u)\n                        if depth % 2 == 1:\n                            cycle_length = 0\n                            current = u\n                            while current != u and current in visited_nodes:\n                                cycle_length += 1\n                                current = edges[current][0] if edges[current] and edges[current][0] in visited_nodes else None\n                                if current is None:\n                                    break\n                            if cycle_length > 0 and (cycle_length + depth) % 2 == 1:\n                                has_cycle = True\n                                break\n                    else:\n                        current = u\n                        if current in visited_nodes:\n                            continue\n                        visited_nodes.add(current)\n                        for v in edges[current]:\n                            if v not in visited_nodes:\n                                stack.append( (v, depth + 1) )\n                if has_cycle:\n                    break\n            if has_cycle:\n                odd_cycles.append(comp)\n        \n        if len(odd_cycles) == 0:\n            found = False\n            min_t = float('inf')\n            total_ways = 0\n            for i in range(len(components)):\n                comp = components[i]\n                if len(comp) < 2:\n                    continue\n                required = {}\n                nodes = list(range(len(comp)))\n                for node in comp:\n                    idx = comp.index(node)\n                    neighbors = edges[node]\n                    for neighbor in neighbors:\n                        if neighbor in comp:\n                            idx2 = comp.index(neighbor)\n                            if idx < idx2:\n                                req = max(1 -

If it does, we note it as a candidate.\n4. **Calculating Minimum Edges and Ways**: If no component has an odd-length cycle, we consider the possibility of forming such a cycle by adding edges between components. We calculate the minimum number of edges required and the number of ways to achieve this.\n5. **Output Results**: Finally, we print the results based on the calculations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum edges and ways to form an odd-length cycle, considering both existing structures and potential additions.",
