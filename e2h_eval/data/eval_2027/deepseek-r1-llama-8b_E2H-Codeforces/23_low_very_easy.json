In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, each with a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). The goal is to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu, which is either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, right. So the task is to determine for each possible initial set what's the minimal number of additional tiles needed.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, \"1s 2s 3s\" is a shuntsu already, so the output for that would be zero.\n\nI need to process each of these three cases separately, right? Because each initial hand is considered individually. Wait, no, wait—no, the problem says that the input is three strings, but each string represents a single player's hand. Oh wait, no, the input is three strings, each is a single tile. Or wait, wait: the problem says, \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" So each string is a tile, meaning she has three tiles. So for each of the three initial hands, we need to compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\nThen, the input is three strings, each being a tile. So she has three tiles in total. For each of these three scenarios, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Oh, no, no. Wait, the problem is not clear. Wait, the first paragraph says, \"she must have at least one mentsu in her hand, sometimes she draws extra tiles.\" So the question is, given her current three tiles, what is the minimum number of tiles she needs to add (could be zero) such that after adding, her entire collection (current plus added) has at least one mentsu.\n\nBut the input is three tiles, so perhaps the function is to evaluate all possible ways she could add tiles, and find the minimal count where she has a mentsu.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is three integers. Each corresponds to one of the three initial hands. So I think that the input consists of three separate hands, each of which is a single tile. Or perhaps each of the three is a hand of three tiles. Wait, the sample input shows something like ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'], which suggests each element is a list of three tiles. Oh wait, no, the way it's written, each element is a single string, perhaps representing a single tile. Or maybe each element is a list of three tiles.\n\nWait, the problem statement says, \"the only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" So each string represents a single tile. So she has three tiles in total. So the problem is: given three tiles, what is the minimal number of additional tiles she needs to draw so that in the combined set, there exists a mentsu.\n\nBut wait, the sample input has three outputs. So for each of the three possible initial hands, compute the minimal number? Or is each of the three lines an initial hand, and for each, compute the minimal number?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nSo for each of the three initial hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu. So each of the three lines is a separate test case.\n\nAh, okay. So the function needs to take three separate test cases, each consisting of a single hand, and for each, compute the minimal number.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: \"the only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" So perhaps each of the three strings represents a tile, and the three together form her hand. So she has three tiles. And the question is, what is the minimal number of tiles to add so that in the combined set, there's at least one mentsu.\n\nBut the sample output is three numbers, which suggests that each of the three initial hands is being considered as separate cases. Or perhaps the problem is miswritten, and the input is three separate hands, each of which is a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand plus the drawn tiles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: A mentsu is either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). Tokitsukaze starts with three tiles and can draw any number of additional tiles, including duplicates of her current tiles.\n\n2. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current hand already forms a mentsu. If it does, no additional tiles are needed.\n\n3. **Evaluate Possible Draws**: For each possible way to form a mentsu, calculate how many additional tiles are needed. The goal is to find the minimal number of such draws.\n\n4. **Check All Combinations**: Consider all possible triplets and sequences that can be formed using the current tiles and additional draws, ensuring we find the minimal number of draws required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_min_draws(tiles):\n    suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n    counts = {}\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = t[0]\n        suit = t[1]\n        counts[suit] = counts.get(suit, 0) + 1\n    current_suits = {suit for suit, _ in counts.items()}\n\n    # Check for existing triplet or sequence\n    for suit in current_suits:\n        numbers = []\n        for tile in tiles:\n            if tile[1] == suit:\n                numbers.append(int(tile[0]))\n        numbers.sort()\n        if len(numbers) >= 3:\n            if numbers[0] == numbers[1] == numbers[2]:\n                return 0\n            elif numbers[1] - numbers[0] == 1 and numbers[2] - numbers[1] == 1:\n                return 0\n\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n\n    # Check all possible triplets\n    for suit in suits:\n        if suit not in counts:\n            continue\n        max_num = list(range(1, 10))\n        for n in range(1, 10):\n            if n in counts[suit]:\n                remaining_needed = 2\n                for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n                    if i in counts[suit]:\n                        remaining_needed -= 1\n                        if remaining_needed <= 0:\n                            break\n                if remaining_needed <= 0:\n                    total = 0\n                    for num in range(n-2, n+1):\n                        if num not in counts[suit]:\n                            total += 1\n                    if total < min_draws:\n                        min_draws = total\n        for n in range(9, 0, -1):\n            if n in counts[suit]:\n                remaining_needed = 2\n                for i in range(n+1, n+3):\n                    if i > 9:\n                        break\n                    if i in counts[suit]:\n                        remaining_needed -= 1\n                        if remaining_needed <= 0:\n                            break\n                if remaining_needed <= 0:\n                    total = 0\n                    for num in range(n+1, n+3):\n                        if num not in counts[suit]:\n                            total += 1\n                    if total < min_draws:\n                        min_draws = total\n\n    # Check all possible sequences across different suits\n    for suit1 in suits:\n        for suit2 in suits:\n            if suit1 == suit2:\n                continue\n            current_nums = []\n            for tile in tiles:\n                if tile[1] == suit1:\n                    current_nums.append(int(tile[0]))\n                elif tile[1] == suit2:\n                    current_nums.append(int(tile[0]))\n            current_nums.sort()\n            for start in range(1, 8):\n                end = start + 2\n                if end > 9:\n                    continue\n                needed = 0\n                found = 0\n                for num in [start, start+1, start+2]:\n                    if num in current_nums:\n                        found += 1\n                    else:\n                        needed += 1\n                if found == 3:\n                    return 0\n\n    return min_draws if min_draws != float('inf') else 4\n\ntiles = input().split()\noutput = []\nfor t in tiles:\n    output.append(compute_min_draws(t))\nprint(' '.join(map(str, output)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution first checks if the current hand already forms a mentsu. If not, it evaluates all possible ways to form a mentsu by considering both triplets and sequences. It calculates the minimal number of additional tiles needed for each possible case and returns the smallest value. This approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal solution.",
