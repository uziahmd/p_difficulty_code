    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph, and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs with that minimum number of nodes.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully again.\n\nSo, a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, and u and v are reachable from each other. Unidirectional pairs are those where (u, v) is present but not (v, u), and there's no path from v to u.\n\nWait, the definition says that for an ordered pair (u, v) to be unidirectional, u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So, it's about reachability in both directions.\n\nThe task is two-fold:\n1. Find the minimal number of nodes n such that there exists a p-reachable graph.\n2. Among all such graphs with this minimal n, find the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, what does a p-reachable graph look like? It requires exactly p such ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and they can reach each other. So, these are edges that form bidirectional connections between u and v, or perhaps more complex structures where multiple paths exist but no cycles.\n\nWait, no. Because for (u, v) to be in p, u and v must be reachable from each other. So, it's possible that u can reach v through some path, and v can reach u through another path, even if there's no direct edge in either direction.\n\nBut wait, in the example given:\n\nFor p=3, the output is 3 nodes. The graph has 3 such pairs. How?\n\nWait, the sample input when p=3, the graph is 3 nodes. Let me see: the graph must have exactly 3 such (u, v) pairs.\n\nIn the sample explanation, one possible graph is where all 3 nodes are connected in a cycle, but that would have more than 3 pairs. Or perhaps it's a chain where each adjacent pair forms a bidirectional edge.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem in terms of strongly connected components (SCCs). Because in an SCC, every node can reach every other node.\n\nSo, in a DAG of SCCs, each edge represents a connection between components. For two nodes u and v in different components, if there's a path from u's component to v's component, but not vice versa, then (u, v) is a unidirectional pair only if u can reach v but not the other way around.\n\nWait, but the problem's definition of unidirectional pairs is based on whether u can reach v and v cannot reach u. So, in the context of SCCs, any two nodes in the same SCC can reach each other, so (u, v) is not unidirectional if u and v are in the same SCC.\n\nTherefore, unidirectional pairs come from different SCCs where there's a directed edge from one to another, but not vice versa.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we should have as many such edges between different SCCs as possible.\n\nNow, let's think about the minimal number of nodes.\n\nEach p-reachable graph contributes exactly p such (u, v) pairs where u < v and are reachable. So, the total number of such pairs is p.\n\nI need to construct a graph with the minimal number of nodes that allows exactly p such pairs.\n\nWhat's the structure that gives exactly p such pairs with minimal nodes?\n\nI remember that in a tournament graph, every pair of nodes has exactly one directed edge, so the number of such pairs is n choose 2. But that's for a complete asymmetric graph, which is not our case here.\n\nWait, no. Because in a tournament graph, for any u and v, either u→v or v→u. So, the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and reachable is equal to the number of edges in the underlying undirected graph minus the number of symmetric edges. Wait, no, because in a tournament, for any u < v, exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) exists. So, the number of such (u, v) pairs is (n choose 2) - s, where s is the number of symmetric edges (which is zero in a tournament). So, in a tournament, the number of such pairs is (n choose 2).\n\nBut in our problem, the number is fixed as p. So, if the minimal n is such that (n choose 2) = p, then that's the minimal n.\n\nWait, but that's only if the graph is a tournament. But in our case, the graph needs to have exactly p such pairs, and the rest can be non-pairs. So, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n where n choose 2 >= p, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for example, when p=3, n=3: 3 choose 2 is 3, which matches. When p=4, 5 choose 2 is 10, but wait in the sample input p=4, the minimal n is 5. Wait, that's 5 nodes giving 10 such pairs, but in the sample, the output for p=4 is 5 nodes, but why is 5 the minimal n?\n\nWait, no, the sample input shows for p=4, the output is 5 nodes. Wait, 5 choose 2 is 10, which is larger than 4. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is such that it's the smallest n where the sum of the first k integers is at least p, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the ceiling of (sqrt(8p +1) -1)/2, which is the inverse of the triangular number function.\n\nWait, for p=3, sqrt(25)=5, (5-1)/2=2, but n was 3. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal number such that the sum 1+2+...+n-1 >= p. Because for each node, the number of pairs it can contribute is its out-degree.\n\nWait, no, that might not directly apply.\n\nAnother approach: Think about the p as being the number of edges in a DAG where each edge is part of a path that's acyclic.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal number of nodes needed to form a DAG with exactly p edges, but that's not necessarily the case because the problem is about the number of reachable pairs, not edges.\n\nWait, perhaps each pair (u, v) where u can reach v adds to the count. So, the graph must have exactly p such pairs.\n\nTo minimize n, perhaps arrange the graph such that as many as possible of these pairs are formed with as few nodes as possible.\n\nWait, for example, in a linear chain where each node points to the next, the number of such pairs is (n*(n-1))/2, which is similar to a tournament. But that's only if it's a complete DAG.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that n*(n-1)/2 >= p.\n\nBecause for a complete DAG, the number of such pairs is n*(n-1)/2. So, if p is less than or equal to this, then n is minimal.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, p=3: 3*2/2=3, so n=3 is correct.\n\np=4: 3*2/2=3 <4, so n must be 4, since 4*3/2=6 >=4. But the sample shows n=5. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\"\n\nSo, in the case of a complete DAG (a tournament), each pair (u, v) has exactly one direction, so the number of such pairs is n*(n-1)/2.\n\nBut if the graph isn't a tournament, then the number could be less.\n\nWait, for example, if the graph is a chain: 1→2→3→...→n. Then, for each i < j, there's a path from i to j. So the number of such pairs is n*(n-1)/2.\n\nWait, but that's the same as a complete DAG. So that can't be. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because in a chain, each node has edges only to the next node. So, for node 1, it can reach nodes 2,3,...,n. So for node 1, there are (n-1) such pairs. Similarly, node 2 can reach n-1 nodes (3,4,...,n). So the total is 1*(n-1) + 2*(n-2) + ... + (n-1)*0. Which is (n-1)*n/2.\n\nYes, that's the same as the complete DAG.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that n*(n-1)/2 >= p.\n\nWait, but the sample input for p=4 is 5 as the output. Let's compute 5*4/2=10, which is way bigger than 4. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the minimal n is the smallest n where the sum 1+2+...+(n-1) >= p.\n\nWait, the sum 1+2+...+(n-1) is (n-1)*n/2, which is the same as the complete DAG scenario. So again, for p=3, n=3. For p=4, n=4, since 1+2+3=6 >=4. But sample shows n=5 for p=4. So this doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's 'reachable' condition.\n\nWait, the problem states that (u, v) is counted if u < v and u can reach v. So, it's possible that u can reach v via multiple paths, but the count is per unordered pair {u, v}.\n\nWait, no, because u < v, so each unordered pair is considered once, but only if u can reach v.\n\nWait, no, because (u, v) is an ordered pair, but the condition is that u can reach v. So for each ordered pair (u, v) where u can reach v, and u < v, it's counted.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, \"the number of ordered pairs of nodes (u, v)\" such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So for a pair u and v, if u can reach v, then (u, v) is counted if u < v. If v can reach u, then (v, u) is also counted if v < u. Wait, but u < v and v < u can't happen unless u=v, which is excluded.\n\nWait, no, because u and v are distinct. So for u < v, if u can reach v, then (u, v) is counted. If v can reach u, then since v > u, (v, u) is not considered because v > u. So for each unordered pair {u, v}, if u can reach v and v can reach u, then both (u, v) and (v, u) would be considered, but since u < v, only (u, v) is counted, and if v < u, then (v, u) would be counted, but that's impossible because u < v implies v > u. So wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says u < v, so (u, v) is considered, and if v can reach u, then (v, u) is considered only if v < u, which is not possible because u < v. So, for each unordered pair {u, v}, if u can reach v and v can reach u, then exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) is counted, depending on which is smaller.\n\nWait, no. Because for u < v, if u can reach v and v can reach u, then (u, v) is counted, because u < v. But (v, u) is not, since v > u.\n\nWait, but in that case, the count is just the number of such ordered pairs where u can reach v and u < v.\n\nSo, the total p is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u can reach v, regardless of whether v can reach u.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, for example, in a graph where u can reach v and v cannot reach u, then (u, v) is counted, but (v, u) is not because v can't reach u, so it's not counted.\n\nBut if u and v can reach each other, then (u, v) is counted because u < v, but (v, u) is not counted because v > u.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a graph where the number of such ordered pairs is exactly p, and find the minimal n.\n\nHmm, okay. So, how to model this.\n\nLet me think about the minimal n.\n\nEach such (u, v) pair is an edge from u to v, but in the graph, u can reach v, and v can't reach u.\n\nWait, no. Because u can reach v through other nodes, not necessarily directly.\n\nSo, for a pair (u, v), u can reach v, but v cannot reach u. That's what makes (u, v) an unidirectional pair.\n\nWait, but the problem counts all such (u, v) where u < v and u can reach v, regardless of whether v can reach u or not.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that (u, v) is counted if u can reach v, and u < v. So, it's possible that v can also reach u, but that doesn't affect the count of (u, v).\n\nWait, no. Because the condition is just that u can reach v, regardless of whether v can reach u.\n\nSo, for each ordered pair (u, v) where u < v, if u can reach v, then it's counted towards p.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a graph where the number of such pairs is exactly p, and the graph is minimal in the number of nodes.\n\nTo minimize n, perhaps the graph should be a DAG, because in a DAG, for any two nodes u and v, if u < v and u can reach v, then v cannot reach u, because it's a DAG.\n\nWait, because in a DAG, there's no cycles, so if u can reach v, v cannot reach u.\n\nSo, in a DAG, each (u, v) pair where u < v and u can reach v contributes exactly one to p.\n\nThus, in a DAG, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of edges in the transitive closure.\n\nWait, but the transitive closure of a DAG is a DAG as well.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a DAG with exactly p edges in its transitive closure.\n\nWait, no. Because the transitive closure includes all pairs (u, v) where u can reach v via any path. So the number of such pairs is the size of the transitive closure.\n\nBut the problem requires that exactly p such pairs exist.\n\nWait, but the transitive closure is a superset of the edges. So, the number of such pairs can be more than the number of edges in the original graph.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal n is achieved by a DAG where the transitive closure has exactly p such pairs.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n for a given p.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is determined by the structure of the DAG.\n\nIn a DAG, the maximum number of such pairs is achieved by a complete DAG, where all possible (u, v) pairs are included if u can reach v.\n\nSo, the maximum number of such pairs in a DAG with n nodes is (n choose 2).\n\nBut if we want exactly p such pairs, perhaps we can arrange the DAG to have exactly p pairs.\n\nBut to minimize n, perhaps the minimal n is such that (n choose 2) is the smallest number greater than or equal to p.\n\nBut let's test this against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: p=3.\n\n(n choose 2) for n=3 is 3, which equals p. So minimal n is 3.\n\nSample Input 2: p=4.\n\nThe minimal n where (n choose 2) >=4 is n=3, since 3 choose 2 is 3 <4, so n=4, 4 choose 2 is 6>4. So minimal n is 4.\n\nBut the sample output for p=4 is 5 nodes. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, the sample output for p=4 is 5 nodes, but according to this logic, n=4 would suffice, since 4 choose 2 is 6>4. So why is the sample output 5 nodes?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait, the problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\" So, it's not just that u can reach v, but that they are reachable from each other.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, for (u, v) to be counted, u must be able to reach v, and v must be able to reach u. So, the pair is bidirectional.\n\nAh! Oh, that's a crucial point. So, the pair (u, v) is counted only if u can reach v and v can reach u. So, it's a mutual reachability condition.\n\nThat's a big difference from what I thought earlier.\n\nSo, the p is the number of such mutual reachable pairs.\n\nSo, for each unordered pair {u, v}, if u can reach v and v can reach u, then (u, v) is counted once if u < v.\n\nSo, in the sample input where p=3, the graph must have exactly 3 such pairs. The minimal n is 3.\n\nSo, for example, if the graph is a triangle, each node can reach the others, so each pair (u, v) is counted once, leading to 3 pairs, which matches p=3.\n\nBut if the graph is a linear chain, like 1→2→3, then 1 can't reach 3 via a shorter path, but wait, in this case, 1 can reach 3, and 3 can't reach 1. So the pair (1,3) is not counted because 3 can't reach 1. So, in this case, the mutual reachability is only between 1 and 2, and 2 and 3. So, the number of such pairs is 2, which is less than 3.\n\nSo, to get p=3, the graph must have three such pairs, which can be achieved with 3 nodes arranged in a cycle.\n\nSo, now, the problem becomes: find a directed graph where exactly p such pairs exist, and find the minimal n.\n\nAdditionally, among all such graphs with minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo, the first part is to find the minimal n such that a graph exists with exactly p mutual reachable pairs.\n\nSo, for each pair {u, v}, if u can reach v and v can reach u, then it's a mutual pair, contributing 1 to p.\n\nThus, p is the number of such mutual pairs.\n\nSo, how to model this.\n\nEach mutual pair is a strongly connected component (SCC) of size at least 2.\n\nBecause, in an SCC, every node can reach every other node.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a graph where the number of edges between the SCCs is such that the number of mutual pairs is exactly p.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal n is the sum of the sizes of the SCCs.\n\nWait, but in the minimal case, perhaps the graph consists of a single SCC. Because that way, all possible pairs within the SCC are mutual, so the number of such pairs is (n choose 2). So, if n choose 2 equals p, then n is minimal.\n\nSo, for example, p=3: 3 choose 2 is 3, so n=3.\n\np=4: 4 choose 2 is 6>4. So, perhaps a single SCC of 4 nodes would have 6 mutual pairs, which is more than p=4. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the graph must have multiple SCCs, such that the sum of the combinations of their sizes is exactly p.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because in a graph with multiple SCCs, the mutual pairs are those within each SCC.\n\nSo, the total number of mutual pairs is the sum over each SCC of (size choose 2).\n\nSo, for example, if the graph has two SCCs, one of size a and another of size b, then the total mutual pairs are (a choose 2)+(b choose 2).\n\nSo, to get exactly p mutual pairs, we need to find a partition of p into sums of (a choose 2) for various a.\n\nBut wait, p can be expressed as the sum of (k choose 2) for some k's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal sum of k's where the sum of (k choose 2) equals p.\n\nWait, for example, for p=3: 3 choose 2 is 3, so sum is 3, n is 3.\n\nFor p=4: 3 choose 2 is 3, so sum is 3, which is less than 4. So, perhaps we can have a single SCC of size 3 (contributing 3), and another SCC of size 1 (contributing 0), but that's not allowed because the pair (3,1) would have 3 can't reach 1 (since 3 is in a separate SCC), so it's not a mutual pair. So, adding another node doesn't contribute to p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal number such that (n choose 2) >= p, and then see if p can be achieved by breaking the graph into multiple SCCs.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think differently.\n\nWe can model the problem as follows: the number of mutual pairs is the sum over all SCCs S of (|S| choose 2).\n\nSo, the problem is to find a collection of integers (k_1, k_2, ..., k_m) such that sum_{i=1 to m} (k_i choose 2) = p.\n\nAnd the sum of k_i is minimized.\n\nBecause each k_i is the size of an SCC, and the sum is the total number of nodes.\n\nSo, the minimal sum of k_i is the minimal n.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal n such that p can be written as the sum of (k choose 2) for some integers k >=1.\n\nBut wait, each k_i must be at least 1, because each SCC must have at least one node.\n\nSo, how to find the minimal n for a given p.\n\nWe can think of this as a change-making problem, where the coins are (k choose 2) for various k, and we want to make sum p with the fewest coins, and then the minimal n is the sum of the k's used.\n\nWait, for example:\n\np=3: 3=3 choose 2. So, one coin of 3, sum k=3.\n\np=4: 3 choose 2 is 3, 4-3=1. But 1 can't be made by any (k choose 2) since for k=1, (1 choose 2)=0. So, perhaps 3 choose 2 plus 2 choose 2 (which is 1). So, 3+1=4. Sum of k's is 3+2=5. So, n=5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: p=6.\n\nOptions: 3 choose 2 is 3, 3 choose 2 is 3. Sum is 6. So, two coins of 3, sum k=3+3=6. Alternatively, 4 choose 2 is 6, so one coin of 4. Sum k=4. Which is better? 4 is better than 6, so minimal n is 4.\n\nSo, the minimal n depends on how to represent p as a sum of (k choose 2) terms with the minimal sum of k's.\n\nSo, the problem now is to find the minimal sum of k_i such that sum (k_i choose 2) = p.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, the first part is to find the minimal n, which is the minimal sum of k_i's, given that sum (k_i choose 2) = p.\n\nOnce n is determined, the second part is to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph.\n\nUnidirectional pairs are pairs (u, v) where u can reach v but v cannot reach u, and u != v.\n\nSo, in the graph, the unidirectional pairs are the edges that go from one SCC to another, but not the other way around.\n\nBecause, for any two nodes in different SCCs, if there's a path from u's component to v's component, but not vice versa, then (u, v) is unidirectional.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we should arrange the graph such that as many as possible such directed edges exist between the different SCCs.\n\nSo, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is the number of edges between the different SCCs, which is maximized by making the DAG between SCCs a tournament.\n\nWait, in a tournament, every pair of components has exactly one directed edge between them. So, for m components, the number of such edges is m choose 2. So, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is m choose 2.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the graph is built by having the components arranged in a DAG. Each component can have edges pointing to other components, but not the reverse.\n\nSo, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is the number of edges in the transitive closure of the DAG, which is the number of edges between different components.\n\nSo, to maximize this, we can arrange the components in a linear order and have a directed edge from each component to all components that come after it.\n\nThis way, the number of unidirectional pairs is maximized as m choose 2.\n\nSo, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (m choose 2), where m is the number of components.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. For the given p, find the minimal number of nodes n such that p can be expressed as the sum of (k_i choose 2) for some integers k_i >=1. The minimal n is the sum of the k_i's.\n\n2. Once n is found, determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs, which is (m choose 2), where m is the number of components (SCCs) in the optimal graph.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to two parts: finding the minimal n and then finding m, the number of components in the optimal graph arrangement.\n\nSo, the main challenge is to compute the minimal n for a given p.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the minimal n for a given p.\n\nApproach:\n\nWe can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where for each possible sum up to p, we track the minimal sum of k_i's.\n\nWe can represent dp[i] as the minimal sum of k_i's needed to reach a total of i mutual pairs.\n\nOur goal is to compute dp[p], which will give us the minimal n.\n\nBut considering that p can be up to 2e5, a standard DP approach with O(p^2) time complexity is not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Find the largest possible (k choose 2) that is less than or equal to p, subtract it, and repeat.\n\nBut sometimes, combining multiple smaller (k choose 2) may yield a smaller sum of k_i's.\n\nFor example, for p=4:\n\nUsing (3 choose 2) =3, then the remaining 1 can't be achieved with any (k choose 2) except (2 choose 2)=1. So, 3+1=4, sum k=3+2=5.\n\nAlternatively, using (2 choose 2) *2=2, sum is 2+2=4, sum k=2+2=4, which is better.\n\nSo, in this case, using two 2's gives a lower sum.\n\nHence, the greedy approach of taking the largest possible (k choose 2) each time may not lead to the minimal sum.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a set of (k_i choose 2) terms whose sum is p, and the sum of k_i's is minimized.\n\nHow can we find this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible (k choose 2) values.\n\n(k choose 2) = k*(k-1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=1, it's 0.\n\nk=2: 1\n\nk=3:3\n\nk=4:6\n\nk=5:10\n\netc.\n\nWe can see that the possible (k choose 2) values are 0,1,3,6,10,15,...\n\nNow, for p=4:\n\nPossible options:\n\nOption 1: 3 +1 → k's are 3 and 2 → sum 5.\n\nOption 2: 1+1+1+1 → sum 4 (each k=2, since (2 choose 2)=1). Sum of k's is 2*4=8.\n\nOption 3: 3 + (something else?)\n\nWait, 3+1 is sum 4, but 3+1 is p=4. So option 1 is sum 3+2=5.\n\nAnother option: 6 is too big, so no.\n\nSo, option 1 is better.\n\nBut wait, what about using 2 choose 2 twice: 2+2=4, sum of k's is 4.\n\nWhich is better than 5.\n\nSo, for p=4, the minimal sum is 4.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to try to break p into as many small (k choose 2) as possible, but that's not always the case.\n\nWait, no. Because (2 choose 2) is 1, which is small, but using four of them gives a sum of 4, which is worse than option 1.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the combination of (k choose 2) terms that sum to p and have the minimal sum of k's.\n\nIt's a variation of the coin change problem, where the coins are (k choose 2) for k>=2, and we want to make change for p, with the minimal sum of k's.\n\nWait, but the coin denominations are 1,3,6,10, etc., and each coin of denomination d corresponds to a k where d = k*(k-1)/2.\n\nSo, for each d, find the minimal k such that d = k*(k-1)/2.\n\nThen, for each d, the k is known.\n\nSo, the problem is to select a subset of these d's, possibly repeating, such that their sum is p, and the sum of their corresponding k's is minimized.\n\nSo, for example, for p=4:\n\nWe can use d=3 (k=3) and d=1 (k=2), sum of k's is 5.\n\nOr, we can use four d=1's (k=2 each), sum of k's is 8.\n\nBut the best option is to use two d=1's (each k=2), sum of k's is 4.\n\nWait, because 2 choose 2 is 1, so two of them sum to 2, which is 2, which is less than 4.\n\nWait, no, wait: 2 choose 2 is 1, so two of them sum to 2, which is less than p=4. No, that's not right.\n\nWait, no, 2 choose 2 is 1, so four of them would sum to 4. Sum of k's is 2*4=8.\n\nBut that's worse than option 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved by using the largest possible d's.\n\nBut in some cases, using smaller d's may allow a better sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved by using as few as possible terms, each as large as possible, but perhaps sometimes combining smaller terms can result in a better sum.\n\nSo, this suggests that the problem is similar to the classical coin change problem, but with the twist that each coin has a weight (k) and a value (d), and we need to find a combination that sums to p with the minimal total weight.\n\nIn the coin change problem, the minimal number of coins is often achieved by using as many large coins as possible. But here, the weight (k) of each coin is also important.\n\nFor example, using a single coin of d=3 (k=3) gives a weight of 3, while using three coins of d=1 (each k=2) gives a weight of 6, which is worse. So, for p=3, it's better to use a single coin of d=3.\n\nBut for p=4, using two coins of d=1 (each k=2) gives a sum of 4, which is better than using one d=3 (k=3) and one d=1 (k=2), which gives a sum of 5.\n\nSo, in this case, using smaller d's with smaller k's is better.\n\nHmm, this complicates the approach.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem, but with optimizations to handle up to p=2e5.\n\nLet me consider the possible (k, d) pairs:\n\nd = k*(k-1)/2.\n\nSo, for each possible k, d is known.\n\nWe can precompute all possible (k, d) pairs, and then model the problem as a coin change where each coin is of value d and weight k.\n\nWe need to find the minimal sum of weights for a sum of values equal to p.\n\nThis is similar to the unbounded knapsack problem, where items can be used multiple times.\n\nBut for p up to 2e5, and with potentially many (k, d) pairs, the DP approach may be feasible.\n\nSo, the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Precompute all possible (k, d) pairs, where d = k*(k-1)/2, for k >=2.\n\n   For example:\n\n   k=2: d=1.\n\n   k=3: d=3.\n\n   k=4: d=6.\n\n   k=5: d=10.\n\n   etc.\n\n   We can stop when d exceeds p, as higher k's won't contribute.\n\n2. Initialize a DP array where dp[i] is the minimal sum of k's needed to achieve a sum of d's equal to i.\n\n   Initialize dp[0] =0.\n\n   For other i, dp[i] = infinity initially.\n\n3. For each (k, d) pair, iterate through the DP array and update the dp[i + d] as min(dp[i + d], dp[i] + k).\n\n   This is similar to the unbounded knapsack approach.\n\n4. After processing all (k, d) pairs, dp[p] will contain the minimal sum of k's needed to reach p.\n\nIf dp[p] is not found (i.e., remains infinity), then it's impossible to create a graph with exactly p mutual pairs. But according to the problem statement, p can be 0, which is achievable with 0 nodes.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says p can be 0.\n\nWait, when p=0, the graph has no mutual pairs. That can be achieved with 0 nodes, but according to the sample input, when p=0, the output is 0 0.\n\nSo, in the DP approach, for p=0, the minimal n is 0.\n\nBut for p>0, we need to find the minimal sum.\n\nSo, the DP approach can handle p=0 correctly.\n\nBut what about when p is not achievable with any combination of (k choose 2) terms?\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, p can be up to 2e5. So, perhaps for any p >=0, it's possible to represent it as a sum of (k choose 2) terms.\n\nWait, because (k choose 2) for k=2 is 1, which is a unit. So, for any p>=0, you can represent it as a sum of 1's. So, the minimal sum is always possible.\n\nThus, the DP approach is feasible.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the DP approach.\n\nBut considering that p can be up to 2e5, and the number of (k, d) pairs is O(sqrt(2p)), which is about 632 for p=2e5, the code should be efficient enough.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nOnce the minimal n is found, the next part is to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this is achieved when the DAG between the SCCs is a tournament, meaning that for every pair of components, there's exactly one directed edge between them. So, the number of such edges is m choose 2, where m is the number of components.\n\nThus, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (m choose 2).\n\nSo, to find m, we need",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs with that minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and both nodes are reachable from each other. This means the graph must have `p` mutual reachable pairs.\n\n2. **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**: The key insight is that mutual reachable pairs form SCCs. Each SCC contributes `(k choose 2)` mutual pairs, where `k` is the size of the SCC.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a dynamic programming approach to find the minimal number of nodes required to achieve exactly `p` mutual pairs. The state `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of nodes needed to form `i` mutual pairs.\n\n4. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum number of nodes is determined, the graph should be structured as a tournament between its SCCs to maximize unidirectional pairs. The number of such pairs is given by `m choose 2`, where `m` is the number of SCCs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute all possible (k, d) pairs where d = k*(k-1)/2\n    max_k = 2 * int((2 * p) ** 0.5) + 2  # Just to cover enough k's\n    kd = []\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        d = k * (k - 1) // 2\n        if d > p:\n            break\n        kd.append((k, d))\n    \n    # Initialize DP\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (p + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n    for i in range(p + 1):\n        if dp[i] != float('inf'):\n            for (k, d) in kd:\n                if i + d <= p:\n                    if dp[i + d] > dp[i] + k:\n                        dp[i + d] = dp[i] + k\n    \n    n = dp[p]\n    \n    # Now, find the number of components m\n    # To maximize unidirectional pairs, arrange components in a linear order with edges pointing forward\n    # So, m is the number of components used in the sum\n    # So, we need to find how many (k choose 2) terms are used, and their sum is p.\n    # We can reconstruct the number of components by backtracking through the DP array\n    # But perhaps a better way is to note that the more components we have, the higher the number of unidirectional pairs.\n    # However, since we're using the minimal n, which might involve fewer components, but to maximize the unidirectional pairs, we need to maximize m.\n    # Wait, no.
