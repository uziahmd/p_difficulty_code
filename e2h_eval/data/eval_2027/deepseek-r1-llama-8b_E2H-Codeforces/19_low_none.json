The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about districts connected in a tree structure because it's given that each pair of districts has exactly one path connecting them. Each district i has 2^i fans. The president wants to remove k contestants, and after removing them, the remaining districts should form a connected subtree (since they can all reach each other). The goal is to maximize the sum of the fans of the remaining districts. We need to find which k districts to remove.\n\nHmm. So the strategy here is to choose a subtree of the original tree such that the sum of 2^i for all nodes in the subtree is as large as possible, while having exactly n - k nodes in it.\n\nWait, but wait. Because when you remove a node, you're effectively removing all its descendants from consideration. Or maybe not. Wait, no—removing a contestant from a district means that the district is no longer part of the participating districts. So the remaining districts must form a connected component, meaning they are all reachable from each other. So the remaining districts must form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree with as many nodes as possible (n - k), but since we can choose which nodes to remove, perhaps we can select a subtree that's as dense as possible in terms of the sum of 2^i.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think: each node contributes 2^i to the sum. So higher-numbered nodes contribute much more. So, to maximize the sum, we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But the tree structure might mean that some lower nodes are necessary to connect the higher ones.\n\nWait, but in a tree, any two nodes are connected via exactly one path. So if I want a connected subtree, perhaps the best approach is to find a subtree that includes certain high-value nodes and their paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to find a subtree where the sum of 2^i for the included nodes is maximized, regardless of their positions, as long as they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the problem is similar to selecting a subtree S with |S| = n -k, and S is connected, and the sum of 2^i for i in S is as large as possible.\n\nNow, how to find such a subtree.\n\nLet's think about the structure of the tree. Since each node's value is exponentially increasing with i, it's better to have higher i's included.\n\nWait, so perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that consists of the highest possible nodes. But considering that the tree is connected, maybe the subtree should be a chain where each node is connected to the next, but that might not always be the case.\n\nWait, another angle: the sum of 2^i is maximized when the subtree includes as many high i as possible. So, perhaps the subtree should include a path that starts at some high node and includes as many high nodes as possible.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal subtree is formed by choosing the node with the highest possible value, then including all its children, and so on, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as finding a subtree where the sum of 2^i is maximum, given that the subtree is connected and has exactly m = n -k nodes.\n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem, but with n up to 1e6, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the subtree:\n\nEach node in the subtree contributes 2^i to the total. So, higher i is better. But the subtree must be connected.\n\nSo the optimal subtree is a subtree that contains a set of nodes where each node is as high as possible, and they form a connected component.\n\nWait, perhaps the subtree is a chain where the root is the highest possible node, and all its children are included as well.\n\nWait, another thought: for a given subtree, the sum is 2^r + sum of all its descendants, where r is the root. So to maximize the sum, we should pick the subtree rooted at the highest possible node, and include as many of its descendants as needed.\n\nBut how does the size of the subtree (n -k) factor into this? Because sometimes including a lot of descendants might not be necessary if we can find a larger sum elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path through the tree, starting from a certain node and going down, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by finding the subtree with the maximum sum, but with exactly s = n -k nodes, and connected.\n\nBut how do we find such a subtree efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the following approach:\n\nWe need to select a subtree S of the original tree, which is connected, has exactly s nodes, and the sum of 2^i for i in S is as",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected subtree with the maximum possible sum of fans. Each district contributes \\(2^i\\) fans, where \\(i\\) is the district number. The goal is to maximize this sum while ensuring the remaining districts are connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure Insight**: The districts form a tree, meaning there's exactly one path between any two districts. To keep the remaining districts connected, the subtree must be connected.\n2. **Maximizing Fan Sum**: Higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we should include as many higher-numbered districts as possible.\n3. **Optimal Subtree Selection**: The optimal subtree will be a chain of districts starting from the highest possible node and including as many of its descendants as needed to form a connected component with exactly \\(n - k\\) nodes.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using a post-order traversal, we can calculate the sum of fans for each subtree and determine which subtrees to keep based on their sums and sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    depth = [0] * (n + 1)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Build the tree with root at 1\n    stack = [(1, 0)]\n    while stack:\n        u, p = stack.pop()\n        if visited[u]:\n            continue\n        visited[u] = True\n        parent[u] = p\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                depth[v] = depth[u] + 1\n                stack.append((v, u))\n    \n    s = n - k\n    \n    # We need to find a subtree of size s, connected, which has the maximum sum of 2^i\n    # So, the subtree should be a chain where the sum is maximum.\n    # We can think of it as choosing a root such that the total number of nodes in the subtree is s.\n    # But how?
