Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters of the guest and host, they should exactly match the pile, without any extra letters left over or missing.\n\nHmm, so the input has three lines. The first line is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile. All are uppercase letters. I need to determine if the pile can be rearranged to form both names together.\n\nSo, the approach here seems straightforward. We can count the frequency of each character in the guest name, then do the same for the host name, add those counts together, and then compare with the counts from the pile. If all counts match, then output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, right. Because if the combined letters of guest and host have certain frequencies, the pile must have exactly those frequencies. Any extra or missing letters would make it invalid.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the three lines from input. But wait, in some cases, the input might have newlines or something? Well, according to the problem statement, each line is a string of uppercase letters, so perhaps I can just read them as is.\n\nWait, no, the input is given as three separate lines. So in Python, I can read them using input().strip() for each line.\n\nWait, but sometimes, when reading from standard input, especially when there's multiple lines, I have to read each line properly. So for example:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, I need to create a frequency dictionary for each of the guest, host, and pile.\n\nAlternatively, since in Python, the collections.Counter class can help with this, I can use that.\n\nSo, for each string, I can create a Counter which gives the frequency of each character.\n\nOnce I have the counters for guest and host, I can combine them by adding their counts.\n\nThen, compare this combined counter with the pile's counter.\n\nIf they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read guest, host, pile.\n2. Create Counter for guest and host.\n3. Combine the two Counters (add them).\n4. Create Counter for pile.\n5. Compare the combined guest+host Counter with the pile Counter.\n6. If equal, print YES, else NO.\n\nThat sounds manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: Either guest or host is empty. But according to the problem statement, all lines are not empty. So no problem.\n\nEdge Case 2: The pile is exactly the sum of guest and host letters.\n\nAnother case: letters are all the same. Like guest is \"AA\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AAA\".\n\nYes, code should handle that.\n\nWhat about when the guest or host has zero length? No, because the problem says each line is non-empty.\n\nSo, now, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\nWait, wait, no, the sample input was shown as:\n\nIn the first sample input, the guest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ, and the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nWait, combining guest and host letters: SANTACLAUS + DEDMOROZ = ?\n\nBut when we count all letters, and compare to the pile, it should match.\n\nIn the code, when I combine the two Counters, it should give the same as the pile's Counter.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample: second input, where P is missing, and an extra L. So, the code correctly returns NO.\n\nThird sample: extra L, so also returns NO.\n\nSo, the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nIn Python, I can import Counter from collections.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nguest_counter = Counter(guest)\nhost_counter = Counter(host)\n\ncombined = guest_counter + host_counter  # This adds the counts.\n\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nif combined == pile_counter:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, yes, because adding the Counters will sum the counts of each character.\n\nBut wait, the '+' operator for Counters in Python does exactly that: it adds the counts for each key, returning a new Counter where the value is the sum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this code should work.\n\nTesting against the samples:\n\nFirst sample: guest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ.\n\nCombined Counter would have all the letters from both.\n\nPile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS, which is the same letters, so the Counters match.\n\nSecond sample: guest and host's combined letters have one less P, and one more L than the pile.\n\nSo, the combined Counter won't match pile's, hence output NO.\n\nThird sample: combined has one less L than the pile, so again, doesn't match.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWhat about another test case where letters are duplicated?\n\nE.g., guest is \"AAB\", host is \"B\", pile is \"ABA\".\n\nCombined guest+host: A:2, B:2.\n\nPile: A:2, B:1. So, no, output is NO.\n\nAnother test case: guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" â†’ YES.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the pile is exactly the same as the sum of guest and host? Like guest is \"AB\", host is \"CD\", pile is \"ABCD\". Then the code correctly outputs YES.\n\nSo, I think this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host exactly, without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to check if the pile of letters can be used to form both the guest's name and the host's name. This means that the combined letters of the guest and host should exactly match the pile in terms of character frequency.\n2. **Intuition**: By counting the frequency of each character in the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile, we can compare these frequencies. If the combined frequencies of the guest and host match exactly with those of the pile, then it is possible to rearrange the pile to form both names.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module in Python allows us to efficiently count the frequency of each character in a string. By combining the counters of the guest and host names and comparing them with the counter of the pile, we can determine the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves reading three strings and counting the characters in each, which is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of characters across all three strings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nguest_counter = Counter(guest)\nhost_counter = Counter(host)\n\ncombined = guest_counter + host_counter\n\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nprint(\"YES\" if combined == pile_counter else \"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The guest's name, host's name, and the pile are read from standard input.\n2. **Counting Frequencies**: We use the `Counter` class to create frequency dictionaries for the guest's name, host's name, and the pile.\n3. **Combining Frequencies**: The combined frequency dictionary is created by summing the counts from the guest's and host's names.\n4. **Comparison**: The combined frequency dictionary is compared with the frequency dictionary of the pile. If they match exactly, \"YES\" is printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately determine if the pile can be rearranged to form both names without any extra or missing letters.",
