Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then there are n queries where each query is like \"di→ti\". Each query means replacing every occurrence of digit di in the current string with ti. After all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored when interpreting the number, but wait, no—wait, the note says that leading zeroes are not removed after replacement. Oh right, because in the example, the third sample input ends up as '777', but the replacement didn't remove any leading zeros. So the resulting string is treated as is, including any leading zeros, except that if it's empty, it's considered zero.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore the leading zeros. Also, if s is empty, it's zero. So for example, if after substitutions the string is \"000\", the numeric value is 0.\n\nBut wait, the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string after replacement. So the string can have leading zeros, but when converted to a number, those are ignored. So the actual numeric value is computed by ignoring leading zeros, but the string is processed as is.\n\nHmm, okay. So the steps are:\n\n1. Process each query in order, replacing every occurrence of di with ti.\n\nBut wait, how? Because each query is applied to the current string. For example, the first example: the initial s is \"123123\". The first query is \"2→00\", which replaces 2 with 00, so s becomes \"10031003\". Then the next query is \"3→\", which replaces 3 with empty, so s becomes \"1212\".\n\nSo the processing is done in the order of the queries, each modifying the current string.\n\nThe challenge is to model this efficiently.\n\nNow, considering that the string can be up to 105 characters, and each substitution can replace a single character with multiple others, but the sum of all ti lengths across queries is up to 105. So the maximum possible length after all substitutions is manageable.\n\nBut processing each substitution step naively by string replacement could be feasible given the small size.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, the string is processed into a number, ignoring leading zeros. But how to handle that?\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7, but taking into account that leading zeros are ignored. So, for example, if the string is \"0123\", the numeric value is 123. But if the string is empty, it's zero.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n\n- For each query, process it in order:\n\n   - di is a single character (digit), ti is a string.\n\n   - Replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n\n- Once all queries are processed, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, treating leading zeros as insignificant, except when the string is empty.\n\n- Compute this value modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the issue is that the resulting string can be very long, even after substitutions. For instance, if each substitution replaces a single digit with a longer string, the string can grow exponentially. But given the constraints, the maximum initial length is 105, and each substitution adds ti's length minus 1 (since each di is replaced by ti, which may be longer). The sum of ti's lengths is up to 105, so the total possible length is 105 + 105 = 210. So the resulting string is at most around 210 characters.\n\nProcessing each substitution step by replacing all occurrences of di with ti is feasible.\n\nSo, the approach is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent the current string as a list or a string. For each substitution, we can do a replace operation.\n\nBut wait, since the substitution is global, not just once. For example, if di is replaced by ti, and ti contains di again, then subsequent replacements will also affect those new occurrences.\n\nBut since the substitution is done in the order of the queries, each time the entire string is processed, and all occurrences of di are replaced.\n\nSo, for each query, we process the current string, replacing every di with ti.\n\nIn Python, the string's replace method replaces all occurrences of a substring, but only once per call. So, for example, if the string is \"ababa\" and we replace 'a' with 'x', each 'a' is replaced in one pass. So, in Python, the string.replace() function does exactly that.\n\nWait, but what about if the substitution is part of a larger substitution? For example, if after replacing '2' with '00', and then another query replaces '0' with something else. Each substitution affects the current string, and each is done globally.\n\nSo, in code, for each query, we take the current string, and do s = s.replace(di, ti). Wait, but wait: di is a single character, so using str.replace() would work.\n\nYes, because each query is in the format di → ti, where di is exactly one digit. So for each query, di is a single character, and we can use s.replace(di, ti) to replace all instances of di with ti.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read the initial string s.\n\n- Read n.\n\n- For each of the n lines:\n\n   - parse the line into di and ti. For example, split on \"->\" to get the two parts. So, parts = line.split('->'), di is parts[0], ti is parts[1].\n\n   - then, replace all occurrences of di in s with ti.\n\nOnce all queries are done, process the resulting s:\n\n- if s is empty, output 0.\n\n- else, compute the numeric value of s, ignoring leading zeros. So, strip leading zeros, then if the result is empty, treat as 0, else as the integer.\n\nBut wait, how to compute this modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the string can be up to 210 characters, which is manageable for standard integer parsing in Python, but for very large numbers, but 210 digits is way less than what Python can handle as an integer. So, we can directly convert the string to an integer, then take mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, what if the string starts with '0's? For example, '00123' would be treated as 123. So, the correct approach is to:\n\n- Strip leading zeros: create a new string by removing all leading '0's until the first non-zero digit is found. If all are zeros, then the number is zero.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns_final = s.lstrip('0')\n\nif not s_final:\n    number = 0\nelse:\n    number = int(s_final)\n\nThen, compute number mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the input is read as:\n\nFirst line: '123123'\n\nSecond line: 1\n\nThen, the first query is '2->00'\n\nThen, the second query is '3->'\n\nThird query is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is a bit ambiguous. Looking back:\n\nThe problem says the input is the first line is s, second line is n, then next n lines describe the queries.\n\nWait, in the example given:\n\nThe input is written as ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0'].\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo. Or perhaps it's an example of input with four lines, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the example seems to have four lines, but that would make n=3, but the fourth line is another query. Hmm, perhaps that's a mistake in the formatting.\n\nBut perhaps the example's input is a bit unclear. Well, regardless, the code should read s, then n, then read n lines, each being a query.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead s from input. Then read n. Then read n lines, each line is a query.\n\nEach query is a string like 'di->ti'.\n\nSo, for each query, split on '->' to get di and ti.\n\nWait, but in Python, the input can be read via input().strip(), but in some cases, the lines may contain '\\n' characters, especially if the input is read via readlines().\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to read all lines at once, split into s and the queries.\n\nWait, but the first line is s, which can contain '\\n'? No, because in the input description, the first line is s, consisting of digits. So, the first line is a single line of digits, possibly containing no newline characters.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nqueries = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    # Split into di and ti\n    di_ti = line.split('->')\n    di = di_ti[0]\n    ti = di_ti[1]\n    queries.append( (di, ti) )\n\nThen, process each query in order:\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor di, ti in queries:\n    current_s = current_s.replace(di, ti)\n\nWait, no! Because each query is to be applied in order, but the replace function in Python replaces all occurrences of di in the string with ti, but if ti contains di again, it will be replaced again in the same step. However, since the queries are processed in sequence, each substitution is done in the correct order.\n\nWait, no. Because each substitution is done in the order of the queries, so each substitution affects the string for the next substitution.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have a query that replaces '2' with '22', and then a query that replaces '2' with '0'. The first substitution creates more '2's, which are then replaced in the second substitution.\n\nSo, in code, the order of substitution is correct as long as each query's substitution is done on the current string.\n\nYes, because each time, the current_s is updated with the new substitution.\n\nSo, in the code above, current_s is being replaced correctly.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, process current_s.\n\nCompute the numeric value:\n\nif current_s is empty, output 0.\n\nElse, strip leading zeros, if the result is empty, output 0, else output the integer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif len(current_s) == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    stripped = current_s.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped)\n        print(num % 1000000007)\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is all zeros, like '0000'? After stripping, it becomes empty string, so output 0.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input in the note.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\ns = '222'\n\nn=2.\n\nQueries:\n\n2 → 0\n\n0 →7.\n\nSo after the first substitution, s becomes '000'.\n\nThen, the second substitution replaces 0 with 7, so s becomes '777'.\n\nSo the numeric value is 777 mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: the first sample.\n\nAfter all substitutions, the string is '10031003' → 10031003, which is 10031003 mod 1e9+7 is 10031003.\n\nWait, but 1e9+7 is 1000000007. So 10031003 is less than that, so mod is 10031003.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about the order of substitution?\n\nSuppose a substitution is made, and the ti contains the di again. For example, a query that replaces '2' with '22', and then another query that replaces '2' with '0'. Then, the first substitution would create more '2's, which would then be replaced in the second substitution.\n\nYes, the code handles that correctly because each substitution is done in order.\n\nAnother edge case: substitution leads to an empty string.\n\nFor example, initial s is '3', and the query is '3→', then s becomes empty. So the output is 0.\n\nAnother case: substitution leads to a string starting with zero.\n\nLike s is '0000', after substitution becomes '0000'. The numeric value is 0.\n\nSo the code correctly handles all these cases.\n\nThus, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nBut wait, the problem's input is given as a list, but in reality, the code should read from stdin, line by line.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the sample input is presented as a list, but that's probably a representation of how the input is structured.\n\nSo, the code will read s from the first line, then n from the second line, then n lines of queries.\n\nSo, the code structure is as follows:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a query.\n\nProcess each query in order.\n\nCompute the final string.\n\nCompute the number, handling leading zeros.\n\nOutput the number mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead s:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    # Split into di and ti.\n\n    parts = line.split('->')\n\n    di = parts[0]\n\n    ti = parts[1]\n\n    queries.append( (di, ti) )\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor di, ti in queries:\n\n    current_s = current_s.replace(di, ti)\n\nif not current_s:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    stripped = current_s.lstrip('0')\n\n    if not stripped:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        num = int(stripped)\n\n        print(num % 1000000007)\n\nWait, but what about cases where di is '0' and ti is an empty string?\n\nLike, if s is '0', and the query is '0→', then s becomes empty.\n\nWhich is handled correctly.\n\nAnother test case: s is '0', n=0. Output is 0.\n\nWhat about when s is '10' and the query is '1→0', so '10' becomes '00' → the numeric value is 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think this covers all cases.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
