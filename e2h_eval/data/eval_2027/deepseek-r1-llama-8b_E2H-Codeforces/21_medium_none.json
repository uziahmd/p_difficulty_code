    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. The goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the keys. Each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by only one key. \n\nThe condition for a key j and chest i is that a_i + b_j must be odd. So, the sum needs to be congruent to 1 mod 2. That means either a_i is even and b_j is odd, or vice versa.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I need to figure out is how to pair the keys and chests in such a way that as many chests as possible are opened.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since each key can only be used once, and each chest can only be unlocked once, the problem reduces to matching the keys to chests in a way that satisfies the parity condition.\n\nI think the key here is to count how many chests have even a_i and how many have odd a_i. Similarly, count how many keys have even b_j and how many have odd b_j.\n\nWait, because for a key to open a chest, the sum must be odd. So:\n\n- If the key is even (b_j is even), then the chest must be odd (a_i is odd) for their sum to be odd.\n- If the key is odd (b_j is odd), then the chest must be even (a_i is even) for the sum to be odd.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i values in the chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j values in the keys.\n3. Then, determine how to best match the keys and chests based on parity.\n\nLet's denote:\n- even_a = number of chests with a_i even\n- odd_a = n - even_a\n- even_b = number of keys with b_j even\n- odd_b = m - even_b\n\nNow, for the keys, we can have two types: even and odd. For each type, we can use them to unlock chests of the opposite parity.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use as many even keys as possible to unlock odd chests.\n- Use as many odd keys as possible to unlock even chests.\n\nBut wait, the order in which we process these could affect the total. Or maybe not, since it's optimal to take the maximum possible.\n\nWait, let's model this. Let's say:\n\nThe maximum number of chests that can be unlocked is the sum of the minimum between the available keys of one parity and the available chests of the opposite parity.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can only be used once. So, the process is:\n\n- The number of chests that can be unlocked by even keys is the minimum of even_b and the number of odd_a chests.\nSimilarly, the number of chests that can be unlocked by odd keys is the minimum of odd_b and even_a.\n\nBut wait, but each key can be used only once, so we have to allocate the keys optimally.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of chests is the sum of the min(even_b, odd_a) and min(odd_b, even_a). But wait, that might not be correct because if we have more even_b than odd_a, the extra even_b can't be used, but perhaps some of them can be used in another way. Or maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of chests is min(even_b + odd_b, even_a + odd_a), but that's not necessarily correct because the keys have to match the chests in parity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the sum of the two minima: min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a). But wait, what if the sum of these two exceeds the total number of chests? Because each chest can be unlocked by only one key.\n\nYes, exactly. So the maximum number of chests is the minimum between (min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)) and the total number of chests n.\n\nWait, no. Wait, imagine that even_b is 5 and odd_a is 3. So you can only use 3 even_b keys to unlock 3 odd_a chests. Then, for the remaining 2 even_b keys, they can't be used for anything else. Similarly, if odd_b is 4 and even_a is 2, then you can use 2 of them. So the total is 3+2=5, but if n is 5, then that's the maximum.\n\nBut if the sum of those two minima is larger than n, then the maximum is n.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nmax_chests = min( (min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)), n )\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the example given.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo, a_i are 9,14,6,2,11. Their parities: 9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So:\n\neven_a = 3 (14,6,2)\nodd_a = 2 (9,11)\n\nb_j are 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even,7 odd,20 even.\n\nSo even_b =3 (8,4,20)\nodd_b=1 (7)\n\nSo, min(even_b, odd_a) is min(3,2) =2. So 2 even_b keys can be used to unlock 2 odd_a chests.\n\nThen, min(odd_b, even_a) is min(1,3)=1. So 1 odd_b key can unlock 1 even_a chest.\n\nTotal is 2+1=3, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: second input.\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na_i: 2,4,6,8,10 → all even → even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb_j:5 → odd. So even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nSo, min(even_b, odd_a) is 0, because odd_a is 0. And min(odd_b, even_a) is min(1,5)=1. So total is 0+1=1, which is the sample output.\n\nThird example: n=1, m=4.\n\na_i:10 → even.\n\nb_j:20,30,40,50 → all even.\n\nSo even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\neven_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nSo, min(even_b, odd_a) is 0. min(odd_b, even_a) is 0. So total 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo this formula seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read a array and compute even_a and odd_a.\n\n3. Read b array and compute even_b and odd_b.\n\n4. Compute possible pairs:\n\n   - x = min(even_b, odd_a)\n   - y = min(odd_b, even_a)\n   - total = x + y\n\n5. The maximum chests is the minimum between total and n.\n\nSo, now the code can be written accordingly.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\nCase when m=0: then no keys, so no chests can be opened.\n\nCase when n=0: same.\n\nBut according to constraints, n and m are at least 1.\n\nAnother case: when even_b is 0, and odd_b is sufficient to cover all even_a.\n\nLike n=3, m=2. a is [2,4,6] → even_a=3. b is [3,5] → odd_b=2. So min(odd_b, even_a) is 2. So total is 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when even_b is more than odd_a, and odd_b is more than even_a.\n\nFor example, even_b=5, odd_a=3. So x=3. Then, even_a=5, and odd_b=4. So y=4. Total is 7, but if n is 7, that's fine.\n\nBut what if n is 6? Then 3+4=7>6 → so the maximum is 6.\n\nSo yes, the formula works.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a as list of integers. Compute even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x%2 ==0).\n\nSimilarly, read b and compute even_b.\n\nCompute odd_a = n - even_a.\n\nCompute odd_b = m - even_b.\n\nx = min(even_b, odd_a)\n\ny = min(odd_b, even_a)\n\ntotal = x + y\n\nans = min(total, n)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but what about when the sum of x and y is greater than n? Like in the example where x=3, y=4, and n=6. Then the maximum is 6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should implement this.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\neven_a=3, odd_a=2.\n\neven_b=3, odd_b=1.\n\nx = min(3,2) → 2.\n\ny = min(1,3) → 1.\n\ntotal 3, which is <=5. So ans is 3.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\neven_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\neven_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nx= min(0,0)=0.\n\ny= min(1,5)=1.\n\ntotal=1, which is <=5. So ans 1.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\neven_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\neven_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nx= min(4,0)=0.\n\ny= min(0,1)=0.\n\ntotal 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, m=2.\n\na: [2,4,6] → even_a=3.\n\nb: [3,5] → odd_b=2.\n\nx = min(0, 3) → 0.\n\ny = min(2,3) → 2.\n\ntotal 2.\n\nn=3, so ans is 2.\n\nWait, but wait, in this scenario, the even_b is 0 (because b has two odd numbers). So the even keys can't be used. The odd_b is 2, which can be used on the even_a chests. So 2 chests can be opened. So the formula works.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, m=5.\n\na: [1,3,5,7,9] → all odd. even_a=0.\n\nb: [2,4,6,8,10] → even_b=5.\n\nSo x = min(5, 0) → 0.\n\ny = min(0,5) → 0.\n\ntotal is 0. So no chests can be opened.\n\nBecause the a's are all odd, and the b's are all even. So each a_i + b_j is odd, so all 5 can be opened. Wait, wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, no! Because the sum of an odd (a_i) and even (b_j) is odd. So a_i + b_j is odd. So for each of the 5 a_i (all odd), each can be matched with any of the 5 b_j (all even). So why is the formula giving zero?\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because according to our approach, x is min(even_b, odd_a) → min(5,5) → 5. Y is min(0,0) →0. So total is 5, which is equal to n=5. So the formula gives 5, which is correct.\n\nWait, so in my previous test case, I had a's as all odd, so even_a=0. B's as all even, so odd_b=0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, even_b is 5, since all b's are even.\n\nSo even_b is 5, odd_b is 0.\n\nWait, in this case:\n\nx = min(even_b, odd_a) → min(5,5) →5.\n\ny = min(odd_b, even_a) → min(0,0) →0.\n\ntotal is 5.\n\nWhich is correct, since all 5 chests can be opened.\n\nAh, I see. So earlier mistake was thinking that in that case, the formula gives zero, but actually, it's 5.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=4, m=3.\n\na: [2,4,6,8] → even_a=4.\n\nb: [1,3,5] → odd_b=3.\n\nSo even_b is 0, odd_b=3.\n\nx = min(0,0) →0.\n\ny = min(3,4) →3.\n\nTotal is 3.\n\nWhich is correct, since each of the 3 odd_b can be used to unlock 3 of the 4 even_a chests.\n\nSo the code will correctly output 3.\n\nThus, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nWe need to read the inputs correctly.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via input().split(), but for large inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the problem, since n and m can be up to 1e5, it's manageable.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for num in a if num % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for num in b if num % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nx = min(even_b, odd_a)\n\ny = min(odd_b, even_a)\n\ntotal = x + y\n\nans = min(total, n)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting against the examples:\n\nFirst example:\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_a is 14,6,2 →3.\n\nodd_a=2.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20].\n\neven_b=8,4,20 →3.\n\nodd_b=7 →1.\n\nx = min(3, 2) →2.\n\ny = min(1,3) →1.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\na is all even →5.\n\nb is [5], which is odd. So even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nx = min(0,0)=0.\n\ny = min(1,5)=1.\n\nTotal 1.\n\nThird example:\n\na is 10 → even.\n\nb is 20,30,40,50 → even.\n\neven_a=1, even_b=4.\n\nx= min(4,0) →0.\n\ny= min(0,1) →0.\n\nTotal 0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case where a is all odd and b all even:\n\nn=5, m=5.\n\na is all odd → even_a=0.\n\nb is all even → even_b=5.\n\nx = min(5,5) →5.\n\ny = min(0,0) →0.\n\ntotal=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case where even_b is 5, odd_a is 3.\n\nx is 3.\n\nodd_b is 4, even_a is 5.\n\ny is 4.\n\nTotal 7. If n is 7, okay. Else, min(7, n).\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nI think this should pass all the test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using given keys. Each key can unlock a specific type of chest based on their parity (odd or even).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Parity Condition**: A key can unlock a chest if the sum of their values is odd. This happens when one value is even and the other is odd.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Values**: For both chests and keys, count how many have even values and how many have odd values.\n3. **Match Keys and Chests**: Use even keys to unlock odd chests and odd keys to unlock even chests. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the available keys and chests of the required parity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    even_a = sum(1 for num in a if num % 2 == 0)\n    odd_a = n - even_a\n    \n    even_b = sum(1 for num in b if num % 2 == 0)\n    odd_b = m - even_b\n    \n    x = min(even_b, odd_a)\n    y = min(odd_b, even_a)\n    \n    total = x + y\n    print(min(total, n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of chests `n` and keys `m`, followed by the values on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: It counts how many chests have even values (`even_a`) and how many have odd values (`odd_a`). Similarly, it counts the even and odd keys.\n3. **Matching Keys and Chests**: The code calculates how many even keys can unlock odd chests (`x`) and how many odd keys can unlock even chests (`y`). The sum of these values gives the total number of chests that can be unlocked.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is the minimum of the total number of unlocked chests and the total number of chests `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened by leveraging the parity of the values on the chests and keys.",
