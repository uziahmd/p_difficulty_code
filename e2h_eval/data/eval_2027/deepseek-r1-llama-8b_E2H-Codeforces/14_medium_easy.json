He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then count how many such n's and list them.\n\nFirst, I think I need a way to compute Z(n) quickly. But for finding n given m, maybe I can use binary search. Because Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. So for a given m, the possible n's must lie in a certain range where Z(n) equals m.\n\nWait, but sometimes multiple n's can have the same Z(n). For example, if m is 5, looking at the sample input, n=5 gives 1 zero (since 5! is 120), but wait no, the sample shows m=1 and m=5? Wait the example says input is ['1', '5'], but the output for the first case is 5,6,7,8,9 giving 1 zero each. Oh right, because 5! is 120 (one zero), 6! is 720 (one zero), etc., up to 9!.\n\nSo for m=5, what happens? Let's see:\n\nCompute Z(20): 20/5=4, 20/25=0. So Z(20)=4.\n\nZ(21): same as 20, since 21/5=4, 21/25=0. So Z(21)=4.\n\nWait, no: 21//5 is 4, 21//25 is 0. Sum is 4.\n\nWait, but when does Z(n) increase by one? It increases by 1 when n is a multiple of 5 but not 25, or a multiple of 25, etc. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think that for every multiple of 5, you add at least one zero. But when it's a multiple of 25, it adds two, so you have to account for that.\n\nBut for the problem, I think the approach is to find the lower bound and upper bound where Z(n) = m.\n\nSo how to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m, and then find all consecutive n's that also have Z(n) = m.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to find the minimal n that gives m zeros, and then see how far it goes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this with binary search. Because for a given m, the n's that produce it form a contiguous range. So I can find the smallest n where Z(n) = m, and then find the largest n where Z(n) = m. Then the count is largest - smallest + 1, and the numbers from smallest to largest inclusive are the answers.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n2. Find the maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n3. The count is (max_n - min_n + 1).\n4. Output all these n's in order.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find min_n and max_n?\n\nI can use binary search for both.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think about it.\n\nFor min_n: We need to find the smallest n where Z(n) = m. Since Z(n) is non-decreasing, once we find the first occurrence where Z(n) >= m, we check if it's equal to m. If yes, that's min_n. If not, perhaps adjust.\n\nWait, no. Because for some m, there might be a range where Z(n) = m. So the first n where Z(n) = m could be found via binary search.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the first n where Z(n) == m, and then find the last n where Z(n) == m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n where Z(n) >= m and then see if Z(n) is exactly m. If yes, then find the next n where Z(n) exceeds m.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Use binary search to find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n\nOnce found, check if Z(n) is m. If yes, proceed. Otherwise, that means there's no solution.\n\nWait, no. Because for some m, there may be no n with Z(n) = m. For example, m=0 is not allowed as per the input constraints (m >=1). But wait, the input constraints say m >=1.\n\nWait, but wait: let's think about m=1. What's the Z(n) for various n:\n\nn=5: 5/5=1, so Z(5)=1.\n\nn=6: 6/5=1, 6/25=0. So Z(6)=1.\n\nSimilarly, up to n=9: Z(9) = 1.\n\nn=10: 10/5=2, so Z(10)=2.\n\nSo for m=1, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9: five numbers.\n\nSo the minimal n is 5, and the maximal is 9.\n\nThus, the approach would be to find the minimal n where Z(n) = m, then find the maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n\nSo to find the minimal n:\n\nWe can perform a binary search between low and high, where low starts at 0 and high is some upper limit.\n\nSimilarly, for the maximal n, perhaps we can find the point where Z(n) becomes m+1, and then subtract 1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to find the lower and upper bounds using binary search.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m. Let's call this lower_bound.\n\n   - Check if Z(lower_bound) == m. If yes, proceed. Else, no solution.\n\n2. Find the largest n where Z(n) <= m. Let's call this upper_bound.\n\n   - Check if Z(upper_bound) == m. If yes, proceed. Else, no solution.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nWe can find the first n where Z(n) = m. Then find the last n where Z(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For each n, Z(n) can be computed quickly.\n\nSo, for a given m, the minimal n is the smallest n where Z(n) = m.\n\nTo find this, perhaps binary search is the way to go.\n\nSimilarly, the maximal n is the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n\nSo let's think about binary searching for the minimal n.\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m (since 5*m will have at least m 5 factors, but perhaps higher).\n\nWait, but for m=1, 5*1=5, which is correct.\n\nFor m=5, 5*5=25, which may be the correct minimal n.\n\nBut let's see: Z(25) = 25//5=5, 25//25=1, 25//125=0. So 5+1=6. So Z(25)=6. So for m=5, the minimal n is 20?\n\nWait no, let's compute Z(20):\n\n20//5=4, 20//25=0. So Z(20)=4. So for m=5, the minimal n is 21? No, wait Z(21) is also 4. Wait no, wait 21//5=4, 21//25=0, so Z(21)=4. So when does Z(n) reach 5?\n\nAt n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1, so Z=6.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to compute Z(n) for some n:\n\nn | Z(n)\n5 → 1\n6 → 1\n...\n9 → 1\n10 → 2\n15 → 3\n20 →4\n25 →6\n24 →4\n21→4\n22→4\n23→4\n24→4\n25→6\n\nAh, so for m=5, there is no n where Z(n)=5. Because between 20 and 25, Z(n) jumps from 4 to 6.\n\nSo for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nWhich explains why in the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0.\n\nSo, the first step is to correctly find whether any n exists such that Z(n)=m.\n\nSo, the algorithm should be:\n\n1. Binary search for the minimal n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n2. Once found, check if Z(n) is exactly m.\n\n3. If yes, then find the maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n\n4. Else, output 0.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nImplementing a function to compute Z(n):\n\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for binary search:\n\nTo find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m.\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m (since for m=1, 5*1=5 is the minimal n).\n\nWait, but for larger m, 5*m may not be sufficient.\n\nWait, let's see: For m=100000, 5*m=500000. What's Z(500000)?\n\n500000 /5=100000, 500000/25=20000, 500000/125=4000, 500000/625=800, 500000/3125=160, 500000/15625=32, 500000/78125=6, 500000/390625=1, higher divisions give 0. So total Z(n)=100000+20000+4000+800+160+32+6+1= 142909.\n\nWhich is larger than m=100000. So 500000 is a valid high.\n\nSo, binary search between low=0 and high=5*m is acceptable.\n\nWait, but for m=1, 5*m=5. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the binary search for minimal n:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 5 * m\n\nans = -1\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    z = count_zeroes(mid)\n\n    if z >= m:\n\n        ans = mid\n\n        high = mid - 1\n\n    else:\n\n        low = mid + 1\n\nAfter the loop, if ans is not -1, then check if Z(ans) == m.\n\nIf yes, proceed. Else, no solution.\n\nWait, but for m=5, the minimal n where Z(n)>=5 is 25, because Z(25)=6.\n\nSo for m=5, the binary search would return 25, but since Z(25) !=5, we have to output 0.\n\nSo, after finding the minimal n, we have to verify that Z(n) == m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nSo, that's the first step.\n\nOnce we have the minimal n where Z(n) = m, we can find the maximal n where Z(n)=m.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can perform another binary search for the maximal n where Z(n) <= m, but then again, we have to check if it's exactly m.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximal n where Z(n)=m is the largest n such that Z(n) = m.\n\nSo perhaps we can find the point where Z(n) = m, and find the next n where Z(n) >m. Then the maximal n is one less than that.\n\nFor example, in the sample where m=1, the minimal n is 5, and the maximal n is 9. Because Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2.\n\nSo, to find the maximal n where Z(n) =m, we can set high= something like 5*(m+1), and find the maximum n where Z(n) =m.\n\nAlternatively, find the first n where Z(n) >m, and then the maximal n is n-1.\n\nYes, that's a good approach.\n\nSo, to find the maximal n:\n\nWe can set low= minimal_n (which is the first n where Z(n)=m), and high=5*(m+1).\n\nThen, perform binary search to find the smallest n where Z(n) >m.\n\nThe maximal n is then (n-1).\n\nWait, but wait: For example, in the sample where m=1, minimal n is 5, and the first n where Z(n)>1 is 10. So maximal n is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- After confirming that minimal_n has Z(n)=m, find the maximal n.\n\nSet low=5, high=5*(m+1).\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high)//2\n\n    if Z(mid) >m:\n\n        high=mid-1\n\n        possible_max=mid-1\n\n    else:\n\n        low=mid+1\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps the binary search is to find the smallest n where Z(n) >m. Then, the maximal n where Z(n)=m is (that n)-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nFind min_n where Z(min_n) =m.\n\nIf no such n exists, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Find the smallest n where Z(n) >m. Call this upper_bound.\n\n   max_n = upper_bound -1.\n\n   Now, check if Z(max_n) ==m.\n\n   Then, the count is max_n - min_n +1.\n\n   Then, output all the numbers from min_n to max_n.\n\nBut wait, what if Z(upper_bound-1) is not equal to m? That's impossible because upper_bound is the first n where Z(n) >m, so upper_bound-1 must have Z(n)=m.\n\nBecause Z is non-decreasing.\n\nSo, for example, in the case where m=5, minimal_n is 25, but Z(25)=6>5. So, during the initial check, the code will see that Z(25) !=m, so output 0.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute min_n via binary search for the minimal n where Z(n)>=m.\n\nIf Z(min_n) !=m: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Find upper_bound as the minimal n where Z(n) >m.\n\n   max_n = upper_bound -1.\n\n   Now, compute the count as max_n - min_n +1.\n\n   Then, output the numbers from min_n to max_n.\n\nSo, now, the plan is clear.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, write the count_zeroes function.\n\nThen, implement the binary search for min_n.\n\nThen, if min_n is found and Z(min_n) ==m, proceed.\n\nElse, output 0.\n\nThen, find upper_bound.\n\nImplement another binary search.\n\nOnce upper_bound is found, max_n= upper_bound -1.\n\nThen, collect the numbers from min_n to max_n, inclusive.\n\nThen, output the count followed by the numbers.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n\n    res =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n =n//5\n\n        res +=n\n\n    return res\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n\n    low=0\n\n    high=5*m\n\n    ans=-1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        z= count_zeroes(mid)\n\n        if z >=m:\n\n            ans=mid\n\n            high=mid-1\n\n        else:\n\n            low=mid+1\n\n    return ans\n\ndef find_upper_bound(m, min_n):\n\n    # Find the smallest n where Z(n) >m\n\n    low=min_n\n\n    high=5*(m+1)\n\n    ans=-1\n\n    while low <=high:\n\n        mid=(low+high)//2\n\n        z=count_zeroes(mid)\n\n        if z>m:\n\n            ans=mid\n\n            high=mid-1\n\n        else:\n\n            low=mid+1\n\n    return ans\n\nThen, in the main code:\n\nm=int(input())\n\nmin_n=find_min_n(m)\n\nif min_n ==-1 or count_zeroes(min_n)!=m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper_bound= find_upper_bound(m, min_n)\n\n    max_n= upper_bound-1\n\n    # Now, collect all n from min_n to max_n inclusive.\n\n    count = max_n - min_n +1\n\n    res = [str(i) for i in range(min_n, max_n+1)]\n\n    print(count)\n\n    print(' '.join(res))\n\nWait, but what about cases where upper_bound is not found? Well, since Z(n) tends to infinity as n increases, upper_bound will always be found eventually.\n\nWait, for m=0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so no problem.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input: '1' and '5'\n\nFor m=1:\n\nmin_n=5, Z(5)=1.\n\nfind_upper_bound: looking for the first n where Z(n)>1.\n\nZ(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ..., Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2.\n\nSo upper_bound is 10.\n\nmax_n=9.\n\ncount=9-5+1=5.\n\nOutput is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nmin_n=25, but Z(25)=6>5. So, in the initial check, Z(min_n)!=m, so output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nCompute min_n.\n\nZ(5)=1<2, so need higher.\n\nCheck 6: Z=1.\n\nContinue until 10: Z=2.\n\nSo min_n=10.\n\nThen, find upper_bound.\n\nLooking for first n where Z(n)>2.\n\nn=11: Z=2.\n\nn=12: same.\n\nn=15: Z=3.\n\nSo upper_bound is 15.\n\nmax_n=14.\n\nCheck Z(14): 14//5=2, 14//25=0. So Z=2.\n\nSo, numbers from 10 to 14: 5 numbers.\n\nSo output 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nCompute min_n.\n\nLooking for n where Z(n)>=6.\n\nn=25: Z=6.\n\nSo min_n=25.\n\nCheck Z(25)=6, yes.\n\nNow find upper_bound: first n where Z(n)>6.\n\nCheck n=25: Z=6.\n\nn=26: 26//5=5, 26//25=1 →5+1=6.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 →7.\n\nSo upper_bound is 30.\n\nmax_n=29.\n\nZ(29): 29//5=5, 29//25=1 →5+1=6.\n\nSo numbers are 25 to 29 →5 numbers.\n\nSo output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nWait, no: 25,26,27,28,29 is 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nmin_n: let's see.\n\nn=15: Z=3.\n\nIs there a smaller n?\n\nn=14: Z=2.\n\nn=15:3.\n\nSo min_n=15.\n\nupper_bound: first n where Z(n)>3.\n\nn=16:3.\n\nn=20:4.\n\nSo upper_bound=20.\n\nmax_n=19.\n\nZ(19)=3.\n\nNumbers 15-19: 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWhat about when m=0? But according to the problem statement, m is >=1, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nWhat about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nWell, the binary search is O(log (5e5)) which is manageable.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0 is not in input.\n\nSo, code should be correct.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nBut in Python, functions are easy, but in the problem statement, the input is read as a single line containing m.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list, but in the problem statement, the input is an integer m.\n\nIn the code, it's better to read from stdin.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z >= m:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return ans\n\ndef find_upper_bound(m, min_n):\n    low = min_n\n    high = 5*(m+1)\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return ans\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if min_n == -1 or count_zeroes(min_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper_bound = find_upper_bound(m, min_n)\n        max_n = upper_bound -1\n        count = max_n - min_n +1\n        print(count)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, max_n+1))))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the function find_upper_bound, the initial high is 5*(m+1). Is that sufficient?\n\nWait, for m=1, 5*(1+1)=10. Which is correct, as upper_bound is 10.\n\nFor m=6, 5*(6+1)=35. Which is higher than 30, so correct.\n\nYes, the high is enough.\n\nTesting the code with sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nWait, no, the input is a single integer. So the code reads m as the first line.\n\nIn the code, m is read as int(sys.stdin.readline()).\n\nSo for the first sample input line '1', the code will process m=1.\n\nThe second sample input is '5', which is processed as m=5.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample input is shown as ['1', '5'], which is a list, but probably it's a typo. Because in the problem statement, the input is a single integer.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the code should output 5 numbers from 10 to 14.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves using binary search to efficiently find the range of such integers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) (n factorial) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Minimum \\( n \\)**: We use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). If \\( Z(n) \\) at this point is exactly \\( m \\), we proceed; otherwise, there are no valid \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: Once we have the minimum \\( n \\), we perform another binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) > m \\). The largest \\( n \\) with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes is then this upper bound minus one.\n\n4. **Range Calculation**: The integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition form a contiguous range from the minimum \\( n \\) to the derived upper bound minus one. The count of such integers and the list itself are then generated and printed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z >= m:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return ans\n\ndef find_upper_bound(m, min_n):\n    low = min_n\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return ans\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if min_n == -1 or count_zeroes(min_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper_bound = find_upper_bound(m, min_n)\n        max_n = upper_bound - 1\n        count = max_n - min_n + 1\n        print(count)\n        if count > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, max_n + 1))))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single integer \\( m \\).\n2. **Finding Minimum \\( n \\)**: Using binary search, we determine the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m \\).\n3. **Validation**: Check if the count of trailing zeroes at this minimum \\( n \\) is exactly \\( m \\). If not, output 0.\n4. **Finding Upper Bound**: Use binary search to find the first \\( n \\) where the count exceeds \\( m \\). The largest valid \\( n \\) is one less than this upper bound.\n5. **Output Results**: Calculate the count of valid integers and print them in order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable for large values of \\( m \\).",
