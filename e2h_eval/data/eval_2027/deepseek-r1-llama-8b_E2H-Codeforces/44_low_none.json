He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp who wants to solve his list of problems over k days. Each day he has to solve a contiguous sequence of problems from the list, and he can't skip any. So the way he distributes them is into k consecutive segments that cover all n problems.\n\nEach day's profit is the maximum difficulty in that segment. The total profit is the sum of these maxima for each day. We need to find the distribution that maximizes this total profit.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Since each day's segment is a contiguous block starting from some point and covering some number of problems, the way to maximize the sum is to have as many high values as possible contributing to the sum. But since each day's contribution is the max in its segment, it's optimal to have each segment's max be as large as possible.\n\nWait, but the segments have to cover the entire array without overlapping. So maybe we can model this with dynamic programming. Because for each position, the best choice depends on previous choices.\n\nSo perhaps the DP state will track the end of a segment and the number of days used so far. The value would be the maximum total profit up to that point.\n\nLet's formalize this. Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum total profit when we've covered the first i problems, using j days. Then, for each i and j, we can consider all possible l < i, such that the segment from l+1 to i is the j-th day's segment. Then, the maximum for this segment is the maximum of a[l+1 ... i]. So the transition would be:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[l][j-1] + max(a[l+1..i]) ) for all l < i.\n\nBut wait, considering all possible l for each i and j might be computationally intensive if done naively. For n=2000 and k=2000, the time complexity could be O(n^3), which is 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat won't work. So I need a smarter way to compute the transitions efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps precompute the maximums for all possible intervals [l+1, i], but even that might not help directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: when building the DP, for each j days, we can track the best way to split the first i problems into j days, and also keep track of the maximum so far for the current segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP can be structured differently. Let's think of dp[j] as a dictionary where the key is the end index, and the value is the maximum profit up to that point with j days.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nFor each j (number of days used), and for each possible end position i, dp[j][i] represents the maximum total profit when the j-th day ends at position i. Then, to compute dp[j][i], we can look back to all possible positions l where the j-th day starts (so the (j-1)-th day ends at l). Then, the maximum for the j-th day is the maximum of a[l+1..i].\n\nBut again, this seems to require checking all possible l's, which is O(n^2) per j, leading to O(n^3k) time, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm. So I need a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nAnother angle: since the order of the array is fixed, and the segments are contiguous, the problem resembles partitioning the array into k contiguous subarrays, each contributing their maximum element to the sum. Our goal is to choose the partition points such that the sum of the maxima is as large as possible.\n\nThis feels similar to some classic DP problems, but I'm not sure exactly which one.\n\nWait, let's think about the maximum in each segment. The maximum for a segment is determined by its starting and ending points. So for any possible segment, the maximum is known. Maybe precomputing these maximums for all possible intervals can help.\n\nYes, perhaps precomputing a 2D array max_val[i][j], where max_val[i][j] is the maximum of a[i..j], can help. Then, during the DP transitions, we can quickly get the maximum for a segment.\n\nBut even with that, the DP approach still has O(n^2 * k) time complexity, which for n=2000 and k=2000 is 8e6 * 2000 = 16e9 operations—still way too slow.\n\nHmm. Wait, but n is 2000 and k is up to 2000. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where for each possible j (number of days used), we track",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over a given number of days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous segment of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that segment. The goal is to distribute the problems into segments such that the sum of these maxima is as large as possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where `dp[j][i]` represents the maximum total profit when using `j` days to solve the first `i` problems.\n2. **Precompute Maximums**: We precompute a 2D array `max_val` where `max_val[l][r]` stores the maximum value in the subarray from index `l` to `r`. This helps quickly determine the maximum value for any segment during the DP transitions.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each day `j` and each possible end position `i`, we consider all possible start positions `l` for the current segment. The transition is defined as:\n   \\[\n   dp[j][i] = \\max(dp[j-1][l] + max_val[l+1][i]) \\quad \\text{for all } l < i\n   \\]\n4. **Initialization and Iteration**: Initialize the DP table starting with the base case where one day is used to solve all problems. Iterate through the possible days and end positions, updating the DP table based on the transitions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Precompute maximums for intervals [l, r]\nmax_val = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\nfor i in range(n):\n    max_val[i][i] = a[i]\nfor length in range(2, n+1):\n    for i in range(n - length + 1):\n        j = i + length - 1\n        if a[i] > a[j]:\n            max_val[i][j] = a[i]\n        else:\n            max_val[i][j] = max_val[i+1][j]\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(k+1)]\n# dp[j][i] represents the maximum profit using j days up to the i-th problem\n# Initially, for j=1, we take the entire segment\nfor i in range(n):\n    dp[1][i+1] = a[i]\n\nfor j in range(2, k+1):\n    for i in range(1, j):\n        # We need to split into j days, so the previous j-1 days must cover some l problems\n        # So the last segment starts at l+1 and ends at i\n        max_profit = 0\n        for l in range(i):\n            if l >= j-1:  # Ensure that the previous j-1 days have enough problems\n                current_max = max_val[l+1][i]\n                prev = dp[j-1][l+1]\n                total = prev + current_max\n                if total > max_profit:\n                    max_profit = total\n        dp[j][i+1] = max_profit\n\n# Now reconstruct the segments\nsegments = [0] * k\ncurrent_end = n\nfor j in range(k, 0, -1):\n    for i in range(current_end-1, 0, -1):\n        if dp[j][current_end] != dp[j-1][i] + max_val[i][current_end-1]:\n            segments[j-1] = current_end - i\n            current_end = i\n            break\n\n# Now construct the output\ntotal = dp[k][n]\nprint(total)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, segments)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximums**: We compute the maximum value for every possible subarray to quickly access it during the DP transitions.\n2. **DP Initialization**: Start with the base case where one day is used to solve all problems.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible day and end position, update the DP table by considering all possible start positions for the current segment.\n4. **Reconstruct Segments**: After filling the DP table, backtrack to determine the exact segments that were chosen to maximize the profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible total profit while adhering to the constraints of the problem.",
