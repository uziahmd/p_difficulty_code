            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, each with a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). The goal is to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu, which is either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, right. So the task is to determine, for each of the three possible starting hands, what's the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. So, the initial hand is three tiles, but perhaps with duplicates. For example, maybe all are the same, which would immediately be a triplet. Or maybe they form part of a sequence.\n\nBut the output is three values, one for each of the three possible starting hands? Or wait, looking back, the input is three strings, but the output is three numbers, which probably correspond to the minimal draws required for each possible way of combining the three tiles into a group. Or maybe not. Wait, the sample input shows that for the third example, the output is 0, 0, 1. So, the initial three tiles can form three different possibilities, and for each possibility, we calculate the required draws.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the sample input:\n\nThe third example's input is ['3p 9m 2p'], and the output is 0, 0, 1. Wait, no. Oh wait, the sample input is given as three separate lines? Or perhaps, the input is a single line containing three strings, each representing a tile. So, the initial hand is three tiles, possibly with duplicates. But the output is three integers, each representing the minimal draws required if she considers each of the three tiles as the start of a group.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe input is three strings, each representing a tile. So, the initial hand consists of these three tiles. Then, after drawing some tiles, she must have at least one mentsu. We need to find the minimal number of draws required.\n\nSo, the output is a single integer, the minimal number of tiles to draw.\n\nWait, no. Because the sample output shows three numbers. Oh wait, the sample input is written as:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nAnd the output is ['0', '0', '1']. So, for each of the three possible groups (the first group is 1s,2s,3s; the second is 9m thrice; the third is 3p,9m,2p), compute the minimal draws needed.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is, for each of the three possible initial groups (each consisting of the three tiles given), calculate the minimal number of tiles needed to be drawn to complete a mentsu in that group. Then, output the three numbers, each being the minimal draws required for each of the three groups.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each of the three possible starting groups, check what is the minimal number of draws needed to form a mentsu within that group.\n\nWait, but how are the groups formed? Each group is the collection of the three tiles provided, and for each group, we need to see what's the minimal number of additional tiles needed to form any mentsu within that group.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the three possible groups (each group is the three tiles given, but perhaps arranged differently), compute the minimal number of tiles needed to be drawn to form a mentsu.\n\n2. Output the three numbers.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each of the three groups (each group is the three tiles, but perhaps in different order), process each group to find the minimal draws needed.\n\nWait, but the groups are fixed. For example, the three initial tiles form a group, and we have to analyze this group for each possible mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Because for each group, the three tiles can be used in any way. For example, the group is A, B, C. So, any triplet or sequence within these three plus the added tiles.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: for each of the three groups, find the minimal number of tiles to add so that within that group, there exists a mentsu.\n\nThus, the approach is to process each group separately and compute the minimal draws needed for that group.\n\nNow, the question is, for each group, how to compute the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nSo, let's think about how to model",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her hand. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Mentsu Requirements**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n2. **Group Analysis**: For each group of three tiles provided, analyze the possibilities of forming a mentsu by checking all possible triplets and sequences within the group.\n3. **Check for Triplet**: Check if any tile appears at least three times in the group.\n4. **Check for Sequence**: For each suit, check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n5. **Calculate Minimum Draws**: For each group, calculate how many additional tiles are needed to complete a mentsu, considering both triplet and sequence possibilities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_draws(group):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    tiles = group.split()\n    count = defaultdict(int)\n    for t in tiles:\n        count[t] += 1\n\n    # Check for triplet\n    for t in count:\n        if count[t] >= 3:\n            return 0\n\n    # Check for shuntsu\n    suits = defaultdict(list)\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suits[t[1]].append(num)\n    \n    min_add = float('inf')\n    for suit in suits:\n        sorted_nums = sorted(suits[suit])\n        for i in range(len(sorted_nums) - 2):\n            a, b, c = sorted_nums[i], sorted_nums[i+1], sorted_nums[i+2]\n            if b == a + 1 and c == b + 1:\n                continue_sequence = False\n                for j in range(len(sorted_nums)):\n                    if sorted_nums[j] == a:\n                        continue_sequence = True\n                        break\n                if continue_sequence:\n                    # How many tiles are missing\n                    required = [a, a+1, a+2]\n                    current = set(sorted_nums)\n                    needed = []\n                    for r in required:\n                        if r not in current:\n                            needed.append(r)\n                    draws_needed = len(needed)\n                    if draws_needed < min_add:\n                        min_add = draws_needed\n    return min_add\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\ntiles_list = input_line.split()\n\n# For each possible grouping (each of the three tiles as part of a group)\ngroups = []\nfor i in range(3):\n    group = []\n    for j in range(3):\n        if j != i:\n            group.append tiles_list[j]\n    groups.append(' '.join(group))\n\nresults = []\nfor group in groups:\n    results.append(min_draws(group))\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, results)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into individual tiles.\n2. **Group Formation**: For each possible group of three tiles, check if they can form a triplet or a sequence.\n3. **Triplet Check**: Count occurrences of each tile. If any tile appears at least three times, no additional draws are needed.\n4. **Sequence Check**: For each suit, sort the numbers and check for sequences of three consecutive numbers. Calculate the number of additional tiles needed to complete any found sequence.\n5. **Determine Minimum Draws**: Compare the results from both checks and determine the minimum number of draws needed for each group.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu and ensures the minimal number of draws required is found for each group.",
