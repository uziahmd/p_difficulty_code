He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the string is built in a specific way. A gives a string of some 'a's to B, who appends some 'b's. Then C appends some 'c's. The key points are:\n\n1. The final string must consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's.\n2. Each part must be non-empty. So after A and B, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then when C adds 'c's, the count of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\nSo my task is to check if a given string meets these conditions.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the string is in the correct order: all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. If any 'a' comes after a 'b' or 'c', it's invalid. Similarly for 'b's appearing after 'c's.\n\nSecond, I need to count the number of each character. Let's call them count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nThen, the count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b. Also, since the 'c's are added after both 'a's and 'b's, the 'c's can't come before any 'a's or 'b's.\n\nWait, but the initial step is that A has some 'a's, B appends 'b's, making sure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist. So the string after B has both 'a's and 'b's. Then C appends some 'c's, which could be zero? No, wait, the problem says \"some number\", which I think means at least one. Because appending some number implies adding one or more.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". So the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. But also, the count of 'c's can't be zero because they append \"some\" which probably means at least one.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that C appends \"some number of letters 'c'\". So the number could be zero? Or does \"some\" imply at least one? Hmm, the wording isn't clear. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" It's also possible that it equals both.\n\nWait, but the way the string is built, after A and B, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So when C appends 'c's, it's possible that the 'c's are zero? Or no, because the problem says \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". Oh, no, wait, \"some number\" probably includes zero or more. But looking back, in the problem's note, the first example has 'aaabccc' where the 'c's are 3, which is equal to the 'a's (3). So the count_c can be zero? Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, let me think again. The steps are:\n\nA creates a string of 'a's, maybe just one 'a'.\n\nB appends some 'b's. So B's contribution is at least one 'b'.\n\nThen C appends some 'c's. So C's contribution is at least one 'c'? Or can it be zero?\n\nThe problem statement doesn't explicitly say that C appends at least one 'c'. But looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the third example, 'aabc' is the input. Let's see:\n\nThe string is 'aabc' â†’ 'aa' followed by 'bc'. So the counts are a=2, b=1, c=1. So count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So yes.\n\nBut what if C appends zero 'c's? Then the string would have only 'a's and 'b's. But in that case, the 'c's count is zero, which would have to equal either count_a or count_b, which are both at least 1. So zero cannot equal 1. So C must have appended at least one 'c'.\n\nTherefore, count_c must be >=1, and must equal either count_a or count_b.\n\nSo the steps to validate the string S:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form of a+ b+ c+. That is, all a's come first, followed by all b's, then all c's.\n\nIf any other order is found, return NO.\n\n2. Count the number of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by the described process. The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's and then 'c's, with specific conditions on the counts of each character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: Ensure the string is in the correct order, i.e., all 'a's first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's.\n2. **Count Characters**: Calculate the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Check if the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's. Additionally, ensure that each segment (a's, b's, c's) is non-empty.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is in the form a+ b+ c+\nhas_valid_order = True\nfor c in s:\n    if c not in ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n        has_valid_order = False\n        break\nif 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n    has_valid_order = False\n\nif not has_valid_order:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check the order strictly a's followed by b's followed by c's\na_end = 0\nwhile a_end < len(s) and s[a_end] == 'a':\n    a_end += 1\n\nif a_end == 0 or a_end == len(s):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nb_end = a_end\nwhile b_end < len(s) and s[b_end] == 'b':\n    b_end += 1\n\nif b_end == a_end or b_end == len(s):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nc_count = len(s) - b_end\n\na_count = a_end\nb_count = b_end - a_end\n\n# Check if c_count equals a_count or b_count\nif c_count != a_count and c_count != b_count:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code first checks if the string is a valid sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and ending with 'c's. If any other order is found, it immediately returns \"NO\".\n2. **Character Counting**: The code counts the occurrences of 'a's and 'b's up to their respective segments and calculates the count of 'c's.\n3. **Validation**: Finally, it checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If all conditions are met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".",
