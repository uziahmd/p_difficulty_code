The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a certain number of vertices n can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph has specific construction rules. \n\nHmm, let me try to understand the structure. So, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices, where k is greater than 1. Then, each vertex that has only one edge (so those k new ones) must be connected to k more new vertices. This second step has to be done at least once.\n\nWait, right. So the initial structure is a star with the center connected to k leaves. Then, each of those leaves must themselves become centers of their own stars, each adding k new leaves, and this process continues for each new leaf at least once.\n\nSo the snowflake graph is built in layers. The first layer is the center, the second layer is the k children, and then each of them adds their own k children in the third layer. But wait, maybe the process can continue further, adding more layers beyond that.\n\nBut the key point is that the minimal snowflake for k=4 has a certain number of nodes. For example, in the sample input, n=9 is considered, but the output is NO. Hmm, why?\n\nLet me think about the minimal case. Let's take k=2. The minimal snowflake would be:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 node.\n- Layer 1: 2 nodes.\nEach of these two nodes is a child of the center. Since each must have at least one expansion, each of them adds 2 more nodes.\n\nSo layer 2: each of the two nodes adds 2, so 2 * 2 =4 nodes.\nSo total nodes: 1 + 2 + 4 =7.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, in the problem statement, the initial step is connecting the initial node to k new nodes (k>1). Then, each of those k nodes must connect to k new nodes, and this step should be done at least once. So the minimal structure has the initial node, then the k nodes, then each of those adds k nodes. So the total nodes are 1 + k + k*k. Because each of the k nodes adds k children.\n\nSo for k=2: 1+2+4=7 nodes.\n\nSo for n=7, the answer is YES.\n\nLooking back at the sample input: for n=6, the output is NO. Let's see why. Let's compute possible k's.\n\nWait, for n to be possible, it must be equal to 1 + k + k^2, or 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, or more layers.\n\nBecause each expansion step adds another layer. So the minimal structure is 1 +k +k^2. But if after that, each of the leaves also adds k nodes, that's an additional layer, making it 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc.\n\nSo the possible n's are numbers that can be written as 1 + k*(m), where m is a sum of a geometric progression.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is a tree where the root has degree k, each of its children have degree k, except the leaves which have degree 1 before any expansion. But each expansion step adds a new layer of nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is such that the snowflake graph is a rooted tree where the root has exactly k children, each of those children has exactly k children, recursively. But the process stops after some steps, not necessarily just two steps.\n\nWait no, because the process requires that each vertex with only one edge (degree 1) must add k new edges. So it's a process that must be done at least once. So for the minimal case, after the initial step, each of the k children must add k nodes, but then those new nodes are leaves and don't need to add anything unless we go further.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake graph is a tree where all non-root nodes have exactly k children. But no, because the root has k children, each of those has k children, and so on until some depth.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial step is done, then each node with only one edge must do the same step. So for the minimal case, the root has k children, each of which has k children. So the total nodes are 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut what about deeper structures? Like, after adding the second layer, each of those nodes also adds k children. So the total becomes 1 +k +k² +k³, and so on.\n\nSo the possible n values are sums of the form 1 +k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}), where m >= 2. Or wait, maybe it's 1 +k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d}), where d is the depth minus one.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k*(s), where s is the sum of a geometric series starting from 1.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. The initial node contributes 1. Then, the k children contribute 1 each, so k. Then each of those k children must add k children, contributing k². Then each of those k² children must add k children, contributing k³, and so on. But wait, no—because the initial step is done, and then each node that was added in that step must have their own step. So after the first expansion, each of the k nodes adds k children. So the next layer is k² nodes. But those nodes are leaves, so they don't need to add anything unless the process continues beyond that.\n\nSo the snowflake can have any number of layers, including the minimal two. So n can be 1 +k +k², or 1 +k +k² +k³, etc.\n\nBut how do we model the possible n's?\n\nWe need to find if there exists a k>1 and some m ≥2 such that n = 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... +k^{m-2}).\n\nWait, because the initial step is 1 node, then k nodes added (layer 1), then each of those adds k nodes (layer 2), which is k² nodes, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the total number of nodes as 1 + k * (sum_{i=0}^{d} k^i), where d is the depth minus 1.\n\nWait, for example, for the minimal case, d=1 (depth 2, since the root is depth 0?), sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is n = 1 + k * (sum_{i=0}^{d} k^i) ), where d is the number of layers beyond the root. So for the minimal case, d=1: sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, let's test for k=2 and d=1: sum is 1+2+4=7. Which matches the earlier example.\n\nAnother example: for k=3, minimal case is 1+3+9=13. So n=13 is a yes.\n\nIn the sample input, n=13 gives YES.\n\nSo the approach is: for each n, check if it can be expressed as 1 + k * (sum_{i=0}^d k^i ), for some k>1 and d≥1.\n\nWait, but how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nGiven that n can be up to 1e18, and t is up to 1e4, we need an O(1) or O(log n) solution per test case.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible d, check if (n-1) is divisible by a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, n = 1 + k * (sum_{i=0}^d k^i )\n\nSo n-1 = k * (sum_{i=0}^d k^i )\n\nSum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} - 1)/(k-1)\n\nSo n-1 = k * (k^{d+1} - 1)/(k-1 )\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nn-1 = [k^{d+2} -k ]/(k-1 )\n\nHmm, but solving for k in terms of n and d seems challenging.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible d, check if (n-1) can be written as k * (s), where s is a sum of a geometric series of k's up to d terms.\n\nWait, but for each d, we can try to find a k>1 such that s = (k^{d+1}-1)/(k-1), and (n-1) is divisible by k*s.\n\nWait, maybe for each d, we can compute possible k's.\n\nBut what are the possible values of d?\n\nWell, for d=1: sum is 1 +k.\n\nSo n-1 =k*(1+k) =k(k+1). So n-1 must be equal to k(k+1). So for d=1, we can check if (n-1) is a product of two consecutive integers, i.e., k and k+1.\n\nFor d=2: sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nn-1 =k*(1 +k +k² )=k*(k² +k +1). So n-1 must be divisible by k*(k² +k +1).\n\nSimilarly, for d=3: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³. So n-1 =k*(k^3 +k² +k +1) =k*(k+1)(k² +1).\n\nWait, but trying all possible d's up to log_k(n) is not feasible for large d. So perhaps the maximum possible d is small, like up to 60, because k^d grows exponentially.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate over possible d from 1 to, say, 60, and for each d, check if (n-1) is divisible by s = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). Then, for each d, we can try to find a k>1 such that k divides (n-1)/s.\n\nWait, but how to find k for a given d.\n\nLet me think differently. For each possible d, compute the possible s, and see if (n-1) is divisible by s multiplied by some k.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d, the sum s is known. So for d=1, s =1 +k. For d=2, s=1 +k +k², etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to precompute possible d's and for each d, compute s, and then see if (n-1) is divisible by s multiplied by some k.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d from 1 to 60, compute s = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), and see if (n-1) is a multiple of s multiplied by k.\n\nBut that's still unclear.\n\nAlternative plan: For each possible d (starting from 1 to, say, 60), compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d.\n\nThen, for (n-1) to be equal to k*s, we can write:\n\n(n-1) / s = k.\n\nSince k must be an integer >1, for each d, compute s, and check if (n-1) is divisible by s, and the quotient is k>1.\n\nBut for each d, how do we compute s without knowing k?\n\nWait, but s is a function of k and d. So for a given d, s is a function that depends on k. So this seems tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given d, we can express (n-1) as k * s, and s is (k^{d+1} - 1)/(k-1). So substituting k into the equation, we get:\n\n(n-1) = k * (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(n-1) * (k-1) = k^{d+2} -k\n\nRearranged:\n\nk^{d+2} -k - (n-1)(k-1) =0\n\nHmm, but solving this for k is difficult, especially for large d and n.\n\nAlternative idea: For each d, try to find a k>1 such that (n-1) is divisible by s, where s is the sum for that d and k.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For each d, compute s for possible k's and see if (n-1) is divisible by s * k.\n\nBut this might not be efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps we can try for each possible d, compute the sum s for varying k, but that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each d, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d. Then, (n-1) must be equal to k * s. So, for each d, we can compute s = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), and then set (n-1) = k * s.\n\nBut again, this is a bit circular.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given d, we can compute the maximum possible k. For example, for d=1, s =1 +k. So (n-1) must be divisible by k*(k+1). So k and k+1 are consecutive integers, so (n-1) must be a product of two consecutive integers.\n\nThis is similar to checking if (n-1) is a pronic number, i.e., n-1 = k(k+1). So for d=1, we can compute k by taking the square root of (n-1), and check if it's an integer, and that k+1 is the next integer.\n\nSo for d=1, it's manageable.\n\nFor d=2, sum is 1 +k +k². So (n-1) must be equal to k*(k² +k +1). So for each possible k, compute k*(k² +k +1) and see if it equals n-1.\n\nBut for large n, this could be time-consuming.\n\nWait, but for each d, the maximum possible k is such that k^(d+1) <= something.\n\nSo perhaps for each d, we can compute an upper bound for k, and then iterate k from 2 upwards until that bound, checking if (n-1) equals k*s.\n\nBut for d=60, even for k=2, the sum s would be enormous. So for each d, the maximum possible k is limited.\n\nBut for t=1e4 and d=60, it's 6e5 operations, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nIf n < 3: definitely NO.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for each d from 1 to 60:\n\nCompute s = sum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1)\n\nCheck if (n-1) is divisible by s, and the quotient is k>1.\n\nBut how to compute s for varying k and d?\n\nWait, perhaps for a fixed d, and for varying k, compute s and see if (n-1) is divisible by k*s.\n\nBut this is computationally expensive because k can vary a lot.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each d, find the possible k by binary search.\n\nBecause for each d, s increases as k increases.\n\nSo for a given d, we can perform binary search on k.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for a given d, the sum s = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d. So for k>1, s is strictly increasing as k increases.\n\nSo for a given d and (n-1), we can compute the maximum possible k that could satisfy (n-1) = k * s.\n\nSo for each d, we can perform binary search on k.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n\nFor each d in 1..60:\n\nlow =2, high= some upper limit (like sqrt(n-1)).\n\nCompute mid = (low + high)/2.\n\nCompute s = (mid^{d+1} -1)/(mid -1). But for large d and mid, mid^{d+1} may exceed 64-bit integers, leading to overflow.\n\nSo this approach may not be feasible for large d.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of computing s directly, perhaps find for each d, the possible k by considering that s must divide (n-1).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for each d, we can compute s = sum_{i=0}^d k^i. We can note that for a given d, s must be a divisor of (n-1). So for each d, we can factorize (n-1), and see if any of the divisors is of the form s for some k>1.\n\nBut factorizing very large numbers (up to 1e18) is time-consuming for each test case, especially with t=1e4.\n\nSo perhaps another way is needed.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each d, compute the possible s for k=2,3,4,... up to a certain limit, and see if s divides (n-1). But again, for large d, s can be big quickly.\n\nWait, but perhaps for small d, the maximum k is manageable. For example, for d=1, k can be up to sqrt(n-1). For d=2, k can be up to cube root of (n-1), etc.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nIf n < 3: output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute m = n-1.\n\nFor each d in 1 to 60:\n\n   Compute s_max = m // 2 (since k>1, s must be at least 3)\n\n   For k in 2 to sqrt(m):\n\n      compute s = sum_{i=0}^d k^i\n\n      if s > m: break\n\n      if m % s ==0:\n\n          q = m // s\n\n          if q ==k:\n\n              return YES\n\nSo, for each d, loop through possible k's, compute s, and check if m is divisible by s, and q equals k.\n\nBut for larger d, this will take longer.\n\nWait, but for d=60, k=2: s = 2^61 -1 which is about 2e18, which for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 1e18. So for d=60, s can be up to 1e18, which makes k=2 the only possible candidate.\n\nSo perhaps the code can be optimized by capping the maximum d to a reasonable number, say 60.\n\nBut with t=1e4 and d=60, it's 6e5 iterations, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, for each d, and for each k in 2..sqrt(m), it's O(d) per iteration. So for d=60, each k takes 60 steps, which is 6e5 *60=3.6e7 operations, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, another Idea: For each possible d, the sum s must be a divisor of m. So for each d, compute s = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). We can represent this as a function and see if for any k>1, s divides m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each d, we can compute the minimal possible s when k=2, and the maximal possible s when k is such that s is just less than m.\n\nWait, but perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nFor each d from 1 to 60:\n\n   Compute the minimal s (k=2): s_min = 2^{d+1} -1.\n\n   Compute the maximal possible k such that s = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) ≤ m.\n\n   For k starting from 2, compute s and check if s divides m, and m/s ==k.\n\nBut this can be done using binary search for k in [2, ... , max_k], where max_k is determined based on d and m.\n\nSo, for each d:\n\n   low =2, high= ?\n\n   What is the maximum possible k for a given d?\n\n   For s = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) ≤ m.\n\n   For k=2: s = 2^{d+1}-1.\n\n   For k=3: s = (3^{d+1} -1)/2.\n\n   And so on.\n\nBut for large d, even k=2 may result in s larger than m.\n\nSo for each d, we can check if s for k=2 is larger than m. If yes, skip this d.\n\nElse, perform binary search for k between 2 and some upper limit.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d:\n\nCompute s for k=2. If s > m, then no possible k for this d.\n\nElse, perform binary search for k in [2, ... , some upper limit].\n\nBut how to compute the upper limit?\n\nWe can compute the maximum possible k such that s <= m.\n\nWe can approximate s ≈ k^{d} (since s is roughly k^{d+1}/(k-1) → for large k, it's about k^{d} *k/(k-1) → about k^{d} *1).\n\nSo for s ≈k^d ≤ m → k ≤ m^{1/d}.\n\nSo the upper limit can be m^{1/(d+1)}, but perhaps for binary search, it's better to set a higher upper limit, like m.\n\nBut for binary search, even with high=1e9, for each test case, it's manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nif n < 3: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\nm = n-1\n\nfor d in 1 to 60:\n\n   compute s for k=2. If s > m, continue to next d.\n\n   else:\n\n       perform binary search for k in [2, ... , m]\n\n       for each mid in binary search:\n\n           compute s = sum_{i=0}^d mid^i\n\n           if s > m: high = mid -1\n\n           else: check if m is divisible by s.\n\n               if yes: check if m/s == mid.\n\n                   if yes: return YES.\n\nSo, for each d, perform a binary search for k.\n\nBut computing s for a given mid and d can be done using a loop, but for d=60, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but for mid=1e9 and d=60, mid^d is 1e540, which is way beyond 64 bits. So in Python, it can handle big integers, but computation is time-consuming.\n\nWait, but for mid=2, d=60, sum is 2^61 -1. For n=1e18, m=1e18-1.\n\nSo 2^61 is about 2e18, which is larger than m. So for d=60, when mid=2, s=2^61-1 is about 2e18, which is larger than m=1e18.\n\nSo for d=60, when m=1e18, the maximum possible k is 1, but since k>1, it's invalid.\n\nSo for d=60, the s for k=2 is 2^61-1 which is larger than 1e18. So for higher d's, we can skip early.\n\nThus, for each d, the maximum possible k is small.\n\nSo the binary search for k can be optimized.\n\nWait, but perhaps the binary search can be avoided, and instead, we can try k from 2 upwards until s exceeds m.\n\nBecause for a given d, s increases as k increases.\n\nSo for each d:\n\n   current_sum =0\n\n   for k in 2,3,...:\n\n       current_sum += k^d\n\n       if current_sum > m: break\n\n       if current_sum == m: check if it's valid.\n\n       else: continue.\n\nWait, but no, because the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d.\n\nWait, for a given d, the sum s is computed as:\n\ns = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1)\n\nSo for each d, we can compute s for k=2,3,4,... and check if s divides m, and m/s =k.\n\nBut for larger d's, even k=2 may make s too big.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nfor each d from 1 to 60:\n\n   compute s for k=2.\n\n   if s > m: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n       for k in 2,3,... until s <=m:\n\n           compute s = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1)\n\n           if s > m: break\n\n           if m % s ==0:\n\n               q = m // s\n\n               if q ==k:\n\n                   return YES.\n\nBut for each d, the loop for k can be done quickly because for large d, k=2 may already make s bigger than m.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute s efficiently for various k and d.\n\nSo, implementing this in Python:\n\nBut how to compute s for a given k and d.\n\nWe can compute it iteratively:\n\ndef compute_s(k, d):\n    s = 0\n    for i in range(d+1):\n        s += k**i\n    return s\n\nBut for k=2 and d=60, this is 61 exponentiations and additions, which is manageable.\n\nBut for k=1e9 and d=60, this is not feasible.\n\nBut in practice, since for each d, the k's are small, this won't be a problem.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n <3: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\nm =n-1\n\nfor d in 1 to 60:\n\n   # compute s for k=2\n\n   s_k2 = compute_s(2, d)\n\n   if s_k2 > m:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       # try k=2\n\n       if m % s_k2 ==0:\n\n           q = m // s_k2\n\n           if q ==2:\n\n               print YES and proceed.\n\n       # now try other k's.\n\n       # compute for k=3,4,...\n\n       current_sum = compute_s(3, d)\n\n       while True:\n\n           if current_sum > m:\n\n               break\n\n           if m % current_sum ==0:\n\n               q = m // current_sum\n\n               if q ==3:\n\n                   print YES and proceed.\n\n           # increase k\n\n           k +=1\n\n           current_sum += k**(d+1) -1 // (k-1) - (k-1)^(d+1)/(k-2) ?\n\n           Wait, no. That's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps for the next k, the sum s increases by (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) - ((k-1)^{d+1} -1)/(k-2). But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since s for k+1 is s_prev + (k+1)^d + ... ? No, because the sum is 1 + (k+1) + (k+1)^2 + ... + (k+1)^d.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to re-calculate s for each k from scratch.\n\nBut for each k, the sum s is the sum from i=0 to d of k^i.\n\nWhich is a geometric series.\n\nSo for a given k and d, s can be computed as (k^{d+1} -1) // (k-1), provided k !=1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in code, for each d:\n\nmax_k = ?\n\nWe can precompute for each d:\n\n   for k in 2,3,...:\n\n       s = (k^{d+1} -1) // (k-1)\n\n       if s > m: break\n\n       if m % s ==0:\n\n           q = m // s\n\n           if q ==k:\n\n               return YES.\n\nBut in code, this would involve loops within loops, but perhaps manageable.\n\nBut for large d, k=2 may already make s larger than m.\n\nSo, for each d, we can start with k=2, compute s, and if s is <=m, proceed.\n\nElse, move to next d.\n\nSo, putting this into code:\n\nImplement a helper function that, given k and d, returns the sum s.\n\nBut how to compute k^{d+1}? For d up to 60, and k up to say 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nBut for k=1e9 and d=60, k^{d+1} is way beyond 1e18, so s would be larger than m, which is 1e18.\n\nSo for each d, the maximum k is bounded.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nt = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n <3:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    m = n-1\n\n    found = False\n\n    for d in range(1, 61):\n\n        # Try k=2 first\n\n        k =2\n\n        s = (k ** (d+1) -1) // (k-1)\n\n        if s > m:\n\n            continue\n\n        if m % s ==0:\n\n            q = m // s\n\n            if q ==k:\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n        # Now try k=3,4,...\n\n        # Find the maximum possible k for this d.\n\n        # Since s increases with k, we can loop until s exceeds m.\n\n        # Starting from k=3.\n\n        k =3\n\n        while True:\n\n            s = (k ** (d+1) -1) // (k-1)\n\n            if s > m:\n\n                break\n\n            if m % s ==0:\n\n                q = m // s\n\n                if q ==k:\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n            # increment k\n\n            k +=1\n\n    print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the above code, for each d, it's trying k=2, then k=3,4,... until s>m. But for d=60 and k=3, s is (3^61 -1)/2, which is around 3^61/2, which is way larger than 1e18. So the loop for k=3 would immediately break.\n\nSo this is manageable.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\nLet's test for n=6.\n\nn=6: m=5.\n\nCheck d=1:\n\ns for k=2 is (2^2-1)/(2-1)=3.\n\n3<=5.\n\n5%3=2 !=0.\n\nThen, try k=3:\n\ns=(3^2-1)/(3-1)= (9-1)/2=4.\n\n4<=5.\n\n5%4=1 !=0.\n\nk=4: s=(16-1)/3=5.\n\n5<=5.\n\n5%5=0.\n\nq=5//5=1 !=4.\n\nSo no.\n\nSo for d=1, nothing.\n\nd=2:\n\ns for k=2: (8-1)/1=7>5: no.\n\nNo k.\n\nSo overall, for n=6, output is NO.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, n=6 outputs NO.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: for n=6, m=5.\n\nIs there any k and d where 5 = k * s?\n\nFor d=2, k=2: s=7>5.\n\nNo.\n\nd=1:\n\nk=2: s=3. 5 mod 3=2. q=5/3 is not 2.\n\nk=3: s=4. 5 mod4=1. q=1 not 3.\n\nk=4: s=5. q=1 !=4.\n\nd=3:\n\ns for k=2: (16-1)/1=15>5.\n\nNo.\n\nSo for n=6, no.\n\nSo sample is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=13.\n\nm=12.\n\nCheck d=1:\n\nk=2: s=3. 12 mod3=0. q=4.\n\nIs q==2?

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific way, starting with one vertex and expanding symmetrically in layers. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers. Each vertex with only one edge (degree 1) must add \\( k \\) new vertices, where \\( k > 1 \\). This process continues for each new vertex at least once.\n2. **Key Insight**: The total number of vertices in a snowflake graph can be expressed as a sum of a geometric series. For each possible depth \\( d \\), we need to check if the number of vertices \\( n \\) can be written in the form \\( 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d \\).\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each test case, we iterate over possible depths \\( d \\) from 1 to 60. For each depth, we compute the sum of the geometric series and check if it matches the required form.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    m = n - 1\n    for d in range(1, 61):\n        # Check for k=2\n        k = 2\n        s = (k ** (d + 1) - 1) // (k - 1)\n        if s <= m:\n            if m % s == 0:\n                q = m // s\n                if q == k:\n                    return True\n        # Now try higher k's\n        current_k = 3\n        while True:\n            s = (current_k ** (d + 1) - 1) // (current_k - 1)\n            if s > m:\n                break\n            if m % s == 0:\n                q = m // s\n                if q == current_k:\n                    return True\n            current_k += 1\n    return False\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    if is_snowflake(n):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases.\n2. **Check for Small Values**: If \\( n \\) is less than 3, it cannot form a snowflake graph.\n3. **Iterate Over Depths**: For each possible depth \\( d \\) from 1 to 60, compute the sum of the geometric series for varying values of \\( k \\).\n4. **Check Validity**: For each computed sum, check if it divides \\( n-1 \\) exactly and if the quotient equals \\( k \\). If true, \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph.\n5. **Output Result**: Print \"YES\" if a valid configuration is found, otherwise print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations using properties of geometric series and ensures that the solution handles large values of \\( n \\) up to \\( 10^{18} \\).",
