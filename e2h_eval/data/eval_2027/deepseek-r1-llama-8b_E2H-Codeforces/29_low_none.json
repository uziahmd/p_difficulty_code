Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then there are multiple queries where each query is like \"di → ti\". For each digit di in the current string, replace it with the substring ti. After all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored when interpreting the number, but wait, no—wait, the note says that leading zeroes are not removed after replacement. Oh right, because in the example, the third sample input ends up as '777', but the actual string is '777' because the replacements don't introduce leading zeros unless they're part of the substitution.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The note says: Note that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample). So for example, if the substitution leads to leading zeros, they are kept. But when calculating the number, the leading zeros are ignored. So the string remains as it is, but when converting to a number, any leading zeros are stripped before calculation.\n\nBut wait, no. The problem statement says: when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore the leading zeros. Also, if s is empty, treat it as zero. So for example, after substitutions, the string might start with multiple zeros, but when converted into a number, those are ignored.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. Process each query in order.\n3. For each query, replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n4. After all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute its remainder modulo 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model the substitutions efficiently, especially since the initial string can be up to 105 characters, and each substitution can affect many digits.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 105, and each substitution can be O(length of s) time, the total operations are manageable within Python's constraints.\n\nBut wait, each substitution could potentially change the string length. For example, replacing a single digit with a longer or shorter substring. So processing each substitution correctly is essential.\n\nLet me think about how to model the substitution process.\n\nOne approach is to represent the string as a list, so that substitutions can be done efficiently. Each substitution is done by scanning the string and replacing every occurrence of di with ti. But since substitutions are processed in order, each step depends on the previous.\n\nBut for n up to 105, and each substitution possibly taking O(len(s)) time, it's feasible.\n\nWait, but the queries can overwrite each other. For example, if the first query replaces '2' with '00', and the second replaces '0' with '7', then any '0's in the string after the first substitution will be replaced again by the second query.\n\nSo, the order of processing is crucial.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n\n- For each query in order:\n   - di is a single character (digit).\n   - ti is a string which may be empty or contain any digits.\n   - Replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n\nAfter all substitutions, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros, and output mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the substitution is done for all digits di in the string at once? Or is it for each digit in the string during the substitution step?\n\nYes, for each substitution step, all occurrences of di are replaced with ti.\n\nSo, for example, if the string is '123', and the query is '1→12', then the new string becomes '213' (wait, no: because '1' is replaced by '12'. So '123' becomes '12' followed by '23' → '1223'? Wait no: original '123' → '1' is replaced by '12', '2' remains, '3' remains. So the result is '1223'.\n\nSo, the substitution is done for each occurrence of di in the string, all at once.\n\nSo, for processing each query, the steps are:\n\nLoop through each character in the current string, and for each character, if it equals di, replace it with ti. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut this approach would require building a new string for each substitution, because the ti could be of any length, and multiple di's can be in the string.\n\nWait, no. Because, for each substitution, all di's are replaced in one go. So, for each substitution step, we can process the string from left to right, and build a new string by appending ti for each di encountered,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1,000,000,007. The substitutions are performed in the given order, and each substitution replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with a given substring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the initial string and the list of substitution queries.\n2. **Process Queries:** For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Compute Result:** After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a numeric value, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo 1,000,000,007.\n\nThe key steps involve efficiently handling each substitution and ensuring that the resulting string is correctly processed after all substitutions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\n# Now compute the number\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Remove leading zeros\n    s = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not s:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(s) % MOD\n        print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input.\n2. **Processing Each Query:** Each query is processed by splitting it into the digit to replace (`di`) and the substring to substitute (`ti`). The current string is updated by replacing all occurrences of `di` with `ti`.\n3. **Handling Substitutions:** Each substitution is done in place, ensuring that all previous substitutions are respected.\n4. **Computing the Result:** After all substitutions, the resulting string is converted into an integer. Leading zeros are removed before conversion to ensure the correct numeric value is computed. The result is then taken modulo 1,000,000,007 to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is handled correctly and efficiently, even for the maximum constraints, providing the correct result in a timely manner.",
