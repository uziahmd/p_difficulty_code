The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot. My task is to calculate how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm, right. So each round, both choose their move based on their respective sequences. The key is that each uses a cyclic sequence: for example, if A is \"RPS\", then the moves go R, P, S, R, P, S, etc. Similarly for B.\n\nSo for each round i (from 0 to n-1), we need to determine who wins, and increment the corresponding counter.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So efficiency is important. We need an approach that doesn't require checking each round in O(1) time, but perhaps precomputing some cycles or using modulo operations.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read strings A and B.\n3. For each round i (0-based?), compute the current move of each player.\n4. Determine the winner of that round.\n5. Update the counters for the red spots accordingly.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 2e5 and each string can be up to 1000 characters, the total number of operations would be manageable since 2e5 * 2 is 4e5, which is acceptable.\n\nWait, no, for each round, we can compute the current move by taking the i mod m for A, and i mod k for B. That makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the length of A (m) and B (k).\n- For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   - Get A's move: A[i % m]\n   - Get B's move: B[j % k]\n   - Determine who loses.\n   - Increment the respective counter.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nNow, the main part is determining the outcome of each round. Let's think about the rules:\n\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beat Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nIf both choose the same, it's a draw.\n\nSo for each pair of moves (a, b), decide who wins.\n\nLet me create a helper function or a lookup table to quickly determine the winner.\n\nAlternatively, in code, for each a and b, we can compare:\n\nIf a == b: no one gains a point.\nElse:\n   If (a, b) is a winning pair, then the first player (Nikephoros) loses, so Polycarpus gets a point.\n   Else, Nikephoros gets a point.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in each round, the winner is determined. The loser is the one getting a red spot. So if a beats b, then b is the loser (so Polycarpus, assuming he is the one playing b). Or wait, wait:\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the winner gives the loser a pinch. So if a beats b, then the player who played a is the winner, and the other is the loser.\n\nSo for each round:\n\nIf a beats b → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets a red spot.\nIf b beats a → Polycarpus wins → Nikephoros gets a red spot.\nElse → no red spots.\n\nWait no, wait the problem says: the winner gives the loser a pinch. So the loser is the one who gets the red spot.\n\nSo, in a round where a beats b: the winner is Nikephoros (since he played a), so Polycarpus (the loser) gets a point.\n\nIn a round where b beats a: Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros gets a point.\n\nIf they draw, no one gets a point.\n\nSo for each round, we need to see whether a beats b or not.\n\nSo, how do I represent this?\n\nI can represent the moves as 'R', 'S', 'P'.\n\nWe can write a function that takes a and b and returns True if a beats b, False otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible pair, precompute who wins.\n\nAnother approach is to map each move to its beating move.\n\nLike:\n\nrock beats scissors → 'R' beats 'S'\nscissors beats paper → 'S' beats 'P'\npaper beats rock → 'P' beats 'R'\n\nSo, for a given a, if b is the one that a beats, then a beats b.\n\nSo, for each a in A and b in B:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') → a beats b → Polycarpus loses, so his count increases.\nif (a == 'S' and b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games. Each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B` for both players.\n2. **Cyclic Move Calculation**: For each round, determine the move of each player using their respective sequences cyclically. This means using modulo operations to cycle through the sequences repeatedly.\n3. **Determine the Winner**: For each pair of moves from players A and B, determine the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors. If the moves are the same, it's a draw with no red spots. Otherwise, the player with the winning move gives the other player a red spot.\n4. **Count Red Spots**: Maintain counters for the red spots of both players and update them based on the outcome of each round.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\ncount_Nikephoros = 0\ncount_Polycarpus = 0\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    \n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    # Determine who loses (who has the losing move)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        count_Polycarpus += 1\n    else:\n        count_Nikephoros += 1\n\nprint(count_Nikephoros, count_Polycarpus)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Cyclic Move Calculation**: Using modulo operations (`i % m` for player A and `i % k` for player B), we cycle through their sequences efficiently.\n- **Determine the Winner**: For each round, we check if the move of player A beats the move of player B. If it does, player B gets a red spot. Conversely, if player B's move beats player A's, player A gets a red spot.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 200,000 rounds with constant time checks for each round, ensuring optimal performance.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly count the red spots for each player based on the cyclic nature of their moves and the rules of the game.",
