Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about candles and figuring out how many hours they can burn for. The process goes like this: each candle burns for an hour and then goes out. But Vasily is smart because he can take 'b' number of burned-out candles and make a new one. So the question is, what's the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let's think about the example given. For instance, when a is 4 and b is 2, the output is 7. How does that work? \n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Now he has 4 stubs. He can exchange them for 4/2 = 2 new candles. Burning those adds 2 more hours, making total 6. Now he has 2 stubs left from these. But wait, 2 is equal to b, so he can make another candle. That's one more hour, bringing the total to 7. Oh right, because after burning the two candles, he gets 2 more stubs, which again give him one candle, adding another hour. Wait, no—wait, wait. Let me recount:\n\nInitial 4 burn → 4 hours. Then 4 stubs → 2 new, which gives 2 hours (total 6). Now he has 2 stubs from those 2 candles. So he can make 1 new candle, burn it for 1 hour (total 7), and now he has 1 stub. But 1 is less than b=2, so he can't make any more. So yeah, 7.\n\nAnother example: 6 3. The output is 8. Let's see: initial 6 → 6 hours, 6 stubs. Exchange for 2 new candles (since 6/3=2). Burn them for 2 → total 8. Now he has 2 stubs, but 2 is less than 3, so nothing more. So 8 is correct.\n\nSo the approach is to calculate how many times we can recycle the stubs into new candles, each time adding the number of new candles to the total hours.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Start with 'a' candles. Each burns for 1 hour, so add 'a' to the total.\n2. Collect 'a' stubs.\n3. While the number of stubs is >= b:\n   a. Convert stubs into new candles: total_stubs // b\n   b. Add that number to the total hours.\n   c. The new stubs are the remainder plus the new candles burned (so, after converting, you have (total_stubs % b) + (new_candles) stubs).\n   d. Repeat until stubs < b.\n\nWait, let me model this with variables.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\ntotal_hours = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    current_stubs = current_stubs % b + new_candles\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each new candle contributes 1 hour, and when they burn, they produce a stub each.\n\nSo in code, we can implement this loop.\n\nLet's test this logic with the first example.\n\nExample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours =4\ncurrent_stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n4 >=2 → new_candles=2. total becomes 6. current_stubs=4%2=0 + 2=2.\n\nNext iteration: 2 >=2 → new_candles=1. total 7. current_stubs=0+1=1.\n\nNow, 1<2 → loop ends.\n\nTotal is 7.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, stubs=6.\n\n6 >=3 → new=2, total 8. stubs=6%3=0 +2=2.\n\n2 <3 → done. So 8.\n\nWhat about a=5, b=5.\n\nInitial: 5→5 hours, stubs=5.\n\n5>=5 → new=1, total 6. stubs=0 +1=1.\n\nNo more.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=3.\n\nStubs start at 10.\n\n10//3=3, add 3 → total 13. stubs: 10%3=1 +3=4.\n\n4 >=3 → 1 new, total 14. stubs:4%3=1 +1=2.\n\n2<3 → done. So 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should follow this logic.\n\nSo in Python, the steps are:\n\nRead a and b from input. Split the input line into two",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can recycle burned-out candles into new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`. Each candle burns for exactly 1 hour.\n2. **Recycling Process**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. Use these stubs to create new candles by converting `b` stubs into one new candle.\n3. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Continue recycling until the number of stubs is less than `b`. For each successful conversion, add the number of new candles created to the total hours and update the stub count accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` and `b`, which are read and converted into integers.\n2. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` is burned, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Recycling Loop**: Using a loop, we repeatedly convert stubs into new candles as long as there are enough stubs (`>= b`). Each iteration calculates how many new candles can be made, adds this to the total hours, and updates the stub count to reflect the new stubs from the newly burned candles and any leftover stubs from the conversion.\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when the number of stubs is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made. The total hours accumulated at this point is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by simulating the recycling process step-by-step, ensuring all possible conversions are considered.",
