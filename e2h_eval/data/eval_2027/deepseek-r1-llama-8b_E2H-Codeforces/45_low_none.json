There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, so for example, when n=2, there's only one game, so the output is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games: first against someone, then against another. But wait, how does that work exactly?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So the total number of games is always n-1 because each game reduces the count by one.\n\nBut we're not just counting all the games; we need the maximum number that the winner could have participated in. The winner must win each game they play, and each opponent they face must have a similar number of games played before facing them.\n\nSo, what's the pattern here? Maybe the maximum number of games is determined by the Fibonacci sequence. Because each time the winner plays, the opponent must have played either the same number or one less than the winner's current count.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each game they play must be against someone who has played either k-1 or k-2 games before. Because for their previous games, their opponents must have had similar counts.\n\nThis seems like a problem where the maximum number of games is the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, maybe. Let me test some examples.\n\nTake n=4: the output is 2. Wait, according to the sample, yes. So why is that?\n\nBecause the winner can play two games. Like, in the first round, he plays someone (game 1), then in the second round, he plays another (game 2). But how do the others fit in? Oh right, the others are arranged in such a way that after the initial rounds, the winner can keep playing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest m where the (m+1)th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n. Or perhaps it's the largest m such that Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nWait, let's think about Fibonacci numbers. The sequence starts as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. So for n=2, the maximum is 1. For n=3, it's 2. For n=4, 2 as well. For n=5, it's 3. Because 1+2=3, but 3 is part of the Fib sequence.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games is the largest m such that Fib(m+2) ≤ n.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor m=1: Fib(3)=2. So when n=2, it's okay.\nFor m=2: Fib(4)=3. So when n=3, m=2.\nFor m=3: Fib(5)=5. So when n=5, m=3.\nFor m=4: Fib(6)=8. So when n=8, m=4.\n\nSo, the idea is that the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest m where Fib(m+2) is ≤n, then the maximum games is m.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Generate Fibonacci numbers until we reach a number larger than n.\n2. Keep track of the largest m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n3. Return m.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: n=2.\n\nFibonacci numbers:\nF(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, etc.\n\nWe look for the largest m where F(m+2) ≤2.\n\nLooking:\n\nm=0: F(2)=1 ≤2 → yes.\nm=1: F(3)=2 ≤2 → yes.\nm=2: F(4)=3>2 → no.\n\nSo the maximum m is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=10.\n\nWhat is the maximum m?\n\nLet's compute Fib numbers up to 10.\n\nF(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13.\n\nSo looking for m where F(m+2) ≤10.\n\nCheck m=3: F(5)=5 ≤10 → yes.\nm=4: F(6",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the problem can be approached using the Fibonacci sequence. The maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number such that it is less than or equal to the total number of players, `n`. This is because each game the winner plays must be against an opponent who has either played the same number of games or one fewer game than the winner, which aligns with the Fibonacci sequence structure.\n\n1. **Generate Fibonacci Sequence**: We generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed the given number of players, `n`.\n2. **Find the Maximum Valid m**: Track the largest value `m` such that the (m+2)th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_fib > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_fib)\n    # Find the largest m where fib[m+2] <= n\n    for m in range(len(fib)-2, -1, -1):\n        if fib[m+2] <= n:\n            return m\n    return 0\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Generation**: We start generating Fibonacci numbers from the third term onwards. Each new term is the sum of the previous two terms.\n2. **Check Against n**: For each generated Fibonacci number, we check if it exceeds `n`. If it does, we stop the generation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: We iterate backwards through the generated Fibonacci sequence to find the largest `m` such that the (m+2)th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`. This gives us the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 1018`.",
