After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this competitive programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means that no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to find which student has the maximum mark for that subject. Then, count how many students are the best in at least one subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the input. The input has n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m characters.\n\n2. For each subject, determine the maximum mark among all students. Then, for each student, check if their mark in that subject equals the maximum. If yes, then this student is the best for that subject.\n\n3. For each student, check across all subjects whether they are the best in any of them. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nHow to approach this in code?\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The first line gives n and m. Then, there are n lines, each with m characters representing the grades.\n\nWait, each line represents a student's grades for each subject. So for each student, their row is a string like \"223\" which means subject 1: 2, subject 2: 2, subject 3:3.\n\nI need to process each subject separately. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), I need to find the maximum value across all students' j-th character.\n\nOnce I have the max for each subject, I can create a list indicating for each student whether they are the best in each subject.\n\nFor example, for each subject j:\n- Find the maximum mark among all students.\n- Then, for each student i, if their j-th mark is equal to the max, mark that student as a 'subject leader' for j.\n\nOnce I have for each student, the set of subjects where they are leaders, I just need to check if any of these sets is non-empty. The count of such students is the answer.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps in code:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read n strings, each of length m.\n- For each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n   - Iterate through all students, collect their j-th mark as integer.\n   - Find the maximum value for this j.\n   - Record for each student if their j-th mark equals this max.\n- For each student, check if they have at least one 'yes' in their subject leadership.\n- Count the number of such students.\n\nHow to represent this? Maybe for each subject j, create a list (or a dictionary) that says which students are leaders for j.\n\nAlternatively, for each student, track for each subject if they are the best. But since m can be up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nLet's plan data structures:\n\n- subjects_max: a list of m elements. Each element is the maximum mark for the corresponding subject.\n- student_best: a list of lists. student_best[i] is a list of booleans indicating whether student i is the best in each subject.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is:\n\nFor each subject j:\n   find max_j = max of all students' j-th mark\n   create a list for j, where each entry is True if that student's j-th mark == max_j\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of the j positions in their row is True.\n\nBut storing this per subject might take some space, but for n and m up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nWait, another approach: for each subject j, keep a variable indicating the current maximum. Then, for each student, compare their j-th mark against this maximum. If it's higher, update the maximum and note that this student is not a best for j. Wait, no, because multiple students can have the same maximum.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject j, find all students who have the maximum mark. Then, for each student, if they are in this set for any j, they are successful.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nInitialize a 2D array (n x m) where each cell is True if the student is the best in that subject.\n\nFor each subject j from 0 to m-1:\n   max_mark = -1\n   best_students = []\n   for each student i from 0 to n-1:\n       mark = int(student_data[i][j])\n       if mark > max_mark:\n           max_mark = mark\n           best_students = [i]\n       elif mark == max_mark:\n           best_students.append(i)\n   for each student in best_students:\n       student_best[i][j] = True\n\nOnce this is done for all subjects, for each student, if any of the m entries in student_best[i] is True, count them.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nThe first line is two integers, n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines. Each line is a string of m characters. For each line, we can store it as a list or just process it directly.\n\nWait, perhaps each student's data can be stored as a list of characters, or as a list of integers.\n\nProcessing each subject j: for each student, the j-th character is their mark.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    students.append(s)\n\nThen, for each j in 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_mark = -1\nbest_for_j = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    mark = int(students[i][j])\n    if mark > max_mark:\n        max_mark = mark\n        best_for_j = [i]\n    elif mark == max_mark:\n        best_for_j.append(i)\n\nThen, for each i in best_for_j, we mark that student i is a best in subject j.\n\nWe can represent this with a 2D array, say, is_best = [[False for _ in range(m)] for __ in range(n)]\n\nWait, perhaps better to create a list of sets. For each student, a set of subjects where they are the best.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to precompute for each subject which students are best, and then for each student, check across all subjects.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject j, we can collect the indices of the students who are best in j, and then for each such student, add j to their set.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to loop through each subject, find the best students, and then for each best student, increment their count if they haven't been counted before.\n\nWait, but that's not straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: for each student, track whether they have been marked as best in any subject. Once a student is found to be best in any subject, they are counted as successful and we don't need to check further.\n\nBut that's not efficient because for each subject, you'd have to scan all students again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first approach is manageable.\n\nSo, let's proceed with the following steps:\n\n- Initialize a list of lists, is_best, where is_best[i][j] is True if student i is the best in subject j.\n\n- For each subject j:\n   find all students who have the maximum mark in j.\n   for each such student i, set is_best[i][j] = True.\n\nThen, for each student i, check if any of is_best[i][j] is True for any j. If yes, count them.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nInitialize is_best as a list of n lists, each with m False values.\n\nThen, for each j in 0..m-1:\n\n   current_max = -1\n   current_best = []\n   for i in 0..n-1:\n       mark = int(students[i][j])\n       if mark > current_max:\n           current_max = mark\n           current_best = [i]\n       elif mark == current_max:\n           current_best.append(i)\n   for i in current_best:\n       is_best[i][j] = True\n\nOnce this is done, for each student i, check if any of the m columns has is_best[i][j] as True.\n\nCount all such i's.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo, students are:\n\nStudent 0: '223' → subjects 0:2, 1:2, 2:3\n\nStudent 1: '232' → 2,3,2\n\nStudent 2: '112' → 1,1,2\n\nFor subject 0 (first column):\n\nmarks are 2, 2, 1 → max is 2. Students 0 and 1 are best in subject 0.\n\nSo, is_best[0][0] = True, is_best[1][0] = True, others false.\n\nSubject 1 (second column):\n\nmarks are 2,3,1 → max is 3. Only student 1.\n\nSo, is_best[1][1] = True.\n\nSubject 2 (third column):\n\nmarks are 3,2,2 → max is 3. Only student 0.\n\nSo, is_best[0][2] = True.\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: True in subject 0 and 2 → successful.\n\nStudent 1: True in subject 0 and 1 → successful.\n\nStudent 2: No Trues → not successful.\n\nSo total 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nEach student is the best in at least one subject.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSubject 0: 9,1,1 → max 9. Only student 0.\n\nSubject 1:1,1,1 → max 1. All students have 1. So all are best in subject 1.\n\nWait, but wait, for each subject j, all students who have the maximum are considered best.\n\nSo in subject 1, all three students have 1, so all are best in subject 1. So all are successful.\n\nSimilarly, subject 2:7,8,1 → max 8, only student 1.\n\nSubject 3: 2,8,1 → max 8, only student 1.\n\nSubject4:8,8,1 → max 8. Both student0 and 1 have 8. So both are best in subject4.\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent0: best in subject0, subject1, subject4 → successful.\n\nStudent1: best in subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4 → successful.\n\nStudent2: best in subject1 → successful.\n\nSo total 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nGreat.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1, m=1.\n\nThe only student is the best in the only subject. So output 1.\n\nCase 2: n=2, m=1. Both have same mark.\n\nIn subject0, both are best. So both are successful. Output 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n99\n\n88\n\nFor subject0: 9 vs 8 → student0 is best.\n\nSubject1:9 vs 8 → student0 is best.\n\nSo student0 is best in both, so he is successful. Student1 is not best in any. So output 1.\n\nAnother case: m=0. Wait, according to input constraints, m >=1? Because input says 1<=n,m<=100. So m can be 1.\n\nWait, the problem statement says m is the number of subjects, which can be zero? No, because in the input description, the next lines have n lines, each with m characters. So m must be at least 1.\n\nWait, no, looking back: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). So m can be 1, and n can be 1.\n\nSo, now, thinking about the code.\n\nIn Python, the code would be something like this:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string of m characters.\n\nInitialize is_best as a list of n lists, each with m False.\n\nThen, for each j in 0 to m-1:\n\n   current_max = -1\n\n   current_best = []\n\n   for i in 0 to n-1:\n\n       mark = int(students[i][j])\n\n       if mark > current_max:\n\n           current_max = mark\n\n           current_best = [i]\n\n       elif mark == current_max:\n\n           current_best.append(i)\n\n   for i in current_best:\n\n       is_best[i][j] = True\n\nThen, count the number of students where any of their is_best[i][j] is True.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if is_best[i][j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break  # no need to check further\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nWait, but initializing is_best correctly.\n\nIn Python, for each student, we can create a list of m False.\n\nis_best = [ [False]*m for _ in range(n) ]\n\nYes.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nis_best = [ [False]*m for _ in range(n) ]\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = -1\n    current_best = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = int(students[i][j])\n        if mark > current_max:\n            current_max = mark\n            current_best = [i]\n        elif mark == current_max:\n            current_best.append(i)\n    for i in current_best:\n        is_best[i][j] = True\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if is_best[i][j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the input was given as a single string, but in the problem statement, the first line is '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', which is a single line for each student.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m.\n\nNext n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the input is given as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], which may be a representation of the input, but in reality, the input is read line by line.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the input is given is that each student's line is a separate line. So, in the code, reading via input().strip() for each of the n lines is correct.\n\nYes, that should handle it.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nAfter processing, for j=0, current_max is 2, students 0 and 1 are best.\n\nSo is_best[0][0] and [1][0] become True.\n\nj=1: max is 3, only student1.\n\nj=2: max is 3, only student0.\n\nThus, for student0, is_best[0][0] and [0][2] are True → successful.\n\nStudent1: True in j=0 and j=1 → successful.\n\nStudent2: none → not counted.\n\nSo code returns 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nFor j=0:\n\nmarks are 9,1,1 → max is 9, only student0.\n\nj=1:\n\nmarks 1,1,1 → all are best.\n\nj=2: 7,8,1 → max 8, student1.\n\nj=3: 2,8,1 → max 8, student1.\n\nj=4:8,8,1 → max 8, students0 and 1.\n\nThus, for each student:\n\nstudent0: best in j0, j1, j4 → counts.\n\nstudent1: best in j1, j2, j3, j4 → counts.\n\nstudent2: best in j1 → counts.\n\nThus, code returns 3.\n\nSo code works for samples.\n\nWhat about when all students have the same mark for a subject?\n\nLike, for m=1, n=2: both students have 5. So both are best in j=0.\n\nThus, both are successful.\n\nYes, code correctly counts 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1 → output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when a subject has all students with the same mark except one?\n\nLike, m=2, n=3.\n\nStudent0: 9, 9\n\nStudent1:9, 8\n\nStudent2:9,7\n\nFor j=0: all have 9. So all are best.\n\nj=1: student0 is best.\n\nThus, all three are successful.\n\nBecause for j=0, all are best. So each student is best in at least one subject.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering performance.\n\nConstraints are n and m up to 100. So, the code is O(n*m) time, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks across multiple subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read each student's grades as a string.\n2. **Track Best Students per Subject**: For each subject, identify the maximum mark achieved by any student. Record which students achieved this maximum mark for each subject.\n3. **Determine Successful Students**: For each student, check if they are the best in any subject. Count the number of such students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\nis_best = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = -1\n    current_best = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = int(students[i][j])\n        if mark > current_max:\n            current_max = mark\n            current_best = [i]\n        elif mark == current_max:\n            current_best.append(i)\n    for i in current_best:\n        is_best[i][j] = True\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if is_best[i][j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain each student's grades.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize a 2D list `is_best` where `is_best[i][j]` is `True` if student `i` is the best in subject `j`.\n3. **Processing Each Subject**: For each subject, we determine the maximum mark and identify all students who achieved this mark. These students are marked as the best in that subject in the `is_best` matrix.\n4. **Counting Successful Students**: For each student, we check if they are marked as the best in any subject. If they are, they are counted as successful.\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the count of successful students.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each subject and checks each student's performance, ensuring that we correctly identify all successful students.",
