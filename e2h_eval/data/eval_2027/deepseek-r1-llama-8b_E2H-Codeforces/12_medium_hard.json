The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So the i-th task can only be done after she's handled all earlier ones. My goal is to find the minimum time she needs to finish all her tasks.\n\nHmm, the example helps. Let me look at that. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks: 3,2,3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. That makes sense. She has to go through each required house in the order that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because the order in which she does the tasks affects the total time. She needs to visit all the necessary houses at the right times.\n\nI think the key here is to process the tasks in a specific order. Since each task depends on the previous ones being done, perhaps we can sort the tasks in a way that ensures we're always moving as efficiently as possible.\n\nLet me think about the dependencies. For each task i, she must have visited a_i before doing task i+1. But wait, no. The problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be in a_i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order of the tasks matters because each task may require her to reach a certain position in the ring.\n\nBut since the ring is circular, maybe it's optimal to arrange the tasks in such a way that each step covers the maximum necessary movement, without backtracking too much.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the minimal time is determined by the sum of the distances between consecutive required positions, considering the circular nature.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the tasks in the order they are to be performed, ensuring that for each task, any earlier tasks are already covered.\n2. Then, calculate the time taken by moving from one position to the next, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nBut what's the correct order to perform the tasks?\n\nWait, the order of the tasks in the input is given as a sequence, but she might need to perform them in a different order. For example, in the first sample, the tasks are 3, 2, 3. She can't do 2 first because then when she does 3, she might have to go all the way around again. So the correct order is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3, which totals 6 steps.\n\nWait, no, in the first sample, the sorted order of the tasks (ignoring duplicates) would be 2,3,4. Or wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother idea: The tasks must be processed in the order of their indices. Wait, the problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be in a_i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. So the tasks must be processed in the order of increasing i. Because for task 1, you need to be at a_1. Then, for task 2, you need to be at a_2 after task 1 is done, etc.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that for each task i, she must be in a_i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. So the tasks are to be processed in the order of their task number, i.e., i runs from 1 to m. So the first task is i=1, second i=2, etc. So the order is fixed as per the input's order of the tasks. So she cannot reorder the tasks; she must process them in the order given. Oh, that changes things.\n\nWait, wait, let me read the problem statement again. It says \"the second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am. Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\" So the order of the tasks is important. So she must do the first task, then the second, etc., in that order.\n\nSo, for each task i, she must reach a_i, and after doing all j < i tasks.\n\nWait, but how does this affect the movement? For example, suppose she is at a_{i-1} after doing task i-1, and now she has to go to a_i. The distance between a_{i-1} and a_i could be either clockwise or counter-clockwise, but since the ring is one-way, she can only move clockwise. So the minimal path would be to move clockwise.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is one-way and traffic is clockwise, she can't go back. So movement is always in the direction of increasing house numbers. So from any house, she can only move to the next higher-numbered house in a circular manner.\n\nSo, for example, house 4 is next to house 1. So from 4, she can move to 1, but that's a forward move. Wait, no: if the ring is 1→2→3→4→1, then the movement is only allowed in that direction. So from 4, the only next house is 1.\n\nSo, the movement is strictly clockwise, meaning that from any house x, the next is x+1, except for n, where the next is 1.\n\nSo, the movement is like a cycle where each step increases the house number, wrapping around from n to 1.\n\nThus, the minimal path between two points a and b is the minimal number of steps needed when moving clockwise. So the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod n, but since the movement is only in that direction, it's (b - a) % n, but if a > b, then it's (n - (a - b)).\n\nWait, for example, if a is 3 and b is 1 in n=4, the clockwise distance is 2 steps (3→4→1).\n\nSo, the distance from a to b is (b - a) % n if b >= a, else (b + n - a) % n.\n\nAlternatively, the distance is (b - a) % n if a <= b, else (b + n - a) % n.\n\nWait, no. Because in the case where a=3 and b=1, n=4, the distance is 2 steps. (1 -3 +4 ) = 2.\n\nSo general formula is (b -a) % n.\n\nWait, wait: 1-3 is -2, mod 4 is 2. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, 4-1 is 3 mod 4 is 3, but the actual distance is 3 steps: 4→1, 2 steps? No, wait, 4 to 1 is just one step. Wait, no, wait: 4 is connected to 1. So the distance from 4 to 1 is 1 step. So what's wrong here.\n\nWait, no. If a=4 and b=1, the distance is 1 step. But according to the formula (b -a) mod n, 1-4 is -3 mod 4 is 1. Which is correct.\n\nWait, yes, because (1-4) mod 4 is 1 (since -3 mod4 is 1). So yes, the formula works.\n\nSo, the distance from a to b is (b -a) mod n.\n\nThat's a crucial point.\n\nSo, given that, the movement is always in the clockwise direction, and the time taken to move from a to b is (b -a) mod n.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to: starting at 1, process each task in the given order, and for each task i, ensure that after processing all j < i, she arrives at a_i.\n\nBut how does this affect the movement? Because each a_i must be visited after all previous tasks. So, for example, the first task is a_1: she must be at a_1 after doing task 1. Then, the second task is a_2: she must be at a_2 after doing task 2, etc.\n\nWait, but the initial position is 1. So for task 1, she is already at a_1? Or is a_1 the first task's destination.\n\nWait, the problem says she starts at 1. For each task i, she needs to be in a_i at the time she finishes all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\nSo the first task is i=1: she must be at a_1 after processing task 1. But she starts at 1, so if a_1 is 1, no movement is needed. Otherwise, she needs to move from 1 to a_1, which takes (a_1 -1) mod n steps.\n\nThen, for task 2, she must be at a_2 after task 2 is done. So, after completing task 2, she must be at a_2. But how does that translate into movement steps?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to model the position after each task and see how much time is spent moving.\n\nSo, let's model the position after each task.\n\nWe can keep track of the current position. Initially, it's 1.\n\nFor each task i from 1 to m:\n\n- She must move to a_i, but considering that any previous moves have already been accounted for.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement depends on the order of the tasks. For example, after task i-1, she is at some position, and then she needs to move to a_i, but perhaps passing through some other houses on the way.\n\nBut the movement is only in the clockwise direction, so the path from the current position to a_i is the shortest possible clockwise path.\n\nSo, for each task i, the movement from the current position to a_i is (a_i - current_position) mod n steps.\n\nWait, but the current position is updated to a_i after each task.\n\nWait, but what about the fact that she might have to return to a_i multiple times? Like in the first example, where the third task is again a_3=3.\n\nIn that case, after the second task, she is at a_2=2. Then, for the third task, she needs to be at 3 again, so she moves from 2 to 3, which is 1 step. So the movement is added.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the distances moved for each task.\n\nBut wait, in the first example:\n\nTasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nProcess task 1 (a_1=3): she starts at 1. Distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps. Time +=2. Position becomes 3.\n\nTask 2 (a_2=2): she is currently at 3. Distance to 2 is (2-3) mod 4 = ( -1) mod4= 3 steps. So she goes 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Time +=3. Now at 2.\n\nTask 3 (a_3=3): she is at 2. Distance to 3 is 1 step. Time +=1. Now at 3.\n\nTotal time is 2+3+1=6, which matches the example.\n\nSo, yes, the approach is to compute for each task i, the distance from the current position to a_i, add that to the total time, and update the current position to a_i.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, time =0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n   distance = (a_i - current_pos) mod n\n\n   time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a_i\n\nReturn time.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the list of a_i's.\n\n3. For each a_i in the list:\n\n   a. Compute the distance from current_pos to a_i as (a_i - current_pos) mod n.\n\n   b. Add this distance to the total time.\n\n   c. Update current_pos to a_i.\n\nSo, for the second example, where the input is 4 3 2 3 3.\n\nWait, the input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'.\n\nSo the tasks are 2,3,3.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos =1.\n\nTask 1: a_i=2.\n\ndistance = (2-1) mod4=1.\n\ntime=1.\n\ncurrent_pos=2.\n\nTask 2: a_i=3.\n\ndistance=(3-2)=1.\n\ntime=2.\n\ncurrent_pos=3.\n\nTask3: a_i=3.\n\ndistance= (3-3)=0.\n\ntime remains 2.\n\nSo total time is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: All a_i's are 1.\n\nFor example, n=5, m=3, a=[1,1,1].\n\nTime is 0, since she starts at 1 and doesn't move.\n\nCase 2: Tasks that require going all the way around.\n\nLike n=4, m=2, a=[4,1].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos=1.\n\nTask1: a_i=4. distance is (4-1) mod4=3. time +=3.\n\ncurrent_pos=4.\n\nTask2: a_i=1. distance is (1-4) mod4= ( -3) mod4=1. So 1 step. Time +=1. Total 4.\n\nWhich is correct: 1→4→1 is 3+1=4 steps.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[3,5,2].\n\nProcess:\n\ncurrent_pos=1.\n\ntask1: a=3. distance 2. time=2. pos=3.\n\ntask2: a=5. distance (5-3)=2. time=4. pos=5.\n\ntask3: a=2. distance (2-5) mod5 = ( -3) mod5=2. So 2 steps. time=6. pos=2.\n\nTotal time is 6.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe can proceed as follows.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos=1, time=0.\n\nLoop over each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nPrint time.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator can return negative results if the first operand is negative. So for example, (2-5) is -3, mod 5 is 2, which is correct.\n\nYes, so the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test it against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 4 3, [3,2,3].\n\nAs above, code returns 6.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 4 3, [2,3,3].\n\nCode returns 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, m=2, a=[4,1]. Output is 4.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, m=3, a=[3,5,2]. Output is 6.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nEdge case: m=0? Wait, no, m is given as at least 1.\n\nWait, no, the problem says m is at least 1? Let me check the input constraints.\n\nProblem statement says: 1 ≤ m ≤ 105. So m is at least 1.\n\nSo, no need to handle m=0.\n\nAnother edge case: a_i is the same as the current position. So distance is zero, nothing added.\n\nWhat about when a_i is behind current_pos in the ring, but requires a big loop.\n\nLike n=10, current_pos=8, a_i=2.\n\nDistance is (2-8) mod10= ( -6) mod10=4.\n\nWhich is correct: 8→9→10→1→2: 4 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo now, write the Python code.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the a list.\n\nInitialize current_pos and time.\n\nLoop and compute.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\nfor ai in a:\n    distance = (ai - current) % n\n    time += distance\n    current = ai\nprint(time)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nOutput is 6.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, m=3, a=[3,5,2]\n\ntime is 2 (from 1 to3) + 2 (3 to5) + (2-5) mod5=2 → 2+2+2=6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the given order, and she must be at the specified house when each task is done.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Xenia starts at house 1.\n   - She has to complete tasks in the given order, moving only clockwise.\n   - The movement from one house to the next takes 1 unit of time.\n   - The goal is to find the minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Since Xenia can only move clockwise, the distance between two houses `a` and `b` is calculated as `(b - a) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n   - For each task, calculate the distance from her current position to the required house, add this distance to the total time, and update her current position.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize her starting position at house 1.\n   - For each task in the given order, compute the clockwise distance from her current position to the required house.\n   - Update her current position to the required house after each task.\n   - Sum up all the distances to get the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\nfor ai in a:\n    distance = (ai - current) % n\n    time += distance\n    current = ai\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line contains `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The second line contains the list of task locations.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `time` initialized to 0.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task location, compute the distance from the current house to the task location using modulo arithmetic. Add this distance to the total time and update the current position.\n- **Output**: Print the total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia moves optimally clockwise, minimizing the total time by always taking the shortest path in the clockwise direction.",
