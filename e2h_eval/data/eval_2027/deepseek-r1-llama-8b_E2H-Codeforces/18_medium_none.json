The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$.

The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where a frog can jump either +a or -b from its current position. The function f(x) counts the number of distinct positions it can reach without going outside [0, x]. And I need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m.\n\nHmm, let's start by understanding what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) is the number of reachable points within [0, x]. So for each x, I need to calculate how many unique positions the frog can reach starting from 0, using jumps of a or -b, but never stepping outside 0 and x.\n\nWait, but how do I model the reachable positions? It seems like a graph problem where each node is a position, and edges are the possible jumps. But for large m (like up to 1e9), we can't compute this naively for each x. So I need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the reachable positions. The frog starts at 0. Each jump adds a or subtracts b. So the possible positions form some kind of set that can be described algebraically.\n\nThe key idea here is that the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that the position is between 0 and x.\n\nWait, no. Because each jump can be a combination of adding a and subtracting b any number of times, but in any order. So the reachable positions are all numbers that can be written as s*a - t*b, where s and t are non-negative integers, and s >= t (since you can't have more subtractions than additions otherwise you'd go negative). Also, the position must be >=0 and <=x.\n\nBut wait, maybe not exactly. Because each step is either +a or -b. So the total displacement after n steps is (number of a steps)*a - (number of b steps)*b. The total steps can vary, so s and t could be any numbers as long as s >= t, right?\n\nWait, no. Because each step is either +a or -b. So after s steps of +a and t steps of -b, the total displacement is s*a - t*b. But s and t can be any non-negative integers as long as the total steps are s + t. So the total displacement is s*a - t*b, but the constraints are that:\n\n- The position after any step cannot be less than 0. So when jumping -b, the frog's position must remain >=0.\n\nWait, but that complicates things because it's not just about the final position, but also every intermediate position. Hmm, that's tricky.\n\nSo the problem isn't just about whether the final position is within [0, x], but every step along the way must also stay within [0, x].\n\nOh right! So for f(x), the frog can only make jumps that keep it within 0 and x. So for any path, each step must not take it beyond 0 or x.\n\nThis makes it more complicated because it's not enough to know the final position; the entire path must adhere to the constraints.\n\nSo, for example, if a =5, b=3, and x is 7: \n\nAt position 4, the frog can jump +5 to 9, which is beyond 7, so that's not allowed. Or, from 4, it can jump -3 to 1. So the reachable positions are built by considering all possible paths without stepping outside.\n\nSo, perhaps the reachable positions form a certain pattern. Maybe the minimal and maximal reachable positions at each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Because when you can add and subtract a and b, the minimal step you can make is their gcd.\n\nYes, that's right. The set of all reachable positions is the set of all integers of the form k*d, where d = gcd(a, b), and k is an integer such that the position remains within [0, x], and also satisfies that the path doesn't go out of bounds.\n\nWait, but even with that, the exact reachable positions depend on the order of steps and the constraints on the path.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of f(x), the number of reachable positions is determined by the maximum and minimum reachable positions, given the constraints.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the reachable positions as intervals. For example, for each x, the frog can reach a certain range of positions, and then the count is the size of that range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are all the points between some lower bound L and upper bound U, where L and U are multiples of d = gcd(a, b), and the difference between them is a multiple of a + b or something similar.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find for each x the maximum reachable position, and then determine how many points in the [0, x] interval are reachable.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's consider the frog's movement as a graph where nodes are positions, and edges are the possible jumps. But for each x, the graph is bounded, which complicates things.\n\nAnother approach is to find for each x, the maximum position the frog can reach, and the minimum position it can reach. Then, the number of reachable positions would be (max - min)/d + 1, where d is the gcd of a and b. But I'm not sure if this holds because the frog might not be able to reach every position in that interval due to the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. Because the frog can move in steps of d (since a and b are multiples of d). So the reachable positions are all multiples of d within [0, x], but adjusted based on the path constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because the frog can't take certain steps that would take it beyond x or below 0. So the actual reachable positions may not cover every multiple of d in [0, x]. For example, if d is 2, and x is 5, but the frog can't reach 4 because it would require a step that's beyond x.\n\nBut perhaps for x >= some value, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find the minimal x beyond which all possible reachable positions are included. Because as x increases, the frog has more space to move, and eventually, it can reach all possible multiples of d up to x.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a point x0 beyond which for all x >= x0, the number of reachable positions is (x // d) + 1, assuming that x is a multiple of d. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of reachable positions when x is large enough is floor((x + c)/d), where c is some constant, but I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should model the problem as finding all positions reachable from 0, without ever leaving [0, x], for each x. But for large x, the pattern repeats.\n\nWait, another thought: the frog's movement can be represented as a BFS, where each state is a position, and edges are the possible jumps. But for large x, this is impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the problem can be split into two parts: for x values where the frog can't reach certain positions, and for x values where the frog can reach all possible multiples of d up to x.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the minimal x (let's call it x0) such that for all x >= x0, the frog can reach every multiple of d up to x. Once x >= x0, f(x) = (x // d) + 1.\n\n2. For x < x0, compute f(x) individually.\n\nThen, the sum can be broken into two parts: the sum for x < x0, and the sum for x >= x0.\n\nSo the first task is to find x0.\n\nWhat's x0?\n\nx0 is the smallest x such that the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x, and any further x beyond x0 allows the frog to reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nWait, but how to find x0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x0 is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x by making jumps that don't exceed x.\n\nWait, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x by a series of jumps that include a +a and -b steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal x where the frog can reach a certain position is the minimal x such that x >= (k*a - l*b) for some k and l, and the path doesn't leave [0, x].\n\nWait, this is getting a bit stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: think about the maximum and minimum reachable positions for a given x.\n\nLet's consider that the frog can make any number of +a and -b steps, but each step must not take it beyond 0 or x.\n\nThe maximum reachable position is the largest possible position the frog can reach without exceeding x.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum is the smallest possible, but it can't go below 0.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum reachable position is min(x, a * s), where s is the number of a steps minus the number of b steps, but constrained by the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum reachable position is the minimal between x and some value that depends on a, b, and x.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to model this as a state where for each x, the frog can reach positions in a certain range.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's think of some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input: a=5, b=3, m=7.\n\nFor x=0, f(0)=1.\n\nFor x=1, the frog is at 0. Can't jump +5 (would go to 5>1), can't jump -3 (goes to -3<0). So f(1)=1.\n\nSimilarly for x=2: same as above.\n\nx=3: same.\n\nx=4: same.\n\nx=5: Now, the frog can jump +5 to 5, which is within 5. So the reachable positions are 0,5, and any other positions via combinations. Wait, but wait, how?\n\nWait, from 0, can the frog reach 5? Yes, with one +5 step.\n\nFrom 5, can it jump back? Well, if x=5, it's allowed. So from 5, it can jump back to 2 (5-3=2). So now the reachable positions are 0, 2,5.\n\nSo f(5)=3.\n\nSimilarly, for x=6: the frog can make the same steps, and from 5, can it jump +5 again to 10, which is beyond 6, so that's not allowed. So from 5, the frog can't jump further. So the reachable positions are 0,2,5, and any others via -3 steps.\n\nWait, wait. From 0, the frog can jump to 5, then from 5, it can jump back to 2. Then from 2, can it jump +5? That would take it to 7, which is beyond x=6. So no. From 2, it can't jump +5. But from 2, can it jump -3? That takes it to -1, which is invalid.\n\nSo for x=6, the reachable positions are 0,2,5. So f(6)=3.\n\nWait, but according to the sample note, f(7)=8. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, for x=7, f(7) is 8. So the reachable positions must be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but that doesn't fit with the earlier reasoning. Or perhaps I'm missing some steps.\n\nWait, maybe the frog can reach more positions by combining +a and -b steps.\n\nWait, let's think again: from 0, the frog can choose to jump +5 to 5. Then from 5, can it jump -3 to 2. From 2, can it jump +5 again to 7, which is within x=7. So now the frog is at 7.\n\nFrom 7, can it jump -3 to 4. From 4, can it jump -3 to 1. From 1, can it jump +5 to 6.\n\nWait, so the positions are: 0,5,2,7,4,1,6. Are there any more?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- From 0: 0 →5→2→7→4→1→6→ ... ?\n\nWait, from 6, can it jump +5 to 11 (but x=7, so no). Or jump -3 to 3.\n\nSo from 6, the frog can jump -3 to 3.\n\nSo now the positions include 3.\n\nFrom 3, can it jump +5 to 8 (no), or -3 to 0 (already visited).\n\nSo now, the positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3.\n\nWait, that's 8 positions. So f(7)=8.\n\nAh, so my earlier analysis was incomplete because I didn't consider that from certain positions, the frog can make more jumps.\n\nSo the problem is that the reachable positions depend on the order of jumps and how the frog can chain them without going beyond x.\n\nSo for a given x, the reachable positions form a connected graph, but the exact structure is hard to model.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the best way is to model the problem as finding for each x, the minimal and maximal positions that can be reached, and then see how the reachable positions are distributed within [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of reachable positions is (max_pos - min_pos)/d + 1, where d is the gcd of a and b.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, d = gcd(5,3) =1. So for x=7, the max_pos is 7, min_pos is 0. So (7-0)/1 +1 =8, which matches the sample.\n\nSimilarly, for x=5, the reachable positions are 0,2,5. So min is 0, max is5. (5-0)/1 +1 =6, but in the sample, f(5) is3. So that approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the formula isn't simply (max - min)/d +1.\n\nSo perhaps the idea is more complex.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of reachable positions is (max_pos - min_pos)/d +1, but only if the frog can reach every step in between.\n\nOtherwise, it's less.\n\nBut that's difficult to compute.\n\nAnother thought: since the frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b, the reachable positions are all multiples of d, where d = gcd(a, b). So for any x, the reachable positions are all the multiples of d in [0, x], provided that the frog can navigate through the path without stepping beyond x.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, x=5: the reachable positions are 0,2,5. All multiples of d=1 are present, but 1 and 3,4 are missing. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the frog can't reach every multiple of d because the path constraints prevent it.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the problem as a BFS, where for each x, the frog can reach a certain set of positions. But for x up to 1e9, this is impossible.\n\nSo, the solution must involve finding a pattern or mathematical formula that can compute f(x) quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find for each x, the maximum reachable position and the minimum reachable position, and then the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d between these two, inclusive.\n\nBut again, in the first sample, for x=5, the max is5, min is0, which gives 6 positions, but f(5) is3. So this can't be.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the frog can only reach positions that are congruent to 0 modulo d, but not necessarily all such positions. Because the frog can't make certain jumps without exceeding x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can't reach certain positions in the sequence because the steps required would take it beyond x.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable positions are all the numbers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the resulting position is between 0 and x, and during the path, the frog never steps beyond 0 and x.\n\nBut how to count this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the minimal and maximal reachable positions for a given x, and then the number of reachable positions is the number of points in that interval that can be reached.\n\nBut again, how to compute this quickly.\n\nAnother angle: think about the process as moving in steps of +a and -b, but always staying within 0 and x.\n\nEach time the frog can choose to add a or subtract b, but only if the new position is within 0 and x.\n\nSo the reachable positions form a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent adding a or subtracting b, provided the new position is within the allowed range.\n\nThis graph can have cycles, but for our problem, we need to find the number of nodes reachable from 0.\n\nBut for large x, this is impractical to compute directly.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model the reachable positions as a range that expands as x increases.\n\nSo, for x increasing from 0 to m, the reachable positions grow until they reach a certain maximum, and then beyond that, adding more x doesn't change the set anymore.\n\nSo perhaps the sum can be split into two parts: x where the reachable set is small, and x where it's fully expanded.\n\nSo, the first part is x where the reachable set hasn't yet reached its maximum, and the second part is x where the reachable set is complete.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the minimal x0 where the reachable set is fully expanded.\n\n2. For x < x0, compute f(x) individually.\n\n3. For x >=x0, f(x) is a function that can be computed quickly.\n\n4. Sum the contributions accordingly.\n\nNow, the question is how to find x0.\n\nLet's think about the maximum reachable position for a given x.\n\nThe maximum position is the largest k such that k can be reached by some combination of a and b steps without exceeding x.\n\nSimilarly, the minimal reachable position is the smallest k such that k can be reached.\n\nBut again, for x >= x0, the reachable set includes all possible multiples of d (d=gcd(a,b)) up to x.\n\nWait, perhaps x0 is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x by a series of jumps, including both a and b steps, without exceeding x.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x via some combination of steps, and the path doesn't go beyond x.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach x0 by making a certain number of a and b steps.\n\nFor example, suppose x0 is the minimal x where x0 >= k*a - l*b, and the path to reach x0 doesn't go beyond x.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nAnother approach: think about the problem as a BFS, but track the minimal and maximal reachable positions.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given x, the frog can reach any position in the interval [L, R], where L is the minimal reachable position and R is the maximal reachable position, and L and R are congruent modulo d.\n\nIf the frog can reach every position in [L, R] with step d, then f(x) = ((R-L)/d)+1.\n\nOtherwise, it's less.\n\nBut how to find L and R.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach all positions from L to R in steps of d. So f(x) is (R-L)/d +1.\n\nBut how to find L and R.\n\nHmm, perhaps L is the minimal reachable position, which is the minimal s where s =k*a - l*b >=0, and the path to s doesn't go beyond 0.\n\nSimilarly, R is the maximal reachable position, which is the maximal s where s =k*a - l*b <=x, and the path doesn't go beyond x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the reachable positions as a range that starts at 0, and expands as x increases.\n\nLet me think about the initial conditions.\n\nInitially, at x=0, the frog can only be at 0.\n\nAs x increases, the frog can make more jumps.\n\nEach time the frog can add a, which may allow it to reach higher positions, or subtract b, which may allow it to reach lower positions.\n\nBut the path must not go beyond x or below 0.\n\nSo, the maximum reachable position for a given x is min(x, current_max + a).\n\nBut wait, because adding a could take the frog beyond x, so it's only allowed if current_max + a <=x.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting b could take the frog to current_min -b, but only if current_min -b >=0.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum reachable position is min(current_max + a, x).\n\nThe minimal reachable position is max(current_min -b, 0).\n\nBut this assumes that the frog can make the jump without stepping beyond x or 0.\n\nWait, but this is a simplification because the frog's movement is not just about the current_max and current_min, but the actual path taken.\n\nFor example, the frog might not be able to reach current_max +a if it's blocked by some constraints.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of modeling, this can be considered as a possible expansion.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach can be used to model the growth of the reachable positions.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nWe can track two variables: current_max_reachable and current_min_reachable.\n\nInitially, both are 0.\n\nFor each x, when we increase x by 1, we check if the frog can add a to current_max_reachable, but only if current_max_reachable +a <=x.\n\nSimilarly, check if the frog can subtract b from current_min_reachable, but only if current_min_reachable -b >=0.\n\nWait, but x is the limit, and for each x, the frog can potentially expand its reachable positions.\n\nBut how does this relate to the sum over x from 0 to m.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be computed as follows:\n\nFor x < x0, where x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach a certain point, f(x) can be computed incrementally.\n\nOnce x >=x0, f(x) can be computed as a function that depends on x.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Find x0, the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and the reachable set includes all multiples of d up to x.\n\n3. For x <x0, compute f(x) for each x, and sum them.\n\n4. For x >=x0, compute the sum as (sum from x=x0 to m of f(x)).\n\nSo, the first challenge is to find x0.\n\nHow to compute x0?\n\nx0 is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x by a series of jumps, and can reach any multiple of d up to x.\n\nWait, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x and also x >= (k*a - l*b) for some k and l.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and the frog can also reach x-d.\n\nWait, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x and can also reach x-d, x-2d, etc., down to 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and the frog can also reach x-d, x-2d, etc., all the way to 0.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient, because even if the frog can reach x, it's possible that it can't reach all the lower positions due to path constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, the frog can make a series of steps that allows it to reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the minimal and maximal reachable positions. For each x, the frog can reach a certain range of positions.\n\nThe frog can't reach beyond x, but it can reach as far as possible by adding a steps, but sometimes can't because adding a would take it beyond x.\n\nSimilarly, it can subtract b steps to go back, but not below zero.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum reachable position is min(x, current_max + a).\n\nSimilarly, the minimal reachable position is max(0, current_min - b).\n\nBut this is a dynamic process; each time the frog can expand the reachable area.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this accurately models the reachable positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog's reachable positions form a contiguous range once x is large enough.\n\nBut how to determine when that happens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x >= some value, the frog can reach all positions from 0 up to x, in steps of d.\n\nBut this isn't the case in the sample.\n\nWait, no. In the sample, for x=7, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So all positions are reachable.\n\nSo, for x=7, the reachable positions are all 8 numbers from 0 to7.\n\nSo, in this case, f(x) = x+1.\n\nWhich is consistent with the sample's second test case, where a=1, b=2019, and for x=1e9, f(x) =x+1.\n\nBecause when a=1, the frog can reach every position by adding 1 each time.\n\nWait, in that case, the frog can reach any position, so f(x) =x+1 for x >= some x0.\n\nSo, perhaps the general approach is:\n\n- If the frog can reach every position in [0, x], then f(x) =x+1.\n\nBut when can this happen?\n\nIt happens when the frog can add 1 step (a=1), so it can reach any position.\n\nBut when a and b are such that a=1, then yes.\n\nBut for a=5, b=3, as in the first sample, the frog can't reach every position until x=7.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition is that the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] once x is sufficiently large.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b).\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, but also, it can reach all positions in [L, R], where L is the minimal reachable position, R is the maximal reachable position.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, but also, the frog can move freely within that residue class as x increases.\n\nSo, for x >= some x0, the frog can reach any position in [0, x] that is a multiple of d.\n\nBut in the sample, d=1, so all positions are reachable once x is 7.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x once x is >= some value.\n\nSo, for x >= x0, f(x) = (x//d) +1.\n\nBut in the sample, for x=7, d=1, so (7//1)+1=8, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for the third sample, a=1e5, b=1, m=100. The frog can reach any position up to 100, but since a is 1e5, which is larger than 100, the frog can only make zero a steps, and can make some b steps.\n\nWait, no: in the third sample, the frog starts at 0, and can jump +1e5 (which is beyond 100) or -1 (but can't go below 0). So for x=100, the frog can't make any jumps except possibly -1.\n\nWait, no: because from 0, the frog can't jump -1 (as it would be -1 <0). So the only possible jump is +1e5, which is beyond x=100. So the frog can't move, hence f(100)=1.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output is 101. Wait, no, the third sample's input is '100 100000 1', and the output is 101. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the sample.\n\nWait, the third sample's input is:\n\n100 100000 1\n\nSo a=1e5, b=1.\n\nSo from 0, the frog can only make +1e5, which is beyond 100. Or -1, which is invalid.\n\nSo the frog can't make any jumps, so for all x from 0 to 100, f(x)=1. So the sum is 101*1=101, which matches the sample.\n\nSo in this case, the frog can't reach any positions beyond 0, so for x=100, f(x)=1.\n\nThus, the idea that for x >=x0, f(x)=(x//d)+1 is incorrect in this case.\n\nSo, the approach needs to account for cases where the frog can't make any jumps, leading to f(x)=1 for all x.\n\nThus, the solution must first check whether the frog can make any jumps.\n\nWait, so perhaps the first condition is that the frog can make at least one jump. Otherwise, f(x) is always 1.\n\nWhen can the frog make a jump? When a >0 and b>0.\n\nWait, but if a is 0 or b is 0, but the problem states that a and b are positive integers.\n\nSo, for the frog to be able to make any jump, the sum of a and b must be such that it can move.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can make a jump if a >0 and b>0, and the frog can reach a position by adding a or subtracting b without going beyond x.\n\nBut in the third sample, a is 1e5, b is 1, and x=100. So from 0, adding a would take it to 1e5>100, which is invalid. Subtracting b would take it to -1, invalid. So no jumps can be made.\n\nThus, f(x)=1 for all x.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\n- Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n- If the frog can't make any jumps, then f(x)=1 for all x up to m.\n\nElse:\n\n   Find the minimal x0 where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x0, and beyond that, the reachable positions continue to expand as x increases.\n\nSo, how to find x0.\n\nHmm, perhaps x0 is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and also can reach x -d, x - 2d, etc., all the way down to 0.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and x >= (some value involving a and b).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x0 is the minimal x such that x >= a - b, or some other combination.\n\nWait, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can make a series of steps that allows it to reach x and then come back down via b steps.\n\nWait, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where x >= a.\n\nBecause then, the frog can jump to a, and from a, can't jump further, so no.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, x0 is 5, but the frog can't reach x=5 until x=5 is allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is getting quite stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the frog can reach any position once x is at least (a + b) or some other function of a and b.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps it's time to look for patterns in the sample.\n\nSample 1: a=5, b=3, m=7.\n\nd=1.\n\nIn this case, the frog can reach any position once x is 7.\n\nSample 2: a=1, b=2019, m=1e9.\n\nHere, the frog can reach any position once x is 1e9, but since a=1, it can reach any position.\n\nSample 3: a=1e5, b=1, m=100. Frog can't reach any position beyond 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition for the frog to be able to reach all positions up to x is that the frog can reach x via a series of +a and -b steps, and that x >= a certain value.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach all positions up to x when x >= (a - b) or some other threshold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions once x is >= a + b.\n\nBut in the first sample, a=5, b=3, a +b=8, but the frog reaches all positions at x=7.\n\nSo that's not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, can make a series of steps that allows it to reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Think of the problem as the frog can reach any position as long as x >= a certain value, say, the minimal x where x >= k*a - l*b and x >= k*a and x >= l*b, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position once x is >= a certain value, say, the minimal x where x >= (a - b) or x >= a, depending on the relative sizes of a and b.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps it's time to look for a mathematical approach.\n\nThe frog can make any number of steps, each adding a or subtracting b, as long as the position remains within [0, x].\n\nThe reachable positions form a set S, which is the set of all numbers that can be expressed as s*a - t*b, where s and t are non-negative integers, and the path doesn't go beyond 0 or x.\n\nBut again, for large x, this is difficult to model.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the frog can reach any position in [0, x] that is congruent to 0 modulo d, once x is large enough.\n\nIn the first sample, d=1, so all positions are reachable once x is 7.\n\nIn the second sample, a=1, so all positions are reachable.\n\nIn the third sample, a=1e5, b=1, but the frog can't reach any positions beyond 0.\n\nSo, the condition is that the frog can make a series of steps that allows it to reach any position in [0, x], which depends on whether a and b are such that the frog can move forward and backward.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach any position once x is >= a certain value, say, the minimal x where x >= a and x >= b.\n\nBut in the first sample, a=5, b=3, which is less than a.\n\nBut the frog can reach all positions starting at x=7.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions once x is >= a + b.\n\nBut in the first sample, a=5, b=3: a +b=8. But the frog can reach all positions at x=7.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Perhaps it's time to look for hints or related problems.\n\nUpon searching, I recall that this problem is similar to counting the number of reachable nodes in a graph with certain constraints, but the exact approach is unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea: The reachable positions form a range [L, R], and for each x, the frog can expand this range.\n\nThe sum can be computed by finding for each x the new positions added and accumulating their contribution.\n\nBut again, for large x, this is impractical.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be computed by finding when the frog can reach all possible positions, and then compute the sum for that region.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if the frog can't make any jumps. If a >x or b >x for all x up to m, then f(x)=1 for all x, sum is m+1.\n\nElse:\n\n2. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n3. Compute the minimal x0 where the frog can reach all positions up to x0, and beyond that, the reachable positions continue to expand.\n\n4. For x <x0, compute f(x) individually.\n\n5. For x >=x0, compute f(x) as (x//d)+1.\n\nBut how to find x0.\n\nPerhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, can reach x-d, x-2d, etc., all the way down to 0.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother Idea: The frog can reach all positions once x is at least the maximum of a and b.\n\nWait, in the first sample, max(a, b) is5. So x0=5, but in the sample, the frog can't reach all positions until x=7.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where x >= a + b.\n\nBut again, the first sample's x0 would be 8, which is larger than 7.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, can make a jump that brings it back to 0.\n\nBut in the first sample, x=5 is such that 5-3=2, which is reachable.\n\nBut from 2, the frog can't reach 5 again without exceeding x=5.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions once x is >= the minimal x where the frog can reach x and x is reachable from 0 via some combination of a and b steps, and also can reach 0 from x via some combination.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract.\n\nPerhaps it",
