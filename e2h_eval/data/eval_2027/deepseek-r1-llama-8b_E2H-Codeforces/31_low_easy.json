Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But he can't find some, so we need to determine the minimal number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. The input gives us n, the number of found cards, and x, the maximum absolute value any card can have. Then there's a list of n integers which are the numbers on the found cards. We need to compute the minimum number of additional cards required so that the total sum is zero.\n\nWait, but wait: initially, Vanya had an infinite number of cards with each integer from -x to x. So when he loses some, the sum of the found ones plus the sum of the missing ones must be zero. Oh no, wait—no, the problem says Natasha hid all the cards, but Vanya found n of them. So the sum of the found cards is S. He needs the sum of all found plus the sum of the missing ones to be zero? Or does he need the sum of the found (including the new ones) to be zero?\n\nWait, re-reading the problem statement: \"the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero.\" Oh, so the found cards include the ones he just found now. So the sum of the found cards (including any new ones) must be zero. So the initial found cards' sum is S. So the sum of the new cards must be -S. Because S + (sum of new cards) = 0 → sum of new = -S.\n\nSo the task is: find the smallest number of cards whose sum is exactly -S, and each card has a value between -x and x (inclusive).\n\nBut how do we find this minimal number of cards?\n\nLet's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the current sum S of the found cards. Then, the required sum for the new cards is T = -S. We need to find the minimal number of terms in a sequence where each term is between -x and x (so their absolute value is ≤x), such that their sum is T.\n\nWhat's the minimal possible number of terms? Well, each term can contribute up to x towards the sum (if positive) or up to -x (if negative). So the minimal number is the ceiling of |T| / x. But wait, because if |T| is exactly divisible by x, then that's the number. Otherwise, you take the floor division plus one.\n\nBut wait, perhaps not always. Because sometimes you can combine positive and negative contributions. Wait, for example, if T is 5 and x is 3. The minimal number would be 2: 3 + 2 (but wait, 2 is allowed since 2 ≤x? Or wait, no, x is 3, so 2 is allowed. Wait, no: the absolute value of each card cannot exceed x. So each card can be at most x in absolute value. So 2 is allowed.\n\nWait, but in the case where T is 5 and x is 3: 3+2=5, but that's two cards. Alternatively, 3+ (-1)+1 = 3, which is still not 5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of cards is determined by the minimal k such that |T| ≤ k*x. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the sum. So the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x). Because for example, if |T| is 4 and x is 2, then k is 2. If |T| is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so ceil is 3.\n\nWait, but what about when T is negative? For example, T is -5, x is 3. Then |T|=5. 5/3 is ~1.666, so ceil is 2. So with two cards, can we reach -5? Each card can be as low as -3. So two cards can be -3 and -2, which sum to -5. So yes, that works.\n\nSo regardless of the sign of T, the minimal number is the same as the minimal k where k is the smallest integer such that k ≥ |T| / x. So k = ceil(|T| / x).\n\nWait, but what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. That's correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute S, the sum of the found cards.\n\n2. Compute T = -S.\n\n3. Compute the absolute value of T: |T|.\n\n4. If |T| is zero: output 0.\n\n5. Else, compute k = ceil(|T|",

Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The sum of the additional cards needed is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Compute Absolute Value**: Find the absolute value of the required sum.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: The minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute value divided by x. This ensures that each card contributes as much as possible towards reaching the target sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    x = int(input[1])\n    s = 0\n    for num in input[2:2+n]:\n        s += int(num)\n    if s == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    t = -s\n    absolute_t = abs(t)\n    k = (absolute_t + x - 1) // x  # Equivalent to ceil(absolute_t / x)\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of found cards `n`, the maximum absolute value `x`, and the list of integers representing the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n- **Required Sum Adjustment**: If the sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n- **Absolute Value and Ceiling Calculation**: For non-zero sums, compute the absolute value of the required adjustment and determine the minimal number of cards using the ceiling of the division of the absolute value by `x`.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal number of cards needed by leveraging the properties of integer division and ceiling functions, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
