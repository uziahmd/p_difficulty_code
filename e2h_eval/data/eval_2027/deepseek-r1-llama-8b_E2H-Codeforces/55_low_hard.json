    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So, for example, \"01\" can become \"10\", and \"12\" can become \"21\". But you can't swap '0' and '2' directly because they aren't adjacent in the swap rules. So, what does that mean for the overall arrangement of the string?\n\nHmm, I think it implies that '0's can move past each other, but they can't jump over '2's unless there's a '1' involved. Wait, maybe I should model the allowed movements.\n\nLet me think: since we can swap '0' with '1', any '0' can move to the right past any number of '1's, as long as there are no '2's blocking. Similarly, a '1' can move past a '2' because we can swap them. So, perhaps the order of '0's, '1's, and '2's can be rearranged in some way.\n\nWait, but how? Because the allowed swaps only allow certain adjacent changes. Let's see:\n\n- '0' can swap with '1' (so 0 and 1 are exchangeable)\n- '1' can swap with '2' (so 1 and 2 are exchangeable)\nBut '0' cannot swap with '2' directly.\n\nSo, considering that, let's see the possible groupings. For example, a '0' can move past a '1', but can't move past a '2' unless there's a '1' between them. Because if a '0' is followed by a '2', you can't swap them, but if there's a '1' between, then the '0' can move through.\n\nWait, perhaps the key here is that '0's can be reordered among themselves, but their relative positions to '2's are fixed unless there's a '1' in between. Or maybe not. Maybe '0's can't pass '2's unless there's a path via '1's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0's can be arranged in any order relative to '1's, and '1's can be arranged in any order relative to '2's, but '0's and '2's cannot swap directly. So the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed in some way.\n\nWait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"021\".\n\nWe can perform swaps as follows: \n\nThe first two characters are '0' and '2'; we can't swap them. So the '0' can't move to the right past '2'. But wait, perhaps via another route. If I could somehow move the '1' in between, but in this case, there's no '1'.\n\nWait, wait, but the initial example given is \"010210\". They show that swapping '0' and '1' is allowed, but not '0' and '2'. So in that example, the '0's can move around '1's but can't cross '2's.\n\nSo perhaps the conclusion is that '0's can only be moved past '1's, and '1's can be moved past '0's and '2's. So the ordering between '0's and '2's is fixed because you can't swap them directly. Therefore, the relative positions of '0's and '2's in the original string determine the final arrangement.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So in the string, any '0's that appear before '2's in the original string will also appear before '2's in the minimal string, because you can't swap '0' and '2' directly. But what if there's a '1' between them? For example, in \"02\", you can't swap, so '0' stays before '2'. In \"120\", can '0' move past '2'? No, because '0' and '2' can't swap. So the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n\nWait, but what about the string \"012\"? Then '0' is before '1' and '2', but can the '1' and '2' be swapped, moving '1' to after '2'? Well, yes. So after swapping '1' and '2', the string becomes \"021\". Now, can '0' move past '2'? No, because they are adjacent and can't swap. So in this case, the minimal string would be \"012\" because you can't rearrange the '0' and '2' order.\n\nWait, but perhaps the '0' can't move past '2's at all. So the relative positions of '0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing adjacent swaps between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key insight is that '0's can only move past '1's, and '1's can move past both '0's and '2's, but '0's cannot move past '2's directly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Swapable Groups**: Recognize that '0's can be reordered among themselves and with '1's, while '1's can be reordered among themselves and with '2's. However, '0's cannot be reordered relative to '2's directly.\n2. **Process Each Character Group**: \n   - For each '0', move it as far left as possible by swapping with adjacent '1's.\n   - For each '1', move it as far left as possible by swapping with adjacent '0's or '2's.\n   - For each '2', move it as far right as possible by swapping with adjacent '1's.\n3. **Construct the Result String**: By processing each character group separately, we ensure that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    stack = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0':\n            while stack and stack[-1] == '1':\n                stack.pop()\n            stack.append(c)\n        elif c == '1':\n            while True:\n                if not stack or stack[-1] == '0':\n                    break\n                if stack[-1] == '2':\n                    break\n                stack.pop()\n            stack.append(c)\n        elif c == '2':\n            while stack and stack[-1] == '1':\n                stack.pop()\n            stack.append(c)\n    return ''.join(stack)\n\ns = input().strip()\nprint(min_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Stack Processing**: We use a stack to process each character of the string. This allows us to efficiently move characters to their correct positions by popping elements from the stack when necessary.\n- **Character Movement**:\n  - '0's are moved to the left by removing any preceding '1's.\n  - '1's are moved to the left by removing any preceding '0's or '2's (since '1's can swap with both).\n  - '2's are moved to the right by removing any preceding '1's.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that each character is processed in linear time relative to the length of the string, making the solution efficient even for large inputs.",
