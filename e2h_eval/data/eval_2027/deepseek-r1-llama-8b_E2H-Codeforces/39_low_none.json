Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find an N x N chessboard numbered in a specific way such that when a rook and a queen move according to certain rules, the rook ends up paying strictly fewer vuns than the queen. If it's not possible, I should output -1.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the chessboard is N x N, each cell has a unique number from 1 to N². The process starts with the piece (either rook or queen) on the cell with number 1, which is already visited.\n\nThe movement rules for both are as follows:\n\nFor each step:\n- The piece considers all unvisited cells reachable in one move.\n- Among these, it moves to the cell with the smallest number.\n- If there are no unvisited cells but some are still unvisited, the piece is teleported to the smallest-numbered unvisited cell. This teleportation costs 1 vun.\n\nThe goal is to arrange the numbers such that the total vuns paid by the rook is strictly less than that of the queen.\n\nHmm, so I need to model how the rook and queen move on the board and count their vuns.\n\nWait, but the movement is determined by the numbering of the cells. So the order in which the cells are visited depends on the arrangement of the numbers.\n\nI think the key is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path incurs fewer vuns than the queen's.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the movement rules again.\n\nFor the rook, each step is moving along a row or column as far as possible, choosing the minimal next cell. For the queen, each step is moving any direction (including diagonally) to the next minimal cell.\n\nSo for the rook, the movement can be seen as always moving in straight lines, selecting the next smallest cell in the same row or column.\n\nThe queen's movement is similar but includes diagonal steps, so potentially more options, leading to a different path.\n\nThe fee happens when the teleportation occurs, i.e., when all directly reachable cells are already visited, but there are still unvisited cells. So the teleportation is forced, costing 1 vun.\n\nWait, but the teleportation isn't part of the normal movement. It's only triggered when all possible moves (i.e., in one step) are already visited. Then, the piece jumps to the smallest unvisited cell, paying a fee.\n\nSo, the process continues until all cells are visited.\n\nThe question is whether the total number of teleportations (vuns) for the rook is less than that for the queen.\n\nSo, I need to construct a grid where the number of teleportations during the rook's traversal is less than that for the queen.\n\nLet me consider small N cases.\n\nWhen N=1: There's only one cell. No movement, so no vuns. So both pay zero. But since the problem requires the rook to pay strictly less, which would be true here, but the sample input for N=1 isn't given. Wait, in the first sample, input is '1', but the output is '-1'. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first sample.\n\nWait the sample input seems to be a string, but perhaps it's a typo. Anyway, the problem says for N=1, both pay zero, so the condition is satisfied. So why does the first sample output -1? Or perhaps the first sample is incorrect. Wait no, looking back, the first sample input is ['1', '4'], but perhaps it's not. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nSample Input:\n['1', '4']\n\nWait, no, looking at the problem statement, the input is a single integer N. So maybe the first sample is N=4, but the output is a 4x4 grid.\n\nWait, regardless, let me think about N=2.\n\nFor N=2, the grid is 2x2.\n\nWe need to arrange the numbers 1 to 4 in such a way that the rook's teleportations are less than the queen's.\n\nBut perhaps for N=2, it's possible or impossible.\n\nWait, let's think about the rook's movement.\n\nIn a 2x2 grid, the rook starts at 1.\n\nPossible next steps for the rook: it can move in the same row or column as 1. Suppose 1 is at position (1,1). Then, the rook can go to (1,2) or (2,1), assuming those cells have numbers 2 and 3, for example.\n\nWait, but the numbers are arranged in a way that determines the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arranging the grid such that the rook's movement is efficient, while the queen's is more expensive.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in a way that the rook's path doesn't",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists an N x N chessboard numbered such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns than a queen during their traversal. If such a board exists, we must construct it; otherwise, we return -1.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to arrange the numbers on the board in a way that minimizes the number of teleportations (and thus vuns) for the rook while potentially maximizing them for the queen. The rook's movement is constrained to rows and columns, while the queen can move diagonally as well. By carefully placing the numbers, we can control the paths each piece takes.\n\n1. **Rook Movement**: The rook moves in straight lines (rows and columns), always choosing the next smallest numbered cell.\n2. **Queen Movement**: The queen can move in any direction (including diagonally), which might lead to more frequent teleportations if the path is less straightforward.\n\nWe can achieve the desired condition by arranging the numbers in such a way that the rook's path is efficient, avoiding unnecessary teleportations, while the queen's path may involve more steps, leading to more teleportations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if N == 1:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n\n    # Initialize the grid with zeros\n    grid = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]\n    current_num = 1\n    visited = [ [False for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]\n    start = (0, 0)\n    visited[start[0]][start[1]] = True\n    grid[start[0]][start[1]] = current_num\n    current_num += 1\n\n    # Directions for rook: up, down, left, right\n    rook_dirs = [ (-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1) ]\n    # Directions for queen: all 8 directions\n    queen_dirs = [ (-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1) ]\n\n    # Function to get next minimal cell for rook\n    def get_next_rook_pos(current_pos):\n        min_val = float('inf')\n        best_pos = None\n        for d in rook_dirs:\n            new_r = current_pos[0] + d[0]\n            new_c = current_pos[1] + d[1]\n            if 0 <= new_r < N and 0 <= new_c < N:\n                if not visited[new_r][new_c]:\n                    val = grid[new_r][new_c]\n                    if val < min_val:\n                        min_val = val\n                        best_pos = (new_r, new_c)\n        return best_pos\n\n    # Function to get next minimal cell for queen\n    def get_next_queen_pos(current_pos):\n        min_val = float('inf')\n        best_pos = None\n        for d in queen_dirs:\n            new_r = current_pos[0] + d[0]\n            new_c = current_pos[1] + d[1]\n            if 0 <= new_r < N and 0 <= new_c < N:\n                if not visited[new_r][new_c]:\n                    val = grid[new_r][new_c]\n                    if val < min_val:\n                        min_val = val\n                        best_pos = (new_r, new_c)\n        return best_pos\n\n    # Place numbers in a spiral pattern starting from the top-left corner\n    num = 2\n    dirs = [ (-1,0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,-1) ]  # right, down, left, up\n    r, c = 0, 0\n    for _ in range(4*(N-1)):\n        dr, dc = dirs[(len(dirs)//2):][(_ % 4)]\n        nr = r + dr\n        nc = c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < N and 0 <= nc < N and not visited[nr][nc]:\n            grid[nr][nc] = num\n            visited[nr][nc] = True\n            r, c = nr, nc\n            num += 1\n        else:\n            dr, dc = dirs[:len(dirs)//2]\n            nr = r + dr\n            nc = c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < N and 0 <= nc < N and not visited[nr][nc]:\n                grid[nr][nc] = num\n                visited[nr][nc] = True\n                r, c = nr, nc\n                num += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n    # Fill the remaining cells\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if not visited[i][j]:\n                grid[i][j] = num\n                visited[i][j] = True\n                num += 1\n\n    # Now, simulate both paths\n    # Rook's path simulation\n    rook_vuns = 0\n    pos = (0, 0)\n    while True:\n        possible_moves = []\n        for d in rook_dirs:\n            nr = pos[0] + d[0]\n            nc = pos[1] + d[1]\n            if 0 <= nr < N and 0 <= nc < N and not visited[nr][nc]:\n                possible_moves.append( (nr, nc, grid[nr][nc]) )\n        if not possible_moves:\n            break\n        min_val = min([grid[m[0]][m[1]] for m in possible_moves])\n        found = False\n        for m in possible_moves:\n            if m[2] == min_val:\n                pos = m\n                visited[pos[0]][pos[1]] = True\n                if m[2] != 1:  # Only teleport when moving from 1?\n                    rook_vuns += 1\n                found = True\n                break\n        if not found:\n            # No possible moves, but some cells are unvisited?
