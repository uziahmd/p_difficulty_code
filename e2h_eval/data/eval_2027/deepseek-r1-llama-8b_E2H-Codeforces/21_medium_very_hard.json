The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. The goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the keys. Each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by only one key.\n\nHmm, the condition for a key j to unlock chest i is that a_i + b_j is odd. So that means one must be even and the other odd. Because even plus odd is odd, right?\n\nSo, to rephrase: For a chest with a_i even, we need a key with b_j odd. And vice versa. Wait, no: wait, a_i + b_j mod 2 should be 1. So if a_i is even (0 mod 2), then b_j must be 1 mod 2. Similarly, if a_i is odd, b_j must be even.\n\nSo the first step is to separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly, separate the keys into even and odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between the number of even a_i chests and the number of even b_j keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd a_i chests and the number of odd b_j keys. Because each group can pair as much as possible.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose there are:\n\n- Even chests: E_a\n- Odd chests: O_a\n\nKeys:\n- Even keys: E_b\n- Odd keys: O_b\n\nEach even chest needs an odd key, and each odd chest needs an even key.\n\nSo the number of even chests that can be unlocked is min(E_a, O_b). Because each even chest requires an odd key, but the number of available odd keys is O_b.\n\nSimilarly, the number of odd chests that can be unlocked is min(O_a, E_b).\n\nThe total is the sum of these two.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the a array and count how many are even and odd.\n3. Read the b array and count how many are even and odd.\n4. Compute the sum as min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n5. Output that sum.\n\nWait, but what about when some chests or keys are not used? Like, maybe we can't use all because of the counts. But no, the approach above already considers the maximum possible pairs.\n\nFor example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\nSo a_i are 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So even_a is 3, odd_a is 2.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20] → 8 (even),4 (even),7 (odd),20 (even). So even_b is 3, odd_b is 1.\n\nSo even_a is 3, which can pair with odd_b (1) → min(3,1)=1.\n\nOdd_a is 2, which can pair with even_b (3) → min(2,3)=2.\n\nTotal is 1+2=3, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example:\n\nSecond input:\n\nn=5, m=1\n\na has 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb is 5, which is odd. So even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nSo even_a can pair with odd_b: min(5,1)=1.\n\nOdd_a is 0, so nothing. Total 1.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is 10 → even.\n\nb is 20,30,40,50 → all even.\n\nSo even_a=1, needs odd_b. But odd_b is 0. So nothing.\n\nThus total 0.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nIn Python, I can read the inputs, count the evens and odds for a and b.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead a list, count even_a and odd_a.\n\nRead b list, count even_b and odd_b.\n\nCompute total = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nPrint total.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when the sum of even_a and odd_a exceeds the total n? No, because even_a + odd_a = n.\n\nSimilarly for b.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nWhat about the case where m is larger than n? Doesn't matter, since each key can be used once.\n\nSo, the code would be straightforward.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All a are even, all b are even. Then even_a needs odd_b, which is zero. So no chests can be opened.\n\nCase 2: Some a even, some odd; same for b.\n\nI think this logic covers all scenarios.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead the first line as n, m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the third line as another list.\n\nWait, the input format is such that the first line is two numbers, the second is n numbers, the third is m numbers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\nb = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nmax_even_chests = min(even_a, odd_b)\nmax_odd_chests = min(odd_a, even_b)\n\ntotal = max_even_chests + max_odd_chests\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting with the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\na has 3 evens, 2 odds.\n\nb has 3 evens, 1 odd.\n\nmax_even_chests = min(3,1) =1.\n\nmax_odd_chests = min(2,3)=2.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nSample 2:\n\na has 5 evens, 0 odds.\n\nb has 0 evens, 1 odd.\n\nmax_even_chests = min(5,1)=1.\n\nmax_odd_chests = min(0, 0)=0.\n\nTotal 1.\n\nSample3:\n\na has 1 even.\n\nb has 4 evens, 0 odds.\n\nSo even_a=1, odd_b=0 → 0.\n\nodd_a=0, even_b=4 →0.\n\nTotal 0.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na: [1,2,3] → even_a=1, odd_a=2.\n\nb: [4,5,6] → even_b=2, odd_b=1.\n\nmax_even_chests = min(1,1) =1.\n\nmax_odd_chests = min(2,2)=2.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\na: [2,4] → even_a=2, odd_a=0.\n\nb: [3,5] → even_b=0, odd_b=2.\n\nSo even_a can use odd_b: min(2,2)=2.\n\nBut since even_a is 2, which is more than the available odd_b (2), so 2.\n\nAnd odd_a is 0, so nothing.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using given keys. Each key can unlock a specific type of chest based on their parity (odd or even).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each key can unlock a chest if the sum of the key number and the chest number is odd. This means that an even-numbered key can only unlock an odd-numbered chest, and an odd-numbered key can only unlock an even-numbered chest.\n2. **Categorization**: Separate the chests into two groups: those with even numbers and those with odd numbers. Similarly, separate the keys into two groups: those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n3. **Matching**: The maximum number of chests that can be unlocked is determined by how well the keys can match the chests:\n   - Even-numbered chests can be unlocked using odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests can be unlocked using even-numbered keys.\n4. **Counting**: Count the number of even and odd chests and keys. Use these counts to determine the maximum possible matches between even/odd keys and chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\nb = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nmax_even_chests = min(even_a, odd_b)\nmax_odd_chests = min(odd_a, even_b)\n\ntotal = max_even_chests + max_odd_chests\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of chests `n` and keys `m`, followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parity**: We count how many chests have even and odd numbers. Similarly, we count how many keys have even and odd numbers.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Matches**: For each type of chest (even or odd), we determine the maximum number of keys available that can unlock them. This is done by taking the minimum of the count of the required key type and the available key count.\n4. **Summing Up**: The total number of chests that can be unlocked is the sum of the maximum matches for both even and odd chests.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, considering all edge cases and constraints.",
