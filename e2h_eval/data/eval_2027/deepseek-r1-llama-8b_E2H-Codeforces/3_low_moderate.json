Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l in length. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d so that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, let's think about the approach. How can we model this?\n\nWell, each lantern covers a certain interval. The union of all these intervals must cover the entire [0, l] interval. We need to find the smallest d that allows this.\n\nSo, maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. For each lantern, determine how far left and right it can reach based on d.\n3. Find the gaps between the coverage of consecutive lanterns and ensure they are covered. The largest gap will dictate part of the required d, but perhaps not entirely because other lanterns might help.\n\nWait, but the minimal d is determined by the maximum of two things: the coverage needed at the ends (from the first and last lantern) and the maximum gap between the coverage of adjacent lanterns when sorted.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nFirst, sort all the lantern positions. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the distance between them. The required d must be large enough so that the distance between them doesn't leave any gaps. So for each pair, the required d is at least (distance - (diameter of coverage from each lantern? Wait no, perhaps more accurately: the two lanterns' coverage areas overlap if their positions are within 2d apart. Because each can cover d to the left and right.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify: the coverage of a lantern at position a_i is [a_i - d, a_i + d]. But since the street is from 0 to l, the actual coverage is [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)].\n\nBut for the entire street to be covered, the union of all these intervals must be [0, l].\n\nNow, to find the minimal d, perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the lanterns such that their coverage is as efficient as possible. However, given the fixed positions, the minimal d is determined by the worst case.\n\nSo the minimal d must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. The first lantern must cover from 0 to some point. The second condition is that the last lantern must cover up to l.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but considering that the first lantern may not reach 0 if it's placed at a higher position. Similarly, the last lantern may not reach l if placed too low.\n\nWait, no, because each lantern can cover from a_i -d to a_i +d. So for the first lantern, if it's at position x, then its left coverage is x -d. To cover 0, x -d must be <=0, which implies d >=x. But wait, that's only if the lantern is at x. If x is 0, then no problem. So for the first lantern, the minimal d required is such that 0 is covered. That is, the first lantern's left coverage must reach 0. So, if the first lantern is at a_1, then a_1 -d <=0 => d >= a_1. Similarly, for the last lantern, a_n +d >= l => d >= l -a_n.\n\nBut also, between consecutive lanterns, there might be a gap that requires d to be sufficient to bridge it.\n\nWait, but how do the consecutive lanterns interact? Suppose we have two lanterns at positions x and y, with x < y. The first covers up to x +d, and the second starts at y -d. To cover the area between x and y without a gap, we need x +d >= y -d. Rearranging, x +d >= y -d => 2d >= y -x. So d >= (y -x)/2.\n\nSo, for each consecutive pair, the required d must be at least (y -x)/2.\n\nAdditionally, the first lantern must cover 0, so d >= a_1, and the last lantern must cover l, so d >= l -a_n.\n\nTherefore, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a_1 (to cover 0)\n- l - a_n (to cover l)\n- the maximum of (y -x)/2 for all consecutive pairs (to ensure no gaps between lanterns)\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in increasing order.\n2. Compute the required d for each condition and take the maximum.\n\nThat makes sense",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns cover the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). The approach involves analyzing the coverage of each lantern and ensuring that the entire street is illuminated.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps us efficiently analyze the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Coverage Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the gap between their coverage areas. The required radius \\( d \\) must be sufficient to bridge these gaps.\n3. **Check Endpoints**: Ensure that the first lantern covers the start of the street (0) and the last lantern covers the end of the street (\\( l \\)). This gives us two additional conditions for \\( d \\).\n\nThe minimal radius \\( d \\) is determined by the maximum value among:\n- The position of the first lantern (to cover 0).\n- The distance from the last lantern to \\( l \\) (to cover \\( l \\)).\n- The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2 (to ensure no coverage gaps).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = float(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        if required_d > max_gap:\n            max_gap = required_d\n    \n    d1 = a[0]\n    dn = l - a[-1]\n    final_d = max(d1, dn, max_gap)\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(final_d))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns \\( n \\), the length of the street \\( l \\), and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Gap Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap is calculated, and the required radius \\( d \\) is determined based on this gap. The maximum of these values is tracked.\n4. **Endpoints Check**: The radius must be large enough to cover the start (0) and the end (\\( l \\)) of the street. This is checked by comparing with the positions of the first and last lanterns.\n5. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum value obtained from the above checks, ensuring complete coverage of the street.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required radius while considering both the gaps between lanterns and the endpoints of the street.",
