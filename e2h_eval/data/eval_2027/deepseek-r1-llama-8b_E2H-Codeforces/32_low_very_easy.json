    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is about an array stabilization problem. We're given an array of integers, and we need to remove exactly one element to minimize the instability of the resulting array. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to find which element to remove so that when we compute max - min of the remaining elements, it's as small as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The straightforward way would be for each element, remove it, then compute the max and min of the remaining array, find their difference, and keep track of the minimum such difference. But wait, if n is up to 1e5, doing this naively would take O(n^2) time, which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but what's the alternative? Let's consider the original array. Suppose the original max is M and the original min is m. When we remove an element, the new max could be less than M or remain M, and similarly for the min.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal instability after removal isn't necessarily lower than the original (M - m), because sometimes removing a certain element might not change the max or min much.\n\nBut wait, maybe the minimal instability can be found by considering the cases where either the max or the min comes from the same array except one element.\n\nLet me think differently. What's the minimal possible instability after removing one element?\n\nIt's the minimal value among:\n\n- The max of the array without the current max minus the min of the array without the current max.\n- The max of the array without the current min minus the min of the array without the current min.\n- The original instability (if removing some other elements doesn't affect it).\n\nWait, but that's not quite accurate. Because when you remove an element that's neither the max nor the min, the new max could still be the original max, and the new min could be the original min, so the instability remains the same as the original.\n\nWait no, if you remove an element that's not the max or min, then the max and min of the array are still the same as before. So the instability is the same as the original M - m.\n\nSo in that case, the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the original instability and the minimal instability when removing a max or min.\n\nWait, no. Because maybe when you remove a non-max and non-min element, the max and min don't change, so the instability is the same as the original. So the minimal instability can't be better than the original unless we remove a max or a min.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the original max (M) and min (m). Compute original instability as D = M - m.\n\n2. Then, for each occurrence of M, see what happens when we remove it. The new array will have a new max, which is the second highest value. Similarly, for each occurrence of m, removing it would make the new min the second lowest value.\n\n3. The minimal instability would be the minimum between D and the minimal of all the instabilities when removing each M or m.\n\nWait, but if there are multiple occurrences of M or m, do I have to consider all of them?\n\nYes, because each occurrence's removal could potentially result in different new max or min.\n\nFor example, suppose the array has two Ms. Removing one of them would leave the other M, so the new max is M again, but the new min might stay the same or not. Wait, no, the new max is still M, but the min remains m only if there are other elements.\n\nWait, let me take an example. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. The original max is 7, min is 1. D is 6.\n\nIf I remove 7, the new array is [1,3,3], with max 3, min 1, so D is 2. That's better than 6.\n\nAnother example: the input is ['2\\n1 100000'].\n\nOriginal max is 100000, min is 1. D is 99999.\n\nIf I remove 1, the new array is [100000], so max and min are equal. D is 0.\n\nSimilarly, if I remove 100000, the new array is [1], D is 0. So the minimal D is 0.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal D is achieved by removing either the max or the min.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCompute the original D.\n\nCompute the minimal possible D when we remove each occurrence of M, and each occurrence of m.\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum between the original D and the minimal D obtained from these removals.\n\nWait, but wait. Because removing a max may not always decrease",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, find the maximum (max_val) and minimum (min_val) values in the array. Calculate the initial instability as `max_val - min_val`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Removal of Extremes**: The minimal instability can potentially be achieved by removing either the current maximum or minimum value. For each occurrence of these values, compute the new instability after their removal.\n\n3. **Compute Minimum Instability**: The minimum instability will be the smallest value obtained from the initial instability and the instabilities computed after removing each occurrence of the maximum and minimum values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmax_val = max(a)\nmin_val = min(a)\ninitial = max_val - min_val\n\ncandidates = []\n\n# Check for each occurrence of max_val\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\nfor i in range(count_max):\n    # Remove the i-th occurrence of max_val\n    temp = a[:i] + a[i+1:]\n    current_max = max(temp)\n    current_min = min(temp)\n    candidates.append(current_max - current_min)\n\n# Check for each occurrence of min_val\ncount_min = a.count(min_val)\nfor i in range(count_min):\n    # Remove the i-th occurrence of min_val\n    temp = a[:i] + a[i+1:]\n    current_max = max(temp)\n    current_min = min(temp)\n    candidates.append(current_max - current_min)\n\n# The minimal candidate is the answer\nprint(min(candidates))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Initial Setup**: Compute the initial maximum and minimum values and their difference (instability).\n3. **Remove Extremes**: For each occurrence of the maximum and minimum values, simulate their removal and compute the resulting instability.\n4. **Determine Minimum**: Track the minimum instability across all simulated removals and print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal element to remove, considering both the initial instability and potential reductions by removing extreme values.",
