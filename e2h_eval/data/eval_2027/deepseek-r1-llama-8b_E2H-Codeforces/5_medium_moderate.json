Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And also, output these pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem better.\n\nSo, each left boot has a color (a lowercase letter or '?'), same for right boots. Two colors are compatible if they're the same or one is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the description: an indefinite color (i.e., '?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color. So, when either is '?', they are compatible. Otherwise, their colors must be exactly the same.\n\nSo, for example:\n- 'f' and 'f' are compatible.\n- '?' and 'z' are compatible.\n- 'a' and '?' are compatible.\n- '?' and '?' are compatible.\n\nBut 'f' and 'g' are not, and 'a' and 'z' aren't.\n\nSo, the task is to pair each left boot with a right boot, without reusing any, such that the number of compatible pairs is maximized.\n\nI need to compute the maximum possible k, and then list all such pairs.\n\nThe output requires the count and then each pair in some order. It's important that the left indices are unique and the right indices are unique as well.\n\nHow do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the straightforward approach would be to check every possible pair, but with n up to 150000, that's O(n^2), which is way too slow. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about grouping the left and right boots by their color (or question mark). Then, for each possible combination, calculate how many pairs can be formed.\n\nWait, but that's not enough because the question marks can match anything. So perhaps the optimal strategy involves maximizing the use of question marks.\n\nAnother idea: For each position in left and right, determine if l[i] and r[j] are compatible. But again, checking all i and j isn't feasible.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right nodes if their colors are compatible. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum matching in this graph. But even that would be O(n^2), which is impossible for n=15e5.\n\nSo, alternative approach: count the number of possible pairs based on the color combinations, considering the question marks as wildcards.\n\nLet's think in terms of frequencies:\n\n- For each color c, count how many left boots are c and how many right boots are c. Then, the minimum of these two counts can be added to the total pairs.\n\n- Also, consider the case where one side is a question mark and the other is any color. So, the number of question marks on the left multiplied by the number of non-question mark on the right, plus the number of question marks on the right multiplied by the number of non-question mark on the left. But wait, no— because the question mark can match any, including each other.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nTotal pairs = sum over all c (min(left_c, right_c)) ) + (left_? * right_total - left_? * right_?) + (right_? * left_total - right_? * left_?) - (left_? * right_?) \n\nWait, no, that seems complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, let me think of the problem in terms of the number of possible compatible pairs without any constraints except that each boot can be used at most once.\n\nWait, but that's the crux. Because when you have multiple options, choosing which ones to pair can affect the total.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\n1. Precompute for each left boot, the set of right boots it can be paired with.\n\n2. Then, model this as a bipartite graph and find a maximum matching.\n\nBut for n=15e5, that's impossible because the graph would have 15e5^2 edges, which is way too big.\n\nSo, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the problem allows us to choose any subset of pairs as long as each left and right index is used once, perhaps we can model it using frequency counts and some clever counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of the minimums for each color, plus the remaining question marks.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nFirst, for each specific color c, the number of possible pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nThen, the remaining left and right boots are those that couldn't be paired because one side ran out. These remaining boots include the question marks and possibly some specific colors.\n\nSo, for the remaining left boots (those that weren't paired in the specific color count) and the remaining right boots, the question marks can pair with any of them.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to first pair as many specific colors as possible, then pair the remaining question marks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for all c, plus the number of question marks on the left multiplied by the number of question marks on the right.\n\nWait, no. Because when you have left_? and right_?, each can form a pair, but that's already included in the initial sum if c='?'.\n\nWait, no, because '?' is treated as a wildcard, so for c='?', the min(left_?, right_?) is part of the sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's more accurate to split the process into:\n\n1. For each specific color c (excluding '?'), add min(left_c, right_c) to the total.\n\n2. Then, the remaining left and right boots are those that couldn't be paired in step 1. For these, since they include some specific colors and the question marks, we can see how many can be paired by using the question marks.\n\nBut wait, the question marks can pair with any, including those that are still unpaired.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is:\n\nCompute the maximum possible pairs by:\n\n- For each color c (including '?'), compute the minimum of the left count and right count. Sum these up.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because when c is '?', the left_? can pair with any right_? and any specific right colors, but when you process c='?', you might be double-counting.\n\nNo, because for the specific color processing, when c is not '?', you process it once. Then, for the '?', you process it once, which includes pairing with any remaining.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is to compute for each color c, the min of left_count[c] and right_count[c]. Then, the sum of these is the maximum possible pairs. But this isn't correct because when you process '?', you might be adding more than possible.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose left has l = \"a?\", right has r = \"?a\".\n\nFor color 'a', min(1,1) = 1.\n\nFor color '?', min(1,1) = 1. So sum is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, as we can pair (left 0, right 0) and (left 1, right 1).\n\nAnother example:\n\nLeft: \"a\", right: \"b\".\n\nColor a: min 1,0 → 0.\n\nColor b: min 0,1 → 0.\n\nColor ? on left is 0, right is 0.\n\nSo sum is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nLeft: \"?a\", right: \"a?\".\n\nSo for color 'a', left_count is 1, right_count is 1 → 1 pair.\n\nFor color '?', left_count is 1, right_count is 1 → 1 pair.\n\nSum is 2, but the actual maximum is 2.\n\nSo, the initial approach of summing min(left_c, right_c) for all c works here.\n\nWait, but what about when there's overlapping? Like left is \"?a\", right is \"ab\".\n\nWait, left_count['a'] is 1, right_count['a'] is 1 → 1 pair.\n\nLeft_count['?'] is 1, right_count['?'] is 0 → 0.\n\nSo sum is 1.\n\nBut in reality, the '?' can pair with 'b' in right. So the maximum is 2.\n\nAh! So the initial approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility that the '?' can pair with other colors beyond their own count.\n\nSo, the initial approach is not sufficient.\n\nHmm, that complicates things.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\n1. Compute the number of pairs for each specific color.\n\n2. Then, handle the question marks and remaining specific colors.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_c, right_c) for all c, plus the number of question marks in left times the number of question marks in right, minus the overlaps.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nEach pair can be of three types:\n\n- Both are specific colors and same.\n\n- Left is '?', right is any.\n\n- Right is '?', left is any.\n\nBut wait, no. Because a left '?' can pair with a right '?', but that's covered in both cases.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows:\n\nThe total pairs is equal to:\n\nsum_{c} min(left_c, right_c) + (left_? * right_?) + (left_non? * right_? - left_? * right_?) + (right_non? * left_? - left_? * right_?)\n\nWait, no, maybe that's getting too complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible pairs is:\n\nsum for each color c (including '?') of min(left_c, right_c) plus the number of question marks in left multiplied by (total_right - right_?), but only if that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that after pairing all possible specific colors, the remaining left and right boots can be paired using the question marks.\n\nSo, after step 1, the number of left boots left is L = total_left - sum (min(left_c, right_c)) for all c.\n\nSimilarly, R = total_right - sum (min(left_c, right_c)) for all c.\n\nWait, but L and R would not necessarily be just the question marks. Because, for example, a left boot could be 'a' and right could be 'b'; after pairing all a's and b's, the 'a' left is not considered, but 'a' and 'b' are specific.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn step 1, for each color c, we add min(left_c, right_c) to the total. So for each c, any pairs are formed by taking the minimum of left and right counts.\n\nAfter that, the remaining left boots are those that were not matched in their own color. Similarly for right.\n\nThese remaining left and right boots are those that couldn't find a pair in their own color. So, for example, a left 'a' whose right 'a' is all used up, but the left is not used yet.\n\nWait, no. Because when you process color 'a', you take as many pairs as possible. So, any left 'a's beyond that are unprocessed and can't be part of a pair unless they are paired via the question mark.\n\nSo, after step 1, the remaining left and right boots are those that couldn't be matched in their own color.\n\nThese remaining boots can be paired using the question marks.\n\nSo, the remaining left is L = sum (left_c - min(left_c, right_c)) for all c.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining right is R = sum (right_c - min(left_c, right_c)) for all c.\n\nNow, any pair can be formed between these L and R boots, provided that either the left is '?' or the right is '?'. Because only then are they compatible.\n\nWait, no. Because the remaining left and right may have colors that are specific, but if one is a question mark, they can form a pair.\n\nWait, perhaps the remaining left and right can be thought of as follows:\n\nThe remaining left is the set of boots that are not used in step 1, which could be specific colors or question marks.\n\nSimilarly for the remaining right.\n\nNow, the maximum number of additional pairs we can form is the number of pairs where at least one is a question mark.\n\nBecause only then can they pair.\n\nSo, the number of such pairs is the number of pairs (x, y) where x is in the remaining left, y is in the remaining right, and x and y are compatible.\n\nBut since n is large, we can't compute this directly.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of such pairs is the minimum of the number of question marks in remaining left and remaining right, plus the number of non-question mark in remaining left multiplied by the number of question marks in remaining right.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think:\n\nEach pair in the remaining must consist of at least one question mark.\n\nSo, the possible scenarios are:\n\n- Left is '?': can pair with any right (including '?' and specific).\n\n- Right is '?': can pair with any left (including '?' and specific).\n\nBut if both are specific, they can only pair if their colors are same. However, in the remaining, their color wasn't able to pair in step 1, meaning that for a left of color c and right of color d, if c != d, they can't be paired now.\n\nSo, the remaining pairs can be formed as follows:\n\nCount the number of question marks in the remaining left (QL) and the remaining right (QR). Then, the maximum number of pairs is QL * QR + (number of non-? in left) * (number of ? in right) + (number of ? in left) * (number of non-? in right) - ... Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as:\n\nThe total possible pairs from the remaining is:\n\nQL * QR + (left_non_q * right_non_q) ?\n\nNo, because left_non_q can only pair with right_non_q if their colors are same. But in the remaining, since we've already processed all specific pairs, the non-? left and non-? right may have different colors.\n\nWait, but in the remaining, for a left of color c and right of color d, if c != d, they can't pair. So, the only way to pair non-? left and right is if they have the same color, but that's already accounted for in step 1.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining, the non-? can't form any new pairs, except if one is a question mark.\n\nSo, the only way to pair in the remaining is:\n\nEither:\n\n- Left is '?', right is any (including ?)\n\n- Right is '?', left is any (including ?)\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because if both are '?', they can pair as well.\n\nWait, but the above is the case regardless. So, the number of additional pairs is the maximum number of pairs where at least one is a question mark.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nWait, the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nQL * QR + (QL * (R_non_q)) + (QK * L_non_q) - (QL * QR) ?\n\nNo, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nThe total number of additional pairs is the number of pairs where at least one is a question mark.\n\nSo, for the remaining left and right:\n\nLet QL = number of ? in remaining left.\n\nQR = number of ? in remaining right.\n\nOther than that, let A be the number of non-? in remaining left, and B the number of non-? in remaining right.\n\nNow, any pair (x,y) where x is in (A ∪ QL) and y is in (B ∪ QR) and (x is ? OR y is ? OR x == y) will be a compatible pair.\n\nBut since in the remaining, the non-? can't form pairs among themselves (because their colors are already processed in step 1 and couldn't find a match), the only possible pairs are:\n\n- x is ?, y is anything.\n\n- y is ?, x is anything.\n\nBut x and y can't both be non-? because their colors are different.\n\nSo, the number of additional pairs is:\n\nQL * (QR + B) + QR * A - (QL * QR) ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nEach pair in the remaining can be formed if:\n\nEither x is ? or y is ?.\n\nBut since the pair can consist of one being ? and the other being anything, including another ?.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs is:\n\nmin(QL, QR) + (QL * (B + QR - QL)) ) + (QR * (A + QL - QR)) )\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, the total is:\n\nmax_pairs_remaining = QL * QR + QL * B + QR * A\n\nBecause:\n\n- QL * QR: pairs where both are ?.\n\n- QL * B: pairs where left is ? and right is non-?.\n\n- QR * A: pairs where right is ? and left is non-?.\n\nBut wait, this counts some pairs twice. For example, a pair where left is ? and right is ? is counted in both QL*QR and QL*B and QR*A.\n\nWait, no, because QL*QR is the number of such pairs, and then QL*B and QR*A are the others. So, adding them together would double count the QL*QR.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs_remaining = min(QL, QR) + QL * (B + QR) + QR * (A + QL) - QL * QR.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to compute the maximum possible as the sum of all possible pairs where at least one is a ?.\n\nWhich is:\n\npairs = (QL * (A + B + QR)) + (QR * (A + B + QL)) - (QL * QR) \n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nQL * (A + B + QR) + QR * (A + B + QL) - QL * QR.\n\nBut I'm not confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the sum of all possible pairs where x is ? or y is ?.\n\nBut since each pair is counted once, the total is:\n\nQL * (QR + B) + QR * A.\n\nBecause:\n\n- QL can pair with QR (? and ?) → QL*QR pairs.\n\n- QL can pair with B (non-? on right) → QL * B.\n\n- QR can pair with A (non-? on left) → QR * A.\n\nSo, total is QL*QR + QL*B + QR*A.\n\nWait, but that's adding all three possibilities, but that's correct.\n\nBecause:\n\n- Each pair where x is ? and y is any → QL*(QR + B).\n\n- Each pair where y is ? and x is any → QR*(A + QL) → but wait, QL is already counted in the first term.\n\nWait, but that would double count the cases where both are ?. Because x is ? and y is ?, which is counted in both terms.\n\nSo, the correct way is to avoid double counting.\n\nSo, the formula should be:\n\npairs = QL * (B + QR) + QR * A - QL * QR.\n\nBecause:\n\n- QL*(B + QR) covers all pairs where x is ?.\n\nThis includes the cases where y is ? (QL*QR) and where y is non-? (QL*B).\n\nThen, QR*A covers all pairs where y is ? and x is non-?.\n\nBut wait, QR*A is the same as A*QR, which is the same as QR*A.\n\nSo, adding these gives:\n\nQL*(B + QR) + QR*A = QL*B + QL*QR + QR*A.\n\nWhich is the same as QL*B + QR*A + QL*QR.\n\nWhich is correct, as each of these is a distinct type of pair.\n\nWait, no, because when x is ? and y is ?, it's counted once in QL*QR. When y is ? and x is non-? it's counted in QR*A.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the formula for the additional pairs is QL*B + QR*A + QL*QR.\n\nWhich simplifies to QL*(B + QR) + QR*A.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute it as QL * (B + QR) + QR * A.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nTotal pairs = sum_over_c min(left_c, right_c) + (QL * B + QR * A + QL * QR).\n\nWait, but wait—what are QL, QR, A, B?\n\nQL is the number of ? in the remaining left.\n\nQR is the number of ? in the remaining right.\n\nA is the number of non-? in remaining left.\n\nB is the number of non-? in remaining right.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute for each color c (including '?') the min(left_c, right_c), sum these as base_pairs.\n\n2. Compute L_remaining = sum(left_c - min(left_c, right_c)) for all c.\n\n   Similarly, R_remaining = sum(right_c - min(left_c, right_c)) for all c.\n\n3. Among the L_remaining and R_remaining, compute QL = number of ? in L_remaining.\n\n   QR = number of ? in R_remaining.\n\n   A = number of non-? in L_remaining.\n\n   B = number of non-? in R_remaining.\n\n4. The additional pairs is QL * (B + QR) + QR * A.\n\n5. The total is base_pairs + additional_pairs.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, let me test with the earlier example:\n\nExample 1:\n\nLeft: \"?a\" → l = ['?', 'a']\n\nRight: \"a?\" → r = ['a', '?']\n\nStep 1:\n\nFor color 'a': left has 1, right has 1 → min is 1. So base_pairs +=1.\n\nFor color '?': left has 1, right has 1 → min is 1. So base_pairs +=1.\n\nSo base_pairs = 2.\n\nL_remaining: for each color, left_c - min(left_c, right_c):\n\ncolor 'a': left_c -1 =0.\n\ncolor '?': 1-1=0.\n\nSo L_remaining is 0.\n\nR_remaining: color 'a' has 1-1=0, color '?' has 1-1=0.\n\nSo QL=0, QR=0.\n\nadditional_pairs = 0.\n\nSo total is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nLeft: \"?a\", right: \"ab\".\n\nl is ['?', 'a'], left_counts: 'a' →1, '?'→1.\n\nr is ['a','b'], right_counts: 'a'→1, 'b'→1, '?'→0.\n\nstep1:\n\nfor 'a': min(1,1)=1 → base_pairs +=1.\n\nfor 'b': min(0,1)=0.\n\nfor '?': min(1,0)=0.\n\nso base_pairs=1.\n\nL_remaining:\n\nleft 'a' →1-1=0.\n\nleft '?' →1-0=1.\n\nso L_remaining is 1 (the '?').\n\nR_remaining:\n\nright 'a' →1-1=0.\n\nright 'b' →1-0=1.\n\nso R_remaining is 1 ('b').\n\nQL is 1, QR is 0.\n\nA is 0 (since L_remaining is just '?').\n\nB is 1.\n\nadditional_pairs = 1*(0+1) + 0*0 = 1*1=1.\n\nSo total pairs is 1+1=2.\n\nWhich is correct because the '?' can pair with 'b'.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nLeft: \"a\", right: \"b\".\n\nbase_pairs: min(1,0) for 'a' →0; min(0,1) for 'b' →0; '?' counts as 0. So base_pairs=0.\n\nL_remaining: 1 (a) - 0 =1.\n\nR_remaining: 1 (b) -0=1.\n\nQL=0, QR=0.\n\nA=1, B=1.\n\nadditional_pairs= 0*(1+0) + 0*1=0.\n\nTotal is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nLeft: \"???\", right: \"????\"\n\nbase_pairs: min(3,3)=3 for '?'. So base_pairs=3.\n\nL_remaining: 0.\n\nR_remaining:0.\n\nadditional_pairs=0.\n\nTotal is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nLeft: \"a?\", right: \"ba?\"\n\nl counts: a:1, ?:1.\n\nr counts: b:1, a:1, ?:1.\n\nstep1:\n\nfor 'a': min(1,1) =1 → base_pairs +=1.\n\nfor 'b': min(0,1)=0.\n\nfor '?': min(1,1)=1 → base_pairs +=1.\n\nbase_pairs=2.\n\nL_remaining: a:0, ?:0.\n\nR_remaining: b:0, a:0, ?:0.\n\nadditional_pairs=0.\n\nTotal is 2.\n\nBut wait, left has 2 boots: 'a' and '?'. Right has 3 boots: 'b', 'a', '?'.\n\nIn step1, 'a' is paired with 'a' (1 pair), '?' is paired with '?' (1 pair). So 2 pairs.\n\nBut what about the 'b' on right. It's not paired. But since it's a 'b' on right, and the left has a '?', why not pair it?\n\nAh, because in step1, the '?' on left was considered as a '?', and its min with '?' on right is 1, so that's accounted for.\n\nWait, in step1, the '?' on left is paired with '?' on right.\n\nSo, the 'b' on right remains in R_remaining.\n\nSo, in step1, the base_pairs is 2. Then, L_remaining is 0, R_remaining is 1 (the 'b').\n\nSo, additional_pairs would be:\n\nQL=0, QR=0.\n\nA=0, B=1.\n\nSo additional_pairs=0.\n\nThus, total is 2.\n\nBut in reality, the '?' on left can pair with 'b' on right, which is another pair.\n\nSo the approach seems to miss that.\n\nWait, why?\n\nBecause in the step1, the '?' on left is being paired with '?' on right, but the 'b' on right is in R_remaining.\n\nSo, how can the 'b' be paired with the '?' on left.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, the step1 is for each color c, including '?'. So, the '?' on left is paired with the '?' on right, leaving 'b' on right unprocessed.\n\nSo, in the step1, the '?' on left is paired with '?' on right, so the 'b' on right is not processed.\n\nThus, in the step1, the 'b' remains in R_remaining.\n\nBut then, in the additional_pairs, the 'b' is non-? on right, and the left has no ? left.\n\nSo, the 'b' can't be paired, but in reality, it could have been paired with the '?' on left.\n\nHmm, so the approach is missing this case.\n\nSo, the initial approach is flawed.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nIn step1, when processing '?', we pair min(left_?, right_?), but perhaps the 'b' on right is in R_remaining, but could have been paired with the '?' on left.\n\nWait, no, because in step1, the '?' on left is being processed, and the '?' on right is being processed.\n\nSo, the '?' on left is paired with the '?' on right, and the 'b' on right is left.\n\nBut then, the 'b' on right can't be paired with anything else except via the question marks.\n\nBut in the additional_pairs calculation, the 'b' is non-? on right, and the left has no ? left.\n\nSo, the approach misses that.\n\nThus, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the initial approach of summing min for each color and then handling the question marks is not sufficient.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to model this?\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum over all possible color c (including '?') of min(left_c, right_c) plus the number of pairs where one is ? and the other is any.\n\nBut that's not correct because that would count some pairs twice.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate:\n\nsum_c min(left_c, right_c) + (left_? * right_total - left_? * right_?) + (right_? * left_total - right_? * left_?) - (left_? * right_?) \n\nWait, no, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs is the sum of all possible compatible pairs, which can be:\n\nsum_c min(left_c, right_c) + (left_? * right_total) + (right_? * left_total) - (left_? * right_?).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the example I had earlier.\n\nExample:\n\nLeft: \"a?\" → l = ['a', '?']\n\nRight: \"ba?\" → r = ['b', 'a', '?']\n\nSo, step1:\n\nFor 'a': left has 1, right has 1 → 1 pair.\n\nFor 'b': left 0, right 1 → 0.\n\nFor '?': left 1, right 1 → 1 pair.\n\nSo, base_pairs = 2.\n\nL_remaining: left 'a' is 1-1=0, '?' is 1-1=0 → L_remaining is 0.\n\nR_remaining: 'b' is 1-0=1, 'a' is 0, '?' is 0 → R_remaining is 1.\n\nSo, QL=0, QR=0.\n\nA=0, B=1.\n\nadditional_pairs=0.\n\nTotal is 2.\n\nBut the correct maximum is 3: pair a with a, ? with b, ? with a? Or something else.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- (0, 0): a and a → valid.\n\n- (0, 2): a and ? → valid.\n\n- (1, 0): ? and b → valid.\n\n- (1, 1): ? and a → valid.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nThe left has 0-based indices 0 and 1.\n\nRight has indices 0,1,2.\n\nSo, possible pairs:\n\nPair 0,0 → valid.\n\nPair 1,0 → a and b: invalid.\n\nPair 1,1 → a and a: valid.\n\nPair 1,2 → ? and ? → valid.\n\nWait, but the initial approach says 2 pairs, but the actual maximum is 3.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so what's the issue?\n\nIn the initial approach, the '?' on left is processed in step1, paired with the '?' on right. So, the 'b' on right remains.\n\nBut the '?' on left can also pair with 'b' on right, which would be an additional pair.\n\nSo, the approach fails to account for that.\n\nThus, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum over c of min(left_c, right_c) plus the number of ? in left multiplied by the number of ? in right, plus the number of non-? in left multiplied by the number of non-? in right, but only if their colors are same.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum for each color c of min(left_c, right_c) plus the number of pairs that can be formed by the remaining left and right, where one is a '?'.\n\nSo, the remaining left and right can be paired as follows:\n\nLet me denote the number of ? in remaining left as QL, and the number of ? in remaining right as QR.\n\nAlso, let the number of non-? in remaining left be A, and non-? in remaining right be B.\n\nThe maximum possible additional pairs is QL * QR + QL * B + QR * A.\n\nWait, in the example I had earlier:\n\nAfter step1, L_remaining is 0, R_remaining is 1 ('b').\n\nSo, QL=0, QR=0, A=0, B=1.\n\nSo, additional_pairs=0.\n\nBut in reality, the 'b' on right can be paired with the '?' on left.\n\nSo, the approach is missing this.\n\nAh, because in step1, the '?' on left is being paired with the '?' on right, but the 'b' on right is not being processed.\n\nThus, the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model the problem is to process the specific colors first, and then the question marks.\n\nBut then, the question marks can also pair with the specific colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is:\n\nsum_c min(left_c, right_c) + (number of ? in left) * (number of ? in right) + (number of ? in left) * (number of non-? in right) + (number of ? in right) * (number of non-? in left) - (number of ? in left) * (number of ? in right).\n\nBut that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to bipartite matching where edges exist between left and right if they are compatible.\n\nBut for n=15e5, it's impossible to compute.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\n- For each color c, pair as much as possible (min(left_c, right_c)).\n\n- Then, collect all the remaining left and right boots.\n\n- For the remaining, any pair is allowed as long as one is a '?'.\n\nSo, the additional pairs is the maximum number of pairs where at least one is a '?'.\n\nTo compute this, the maximum number is the number of ? in the remaining left multiplied by the number of non-? in the remaining right, plus the number of ? in remaining right multiplied by the number of non-? in remaining left, plus the number of ? in both.\n\nWait, but that seems like it's overcounting.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum additional pairs is the minimum between:\n\n(total ? in remaining left + total ? in remaining right) and (total remaining left + total remaining right).\n\nBut no, that's not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum additional pairs is the maximum possible between:\n\nmin(QL, QR) + min(QL, B) + min(QR, A).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the remaining as a bipartite graph where edges are present between any left and right if either is a '?'. But again, for n=15e5, it's not feasible.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem is more complex than initially thought.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_c, right_c) for all c plus the number of pairs between the remaining left and right, where one is a '?'.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute the sum of min(left_c, right_c) for all c.\n\nThen, compute the number of pairs where one is a '?'.\n\nBut the issue is that the '?' can pair with any, including those that are already used.\n\nSo, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_c, right_c) plus the number of pairs where one is a '?'.\n\nBut that's not correct because some of these '?' pairs may have already been counted in the initial sum.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum over c of min(left_c, right_c) plus the number of '?' on left multiplied by the number of '?' on right.\n\nBut this is not correct in cases where the '?' can pair with non-?.\n\nLike in the example I had earlier.\n\nThus, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and I need to find a different method.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nWe can model the problem as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right if their colors are compatible.\n\nThen, the maximum matching in this graph is the answer.\n\nBut for n=15e5, this is impossible to compute.\n\nThus, we need a way to compute the maximum matching efficiently.\n\nBut I don't know of any algorithm that can do this quickly.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved greedily.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_c, right_c) for all c plus the number of pairs where one is a '?' and the other is not.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs = sum_c min(left_c, right_c) + (left_? * (right_total - right_?)) + (right_? * (left_total - left_?)) - (left_? * right_?).\n\nWait, that may make sense.\n\nBecause:\n\n- sum_c min(left_c, right_c): pairs for specific colors.\n\n- left_? * (right_total - right_?): pairs where left is '?' and right is a specific color.\n\n- right_? * (left_total - left_?): pairs where right is '?' and left is a specific color.\n\nBut then, we subtract left_? * right_? because those pairs are counted twice: once in left_? * (right_total - right_?) and once in right_? * (left_total - left_?) and once in left_? * right_?.\n\nWait, but perhaps not.\n\nLet me test this formula.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nleft: \"a?\", right: \"a?\".\n\nsum_c min(left_c, right_c) for 'a' and '?': 1+1=2.\n\nleft_? =1, right_? =1.\n\nmax_pairs = 2 + 1*(1) + 1*(1) -1*1 = 2 +1+1-1=3.\n\nWhich is correct, as 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot has a color, which can be a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Two boots are compatible if they have the same color or if one of them is a question mark.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves two main steps:\n\n1. **Count Specific Pairs**: For each specific color, count the minimum number of left and right boots that can be paired. This gives the base number of pairs for specific colors.\n2. **Handle Question Marks**: After pairing as many specific colors as possible, use the remaining question mark boots on both sides to form additional pairs.
