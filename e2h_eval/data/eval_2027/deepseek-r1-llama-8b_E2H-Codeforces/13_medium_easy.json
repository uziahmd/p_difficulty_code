For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are given as strings separated by spaces, and they can be in any order. My task is to classify each chord correctly.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a major and minor triad consists of. \n\nFor a major triad, when the notes are ordered X, Y, Z, the distance from X to Y should be 4 semitones, and Y to Z should be 3 semitones. So overall, X to Z is 7 semitones. But wait, the order matters here because we're considering the distance along the scale from lower to higher. So I need to check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies this condition.\n\nSimilarly, for a minor triad, the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively. So the order would be X to Y is 3, Y to Z is 4, making X to Z 7 semitones as well. Oh, but wait, that's the same total as major. So how do I distinguish between them? Because the way the notes are arranged in the scale matters.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the example given says that C E G is major because C to E is 4 semitones, and E to G is 3. So total 7. For the minor, the example is C# B F, which when ordered as B C# F, the distance between B and C# is 3 semitones (because B to C is 1, then C to C# is another, so 2 semitones? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the note arrangement.\n\nWait, the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And after H comes C again. So each consecutive pair has a distance of 1 semitone, except perhaps some? Wait, the problem says: \"between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone.\" So each step from one note to the next in the list is 1 semitone apart.\n\nWait, but the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then back to C. So the total number of steps is 12, meaning each full cycle is 12 semitones. So the distance between any two notes is calculated as the number of steps between them in that list, but considering the cyclic nature.\n\nSo for example, C to E: C is position 0, C# 1, D 2, D# 3, E 4. So from C to E is 4 semitones. Similarly, E to C would be going the other way: E is 4, F is 5, F#6, G7, G#8, A9, B10, H11, C12-4= 8? Wait, wait. The distance is calculated from the lower tone to the upper one. So if you have two notes, the distance is (y - x) mod 12, but since the distance is from lower to higher, if y is higher than x, it's y-x. Otherwise, it's (y + 12 -x) mod 12.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose note A is at position x and note B is at position y. The distance from A to B is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y +12 -x). Because the scale loops around.\n\nWait, for example, the distance between H and C is 1 semitone. Because H is position 11, C is 0. So 0 -11 = -11 mod 12 is 1, but wait, the distance is from H to C, which is 1 semitone upwards. So yes, the correct way is to calculate (y -x) mod 12, but since the distance is from lower to higher, perhaps it's (y -x) if y >=x else (12 -x + y).\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the distance as (y -x) % 12, but only considering the positive difference. Wait, no, because for example, from C (0) to H (11), the distance is 11 semitones, but from H to C is 1 semitone. So the distance function should return the minimal positive step count from the lower note to the higher note, but since the scale is cyclic, the distance between x and y is (y -x) if y >x, else (12 - (x - y)).\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is (y -x) % 12. Because for x=0, y=11, (11 -0) mod 12 is 11. But the actual distance from C to H is 11 semitones. But according to the problem statement, the distance is always taken from lower to higher, so that's correct. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says, \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\" Oh wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Because according to that, E to C is 8 semitones, which is more than half the circle.\n\nWait, but that's because in that case, the lower note is C, and the higher is E, so the distance is 4. But when the lower is E and the higher is C, the distance is 8. Because the distance is calculated as the number of steps from the lower to the higher, going around the cycle.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance is computed as follows: the number of steps moving forward from the lower note to reach the higher note, wrapping around if necessary.\n\nSo, for example, E to C: the lower note is E, higher is C. Wait, no. Wait, E is at position 4, C is at 0. So E is higher than C? No, because in the list, C comes first, then C#, etc. So E is higher than C. So the lower note is C, higher is E, so the distance is 4.\n\nBut if we take E as lower and C as higher, that's impossible because C is lower than E. So the distance is always computed as from the lower note to the higher note, in the scale.\n\nSo the formula for distance between x and y is:\n\nif x < y: distance is y -x\n\nelse: distance is (12 - x) + y\n\nBecause the scale wraps around. So for x=11 (H) and y=0 (C), the distance is 1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance is (y - x) % 12 if y >=x, else (y +12 -x).\n\nAlternatively, using modulo arithmetic, the distance can be calculated as (y - x + 12) % 12. Because adding 12 ensures that the result is positive before taking modulo 12. Wait, let's test:\n\nx=0 (C), y=4 (E): (4-0) =4 mod12=4.\n\nx=4 (E), y=0 (C): (0-4+12)=8 mod12=8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the distance function is (y -x +12) %12.\n\nSo for two notes, the distance from x to y is (y -x +12) %12.\n\nSo now, for the problem, I need to process three notes: n1, n2, n3. Each note is a string like 'C', 'C#', etc.\n\nFirst, I'll create a mapping from note names to their positions. Let's make a dictionary.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo the index in this list is the position. So for 'C' it's 0, 'C#' is 1, etc., 'H' is 11.\n\nWait, but the problem statement lists the notes as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo first, I'll create a dictionary to map each note to its position:\n\nnote_to_pos = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\nNow, for any given note, I can get its position.\n\nOnce I have the positions of the three notes, say p1, p2, p3, I need to consider all possible orderings of these three notes, and for each possible permutation, check whether the distances between consecutive notes fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nBut wait, since the triad is an unordered set, any permutation could potentially form the major or minor triad. So I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes and see if any of them satisfy the conditions for major or minor.\n\nSo for each permutation (a, b, c) of the three notes:\n\nCompute d1 = distance from a to b: (b -a +12) mod12\n\nd2 = distance from b to c: (c -b +12) mod12\n\nIf d1 ==4 and d2 ==3: then it's a major triad.\n\nIf d1 ==3 and d2 ==4: then it's a minor triad.\n\nWe need to determine whether any permutation leads to a major or minor.\n\nBut since the triad is considered unordered, the same set can be arranged in different orders, and any of those orders may satisfy the condition.\n\nSo for the given three notes, I need to generate all possible orderings (permutations) of their positions, and for each, check if the distances meet the major or minor criteria.\n\nWait, but the number of permutations is 3! =6 for each set. So for each input, I can generate all 6 permutations, compute the distances for each, and see if any permutation meets the major or minor condition.\n\nIf none do, it's strange.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Read the three notes as a list.\n\n2. Convert each note to its position using the note_to_pos dictionary.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of these three positions.\n\n4. For each permutation (p, q, r):\n\n   a. Compute d1 = (q - p +12) %12\n\n   b. Compute d2 = (r - q +12) %12\n\n   c. Check if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3: mark as major.\n\n   d. Else, check if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4: mark as minor.\n\n5. After checking all permutations, if any permutation is major, output 'major'.\n\n   Else if any permutation is minor, output 'minor'.\n\n   Else, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Vasya promises that the answer will always be unambiguous, meaning no chords are both major and minor. So we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input as a list of strings.\n\nThen, for each string, find its position.\n\nSo, code:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\npositions = [note_to_pos[note] for note in notes]\n\nThen, import itertools.permutations to generate all possible orderings.\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nperms = permutations(positions)\n\nThen, for each perm in perms:\n\np, q, r = perm\n\nd1 = (q - p + 12) %12\n\nd2 = (r - q +12) %12\n\nif d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n    print('major')\n\n    exit()\n\nif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n    print('minor')\n\n    exit()\n\nAfter checking all perms, if none found, print 'strange'.\n\nWait, but in the code above, once a permutation is found to be major, we print and exit. Similarly for minor. Otherwise, after all permutations, print 'strange'.\n\nBut in Python, 'exit()' is not the best practice, but for code golfing, perhaps it's acceptable here.\n\nWait, but in the code, after finding a major, we can immediately print and break, and return. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nfor perm in perms:\n\n    p, q, r = perm\n\n    d1 = (q - p +12) %12\n\n    d2 = (r - q +12) %12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample input includes multiple cases, like ['C E G', ...], which is a major. So let's test the code against that.\n\nSample Input 1: C E G\n\nPositions: C=0, E=4, G=7.\n\nPermutations include (0,4,7):\n\nd1 =4-0=4 →4 mod12=4\n\nd2=7-4=3 →3 mod12=3 → so 4 and 3. So this permutation is major. So code will print 'major'.\n\nAnother permutation, like (4,0,7): d1 is (0-4 +12)=8 mod12=8, which is not 3 or4.\n\nAnother permutation: (0,7,4). d1=7-0=7 →7 mod12=7. Not matching.\n\nSo, the code correctly identifies this as major.\n\nAnother sample input: 'C# B F'\n\nLet's see. The notes are C#, B, F.\n\nC# is position 1, B is 10, F is5.\n\nSo positions: 1,10,5.\n\nWhat permutation leads to minor?\n\nLooking for d1=3, d2=4.\n\nWait, let's try permutation (10,1,5).\n\nd1: (1-10 +12) =3 →3 mod12=3.\n\nd2:5-1=4 mod12=4. So yes, 3 and4. So this permutation is minor.\n\nThus, the code would detect minor.\n\nThird sample input: A B H.\n\nA is 9, B is10, H is11.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nFor example, 9,10,11:\n\nd1=1, d2=1. No.\n\nOther permutations:\n\n10,9,11: d1=(9-10+12)=11 →11 mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: 11,9,10.\n\nd1: (9-11+12) =10 →10 mod12=10.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother: 9,11,10.\n\nd1: (11-9) =2 →2 mod12=2.\n\nd2: (10-11 +12) =11 →11 mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother: 10,11,9.\n\nd1=1, d2= (9-11+12) =10.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother: 11,10,9.\n\nd1= (10-11 +12)=11 →11.\n\nd2= (9-10 +12)=11.\n\nNo.\n\nSo none of the permutations give d1=4 and d2=3, or d1=3 and d2=4. So the chord is strange.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All notes are the same. But the problem states that the input is exactly three notes, but does not specify whether they are distinct. However, the definition of a chord requires an unordered set of no less than three notes, which implies that the set must consist of distinct notes. So perhaps the input will always have three distinct notes. So I don't have to handle cases where two notes are the same.\n\nBut if somehow two notes are same, then in the permutation, they would be adjacent, leading to d1=0, which doesn't fit either major or minor. So such cases would be classified as 'strange'.\n\nAnother edge case: notes wrap around. For example, H, C, E.\n\nH is 11, C is0, E is4.\n\nCheck permutation (11,0,4):\n\nd1= (0-11 +12) =1 →1.\n\nd2= (4-0)=4 →4.\n\nSo d1=1, d2=4 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: 0,4,11.\n\nd1=4 →4, d2= (11-4)=7 →7. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: 0,11,4.\n\nd1= (11-0) =11 →11.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: 4,0,11.\n\nd1= (0-4 +12)=8 →8.\n\nd2= (11-0) =11.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: 4,11,0.\n\nd1= (11-4)=7 →7.\n\nd2= (0-11 +12)=1 →1.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: 11,4,0.\n\nd1= (4-11 +12)=5 →5.\n\nd2= (0-4 +12)=8 →8.\n\nNo.\n\nSo this set would be 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: C, D#, G.\n\nC is0, D# is3, G is7.\n\nCheck permutation (0,3,7):\n\nd1=3, d2=4. So 3 and4 → minor.\n\nSo code would print 'minor'.\n\nAnother permutation: (3,0,7):\n\nd1= (0-3 +12)=9 →9.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, let's implement the code.\n\nBut first, the note_to_pos dictionary needs to have all the notes in the correct order.\n\nWait, the note list is:\n\n['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo the note_to_pos is as per this order.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nRead the input line, split into 3 notes.\n\nConvert each note into position.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the positions.\n\nFor each permutation, compute d1 and d2 as (q-p+12)%12 and (r-q+12)%12.\n\nCheck if d1 and d2 match the required values.\n\nIf any permutation is major, output 'major' and exit.\n\nElse, if any permutation is minor, output 'minor' and exit.\n\nElse, after all permutations, output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\npositions = [note_to_pos[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(positions):\n    p, q, r = perm\n    d1 = (q - p + 12) % 12\n    d2 = (r - q + 12) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but wait, in Python, importing sys and using sys.exit() is acceptable.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nProcessing each case:\n\nFor 'C E G', the positions are 0,4,7.\n\nAs discussed, the permutation (0,4,7) gives d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo code returns 'major'.\n\nSecond input: 'C# B F' → positions 1,10,5.\n\nOne permutation is (10,1,5): d1= (1-10 +12) =3, d2= (5-1)=4 → minor.\n\nThird input: 'A B H' → 9,10,11. None of the permutations give 4,3 or 3,4.\n\nThus, output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: ['C', 'E', 'G'] → 'major'.\n\nAnother test case: ['C#', 'B', 'F'] → 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: ['C', 'D#', 'G'] → as discussed, 'minor' in one permutation.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither.

A minor triad is defined by distances of 3 and 4 semitones respectively.\n2. **Note Positions**: We map each note to its position in a predefined list of notes. This helps in calculating the distance between notes.\n3. **Permutations**: Since the notes can be in any order, we generate all permutations of the three notes to check each possible ordering.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes.
