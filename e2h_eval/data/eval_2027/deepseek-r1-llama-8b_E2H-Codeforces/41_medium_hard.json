There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit.

The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house can be built on a spot, and each spot has a height between 0 and h. The profit for each spot is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges of spots. My goal is to find the maximum possible total profit while satisfying all these restrictions.\n\nHmm, the constraints are small: n, h, m are up to 50. So maybe a brute-force approach is feasible here. Because even 50 spots, each with 50 options (heights), that's 50^50 possibilities, which is way too big. Wait, no, that's way beyond anything. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but n is 50, and for each spot, the choices are limited by the restrictions. So perhaps we can model this as a graph problem where each node represents the current spot and the maximum allowed height due to previous constraints. Or maybe dynamic programming?\n\nAlternatively, think about each restriction as imposing an upper bound on some interval. For each spot, the maximum height allowed is the minimum of all x_i from restrictions that cover it, or h otherwise. But wait, no—because multiple restrictions might apply to the same spot, and the maximum allowed is the minimum of all the x_i's that include it plus the global h.\n\nWait, no. Each restriction says that in the range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. So for any spot in l_i to r_i, the height cannot exceed x_i. But if another restriction covers the same spot with a lower x_i, that's the stricter one.\n\nSo for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of h and all x_j where j is a restriction that includes i in its [l_j, r_j] range. Because for each such restriction, the height must be <= x_j. So the maximum allowed for i is min{h} union {x_j for all j where l_j <=i <=r_j}.\n\nWait, yes. So for each spot, I can precompute the maximum allowed height based on all restrictions that apply to it. If a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_j's for those restrictions, but also not exceeding h.\n\nSo the first step is to compute for each spot i, the maximum possible height it can have, given all the restrictions. Once I have this for each spot, the problem reduces to selecting heights for each spot within their individual max allowed, such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nAh, right! Because each spot's maximum is determined by the overlapping restrictions, the problem becomes choosing for each spot a height a_i, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ max_height[i], and the sum of a_i² is as large as possible.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the max_height[i] is already the minimal x_j or h. So each a_i can be up to that value. So the problem then becomes, for each spot, choose a_i as high as possible to maximize the sum of squares, given that each a_i is capped by its own max_height[i].\n\nBecause the square function is increasing, the maximum sum is achieved when each a_i is as large as possible, within their constraints. So the optimal solution is to set each a_i to the maximum allowed by the restrictions.\n\nWait, does that hold? Let me think. For each a_i, the profit is a_i squared. Since it's a convex function, the maximum for each a_i is indeed to take the maximum possible value.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute the maximum allowed height a_i_max, which is the minimum of h and all x_j where the spot i is in [l_j, r_j]. \n\n2. Then, the optimal a_i for each spot is a_i_max.\n\n3. Sum all a_i_max squared to get the maximum profit.\n\nIs this correct?\n\nWait, let's test against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n1-1: x=1\n2-2: x=3\n3-3: x=2\n\nFor each spot:\n\nSpot 1: covered by the first restriction, x=1, so a_1_max is 1.\n\nSpot 2: covered by the second restriction, x=3, so a_2_max is 3.\n\nSpot 3: covered by the third restriction, x=2, so a_3_max is 2.\n\nSum is 1 +9+4=14, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2-3: x=8\n\n3-4: x=7.\n\nCompute for each spot:\n\nSpot 1: only restricted by h=10.\n\nSpot 2: min(10, 8) → 8.\n\nSpot 3: min(10, 8,7) →7.\n\nSpot4: min(10,7) →7.\n\nSo the heights are [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each spot i, find all the restrictions that include i in their [l, r] range.\n\n- For each such restriction, take x_j. The maximum allowed for i is the minimum of all x_j (from applicable restrictions) and h.\n\nThen, the sum of squares is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each spot i, find the minimum x_j among all applicable restrictions, then set a_i to that, but not exceeding h.\n\nThus, the solution is straightforward.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nFor each of m restrictions, read l, r, x.\n\nThen, for each spot i from 1 to n, collect all x's from restrictions where l<=i <= r.\n\nCompute the minimum x in this collection, then compare with h. The a_i is min(h, min_x).\n\nSum the squares.\n\nSo code-wise, in Python:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_heights = [h] * (n+1) # since spots are 1-based.\n\nfor each of m restrictions:\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if x < max_heights[i]:\n\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 1..n:\n\n    sum += (max_heights[i]) **2\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but wait. What if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, each with different x's. For example, two restrictions covering spot i, one with x=5 and another with x=3. Then, the maximum allowed is 3, because the tallest in that range must be at most 3.\n\nYes, because the first restriction allows up to 5, but the second restricts to 3. So the minimum of all x's that include i.\n\nSo the code above correctly takes the minimum x for each spot.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nn=3, h=3.\n\nRestriction 1: l=1, r=1, x=1.\n\nSo for i=1, x=1. So max_heights[1] becomes min(3,1)=1.\n\nRestriction 2: l=2, r=2, x=3. So i=2: max_heights[2] is min(3,3)=3.\n\nRestriction3: l=3, r=3, x=2. i=3: min(3,2)=2.\n\nSum is 1 +9 +4 =14.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10.\n\nRestriction 1: l=2, r=3, x=8.\n\nSo for i=2: min(10,8) →8.\n\ni=3: min(10,8)→8.\n\nRestriction 2: l=3, r=4, x=7.\n\ni=3: current is 8, but 7 is less, so update to 7.\n\ni=4: min(10,7) →7.\n\nSo after processing both restrictions:\n\nspot 1:10.\n\nspot 2:8.\n\nspot3:7.\n\nspot4:7.\n\nSum is 100 +64 +49 +49=262.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, some with higher x and some with lower.\n\nE.g., n=2, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: 1-1, x=5.\n\nRestriction2:1-2, x=3.\n\nFor spot1: min(5,3) →3.\n\nFor spot2: min(10,3) →3.\n\nSo heights are 3 and 3. Profit is 18.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if a spot is not covered by any restriction? Then it's min(h, nothing) →h.\n\nSo code correctly sets it to h.\n\nWhat about overlapping multiple restrictions on the same spot?\n\nLike, spot 2 covered by restrictions with x=4, x=3, x=5. The min is 3.\n\nSo code correctly sets it to 3.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n, h, m from input.\n\nInitialize max_heights as a list of size n+1 (since spots start at 1). Initialize each to h.\n\nThen, for each of m restrictions:\n\nRead l, r, x.\n\nLoop i from l to r:\n\nIf x is less than current max_heights[i], update it.\n\nAfter processing all restrictions, compute the sum of squares.\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, but they have varying x's. The code will correctly take the minimum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_heights = [h]*(n+1)\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\nsum = 0\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    sum += max_heights[i] **2\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2'—so for the first restriction, it's l=1, r=1, x=1. So spot 1 gets updated to 1.\n\nSimilarly, other restrictions.\n\nBut in code, the initial max_heights[i] is h, which is 3.\n\nSo spot1: initially 3. After processing first restriction, it's set to 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\nmax_heights starts as [3,3,3,3]\n\nFirst restriction: 1-1, x=1.\n\nSpot1: 3>1 → set to 1.\n\nmax_heights[1]=1.\n\nSecond restriction: 2-2, x=3.\n\nSpot2: 3<=3 → remains 3.\n\nThird restriction:3-3, x=2.\n\nSpot3: 3>2 → set to 2.\n\nSo max_heights are [3,1,3,2].\n\nWait, wait. No, indices go from 0 to 3, but for spots 1-3, indexes 1,2,3.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: in the code, the list is 0-based. So for n=3, the list is indexes 0,1,2,3. Wait, no, no. Wait, in the code, the list is created as [h]*(n+1), which for n=3 is [3,3,3,3]. So spot 1 is index 1, spot 2 is index 2, spot3 is index3.\n\nWait, no. Oh, wait, no. Because in the code, for i in range(l, r+1), which for l=1, r=1, the loop runs once for i=1.\n\nSo in the first restriction, i=1 is considered, and max_heights[1] is set to 1.\n\nIn the second restriction, l=2, r=2: i=2 is considered, and max_heights[2] is 3 (since x=3, which is equal to current value).\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3: i=3 is considered, x=2 < current 3 → set to 2.\n\nSo the max_heights after processing are:\n\nindex 0:3\n\nindex1:1\n\nindex2:3\n\nindex3:2.\n\nThen, the sum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 →1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: let's say n=2, m=1, l=1, r=2, x=4. h=5.\n\nSo the max_heights for spot1: min(5,4)=4.\n\nSpot2: min(5,4)=4.\n\nSum is 16 +16=32.\n\nSo code returns 32.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, m=2, restrictions:\n\n1-4 x=2\n\n3-4 x=3\n\nSo for spot1: min(5,2) →2.\n\nspot2: min(5,2) →2.\n\nspot3: min(5,2,3) →2.\n\nspot4: min(5,2,3) →2.\n\nSum is 2^2 *4=16.\n\nBut wait, if the first restriction is x=2, then spots 1-4 must have a_i <=2. So even though the second restriction is x=3, which is higher than 2, it doesn't change anything. So the sum is 4*4=16.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think this approach is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house can be built on a spot with a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each spot contributes to the total profit based on the square of its height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Constraints**: Each spot on the street can have a house with a height between 0 and a given maximum height `h`. There are `m` restrictions where each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height.\n2. **Determine Maximum Allowed Heights**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum value of all applicable restrictions plus the global maximum height `h`. This means for each spot, if it falls within multiple restrictions, the height must be limited by the smallest restriction value.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once we know the maximum allowed height for each spot, the optimal strategy is to build the tallest possible house in each spot to maximize the profit, which is the sum of the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmax_heights = [h] * (n + 1)  # 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    total += max_heights[i] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `max_heights` is initialized to store the maximum allowed height for each spot, initially set to `h`.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the maximum allowed height for each spot within the specified range if the restriction's height is lower than the current maximum allowed height.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the code calculates the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each spot.\n5. **Output the Result**: Finally, the total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum allowed height for each spot considering all applicable restrictions and then compute the maximum possible profit by choosing the tallest allowable houses.",
