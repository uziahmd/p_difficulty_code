The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So the i-th task can only be done after she's handled all earlier ones.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first test case, n=4, m=3, and the tasks are 3,2,3. The optimal path is 1 → 2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. That's a total of 6 units. Wait, why does that happen? Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the first task is 3. She needs to reach 3 as soon as possible. But wait, no—she has to do all tasks in order. So for the first task (i=1), she needs to be at a1=3. Then for i=2, she needs to be at a2=2, but since 2 is before 3 in the ring, she can't go back. Oh right, because the ring is one-way clockwise.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh no, the ring is one way, so movement is always forward. So from any house, you can only move to higher-numbered houses, except when you wrap around. Like, from n, you can only go to 1.\n\nWait no, wait. If the ring is one-way clockwise, then the direction is such that each house points to the next one. So, moving from house k, you can go to k+1, but not to k-1, unless you're at n, then you can only go to 1.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: if the traffic is one way clockwise, then the movement is allowed from a lower-numbered house to a higher, or from n to 1. Because the ring is circular, but the movement is only possible in the clockwise direction.\n\nSo, for example, if a house is 4, the next is 1. So moving from 4 to 1 is allowed. But moving from 2 to 1 is not allowed because that's counter-clockwise.\n\nWait, no. No, because in a ring, the next house after n is 1. So movement is only in the direction where you can go to the next higher house, wrapping around from n to 1.\n\nSo, in the first example, the tasks are [3,2,3]. Let's see:\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\nFirst, she has to do task 1: a1=3. So she needs to get there. How?\n\nShe can go from 1 → 2 →3, which is two steps. But wait, after that, she needs to do task 2: a2=2. But she just came from 2. So she has to loop around again.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal path is to visit all required houses in the earliest possible time, considering that she can revisit some houses as needed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to arrange the tasks in such a way that she goes as far as possible in the ring without having to come back, but considering the order of the tasks.\n\nWait, maybe the solution involves looking at the sorted list of task locations. Because Xenia has to process the tasks in order, she must be at a1 at the earliest, then a2, etc., but each step must be reachable via moving in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, but what's the minimal way to cover all the required positions in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as needing to visit certain positions in a specific order, starting from 1, and each time visiting the next required position as early as possible.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal time is determined by the maximum distance she has to cover between consecutive required positions, considering the order in which they appear in the list.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think differently.\n\nEach task requires her to be at a certain house, but she must do them in the order given. So the sequence is a1, a2, ..., am. But wait, no: the problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be in ai and have completed all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order is fixed as per the input list.\n\nSo the first thing she does is a1, then a2, then a3, and so on until am.\n\nWait, no. Because she can't go back in time. So she must process the tasks in the order of their indices, but each task may require her to be at a certain location.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to consider the order of the tasks, and for each task, determine the earliest time she can reach it, considering the previous tasks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal time is the sum of the distances between consecutive required positions, but ordered in such a way that the earliest required position comes first, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the task positions in increasing order, but considering that she must visit them in the order of their occurrence.\n\nNo, that might not work because the tasks are given in a specific order. For example, in the first test case, the tasks are 3, 2, 3. So the first task is 3, then 2, then 3 again.\n\nWait, that seems odd. Because 2 is before 3 in the ring. So how can she go from 3 to 2? She can't, because the ring is one-way. So she would have to go from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is a longer path.\n\nWait, but that brings up the issue: the order of the tasks may require her to visit a later position before an earlier one, which could complicate things.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal path is determined by the longest path she has to take between any two consecutive required positions, considering that each step must be taken in the order of the task list.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the required positions in the order of the task list.\n\n2. For each pair of consecutive positions, calculate the minimal steps required to go from the current position to the next, moving only in the clockwise direction.\n\n3. Sum all these steps, plus the initial steps from 1 to the first required position.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial position is 1, and the first required position is a1. So the steps from 1 to a1, then from a1 to a2, and so on until am.\n\nBut in the example, the first required is 3, which is 1→2→3: 2 steps.\n\nThen from 3 to 2: since she can't go backward, she has to go 3→4→1→2: that's 3 steps.\n\nThen from 2 to 3: 2→3 is 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2 + 3 +1 = 6, which matches the example.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each pair of consecutive required positions, compute the minimal steps between them in the clockwise direction, and sum all these plus the initial steps.\n\nWait, but that's only part of the story. Because sometimes, the required positions may not be in order, meaning that you have to go around the ring multiple times.\n\nFor example, suppose the required positions are [3, 2, 3]. So the first is 3, then 2, then 3 again.\n\nIn this case, the movement from 3 to 2 is not straightforward because 2 is before 3. So she has to go all the way around the ring.\n\nSo, how to model the distance between two points a and b, where a < b, in a clockwise-only ring.\n\nThe distance from a to b is (b - a) mod n. Because to get from a to b, you can go directly, but if a > b, you have to go the long way around.\n\nWait, no. Because in a ring, moving from a to b can be either the short way (if b is after a) or the long way (if b is before a). Since movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, the distance is the minimal number of steps in that direction.\n\nWait, no. Because if the ring is 1 →2 →3 →4 →1, then moving from 3 to 2 is not allowed directly. So the only way is to go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps.\n\nSo, the distance from a to b, when a < b, is (b - a) if moving forward, but if a > b, then the distance is (n - a + b).\n\nWait, let me think about that. For a ring of size n:\n\nIf a <= b: the distance is (b - a) steps.\n\nIf a > b: the distance is (n - a + b) steps.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nn=4, a=3, b=2: 4-3 +2 = 3 steps.\n\na=2, b=3: 3-2=1 step.\n\nSo, the distance function between a and b is:\n\ndistance(a, b) = (b - a) % n, but wait, no. Because (b - a) mod n would give 1 for a=3, b=4, which is correct. But for a=3, b=2, (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4=3, which is correct.\n\nWait, (b - a) mod n gives the correct result, whether a is larger than b or not.\n\nBecause, for a=3, b=2: 2-3 = -1, mod4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nYes, so the distance can be computed as (b - a) % n.\n\nSo, for each consecutive pair in the task list, we compute the distance as (next_a - current_a) mod n, and sum all these distances. Also, the initial distance from 1 to the first a1 is (a1 -1) mod n, which is simply a1-1 since a1 >=1.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial position is 1. So the first step is to go from 1 to a1, which is (a1 -1) steps.\n\nThen, for each subsequent task, we go from the current position to the next a_i. The sum of all these steps is the total time.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Sort the task list in the order of the task indices (i.e., the order given).\n\n2. For each consecutive pair in the sorted list, compute the distance using (next_a - current_a) mod n.\n\n3. Sum all these distances, including the initial step from 1 to a1.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial step is from 1 to a1. So the first distance is (a1 -1) mod n. Which, since a1 >=1, is a1-1.\n\nThen, for each a_i to a_{i+1}, compute the distance.\n\nSo, the total time is (a1 -1) + sum_{i=1 to m-1} (a_{i+1} - a_i) mod n.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\nSo, initial step: 3-1=2.\n\nThen, from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod4=3.\n\nThen, from 2 to3: (3-2)mod4=1.\n\nTotal: 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: '4 3\\n2 3 3'\n\nSo, a = [2,3,3].\n\nInitial step: 2-1=1.\n\nFrom 2 to3: 1 step.\n\nFrom3 to3: 0 steps.\n\nTotal:1+1+0=2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: what if the tasks are in reverse order, say [4,3,2,1] for n=4.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, a1 is the first task, and for each i, she needs to be at a_i after doing all tasks before i.\n\nBut in this case, the first task is 4, then 3, then 2, then 1.\n\nWait, how can she do that? Because to get to 3 from 4, she can't go backward. She has to go 4→1→2→3, which is 3 steps. Then 3→2 is another 1 step, but wait, 2 is before 3, so she'd have to go 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. And from 2 to1: 1 step. So the total would be:\n\nInitial: 4-1=3 steps.\n\nThen 4→1→2→3: 3 steps (to reach 3 from 4, since a2=3 is next).\n\nThen 3→2: 3 steps (since from 3 to2 is 3 steps).\n\nThen 2→1:1 step.\n\nTotal steps:3+3+3+1=10.\n\nBut let's compute using the formula:\n\na = [4,3,2,1].\n\nCompute initial step: 4-1=3.\n\nThen 3-4 mod4= (3-4)= -1 mod4=3.\n\nThen 2-3 mod4= -1 mod4=3.\n\nThen 1-2 mod4= -1 mod4=3.\n\nSum:3+3+3+3=12. Hmm, that doesn't match the manual calculation. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula isn't just the sum of the consecutive differences, but the sum of all the steps between each pair, including the initial step.\n\nWait, in the case of a=[4,3,2,1], the steps would be:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nTask 1: go to 4. Steps:1→2→3→4: 3 steps.\n\nTask 2: go to3. From 4, you can't go to3 directly; you have to go 4→1→2→3: 3 steps.\n\nTask3: go to2. From3, can't go to2 directly. Have to go 3→4→1→2:3 steps.\n\nTask4: go to1. From2, you can go 2→3→4→1:3 steps.\n\nTotal steps:3+3+3+3=12.\n\nWhich is the same as the formula's sum.\n\nBut according to the formula:\n\nsum = (4-1) + (3-4 mod4)+(2-3 mod4)+(1-2 mod4).\n\nWhich is 3 + (3) + (3) + (3) = 12.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[3,5].\n\nSo, initial step:3-1=2 steps.\n\nThen from3 to5:5-3=2 steps.\n\nTotal:2+2=4.\n\nBut in reality, she goes 1→2→3→4→5, which is 4 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[2,4,1].\n\nWait, but wait, can she go from1 to2, then 2 to4, then4 to1?\n\nWait, according to the formula, the steps would be:\n\nInitial: 2-1=1.\n\nThen 4-2=2.\n\nThen 1-4 mod5= (1-4)=-3 mod5=2.\n\nTotal:1+2+2=5.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nPath:\n\n1→2 (1 step).\n\n2→3→4 (2 steps).\n\n4→5→1 (2 steps).\n\nYes, total 5 steps.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Read the list of a_i.\n\n2. Compute the sum of (a_1 -1) plus the sum over i from 1 to m-1 of (a_{i+1} - a_i) mod n.\n\nWait, but wait: the mod n is necessary because when a_{i+1} is smaller than a_i, the difference would be negative, but mod n ensures it's positive.\n\nWait, but in code, (a_{i+1} - a_i) can be negative, but when modded by n, it gives the correct positive distance.\n\nBut in Python, the modulus operator returns non-negative results when the denominator is positive. So for example, (-1) %4 is 3.\n\nSo yes, (a_{i+1} -a_i) %n will correctly compute the minimal steps.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list of a_i.\n\n- Sort them in the order given (since the order is important for the tasks).\n\nWait no, the order is already given. Because the tasks are in the order of i=1,2,...m.\n\nSo the list is already in the order of the tasks. So we don't need to sort it.\n\nWait, the problem says that the second line contains m integers a1,a2,...am. So the order is fixed as given.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nsum = (a1 -1) \n\nfor i in 1 to m-1:\n\n    sum += (a[i+1] - a[i]) %n\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but wait: in the first example, the a list is [3,2,3]. So:\n\nsum starts as 3-1=2.\n\nThen 2-3 mod4= (2-3)=-1 mod4=3. sum becomes 5.\n\nThen 3-2 mod4=1. sum becomes 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn the second sample input, a is [2,3,3].\n\nsum starts as 2-1=1.\n\nThen 3-2=1. sum is 2.\n\nThen 3-3=0. sum remains 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [4,3,2,1].\n\nsum starts as 4-1=3.\n\nThen 3-4 mod4=3.\n\nsum becomes 6.\n\nThen 2-3 mod4=3. sum becomes 9.\n\nThen 1-2 mod4=3. sum becomes 12.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the initial step as (a[0]-1), then for each pair of consecutive elements, add (a[i+1]-a[i]) mod n.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute the sum as (a[0]-1) + sum of (a[i+1]-a[i])%n for i in 0 to m-2.\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where a has duplicates, like in the second sample input, where a is [2,3,3], the last step is (3-3) mod4=0, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: m=1.\n\nIn this case, the sum is (a[0]-1). Because there are no other steps.\n\nFor example, n=5, m=1, a=[5]. sum is 5-1=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nEdge case 2: a[0]=1.\n\nThen the initial step is 0 steps.\n\nThen, for each consecutive step, compute as usual.\n\nSo, for example, n=5, m=2, a=[1,5]. Initial step is 0. Then 5-1=4 mod5=4. Total 4 steps.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: a is in the order that requires going around the ring multiple times.\n\nLike n=5, a = [5, 3, 1].\n\nInitial step:5-1=4.\n\nThen 3-5 mod5= (3-5)= -2 mod5=3.\n\nThen 1-3 mod5= (1-3)= -2 mod5=3.\n\nTotal:4+3+3=10.\n\nLet's see the path:\n\n1→2→3→4→5 (4 steps for first task).\n\nThen 5→1→2→3 (3 steps for second task).\n\nThen 3→4→5→1 (3 steps for third task).\n\nTotal 10 steps. Correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can read the input as follows.\n\nRead the first line as n, m.\n\nRead the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the sum as described.\n\nBut wait, wait: the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but in Python, when using split(), it's handled.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_time = 0\n\nsum_time = (a[0] - 1)  # initial step\n\nfor i in range(m-1):\n\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    sum_time += diff % n\n\nprint(sum_time)\n\nWait, but wait: the modulo operation in Python returns a non-negative result, which is correct.\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nsum_time starts at 3-1=2.\n\nThen, for i=0: a[1]-a[0] = 2-3=-1 mod4=3. sum is 5.\n\ni=1: a[2]-a[1]=3-2=1 mod4=1. sum is 6.\n\nOutput is 6.\n\nSample 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nsum starts at 2-1=1.\n\ni=0:3-2=1 mod4=1. sum 2.\n\ni=1:3-3=0. sum remains 2.\n\nOutput 2.\n\nAnother test case: m=1.\n\nn=5, m=1, a=[5]. Output 4.\n\nAnother test case: a=[1,5], n=5.\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nThen 5-1=4 mod5=4. sum 4.\n\nSo yes, code works.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and can only move clockwise around the ringroad. Each task requires her to be at a specific house after completing all previous tasks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that Xenia can only move clockwise around the ring. This means she can only visit houses in increasing order, wrapping around from the last house back to the first. The goal is to compute the minimal steps required to complete all tasks in the given order.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal steps between two consecutive tasks can be computed by considering the shortest path in the clockwise direction. If moving directly from a lower-numbered house to a higher-numbered house, the distance is straightforward. If moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered house, the distance wraps around the ring.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values.\n   - Compute the initial steps from house 1 to the first task location.\n   - For each subsequent task, compute the steps required to move from the current task location to the next task location, considering the clockwise movement.\n   - Sum these steps to get the total time required.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(m) time complexity, where m is the number of tasks, as it involves a single pass through the list of tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_time = (a[0] - 1)\nfor i in range(m - 1):\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    sum_time += diff % n\nprint(sum_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of task locations.\n- **Initial Steps Calculation**: The initial step is calculated as the distance from house 1 to the first task location.\n- **Subsequent Steps Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive tasks, the distance is computed using modulo arithmetic to handle the wrap-around scenario. This ensures the distance is always positive and follows the shortest path in the clockwise direction.\n- **Summing Up**: The total time is accumulated by summing up the initial steps and the steps between each consecutive task.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time required for Xenia to complete all her tasks while adhering to the constraints of moving only clockwise around the ring.",
