    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l in length. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d so that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, let's think about the approach. How can we model this?\n\nWell, each lantern covers a certain interval. The union of all these intervals must cover the entire [0, l] interval. We need to find the smallest d that allows this.\n\nSo, maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. For each consecutive pair of lanterns, determine the coverage needed between them.\n3. Find the maximum required d for any such gap, which will be our answer.\n\nWait, but what about the ends? Like, the first lantern and the end of the street, or the last lantern and the beginning. Those could also contribute to the required d.\n\nLet me outline this:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions. That's straightforward.\n- Consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns, including the start (0) and end (l).\n- For each such gap, calculate the required d to cover it with the nearest lanterns.\n- The maximum of these required d's is our answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, how do we handle the gaps?\n\nFor example, suppose we have two lanterns at positions x and y, where x < y. The distance between them is y - x. But since each has a radius d, the maximum coverage they provide is x + d and y - d. So the gap between them is (y - x). To cover this, the sum of their coverages should at least cover this gap.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I should model it as: the leftmost point covered by the right lantern and the rightmost point covered by the left lantern. The area in between needs to be covered.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the coverage between two lanterns is the overlap between their individual coverages. But since each lantern's coverage is a circle (in 1D, it's an interval), the combined coverage is the union.\n\nBut the key is, for two lanterns a and b (a <= b), the maximum distance between any point in [a-d, b+d], but that's not directly helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for the street to be fully covered, every point between 0 and l must be within d of at least one lantern. So, the critical points are the regions between lanterns and the edges.\n\nSo, for each pair of consecutive lanterns (sorted), including the start and end, we can compute the minimal d required so that the coverage of the two lanterns overlaps enough to cover the entire street.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the maximum of the following values:\n\n- The distance from the first lantern to 0, because the first lantern must cover from 0 to a_1 + d. Similarly, the last lantern must cover from a_n - d to l.\n\n- For the middle lanterns, between a_i and a_{i+1}, the required coverage is such that a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d. Because if a_i + d is less than a_{i+1} -d, then there's a gap between them that isn't covered.\n\nWait, wait. So for two consecutive lanterns at a and b, the condition is that a + d >= b - d. Because a's coverage goes up to a + d, and b's starts at b - d. So the gap between a + d and b -d must be zero or negative for them to cover the entire [a, b] segment.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if a is at position 2 and b is at position 5. Then, a covers up to 2 + d, and b covers from 5 -d. For the two to cover the entire [2,5] segment, we need 2 + d >= 5 -d. Because otherwise, there would be a gap between 2 +d and 5 -d.\n\nSolving 2 + d >=5 -d gives 2d >=3 → d >= 1.5.\n\nSo in that case, the required d is 1.5.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair, the required d is (b - a)/2. Because (b -a) is the distance between the two. So (b -a)/2 is the minimal d required for those two lanterns to cover the entire stretch between them.\n\nBut wait, that's only considering two lanterns. What about when there are multiple lanterns in between?\n\nNo, because the lanterns are sorted. So for each i from 0 to n (where 0 is the start, and n is the end), we look at the next lantern. For example, the first pair is 0 and a_0, the second is a_0 and a_1, etc., until the last pair is a_{n-1} and l.\n\nSo for each pair, we compute the minimal d required based on that pair, and the maximum of all these d's will be the answer.\n\nWait, but why? Because each pair defines a region that must be covered, and the minimal d that covers all these regions is the maximum required d among all pairs.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and l.\n2. Read the list of ai's.\n3. Sort the ai's.\n4. Add 0 to the beginning of the sorted list and l to the end. Or, process the pairs as (0, a_0), (a_0, a_1), ..., (a_{n-1}, l).\n5. For each consecutive pair (prev, curr), compute the required d as (curr - prev) / 2. But wait, for the first pair (0, a_0), the required d is a_0 - 0, because 0's coverage is 0 + d, and a_0's is a_0 -d. So to cover from 0 to a_0, the 0's coverage must reach at least a_0, so d must be at least a_0. Similarly, for the last pair, a_{n-1} +d must be >= l, so d must be at least l - a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, that's different from the earlier approach. So perhaps my initial thought was incorrect.\n\nSo for the first pair (0, a_0), the required d is a_0 -0. Because 0 +d must be >= a_0 -d. Wait, no, because 0's coverage is [0, d], and a_0's coverage is [a_0 -d, a_0 +d]. To cover from 0 to a_0, the 0's coverage must at least reach a_0. So d >= a_0.\n\nSimilarly, for the last pair, a_{n-1} +d >= l → d >= l -a_{n-1}.\n\nFor the middle pairs, like a_i and a_j (i < j), the required d is (a_j - a_i) / 2. Because a_i +d must >= a_j -d, which implies d >= (a_j -a_i)/2.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n- Sort the lanterns.\n- Prepend 0 and append l to the list of lanterns.\n- For each consecutive pair, compute the required d for that pair.\n- The maximum of all these d's is the minimal d needed.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo now, let's think about the algorithm step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll sort the list of lantern positions.\n\nThen, create a new list that starts with 0, followed by the sorted lanterns, followed by l.\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive points in this new list, compute the required d.\n\nCompute for each pair (prev, curr):\n\nif prev is 0:\n    required_d = curr[0] - 0\nelif curr is l:\n    required_d = l - curr[-1]\nelse:\n    required_d = (curr - prev) / 2\n\nTake the maximum of all required_d's.\n\nThat maximum is the minimal d.\n\nWait, but wait. Suppose we have a pair where prev is 0 and curr is a_0. The required d is a_0, because 0's coverage is 0 to d, and a_0's is a_0 -d to a_0 +d. To cover from 0 to a_0, d must be at least a_0. Because otherwise, if a_0 is larger than d, then 0's coverage ends before a_0, leaving a gap.\n\nSimilarly, for the last pair, a_{n-1} and l. The required d is l - a_{n-1}. Because a_{n-1}'s coverage is a_{n-1} -d to a_{n-1} +d. To cover up to l, a_{n-1} +d must be >= l → d >= l - a_{n-1}.\n\nSo yes, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo, the lanterns are at [15,5,3,7,9,14,0].\n\nAfter sorting, they become [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nWe prepend 0 and append 15, so the list becomes [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original list after sorting is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then, adding 0 at the front and l=15 at the end gives [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15]? No, wait, the initial list is already 7 elements. After adding 0 and 15, it's 9 elements.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think as follows:\n\nCreate a new list called points. Initially, points = [0]. Then add the sorted lanterns. Then add l. So for the first sample, points becomes [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Wait, no, because the original list after sorting is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15], so adding 0 and 15 gives [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15]?\n\nNo, wait, the initial points list is [0], then we add all the lantern positions (including 0?), no. Wait, the lantern positions may include 0 already, like in the first sample. So after sorting, the list is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then, we prepend 0 again? No, wait, the initial points list is [0], then we add all the lantern positions, which includes 0, then add l.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the process is:\n\npoints = [0] + sorted( ai ) + [l]\n\nBecause the street starts at 0 and ends at l.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nsorted_ai = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\npoints becomes [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15]. Wait, but that's not correct. Because 0 is added once, then the sorted list (including 0), then l=15. So points is [0, 0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15].\n\nWait, no, wait. The initial points is [0], then add all the lantern positions (which includes 0,3,5,7,9,14,15) → points becomes [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then, add l=15 → [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15]. So the pairs are (0,0), (0,3), (3,5), (5,7), (7,9), (9,14), (14,15), (15,15).\n\nNow, for each pair, compute the required d.\n\nPair (0,0): required d is 0 (since 0's coverage is 0 to d, and 0's other side is 0 +d >=0 -d=0). So no problem.\n\nWait, for the first pair, prev=0, curr=0: required_d is 0.\n\nNext, (0,3): prev=0, curr=3.\n\nSince prev is 0, required_d is 3 -0 =3.\n\nBut wait, according to the rules, for the first pair (0, a_0), required_d is a_0.\n\nWhich is 3 in this case.\n\nWait, but 3 is the required d.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the answer is 2.5.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo the lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0], which when sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nAfter adding 0 at the beginning and 15 at the end, the points list is [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15].\n\nNow, for each consecutive pair:\n\nBetween 0 and 0: required_d is 0.\n\nBetween 0 and 3: required_d is 3 (since 0 +d must be >=3 -d → 0 +d >=3 -d → 2d >=3 → d>=1.5. So required d is 1.5.)\n\nWait, wait, no. According to the rules, for the first pair (0,3), since prev is 0, required_d is 3 -0 =3. But that's not correct because d could be smaller.\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I should treat all pairs the same way, including the ones involving 0 and l.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to consider each consecutive pair as (prev, curr), and for each, compute the required d as (curr - prev) / 2. Except for the cases where prev is 0 or curr is l.\n\nWait, no. Because for the first pair, (0,3), the required d is 1.5. Because 0 +d must be >=3 -d → 2d >=3 → d >=1.5. So the required d for that pair is 1.5.\n\nSimilarly, for the last pair (14,15), required d is (15-14)/2=0.5.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is wrong. It seems that for each pair, the required d is (curr - prev)/2, regardless of whether it's the first or last pair.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the required d is 2.5. So where does that come from?\n\nWait, let's re-calculate.\n\nLooking at the sample:\n\nThe lanterns are at [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nWe need to compute for each consecutive pair, the required d as (curr - prev)/2.\n\nCompute all pairs:\n\n0 and 3: (3-0)/2=1.5\n\n3 and5: (5-3)/2=1\n\n5 and7: 1\n\n7 and9:1\n\n9 and14: (14-9)/2=2.5\n\n14 and15:0.5\n\nAlso, the first pair is 0 and 0 (because the points list is [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15]). So the first pair is 0 and 0: required d is 0.\n\nThe last pair is 15 and15: required d is 0.\n\nBut wait, the points list after adding 0 and l is [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15]. So the pairs are:\n\n0 and0 → d=0\n\n0 and3 →1.5\n\n3 and5 →1\n\n5 and7 →1\n\n7 and9 →1\n\n9 and14 →2.5\n\n14 and15 →0.5\n\n15 and15 →0\n\nThe maximum among these is 2.5, which is the sample output. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach should be:\n\n- For each consecutive pair (prev, curr), compute (curr - prev)/2.\n\n- The maximum of these values across all consecutive pairs is the minimal d.\n\nWait, but what about the first pair, (0,0) → (0-0)/2=0. Which is fine.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the first pair is 0 and0, which gives d=0. But for the pair (0,3), it gives 1.5, which is higher than 0. So the maximum is 2.5, which comes from the pair (9,14).\n\nAh, so the approach is to compute (curr - prev)/2 for every consecutive pair, including the ones between 0 and the first lantern, and between the last lantern and l.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lanterns.\n\n2. Create a new list by adding 0 at the beginning and l at the end.\n\n3. Iterate through each consecutive pair in this new list, compute (curr - prev)/2.\n\n4. Take the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, no. Because when you add 0 at the beginning, the first pair is 0 and the first lantern.\n\nWait, no. Because the new list is [0] + sorted_ais + [l].\n\nSo the first pair is 0 and sorted_ais[0], the next is sorted_ais[0] and sorted_ais[1], etc., until the last pair is sorted_ais[-1] and l.\n\nWait, no. Because the new list is [0, a1, a2, ..., an, l].\n\nSo the consecutive pairs are (0, a1), (a1, a2), ..., (an, l).\n\nSo for each of these pairs, compute (curr - prev)/2.\n\nThe maximum of these is the required d.\n\nSo in the first sample, the pair (9,14) gives (14-9)/2=2.5, which is the maximum.\n\nHence, the sample output is 2.5.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute (curr - prev)/2 for each consecutive pair in the list [0] + sorted_ais + [l], and take the maximum.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's see the second sample:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the lanterns are at [2,5].\n\nSorted_ais = [2,5].\n\nAdd 0 and 5 to get [0,2,5,5].\n\nConsecutive pairs:\n\n0 and2 → (2-0)/2=1.\n\n2 and5 → (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\n5 and5 →0.\n\nMaximum is 1.5. But the sample output is 2.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, sample output is 2.0000000000.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the second sample:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\nLanterns at 2 and5.\n\nSo sorted_ais is [2,5].\n\nAdding 0 and5 gives [0,2,5,5].\n\nWait, no, the new list is [0,2,5,5], because l is 5.\n\nSo the consecutive pairs are:\n\n0 and2 → (2-0)/2=1.\n\n2 and5 → (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\n5 and5 → (5-5)/2=0.\n\nMax is 1.5.\n\nBut the sample says d=2.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So according to my approach, the answer would be 1.5, but the correct answer is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the note in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second sample, at d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4], and the second covers [3,7]. Together, they cover the entire street [0,5].\n\nBut according to the approach, the required d is 1.5.\n\nWhat's going on here.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is incorrect. So where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach should also consider the coverage of each lantern beyond just their immediate neighbors.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the second sample's reasoning is different.\n\nWait, the approach computes the required d for each consecutive pair as (curr - prev)/2.\n\nBut in the second sample, the maximum of these is 1.5, but the correct d is 2.\n\nSo that suggests that the approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, this indicates that the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo I need to rethink.\n\nLet me try to model the problem differently.\n\nEach lantern i has a coverage interval [ai -d, ai +d].\n\nThe union of all these intervals must cover [0, l].\n\nWe need to find the minimal d such that this condition holds.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the smallest d where the union of the intervals [ai -d, ai +d] for all i covers [0, l].\n\nThis is equivalent to finding d where for every x in [0, l], there exists some i such that |x - ai| ≤ d.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the minimal value where for all x in [0,l], x is covered by at least one ai.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal d such that the maximum distance from any point in [0,l] to the nearest lantern is ≤d.\n\nSo, d must be at least the maximum of the minimal distances from any point in [0,l] to the nearest lantern.\n\nThus, the minimal d is equal to the maximal minimal distance.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances from any point in [0,l] to the nearest lantern.\n\nTherefore, to compute this, we can:\n\n1. Sort the lanterns.\n\n2. For each lantern, compute the coverage on either side.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to compute the maximum minimal distance is to consider all the critical points where the minimal distance changes.\n\nThese critical points are the lantern positions, and the points where the minimal distance increases or decreases.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum minimal distance occurs either at the midpoints between two consecutive lanterns or at the ends.\n\nWait, that's similar to the initial approach.\n\nWait, for example, in the second sample:\n\nlanterns at 2 and5.\n\nThe street is from 0 to5.\n\nCompute for each point x in [0,5], the minimal distance to the nearest lantern.\n\nFind the maximum of these minimal distances.\n\nThe maximum minimal distance is 2.\n\nHow?\n\nAt x=0: nearest is 2 → distance 2.\n\nAt x=5: nearest is 5 → distance 0.\n\nWait, but for x=0, the distance is 2, which is the maximum.\n\nSo the minimal d is 2.\n\nSo according to this approach, the minimal d is 2.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, the maximum (curr - prev)/2 is 1.5.\n\nSo, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the initial approach?\n\nIt seems that the initial approach considers only the pairs and assumes that the maximum of (curr-prev)/2 is sufficient, but in reality, sometimes the endpoints (like 0 and the first lantern) require a larger d.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to consider both the midpoints between consecutive lanterns and the endpoints.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- The distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n\n- The distance from the last lantern to l.\n\n- The maximum of (curr - prev)/2 for consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, no. Because in the second sample:\n\n- Distance from 0 to first lantern (2) is 2.\n\n- Distance from last lantern (5) to l is 0.\n\n- The maximum (curr - prev)/2 is (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2, which is correct.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\n- Distance from 0 to first lantern (0) is 0.\n\n- Distance from last lantern (15) to l is 0.\n\n- The maximum (curr - prev)/2 is 2.5.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1.\n\nIf the single lantern is at position a, then d must be max(a -0, l -a).\n\nWait, no. Because the single lantern must cover the entire street. So d must be at least max(a, l -a). Wait, no. Because the coverage is [a-d, a+d]. So to cover 0, a-d <=0 → d >=a. To cover l, a+d >=l → d >= l -a.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of a and l -a.\n\nSo in this case, the initial approach would compute (0, a) → a/2, (a, l) → (l -a)/2, and the maximum between these and the endpoints.\n\nWait, but the initial approach would compute:\n\nmax( a/2, (l -a)/2 )\n\nBut the correct d is max(a, l -a).\n\nSo, the initial approach is wrong.\n\nSo, the initial approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the endpoints (0 and l) may require a larger d than the midpoints between lanterns.\n\nSo, the correct approach must consider:\n\n- The distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n\n- The distance from the last lantern to l.\n\n- The maximum of (curr - prev)/2 for consecutive lanterns.\n\nThe minimal d is the maximum of all these.\n\nAh! So the correct steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lanterns.\n\n2. Compute the distance from 0 to the first lantern (d1 = a1 - 0).\n\n3. Compute the distance from the last lantern to l (d2 = l - a_last).\n\n4. For each consecutive pair of lanterns, compute (curr - prev)/2 and track the maximum of these (d3).\n\n5. The minimal d is the maximum of d1, d2, and d3.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in the second sample:\n\nd1 = 2.\n\nd2 = 5 -5 =0.\n\nd3 = (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nSo, maximum is 2.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nd1 =0.\n\nd2=15-15=0.\n\nd3=2.5.\n\nMaximum is 2.5.\n\nIn the case where n=1 and a=5, l=10:\n\nd1=5.\n\nd2=10-5=5.\n\nd3 is not applicable (only one lantern).\n\nSo, maximum is5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\n- Compute four values:\n\n   a. 0 to first lantern.\n\n   b. last lantern to l.\n\n   c. for each consecutive pair, (curr - prev)/2.\n\n- The minimal d is the maximum of a, b, and c.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and l.\n\n2. Read the list of ai's.\n\n3. If n==0: impossible? Because the street is unlit. But n is at least 1.\n\n4. Sort the ai's.\n\n5. Compute d1 = ai[0] -0.\n\n6. Compute d2 = l - ai[-1].\n\n7. Compute d3 as the maximum of (ai[i+1] - ai[i])/2 for all i from 0 to n-2.\n\n8. d = max(d1, d2, d3).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nai = list of integers.\n\nai.sort()\n\nif len(ai) ==0:\n\n   ... but n>=1.\n\nd1 = ai[0] -0\n\nd2 = l - ai[-1]\n\nd3 = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(ai)-1):\n\n   diff = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n\n   current_d = diff /2\n\n   if current_d > d3:\n\n       d3 = current_d\n\nd = max(d1, d2, d3)\n\nprint(d)\n\nSo, let's test this with the second sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\nai = [2,5]\n\nd1=2.\n\nd2=5-5=0.\n\nd3 = (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nmax is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, ai=5, l=10.\n\nd1=5.\n\nd2=10-5=5.\n\nd3=0.\n\nmax is5.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, ai=[0, 10, 20], l=20.\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=0.\n\nd3 is (10-0)/2=5, (20-10)/2=5.\n\nmax is5.\n\nSo, d=5.\n\nWhich is correct, because the middle lantern covers up to 15 and down to 15, but the first and last are already covering 0 and 20.\n\nWait, but wait: the coverage of the middle lantern is 15-5=10 to 15+5=25. So the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, ai=[1,3,5], l=6.\n\nd1=1.\n\nd2=6-5=1.\n\nd3: (3-1)/2=1, (5-3)/2=1.\n\nmax is1.\n\nBut wait, with d=1, the coverage is:\n\n1-1=0 to 1+1=2.\n\n3-1=2 to 3+1=4.\n\n5-1=4 to5+1=6.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, ai=[0,4,6], l=6.\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=6-6=0.\n\nd3: (4-0)/2=2, (6-4)/2=1.\n\nmax is2.\n\nWith d=2, the coverage is:\n\n0-(-2) → but wait, 0-2 is -2, which is less than 0, but the street starts at 0.\n\nSo 0's coverage is 0 to 2.\n\n4's coverage is 2 to6.\n\n6's coverage is4 to8.\n\nSo 0 to6 is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nThus, the correct steps are to compute d1, d2, and d3 as above, and take the maximum.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the ai's as a list.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute d1 = ai[0].\n\nd2 = l - ai[-1].\n\nCompute d3 as the maximum of (ai[i+1] - ai[i])/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nd = max(d1, d2, d3).\n\nPrint d with 10 decimal places.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly.\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l.\n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's written as ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'].\n\nWait, the first line is read as a string, then split.\n\nSo, for the code, perhaps read the lines as:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, the next line is a string, which is the ai's separated by spaces.\n\nBut in the sample, the input is given as a list of strings, but for code, it's better to read the entire line.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\nai_str = input().strip()\n\nai = list(map(int, ai_str.split()))\n\nThen, proceed.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will:\n\n- Read n, l.\n\n- Read the ai list.\n\n- Sort it.\n\n- Compute d1, d2, d3.\n\n- Compute d as the maximum.\n\n- Print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\nai = [2,5].\n\nsorted is [2,5].\n\nd1=2.\n\nd2=0.\n\nd3=(5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nmax is2.\n\nSo code returns 2.0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=0.\n\nd3= (14-9)/2=2.5.\n\nmax is2.5.\n\nSo code returns 2.5.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, ai=5, l=10.\n\nd1=5.\n\nd2=5.\n\nd3=0.\n\nmax is5.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, ai=[1,3,5], l=6.\n\nd1=1.\n\nd2=6-5=1.\n\nd3= (3-1)/2=1, (5-3)/2=1.\n\nmax is1.\n\nSo code returns 1.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo now, implement this in Python.\n\nMake sure to handle floating points correctly.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the ai list.\n\nSort it.\n\nCompute d1 = ai[0].\n\nd2 = l - ai[-1].\n\nCompute d3 as the maximum of (ai[i+1]-ai[i])/2 for all i.\n\nd = max(d1, d2, d3).\n\nPrint d with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\n\nd1 = ai[0]\nd2 = l - ai[-1]\n\nd3 = 0\nfor i in range(len(ai)-1):\n    diff = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n    current_d = diff / 2.0\n    if current_d > d3:\n        d3 = current_d\n\nd = max(d1, d2, d3)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but what if n=1? len(ai) is 1. So in the loop, i ranges from 0 to 0 (len(ai)-1 is 0). So no iterations. So d3 remains 0.\n\nWhich is correct, because for n=1, d3 is not considered.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, ai = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=15-15=0.\n\nd3 is computed as:\n\n3-0=3 →1.5.\n\n5-3=2→1.\n\n7-5=2→1.\n\n9-7=2→1.\n\n14-9=5→2.5.\n\n15-14=1→0.5.\n\nSo d3=2.5.\n\nmax is 2.5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, ai = [2,5].\n\nd1=2.\n\nd2=0.\n\nd3= (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nmax is 2.\n\nSo, the code outputs 2.0.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, ai=[5], l=10.\n\nd1=5.\n\nd2=5.\n\nd3=0.\n\nmax is5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, ai=[0,4,6], l=6.\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=0.\n\nd3= (4-0)/2=2, (6-4)/2=1.\n\nmax is2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street light up the entire street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance \\( d \\) from it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to make it easier to compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Compute Distances**: We compute three key distances:\n   - The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern.\n   - The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n   - The maximum distance between consecutive lanterns divided by 2, which ensures that each pair of consecutive lanterns covers the gap between them.\n3. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum of the three computed distances, ensuring that the entire street is covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\n\nd1 = ai[0]\nd2 = l - ai[-1]\n\nd3 = 0\nfor i in range(len(ai) - 1):\n    diff = ai[i + 1] - ai[i]\n    current_d = diff / 2.0\n    if current_d > d3:\n        d3 = current_d\n\nd = max(d1, d2, d3)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns and the length of the street, followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the computation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Distance Calculations**:\n   - `d1` is the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern.\n   - `d2` is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n   - `d3` is the maximum of the half-gaps between consecutive lanterns, ensuring each pair of lanterns covers their respective gap.\n4. **Result**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum of `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, ensuring the entire street is covered.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required radius by considering both the endpoints and the gaps between lanterns, ensuring the solution is optimal and handles all edge cases.",
