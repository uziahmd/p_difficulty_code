The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns arranged along a coordinate line. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build radio towers in each of the towns 1 to n with a probability of 1/2 each. Then, we need to assign signal powers to these towers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n2. Each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nWe need to calculate the probability that after building the towers, there exists a way to set the signal powers as required. The output should be this probability modulo 998244353, represented as x * y^{-1} mod MOD where x/y is the reduced fraction.\n\nHmm. So the approach is to find the number of valid configurations (where a configuration is a subset of built towers) divided by the total possible subsets (which is 2^n), then compute that fraction modulo 998244353.\n\nWait, but for each subset S of built towers, we need to check if there's a way to assign the signal powers so that all conditions are met.\n\nSo the key is to find the number of subsets S where such an assignment is possible. Let's denote this count as f(n). Then the probability is f(n) / 2^n.\n\nBut how do we compute f(n)?\n\nLet me think about the structure that a valid S must have. Since each town from 1 to n must receive exactly one signal, the signals must form a partition of these towns. Moreover, each signal's range must not include 0 or n+1, which implies that the leftmost tower must be at position 1 with power 1, and similarly the rightmost tower must be at position n with power 1. Wait, no, because if a tower is at position i with power p, it covers [i-p+1, i+p-1]. So to prevent covering 0, the leftmost tower's left boundary must not reach 0. So for the leftmost tower, say at position l, its power p_l must satisfy l - p_l + 1 >= 1? No, wait: the coverage is |c - i| < p. So for town 0, it shouldn't be covered by any tower. So for any tower at i, p must be such that i - p <= 0. Similarly, for town n+1, any tower at j must have j + p - 1 <= n. So for the rightmost tower, j + p - 1 <=n.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the valid configurations as certain structures. For example, the towers must form a set of non-overlapping intervals that exactly cover 1..n, without any overlaps or gaps.\n\nEach interval is determined by the tower's position and power. So for each tower in S, its coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)], but considering that the coverage is up to the boundaries of 1..n. But since we can't have any coverage beyond 0 and n+1, the intervals must start at 1 and end at n.\n\nWait, perhaps the valid configurations are those where the towers are placed in such a way that their coverage regions form a tiling of the entire 1..n segment, without overlapping, and each point is covered exactly once.\n\nThis feels similar to tiling with certain blocks. Maybe each tower's coverage is a block of length 2p-1, and the entire 1..n is covered by such blocks without overlaps or gaps.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S of {1, 2, ..., n} such that when each tower in S has a certain power, the coverage forms a perfect partitioning of 1..n into non-overlapping, contiguous intervals.\n\nWait, but the power can vary for each tower. So each tower can contribute a block of varying lengths, as long as they fit perfectly into 1..n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid S must form a certain kind of independent set where each tower's coverage doesn't interfere with others.\n\nBut maybe there's a pattern or a recursive way to model this.\n\nLet me think about small examples.\n\nFor n=1:\nOnly town 1 can be built. If it is built, we must set p=1. Then it covers town 1 only. So the valid subsets are {1}. The probability is 1/2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered. So for n=1, the only possible way is to have the tower in 1 with p=1. So yes.\n\nSo for n=1, f(1)=1, probability 1/2.\n\nFor n=2:\nPossible subsets:\n\n- Both 1 and 2 are built",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 to n, we can set their signal powers such that each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal, and towns 0 and n+1 receive none. The result should be presented as a fraction modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that valid configurations of towers form specific patterns. Each tower's coverage must form non-overlapping intervals that exactly cover the towns from 1 to n without extending beyond 0 or n+1. This leads us to a recursive structure where the number of valid configurations can be determined by counting valid tilings of the towns.\n\nWe use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation involves considering whether the `i-th` town is part of a new segment starting at `i` or not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]\n        if i >= 1:\n            dp[i] += dp[i - 2]\n        dp[i] %= MOD\n    \n    inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)\n    numerator = dp[n]\n    denominator = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD-2, MOD)\n    ans = (numerator * inv_denominator) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n2. **Base Case**: `dp[0]` is initialized to 1 because there's exactly one way to have no towns.\n3. **Recurrence Relation**: For each town `i`, `dp[i]` is updated by considering whether the current town starts a new segment or not. This is done by adding the value of `dp[i-1]` (extending the previous configuration) and `dp[i-2]` (starting a new segment at `i`).\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since results need to be modulo 998244353, all operations are performed under this modulus. We also compute the modular inverse of the power of 2 using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n5. **Final Calculation**: The result is computed as the number of valid configurations divided by the total possible subsets, converted to the required modular format.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, ensuring it works within the constraints for up to 200,000 towns.",
