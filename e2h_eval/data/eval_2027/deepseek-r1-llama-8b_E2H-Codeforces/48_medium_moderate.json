He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but if the second part of a door is 'R', then it's using Roman numerals instead of a normal base. Hmm, let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the input has two lines. The first line is a and b, where b can be R. The second line is c in base a, which could be a very long string. My task is to output c in base b, but if the second part was R, then we have to represent it as a Roman numeral.\n\nWait, right. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then the output should be in Roman numerals. Otherwise, output the number in base b as a string.\n2. Read the number c which is in base a. It can have leading zeros but shouldn't be zero itself.\n3. Convert c from base a to an integer value.\n4. Then, if the second part is R (i.e., we're dealing with Roman numerals), convert that integer to a Roman numeral string. Otherwise, convert it to base b and output without leading zeros.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second part is either b or R. Oh right. So the second part in the first line determines whether the conversion is to a standard base or to Roman.\n\nSo for each test case, I have to check whether the second part is R. If yes, then after converting the number to integer, I have to output it as a Roman numeral. Otherwise, I just convert the number to base b.\n\nBut wait, what about when the second part is not R? Like, for example, in the sample input, one case is '16 R'—so in that case, the conversion is to Roman. Another case is '5 R'—again, Roman. But when it's like '2 2\\n1111001', then it's just base 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Parse the first line into a and b. Check if b is 'R' or a number. If it's 'R', then the output is a Roman numeral. Else, it's a regular base.\n- Then parse the second line into the digits of c in base a. So for example, if the second line is '16 R', then the number is in base a (which could be 10, say) and needs to be converted to base b (which is R, so Roman). Or wait, maybe the second line is the c in base a regardless of the first line's b? Or is the second line always the c in base a, and the first line's second part determines how to output?\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the first line gives a and the target base or R. The second line is the number in base a. So the process is: take c in base a, convert to integer, then based on the first line's b, either write it in base b or as a Roman numeral.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read a and b from the first line. Check if b is 'R' or a number. So, for example, if the first line is '10 2', then the output is in base 2. If it's '10 R', output is Roman.\n2. Read the next line as c_str, which is a string representing a number in base a.\n3. Convert c_str from base a to an integer. Let's call this num.\n4. If b is 'R', then convert num to Roman and output.\n5. Else, convert num to base b, remove leading zeros, and output as a string.\n\nNow, the main challenges are:\n\n- Implementing a function to convert a number to Roman numerals.\n- Implementing a function to convert a number to a given base (like base 2, 10, etc.), ensuring that leading zeros are removed.\n\nLet's think about each function.\n\nFirst, converting from base a to an integer. For that, I'll need to process each character in c_str, map it to its value in base a, and compute the total.\n\nFor example, if a is 10 and c_str is '123', the number is 1*10^2 + 2*10 +3 = 123.\n\nBut wait, c_str could be up to 103 characters, but since a is up to 25, the maximum possible number is 25^103, which is way beyond what can fit in a Python integer. However, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that if the number uses Roman numerals, it won't exceed 300010, and otherwise, it's up to 101510. So perhaps the actual numbers are manageable.\n\nSo for the conversion from base a to integer, I can process each digit, multiply the current total by a, add the next digit's value, and so on.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? For example, if c_str is '00100', then the value is 100 in base a. So the function should correctly handle leading zeros.\n\nOnce I have the integer, I proceed:\n\nIf the target is Roman numerals:\n\nImplement a function to convert the integer to Roman.\n\nHow to do that? Well, Roman numerals have specific patterns. Each symbol is determined by its value, and sometimes subtractive notation is used (like IV for 4, IX for 9).\n\nI recall that there's a standard approach where you use a list of tuples that represent the value and corresponding symbol, sorted in descending order. Then, you subtract the largest possible values from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, the list would include pairs like (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I').\n\nThen, for the given number, iterate through this list, appending the symbol as many times as needed until the remaining number is zero.\n\nSo, for example, 399 becomes 'CCCCLXXXIX': 300 is 'CCC', 90 is 'XC', 9 is 'IX'.\n\nSo implementing this function is manageable.\n\nNow, for the other part: converting to base b and outputting as a string.\n\nThe function needs to take an integer num and return its representation in base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nTo do this, repeatedly divide the number by b and collect the remainders. The remainders, when read in reverse order, give the digits in base b.\n\nBut wait, the digits are represented as their respective characters. For example, in base 10, 5 is '5', in base 13, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc. So for each remainder, we need to map it to the corresponding character.\n\nAlso, note that the number can be zero, but according to the problem statement, the input c is never zero. So the output will also not be zero.\n\nBut wait, the input says that the number is non-zero, so our function doesn't have to handle zero.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the input c is guaranteed to be non-zero. So no problem.\n\nSo for the base conversion function:\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # For bases higher than 10, letters are used.\n            # So rem can be 10 (A), 11 (B), ..., 35 (Z).\n            # Wait, but in the problem statement, the bases are up to 25, so rem can be up to 24, which is 'O' (since A=10, B=11,... O=15, etc.? Wait no, O is 15? Wait, no: A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15, G=16, H=17, I=18, J=19, K=20, L=21, M=22, N=23, O=24, P=25.\n\nWait, but since base is up to 25, the maximum digit is 24, which is 'O'? Wait, let me see:\n\nDigits beyond 9 are represented by letters. So for base 10, digits are 0-9. For base 11, 0-10 (A). For base 25, 0-24, which is 0-9, then A-P (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 24 is O? Wait, no: 10 is A, 11 B, 12 C, 13 D, 14 E, 15 F, 16 G, 17 H, 18 I, 19 J, 20 K, 21 L, 22 M, 23 N, 24 O, 25 P.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the bases are up to 25, but the output is the digits in base b, which can be up to 25. So for base 25, the digits are 0-24, represented as 0-9, then A-P.\n\nSo, for a remainder r, the corresponding character is:\n\nif r < 10: str(r)\n\nelse: chr(ord('A') + (r -10)).\n\nWait, for r=10: 'A', r=11: 'B', up to r=24: 'O'? No, 10 is A, 11 is B, ..., 24 is O? Wait, O is the 15th letter after A. Because A is 1st, B 2nd, ... O is 15th. Wait, no: A is the first letter, so 10 is A, 11 is B, up to 24 is O. Because 10+14=24, which is O.\n\nSo, for r >=10, the character is 'A' + (r-10).\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndigit_map = {}\nfor i in range(10):\n    digit_map[i] = str(i)\nfor i in range(10, 26):\n    digit_map[i] = chr(ord('A') + i -10)\n\nWait, no: for i from 10 to 25:\n\ni=10 → 'A'\n\ni=11 → 'B'\n\n...\n\ni=25 → 'P'\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the base can be up to 25, so the digits can go up to 24 (since the maximum digit is base-1). So for base 25, the maximum digit is 24, which is 'O'.\n\nSo, the function to get the character for a given remainder is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the function to convert a number to a given base:\n\ndef int_to_base(num, base):\n    if num == 0:\n        return '0'\n    res = []\n    while num > 0:\n        rem = num % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            res.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        num = num // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(res))\n\nWait, but wait, for example, if num is 5 and base is 2, it should return '101' because 5 in binary is 101. Let's see:\n\nnum=5, base=2:\n\nLoop:\n\nnum=5, rem=1 → '1', num=2.\n\nnum=2, rem=0 → '0', num=1.\n\nnum=1, rem=1 → '1', num=0.\n\nSo res is ['1','0','1'], reversed to '101' → correct.\n\nAnother test: num=10, base=10 → '10' → correct.\n\nnum=10, base=13 → 'A' → correct.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, the other function is to convert from integer to Roman numerals.\n\nImplementing that:\n\nWe can create a list of tuples, each containing the value and the corresponding Roman numeral, in descending order. Then, for each tuple, while the current number is greater or equal to the value, we append the numeral and subtract the value from the number.\n\nFor example, the list would be:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair in this list, subtract as many times as possible, appending the symbol each time.\n\nSo, the function would look like:\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    roman = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while num >= value:\n            roman += symbol\n            num -= value\n        if num == 0:\n            break\n    return roman\n\nTesting this:\n\nFor 399: 300 is CCC, 90 is XC, 9 is IX → 'CCCXCIX'.\n\nWait, 399 divided by 1000 is 0, so first pair is skipped. 399 >= 900? No. Next is 500, no. 400? No. 100: yes. 399//100 is 3, so add 'CCC'. Now, num is 99.\n\nNext is 90: 99 >=90 → add 'XC', num is 9.\n\nNext is 50, 40, etc. None until 10: 9<10. So next is 9: add 'IX' → done. So overall 'CCCXCIX'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: 5 → 'V'.\n\nAnother test: 4 → 'IV'.\n\nAnother test: 3 → 'III'.\n\nSo, the function seems correct.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCheck if b is 'R' or a number. So, for the first line, split into a_str and b_str. Then, a = int(a_str), and b_val = int(b_str) if possible. But if b_str is 'R', then we treat it as Roman.\n\nWait, no: the first line's second part is either an integer or 'R'. So, if the second part is 'R', then the target is to output in Roman numerals. Else, output in base b.\n\nSo, in code:\n\na, b = input().split()\nif b == 'R':\n    is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b = int(b)\n    is_roman = False\n\nWait, no, wait: the first line is two parts: a and b (or R). So, for example, if the first line is '10 2', then a=10, b=2.\n\nIf it's '10 R', then a=10, b is R.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\na, target = line1.split()\nif target == 'R':\n    is_roman = True\nelse:\n    a = int(a)\n    b = int(target)\n    is_roman = False\n\nWait, but wait: the second part is either R or a number. So, in code, the target is either 'R' or a string that can be converted to an integer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\nparts = line1.split()\na = int(parts[0])\ntarget = parts[1]\nif target == 'R':\n    is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b = int(target)\n    is_roman = False\n\nYes.\n\nThen, read the second line as c_str.\n\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nConvert c_str from base a to integer.\n\nBut wait, c_str is a string that represents a number in base a. How to handle each character in c_str.\n\nEach character must be a digit in base a. So, for example, if a is 10, the digits are 0-9. If a is 16, digits are 0-F.\n\nSo, for each character in c_str, we need to find its value in base a. For example, 'A' in base 16 is 10.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, c is given as a string in base a, which may contain letters only if a is higher than 10. So, for a base less than 10, the digits can only be 0-9.\n\nSo, the function to convert c_str to an integer is:\n\ndef str_to_int(c_str, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in c_str:\n        val = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10)\n        # Wait, but what if ch is lowercase? Probably, the input is uppercase, but better to make it case-insensitive.\n        # So, uppercase the character.\n        # For digits above 9, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        if val >= base:\n            raise ValueError(\"Digit exceeds base\")\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\nWait, but what if a is 10, and the character is 'A'? Then, that's invalid because in base 10, 'A' is not allowed.\n\nSo, the function needs to check that each character is a valid digit in base a.\n\nSo, for each character in c_str:\n\n- If it's a digit, its value must be < base.\n\n- Else, it's a letter (uppercase?), its value must be between 10 and base-1.\n\nSo, the function will raise an error if any digit is invalid.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is valid, so perhaps we don't need to handle errors. But during testing, it's better to ensure that.\n\nSo, in code, for each character:\n\nif ch is a digit: val = int(ch), must be < base.\n\nelse: val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10, must be <= base-1.\n\nWait, but base can be as low as 2. So, for base 2, letters are not allowed. So, any letter in the string would be invalid.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is correct, so perhaps we can assume that the c_str is a valid number in base a.\n\nSo, the function can proceed without error checking.\n\nThus, the code for converting c_str to integer is as follows.\n\nOnce we have the integer, we decide whether to convert it to Roman or to base b.\n\nIf is_roman is True:\n\nCall int_to_roman(num) and output the result.\n\nElse:\n\nConvert num to base b using int_to_base(num, b), then output the string.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros in the base conversion? For example, if the number is 0, but according to the problem statement, c is not zero.\n\nSo, in the function int_to_base, we return '0' only if num is zero. Otherwise, the function returns the string without leading zeros.\n\nWait, no: in the function, if num is zero, it returns '0'. Else, it builds the string by taking remainders, which gives the least significant digits first. Then, reverses it to get the correct order.\n\nSo, for example, num=5, base=2: returns '101'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for cases where the output is zero, but according to the problem statement, it's not required.\n\nSo, the code flow is:\n\nRead a and target.\n\nRead c_str.\n\nConvert c_str to integer num.\n\nIf target is R:\n\n   output int_to_roman(num)\n\nElse:\n\n   output int_to_base(num, b)\n\nBut wait, the function int_to_base returns the correct string without leading zeros.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the input as lines. So, the first line is '10 2', so a=10, target=2 → output base 2.\n\nSecond line is '16 R' → a=16, target is R → output as Roman.\n\nThird line: '5 R' → a=5, target R → Roman.\n\nFourth line: '2 2\\n1111001' → a=2, target 2 → output binary.\n\nFifth line: '12 13\\nA' → a=12, target 13 → output base 13.\n\nWait, the sample output is:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst case: a=10, b=2.\n\nc_str is '1' → 1 in base 10 is 1. Output in base 2 is '1'.\n\nSecond case: a=16, target R.\n\nc_str is '5' → 5 in base 16 is 5. So Roman is 'V'.\n\nThird case: a=5, target R. c_str is '4' → 4 in base 5 is 4. Roman is 'IV'.\n\nFourth case: a=2, target 2. c_str is '1111001' → let's compute its value:\n\nEach '1' is 1 in base 2. The string is 7 digits, which is 1<<6 + 1<<5 + 1<<4 + 1<<3 + 0 + 0 +1.\n\nWait, wait: '1111001' is 1*64 + 1*32 + 1*16 + 1*8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 → 64+32=96, +16=112, +8=120, +1=121. So 121 in decimal. So output is '1111001' in base 2.\n\nWait, but 121 in binary is 1111001, which is correct.\n\nFifth case: a=12, target 13.\n\nc_str is 'A' → in base 12, 'A' is 10. So the integer is 10. Output in base 13 is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code should handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, potential edge cases:\n\n- When the number is zero: but the problem says c is not zero.\n\n- When the base is 1: but the problem says a and b are at least 2, except when target is R.\n\nWait, the constraints say a and b are ≥2, but if b is R, then it's treated as Roman.\n\nSo, no need to handle base 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when the integer is 0, but according to the problem, the input c is non-zero.\n\nAnother case: when the number in base a is '0', but that's not possible as per the problem statement.\n\nAnother case: when the target is a base larger than 10, and the number is such that some digits are letters.\n\nE.g., a=16, target=16. c_str='10' → which is 16 in base 16 → 16 in base 16 is '10'.\n\nWait, no: 10 in base 16 is 16 in decimal.\n\nWait, no: 10 in base 16 is 1*16 + 0 = 16.\n\nSo, output is '10'.\n\nWait, but in base 16, the output would be '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when the number is 0, but according to problem statement, it's not possible.\n\nAnother edge case: when the number is 1, and the target is base 2 → '1'.\n\nWhen the target is Roman, 1 is 'I'.\n\nAnother case: when the number is 399, and target is Roman → 'CCCXCIX'.\n\nAnother case: when the number is 400 → 'CD'.\n\nAnother case: when the number is 0, but problem says it's not possible.\n\nSo, now, let's implement the code.\n\nBut wait, in the function str_to_int, what about letters in lowercase? The problem statement says that the input is a string in base a, which may contain letters, but the examples show uppercase.\n\nSo, perhaps the input is given in uppercase letters. But to be safe, in the function, we can convert the character to uppercase before processing.\n\nSo, in the function, for each character, we do:\n\nif ch.isdigit():\n    val = int(ch)\nelse:\n    ch_upper = ch.upper()\n    val = ord(ch_upper) - ord('A') + 10\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor ch in c_str:\n    if ch.isdigit():\n        val = int(ch)\n    else:\n        val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n    num = num * a + val\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nRead the first line, parse a and target.\n\nRead the second line as c_str.\n\nConvert c_str to integer.\n\nIf target is R: output Roman.\n\nElse: output base b.\n\nNow, code.\n\nImplementing the functions:\n\ndef str_to_int(c_str, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in c_str:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    roman = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            roman += r\n            num -= i\n        if num == 0:\n            break\n    return roman\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if base < 2:\n        return ''  # Not expected per problem statement\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nThen, the main code:\n\nimport sys\n\nline1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nparts = line1.split()\na = int(parts[0])\ntarget = parts[1]\n\nif target == 'R':\n    is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b = int(target)\n    is_roman = False\n\nc_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nnum = 0\nfor ch in c_str:\n    if ch.isdigit():\n        val = int(ch)\n    else:\n        val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n    num = num * a + val\n\nif is_roman:\n    print(int_to_roman(num))\nelse:\n    print(int_to_base(num, b))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '10 2', which is a=10, target=2. So, the code should output the number in base 2.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n10 2\n1\n16 R\n5\n5 R\n4\n2 2\n1111001\n12 13\nA\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor the first case, a=10, target=2, c_str='1' → 1 → output in base 2 is '1'.\n\nSecond case: a=16, target=R. c_str='5' →5 → Roman is 'V'.\n\nThird case: a=5, target=R. c_str='4' →4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nFourth case: a=2, target=2. c_str='1111001' → 121 → output in base 2 is '1111001'.\n\nFifth case: a=12, target=13. c_str='A' →10 → output in base 13 is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: when the number is 399 and target is R → 'CCCXCIX'.\n\nAnother test case: when the number is 400, target is R → 'CD'.\n\nAnother test case: when the number is 0, but problem says it's not present.\n\nAnother test case: when a=16, target=16, c_str='10' →10 in hex is 16 → output '10'.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, target=2, c_str='1111' → 15 → '1111'.\n\nYes.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling leading zeros in c_str: the function str_to_int correctly processes them. For example, '0001' in base 10 is 1.\n\n- When the number is 0: but problem says it's not allowed.\n\n- When the target base is larger than the number: e.g., num=3, base=5 → '3'.\n\n- When the target base is 1: but problem says base is at least 2, except when target is R.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, writing the final code, making sure to read from stdin, etc.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1', which is read as line1 = '10 2\\n1' → split into ['10', '2\\n1'] → wait, no.\n\nWait, no: the first line is '10 2\\n1' → which is two parts: '10' and '2\\n1'?\n\nNo, wait, no. Because the first line is the first line of input, which includes the \\n. So, when using split(), the line is split into two parts: '10' and '2\\n1'?\n\nNo, wait, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1' → but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the sample input is miswritten. Wait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut perhaps that's a formatting issue. So, in reality, the first line is '10 2' followed by a newline, then the second line is '1'.\n\nSo, in code, line1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip() → which would correctly split into '10' and '2'.\n\nSimilarly, the second line is '1' → c_str = '1'.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the code, when target is 'R', is_roman is set to True. Then, the code converts the number to Roman and prints it.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → so a=16, target is R, c_str is '5' → which is 5 in base 16 → 5 in Roman is 'V'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: when the number is 0, but it's not allowed.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to either a specified base `b` or Roman numerals. The problem involves reading input values, converting them, and outputting the result in the appropriate format.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains two integers, `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R' indicating Roman numerals. The second line is a string representing a number in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Integer**: Convert the given string from base `a` to an integer.\n3. **Determine Output Format**: Check if the target is 'R'. If so, convert the integer to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert the integer to the specified base `b`.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: Use a predefined list of tuples to map values to their Roman numeral symbols, iterating through this list to build the Roman numeral string.\n5. **Base Conversion**: Convert the integer to the specified base using repeated division and modulo operations, mapping remainders to appropriate characters for bases higher than 10.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef str_to_int(c_str, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in c_str:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    roman = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            roman += r\n            num -= i\n        if num == 0:\n            break\n    return roman\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    line1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    parts = line1.split()\n    a = int(parts[0])\n    target = parts[1]\n    \n    is_roman = (target == 'R')\n    \n    c_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    num = str_to_int(c_str, a)\n    \n    if is_roman:\n        print(int_to_roman(num))\n    else:\n        print(int_to_base(num, int(target)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the first line to get `a` and `b` (or 'R'). The second line is read to get the number in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Integer**: The function `str_to_int` converts the string from base `a` to an integer by processing each character and converting it to its corresponding value.\n3. **Output Format Check**: If the target is 'R', the integer is converted to a Roman numeral using `int_to_roman`. Otherwise, it is converted to the specified base using `int_to_base`.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `int_to_roman` uses a list of tuples to map values to Roman symbols, iterating through the list to build the result string.\n5. **Base Conversion**: The function `int_to_base` converts the integer to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to appropriate characters for bases higher than 10.\n\nThis approach ensures that the number is correctly converted and formatted according to the problem requirements.",
