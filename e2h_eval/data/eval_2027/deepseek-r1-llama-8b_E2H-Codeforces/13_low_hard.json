For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem:\n\nA triad consists of three notes. The triad is major if, after sorting the notes in some order, the distances between consecutive notes are 4 and 3 semitones. For minor, it's the opposite: 3 and 4 semitones respectively. If neither condition is met, it's strange.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input, which is three space-separated notes.\n2. Convert each note into its position in the 12-note scale. Each note has a specific index, like C=0, C#=1, ..., H=11.\n3. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes since the order matters for calculating the distances.\n4. For each permutation, check the distances between consecutive notes (mod 12, considering cyclical nature).\n5. Determine if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n6. If exactly one condition is satisfied, output accordingly. Otherwise, output 'strange'.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the answer will always be unambiguous. So there won't be cases where both major and minor conditions are satisfied, so no need to worry about that.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the notes.\n\nI'll create a dictionary mapping each note to its index. Like:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nWait, wait—what about the note names? The input could have uppercase letters, but in the problem statement, the examples have lowercase. But the problem says the input is in the notation as given, which includes the example inputs as ['C E G', etc.]. So perhaps the input uses strings with spaces, like 'C E G' as the first element.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSo each triad is given as a string of three notes separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for each triad, I need to split it into individual notes.\n\nFor each note in the triad, I'll convert it to its corresponding index.\n\nOnce I have the three indices, I can generate all possible orderings (permutations) of these three indices.\n\nFor each permutation, I calculate the distance between the first and second note, then between the second and third.\n\nBut wait, since the notes are in a circle, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. However, the problem defines the distance as the number of semitones from lower to higher, so for example, from C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, then D, D#, E: total 4). But from E to C would be 8 semitones because you go up a full octave minus 4, but the distance is measured as from the lower to higher, so wrapping around.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement:\n\nThe distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppermost one. So the distance between two notes is (y - x) mod 12. Because if y is higher than x, it's y-x; otherwise, it's 12 - (x - y).\n\nWait, no. Because for example, the distance from E to C is 8 semitones, not 4. Because when going from E to C, it's a half-circle. So the distance is calculated as (C is after H, which comes after B, etc.) So for any two notes, the distance is (y - x) mod 12, but only if y is considered higher than x in the cyclic order.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance between X and Y is ... from the lowest tone to the uppermost one.\" So when considering X and Y, if X is lower than Y, the distance is (Y - X) semitones. If X is higher, then the distance wraps around.\n\nBut when calculating the distance between two notes, regardless of their order, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that Y is the next note in the cycle after X. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem says: the distance between C and E is 4 semitones, and between E and C is 8 semitones. So when X is C and Y is E: distance is 4. When X is E and Y is C: distance is 8.\n\nSo for two notes A and B, the distance is (B - A) mod 12. Because when A",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. A major chord is defined by specific distances between its notes, as is a minor chord, and if neither condition is met, the chord is considered strange.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Notes to Indices**: First, we map each note to its corresponding index in the 12-note musical scale. This allows us to work with numerical values for easier calculations.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the order of notes matters for determining the distances, we generate all permutations of the three notes.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes. The distance is computed as the difference modulo 12, considering the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Check Conditions**: For each permutation, check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor chord. If a permutation satisfies either condition, classify the chord accordingly.\n5. **Determine Result**: Based on the checks, output whether the chord is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ndef get_note_indices(triad):\n    return [note_to_index[note] for note in triad]\n\ndef is_major(triad_indices):\n    for perm in permutations(triad_indices):\n        d1 = (perm[1] - perm[0]) % 12\n        d2 = (perm[2] - perm[1]) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_minor(triad_indices):\n    for perm in permutations(triad_indices):\n        d1 = (perm[1] - perm[0]) % 12\n        d2 = (perm[2] - perm[1]) % 12\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    triads = input_line.split()\n    for triad in triads:\n        indices = get_note_indices(triad.split())\n        if is_major(indices):\n            print(\"major\")\n        elif is_minor(indices):\n            print(\"minor\")\n        else:\n            print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Conversion**: Each note is converted into its respective index using a predefined mapping.\n- **Permutations**: We consider all possible orderings of the notes to ensure no potential chord type is missed.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the difference modulo 12, which handles the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n- **Condition Checks**: For each permutation, we check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor chord. If any permutation satisfies the major condition, the chord is classified as major; similarly for minor. If neither condition is met, the chord is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine the type of chord based on the given musical theory definitions.",
