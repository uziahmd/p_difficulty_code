She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two types of actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right. But she can't move beyond the currently available tabs. For example, if a tab is closed on the left, moving left might not be possible as far as before.\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position. When she closes, the available tabs (a and b) are updated. So after closing, the next moves will be limited within the remaining tabs.\n\nHmm, so the key here is to model how the movement and closing affect each other and find the optimal sequence of actions to minimize the time.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial state. The tabs are all open, so a=1 and b=n.\n\nShe needs to end up with only the tabs from l to r. So any tabs to the left of l must be closed, and any to the right of r must be closed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial state includes all tabs, and she needs to close the ones outside [l, r]. So:\n\n- All tabs less than l must be closed.\n- All tabs greater than r must be closed.\n\nSo the first thing is to determine whether she needs to close the left side (i.e., if l > 1), the right side (if r < n), or both.\n\nLet's consider the different cases.\n\nCase 1: Both left and right need to be closed.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1 (left of l=2) and 5,6 (right of r=4). So she has to do both.\n\nCase 2: Only left needs to be closed.\n\nLike the second sample: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So she just needs to close the right side (tabs 4,5,6).\n\nCase 3: Only right needs to be closed.\n\nOr maybe none? Like the third sample where l=r=5, but that's perhaps another scenario.\n\nWait, wait, the third sample input is 5 2 1 5. So l=1 and r=5, which covers all tabs. So nothing needs to be done, hence 0 seconds.\n\nSo the approach is to figure out which sides (left and right) need to be closed, then compute the minimal steps required for each scenario.\n\nI think the steps would involve:\n\n1. Determine whether we need to close the left, the right, both, or neither.\n\n2. For each necessary side, calculate the minimal steps to close them.\n\n3. Sum the steps, but also consider that moving between the two closure points may take some time.\n\nWait, but sometimes it's better to close one side first, then the other, or perhaps there's an optimal order.\n\nSo perhaps we should explore all possible orders of closing (left first then right, right first then left) and choose the minimal total steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the process.\n\nSuppose we have to close left and right.\n\nWe can either:\n\na) Close left first, then close right.\n\nb) Close right first, then close left.\n\nEach option may result in a different total time.\n\nWe need to compute both and take the minimum.\n\nSimilarly, if only one side needs to be closed, just compute that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check if we need to close left (if l > 1): yes, because there are tabs less than l that need to be closed.\n\n- Similarly, check if right needs to be closed (if r < n).\n\nThen, based on which sides need to be closed, decide the steps.\n\nNow, for each side, how do we compute the steps needed to close it?\n\nFor the left side:\n\nTo close all tabs to the left of the cursor, she must move to a position where a is such that [a, i-1] can be closed.\n\nWait, when she is at position i, she can close all tabs to the left (which are a to i-1) or to the right (i+1 to b).\n\nSo, to close the left, she needs to be at a position i such that a <= i-1, meaning that there are tabs to the left of i that can be closed.\n\nBut initially, a=1, so to close the left, she needs to move to i=2, and then close all left (but that would close nothing since a=1 and i-1=1, which is the same as a). So perhaps she can't close anything until she moves further.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose she is at position i. Closing left would close all tabs from a to i-1. So to have some tabs to close on the left, i-1 must be >= a. So i must be at least a+1.\n\nSo, for example, in the first case, she starts at 3. To close the left, she can move to 2, then close left, which would close tab 1. Then she can proceed.\n\nSo, the steps for the left closure:\n\n- Move from starting position to a position i where i > a (so that closing left does something).\n\n- Then, close left.\n\nSimilarly for the right closure.\n\nSo for each closure (left and/or right), we need to calculate the minimal steps to reach the optimal position to close that side, plus the step to close.\n\nNow, considering that a and b change after each closure, the movement is affected.\n\nWait, but each closure changes a and/or b. So after closing left, a becomes i, because the new a is the minimum index that's still open.\n\nSo, for the left closure:\n\nInitially, a=1, b=n.\n\nSuppose she needs to close the left. So she needs to reach a position i where i > a (so that i-1 >= a). So she can move to i, then close left.\n\nAfter that, a becomes i, because the tabs before i are closed.\n\nSimilarly, for the right closure: she needs to reach a position j where j < b, so that closing right will close j+1 to b. After that, b becomes j.\n\nSo, the movement to reach the optimal position for each closure depends on the current a and b.\n\nSo, the problem is to model the state transitions as she moves and closes.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, perhaps a BFS approach is feasible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's manageable to model the steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to calculate the required steps without simulating all possibilities.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst, decide which sides need to be closed.\n\nIf both left and right need to be closed:\n\nCompute the cost of two scenarios:\n\n1. Close left first, then close right.\n\n2. Close right first, then close left.\n\nTake the minimal of the two.\n\nIf only one side needs to be closed, compute that.\n\nSo let's model each scenario.\n\nLet me think about the first scenario: close left first, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n\na) Move to the optimal position for left closure.\n\nb) Close left.\n\nc) Update a.\n\nd) Move to the optimal position for right closure.\n\ne) Close right.\n\nf) Update b.\n\nTotal steps: steps a + 1 (close) + steps d.\n\nSimilarly for the other scenario.\n\nBut what is the optimal position for each closure?\n\nFor the left closure:\n\nThe optimal position is the earliest possible position where you can close left, but perhaps it's better to be as close as possible to the current position to minimize movement.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing left, the available tabs change.\n\nWait, but for the left closure, the optimal position is the minimal i such that i > a (initially a=1). So the earliest possible is 2.\n\nBut perhaps moving to 2 is better than moving to a higher position because it reduces movement for the next step.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, for the left closure:\n\nShe needs to reach a position i where i is in the current available tabs, and i > a. So the earliest possible is a+1.\n\nIn the initial state, a=1, so she can reach i=2, and close the left.\n\nSo moving from pos to 2.\n\nThe steps needed are |pos - 2|.\n\nThen, she closes left: +1 step.\n\nThis brings a to 2.\n\nNow, for the right closure: she needs to reach a position j where j < current b (which was n, but after a is 2, but b remains n unless she closes right.\n\nWait, no: after closing left, a becomes 2, but b is still n.\n\nWait, no. Closing left doesn't change b. It only changes a to the current position.\n\nSo, for right closure, she needs to reach a position j where j < b (which is still n, assuming she hasn't closed right yet).\n\nSo, to close right, she needs to be at j where j+1 <= b. So j can be any position up to b-1.\n\nWait, when she is at j, she can close right, which will close j+1 to b. So j must be <= b-1.\n\nSo, for the right closure, the optimal position is the furthest possible to the left, perhaps? Or the closest to the current position?\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal position is as far to the right as possible to minimize the movement.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to be as close as possible to the current position.\n\nHmm, but let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose after closing left, she is at 2. Now, she needs to close the right.\n\nWhat's the best j to choose?\n\nIf she moves to r, that's the position where the right closure is needed.\n\nBecause from there, she can close everything to the right.\n\nSo, she moves from 2 to r.\n\nThe steps taken are (r - 2).\n\nThen, she closes right, which takes 1 step.\n\nSo total steps for left then right: (steps to 2) + 1 (close left) + (steps from 2 to r) + 1 (close right).\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can find a more optimal path.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first test case is n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close left and right.\n\nSo, according to our scenario:\n\nClose left first.\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nNow a is 2.\n\nThen, move from 2 to 4: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 1+1+2+1=5, which matches the sample.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother scenario: suppose she closes right first.\n\nShe needs to get to position r=4.\n\nMove from 3 to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nNow, b becomes 4.\n\nThen, she needs to close left.\n\nShe is at 4. She can close left, but she needs to be at a position i where i> a (current a is 1).\n\nSo she can move from 4 to 2.\n\nSteps: 4-2=2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 1+1+2+1=5, same as before.\n\nSo both orders give the same total.\n\nSo in this case, it doesn't matter which order she chooses.\n\nBut what about other cases?\n\nLet's imagine a scenario where closing left first is better.\n\nSuppose n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\nShe needs to close left and right.\n\nOption 1: Close left first.\n\nMove from 5 to 3: 2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step. Now a=3.\n\nThen, she needs to close right. She is at 3, and needs to go to 7.\n\nSteps: 7-3=4.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal steps: 2+1+4+1=8.\n\nOption 2: Close right first.\n\nMove from 5 to 7: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1 step. Now b=7.\n\nThen, close left: she is at 7, needs to go to 3.\n\nSteps:7-3=4.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal steps: 2+1+4+1=8.\n\nSame.\n\nHmm, same result.\n\nAnother example: n=100, pos=50, l=10, r=90.\n\nShe needs to close left and right.\n\nIf she closes left first:\n\nShe moves from 50 to 10: 40 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nNow a=10.\n\nThen, she needs to move to 90: 80 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal: 40+1+80+1=122.\n\nIf she closes right first:\n\nMove to 90:40 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\na remains 1.\n\nThen, move to 10:80 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal:40+1+80+1=122.\n\nSame.\n\nHmm, perhaps the order doesn't matter in some cases.\n\nBut what if the order affects the total steps?\n\nLet me think of another scenario.\n\nSuppose n=10, pos=6, l=4, r=5.\n\nSo she needs to close left (tabs 1-3) and right (tabs 6-10).\n\nOption 1: Close left first.\n\nShe is at 6. To close left, she needs to be at 4.\n\nSo steps to move from 6 to4: 2.\n\nClose left:1.\n\na becomes4.\n\nNow, she needs to close right. She is at4, needs to get to5.\n\nSteps:1.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal steps:2+1+1+1=5.\n\nOption 2: Close right first.\n\nShe needs to get to5.\n\nSteps from6 to5:1.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nNow, b becomes5.\n\nShe then needs to close left.\n\nShe is at5, needs to get to4.\n\nSteps:1.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal steps:1+1+1+1=4.\n\nAh, here the order matters. So in this case, closing right first gives a better result.\n\nSo the order can affect the total steps.\n\nThus, our approach should consider both possibilities and choose the one that gives the minimal total steps.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Determine which sides need to be closed.\n\n   - left_needed = (l > 1)\n   - right_needed = (r < n)\n\n2. If neither is needed: return 0.\n\n3. Else if only left is needed: calculate the steps.\n\n4. Else if only right is needed: calculate the steps.\n\n5. Else both are needed: calculate the steps for both orders (left then right, right then left) and choose the minimal.\n\nNow, the question is, how to model each scenario.\n\nFor each possible scenario, calculate the steps as follows.\n\nLet's think about the general case where both left and right need to be closed.\n\nCase A: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\na. Move from initial pos to the position where left can be closed.\n\n   - The left can be closed when the current position is > a (initially 1). So the earliest position is 2.\n\n   So she needs to move to 2.\n\n   Or wait, no. Because a is 1, so to close left, the position must be i > a. So i can be 2,3,...,n.\n\n   So the optimal position to close left is the earliest possible, which is 2.\n\n   Because moving to 2 takes the least steps.\n\nWait, but perhaps moving to a position further right allows for a shorter path when moving towards the right later.\n\nBut in the initial state, a is 1, so the earliest possible is 2.\n\nSo for left closure, the steps are |pos - 2|.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, pos is 3. Moving to 2 is 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the initial pos is already at 2?\n\nThen, no movement is needed.\n\nSo, for left closure:\n\npos_left = 2.\n\nsteps_move_left = abs(pos - pos_left).\n\nThen, close left: +1.\n\nAfter closing left, a becomes 2.\n\nNow, for the right closure:\n\nWe need to move to r.\n\nBut what if r is not the same as the current position?\n\nShe is now at 2.\n\nSo steps_move_right = |r - 2|.\n\nClose right: +1.\n\nSo total steps for this order: steps_move_left + 1 + steps_move_right + 1.\n\nCase B: Close right first, then left.\n\nFor right closure, the earliest position is r (since she can't close right before being at r).\n\nWait, no. Because right closure can be done at any j where j < current b.\n\nInitially, b is n.\n\nSo the earliest position is j = n-1.\n\nWait, no. Because to close right, she must be at j where j < b. So j can be up to b-1.\n\nSo to close right, the optimal position is the farthest to the left possible, which is 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the earliest position to close right is 1, but perhaps moving to r is better.\n\nWait, no. Because when you close right from position j, it will close j+1 to current b.\n\nSo to maximize the tabs being closed, she should close right from the rightmost possible position.\n\nWait, no. Because when she is at position j, closing right will close j+1 to current b.\n\nSo to close as much as possible on the right, she should be as far to the right as possible.\n\nSo the optimal position to close right is current b, but she can't be there because j+1 would be b+1, which is beyond current b.\n\nWait, that's not possible.\n\nWait, j can be at most b-1.\n\nSo the optimal j is as large as possible, so that j+1 is as large as possible.\n\nSo j should be as close to b as possible.\n\nSo for the right closure, she should be at position r, or as close as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal j is r.\n\nBecause that's the position where the right closure ends exactly at r.\n\nSo, in the initial state, to close right, she needs to reach j = r.\n\nThen, she can close right, which will close r+1 to current b.\n\nSo steps for right closure: moving from pos to r.\n\nOnce she closes right, b becomes r.\n\nThen, she needs to close left: she needs to reach a position i where i > a (a is 1).\n\nSo she can move from r to 2.\n\nSteps: |r - 2|.\n\nClose left: +1.\n\nSo total steps for this order: steps_move_right_initial +1 + steps_move_left_after_right_close +1.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\nFor each order:\n\norder1:\n\nmove from pos to 2: steps1 = abs(pos - 2).\n\nclose left: +1.\n\nmove from 2 to r: steps2 = abs(2 - r).\n\nclose right: +1.\n\ntotal1 = steps1 +1 + steps2 +1.\n\norder2:\n\nmove from pos to r: steps3 = abs(pos - r).\n\nclose right: +1.\n\nmove from r to 2: steps4 = abs(r - 2).\n\nclose left: +1.\n\ntotal2 = steps3 +1 + steps4 +1.\n\nThen, the minimal between total1 and total2 is the answer.\n\nWait, but is that correct?\n\nWait, in the sample where n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\norder1:\n\nsteps1: |3-2|=1.\n\n+1: 2.\n\nsteps2: |2-4|=2.\n\n+1: 3.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\norder2:\n\nsteps3: |3-4|=1.\n\n+1:2.\n\nsteps4: |4-2|=2.\n\n+1:3.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSame.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=10, pos=6, l=4, r=5.\n\norder1:\n\nmove to 2: steps1=6-2=4.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nmove to5: 2 steps (from 2 to5 is 3 steps? Wait, wait, 2 to5 is 3 steps? 2->3,4,5: 3 steps.\n\nWait, |2-5|=3.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nTotal steps:4+1+3+1=9.\n\norder2:\n\nmove to5:6 to5 is 1 step.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nmove to2:5-2=3 steps.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nTotal steps:1+1+3+1=6.\n\nWhich is better.\n\nSo in this case, order2 is better.\n\nSo the code logic seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, in the case where she has to close both, but the initial position is not 2 or r, the order matters.\n\nSo, the code will need to compute both possibilities and pick the minimal.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe'll first check whether both left and right need to be closed.\n\nIf yes:\n\nCompute the steps for both orders and take the minimal.\n\nElse, compute the steps for whichever is needed.\n\nNow, how to handle the cases where one side is not needed.\n\nCase: only left needed.\n\nShe needs to close the left.\n\nSo, she must move to 2, close left.\n\nSteps: |pos - 2| +1.\n\nCase: only right needed.\n\nShe must move to r, close right.\n\nSteps: |pos - r| +1.\n\nWait, but in the second sample, she has to close the right.\n\nSample Input: 6 3 1 3.\n\nSo l=1, r=3, n=6.\n\nShe needs to close the right (tabs 4,5,6).\n\nShe is at 3.\n\nShe can close right directly, as she is at 3.\n\nBut wait, when she is at 3, she can close right, which will close 4,5,6.\n\nSo steps: 0 (already at 3) +1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 1.\n\nSo yes, for only right needed: steps = |pos - r| +1.\n\nWait, but in this case, pos is 3, r is3, so steps are 0 +1=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nread n, pos, l, r.\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    # compute both orders\n\n    # order1: close left then right\n\n    steps_order1 = (abs(pos - 2)) + 1 + (abs(2 - r)) + 1\n\n    # order2: close right then left\n\n    steps_order2 = (abs(pos - r)) + 1 + (abs(r - 2)) + 1\n\n    min_steps = min(steps_order1, steps_order2)\n\n    print(min_steps)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    steps = (abs(pos - 2)) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n    steps = (abs(pos - r)) +1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Is the position to close left always 2?\n\nNo, because after closing left, a becomes 2, but during movement, the available tabs may have changed.\n\nWait, no. Because in the case where we're closing left first, the movement is done before closing. So a is still 1 until she moves to 2 and closes left.\n\nSo for left closure, the position is 2, regardless of the current a.\n\nBecause she can't close left before reaching 2.\n\nSo yes, in the case where she has to close left, the steps are to move to 2, then close.\n\nSimilarly, for right closure, the steps are to move to r, then close.\n\nBut wait, when she has to close left and right, in the first order, after closing left, a is 2, so the next movement is to r, which may be beyond 2, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but what about the scenario where after closing left, the available a is 2, but the right closure requires moving from 2 to r, which may be beyond the current available tabs.\n\nWait, no. Because before closing right, the available tabs are l to r.\n\nWait, no, after closing left, a becomes 2, but b remains n.\n\nWait, no, because in the initial case, she's closing the left, which is outside l.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the initial state is that all tabs are open.\n\nWhen she closes left, she's closing the tabs to the left of her current position. So, in the case of the first sample, she's at 2, closing left, which closes tab 1. So a becomes 2.\n\nBut for the right closure, she needs to close tabs to the right of 4.\n\nSo she's at 2, and needs to move to 4, then close right, which will close 5,6.\n\nSo, yes, the code correctly models that.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close nothing, so output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the third sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close left (1) and right (5).\n\nSo steps:\n\norder1: close left first.\n\nmove from 3 to 2: 1 step.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nmove to4: 2 steps.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nTotal:1+1+2+1=5.\n\norder2: close right first.\n\nmove to4:1 step.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nmove to2:2 steps.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nTotal:1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSame.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=6, l=4, r=5.\n\nAs discussed earlier.\n\norder1: 6->2 (4 steps), close left (1), 2->5 (3 steps), close right (1). Total 4+1+3+1=9.\n\norder2:6->5 (1), close right (1),5->2 (3), close left (1). Total 1+1+3+1=6.\n\nSo minimal is 6.\n\nSo code correctly selects order2.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this.\n\nBut wait, what about when she has to close left but is already at 2.\n\nFor example, n=10, pos=2, l=3, r=8.\n\nShe needs to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 9,10).\n\nOrder1: close left first.\n\nSteps: 0 (already at 2) +1.\n\nThen move to8: 6 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal: 0+1+6+1=8.\n\nOrder2: close right first.\n\nMove to8:6 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nThen move to2:6 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal:6+1+6+1=14.\n\nSo order1 is better.\n\nThus, code correctly calculates the minimal steps.\n\nAnother case: pos=2, l=2, r=3, n=5.\n\nShe needs to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs4,5).\n\nSo steps:\n\norder1: close left first.\n\nmove to2:0 steps.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nthen move to3:1 step.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nTotal:0+1+1+1=3.\n\norder2: close right first.\n\nmove to3:1 step.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nthen move to2:1 step.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nTotal:1+1+1+1=4.\n\nSo order1 is better.\n\nThus, code correctly picks order1.\n\nSo, the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input as four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if left_needed and right_needed.\n\nCompute steps for both orders.\n\nChoose the minimal.\n\nElse, handle the other cases.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into four integers.\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    # compute both orders\n\n    steps_order1 = abs(pos - 2) + 1 + abs(2 - r) + 1\n\n    steps_order2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - 2) + 1\n\n    min_steps = min(steps_order1, steps_order2)\n\n    print(min_steps)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - 2) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nelse:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but wait. What if l is 1 and r is n? Then, no need to close anything.\n\nYes, handled by the first condition.\n\nAnother edge case: pos is 2 and l=2, r=3, n=5.\n\nShe needs to close left (1) and right (4,5).\n\nSo order1: steps_order1 is 0 +1 + (2-2)=0 +1 =1+1=2.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, steps_order1 is:\n\nabs(pos - 2) =0.\n\n+1: 1.\n\nabs(2 - r) = 2-3=1.\n\n+1: 2.\n\nTotal steps_order1: 0+1+1+1=3.\n\nsteps_order2: move to3:1.\n\n+1:2.\n\nmove to2:1.\n\n+1:3.\n\nTotal steps_order2: 1+1+1+1=4.\n\nSo minimal is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo code returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=5, l=3, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close left (1,2) and right (6,7).\n\nSo, steps_order1:\n\nmove to2:5-2=3.\n\n+1:4.\n\nmove to5:2 steps.\n\n+1:5.\n\nTotal:3+1+2+1=7.\n\nsteps_order2:\n\nmove to5:0.\n\n+1:1.\n\nmove to2:3 steps.\n\n+1:4.\n\nTotal steps_order2:0+1+3+1=5.\n\nSo code will compute steps_order1=3+1+2+1=7, steps_order2=0+1+3+1=5.\n\nmin is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo code handles this.\n\nAnother edge case: l=1, r=n.\n\nOutput is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=n-1.\n\nShe needs to close the right.\n\nSo steps: move to r, close right.\n\nSo, for example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close right (5).\n\nSteps: 3 to4:1 step, +1: total 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and closures to minimize the total time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if tabs need to be closed to the left of the segment or to the right of the segment.\n2. **Calculate Movements**: For each necessary closure (left or right), calculate the minimal steps required to move the cursor to the optimal position and then close the tabs.\n3. **Evaluate Orders**: Consider both possible orders of closing (left first then right, or right first then left) and choose the one with the minimal steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n    print(0)\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n    # Calculate steps for both orders\n    steps_order1 = abs(pos - 2) + 1 + abs(2 - r) + 1\n    steps_order2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - 2) + 1\n    print(min(steps_order1, steps_order2))\nelif left_needed:\n    print(abs(pos - 2) + 1)\nelse:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Check if there are tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Movement Calculation**:\n   - To close the left side, move to position 2 (the earliest position where left closure is possible) and then close the tabs.\n   - To close the right side, move to position `r` (the end of the segment) and then close the tabs.\n3. **Order Evaluation**: If both sides need to be closed, evaluate both possible orders (left first then right, or right first then left) and choose the one with fewer steps. This ensures the minimal time is used regardless of the order of operations.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal steps required by considering all necessary movements and closures, ensuring an optimal solution.",
