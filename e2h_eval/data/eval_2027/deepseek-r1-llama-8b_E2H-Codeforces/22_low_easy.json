After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark than them for that particular subject.\n\nHmm, so how do I approach this? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m characters, each being from 1 to 9. For example, if a student's row is '223', then for subject 1, they got 2, subject 2: 2, subject 3: 3.\n\nMy task is to find out, for each student, whether they are the best in any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nSo, I need to process each student's marks across all subjects and check if for at least one subject, their mark is the maximum in that subject across all students.\n\nWait, but how do I track the maximum marks per subject?\n\nI think I can create an array or a dictionary where for each subject, I keep track of the highest mark achieved by any student.\n\nThen, for each student, I compare their marks against these max marks for each subject. If any of their marks equals the corresponding max, then the student is successful.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and m from the first line.\n2. Read the next n lines, each representing a student's marks.\n3. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark across all students.\n4. For each student, check if any of their subject marks equals the max for that subject.\n5. Count the number of students who have at least one such case.\n6. Output this count.\n\nWait, but how to represent the data. Let's see.\n\nEach student's marks can be stored as a list of integers. So for each student, we have a list of m integers.\n\nFor step 3, I can initialize an array 'max_marks' of size m, where max_marks[i] is the maximum mark in subject i+1.\n\nOnce I have that, for each student, I can iterate over each subject and check if their mark equals the max_marks for that subject. If any does, increment the count.\n\nSo, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, reading the input: the first line is split into n and m. Then, for each of the next n lines, I'll read the string, and for each character in it, convert to integer, forming a list of m integers.\n\nThen, for each subject index (0 to m-1), find the maximum across all students.\n\nWait, but wait: for each subject, the maximum is the highest among all students. So, for subject j, I need to look at all students' j-th mark and find the maximum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each j in 0..m-1:\n   max_mark = max( student[j] for student in all_students )\n\nOnce I have all max_marks, then for each student in all_students, check if any of their marks equals the corresponding max_mark in their subject.\n\nIf yes, count +=1.\n\nSo, putting it together.\n\nLet's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo, n=3, m=3.\n\nStudents:\nStudent 1: [2,2,3]\nStudent 2: [3,2,3]\nStudent 3: [1,1,2]\n\nMax marks per subject:\nSubject 0: max is 3 (student 2)\nSubject 1: max is 2 (students 1 and 2)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (students 1 and 2)\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 1: in subject 0, his mark is 2 < 3 → no. Subject 1: 2 equals max, so yes. So he is successful.\n\nStudent 2: subject 0: 3 == max. So yes.\n\nStudent 3: in all subjects, his marks are below the max. So not successful.\n\nThus, total is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond input:\n3 5\n91728\n11828\n11111\n\nSo, each student has 5 subjects.\n\nLet's compute max_marks:\n\nSubject 0: all three students' first marks are 9,1,1 → max is 9.\n\nSubject 1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\nSubject 2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\nSubject 3: 2,8,1 → max 8.\n\nSubject 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is defined as one who is the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark than them for that particular subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`.\n2. **Parse Student Marks**: For each student, read their marks for all subjects and store these marks as a list of integers.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    row = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in row]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is read and split into `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's marks for all subjects.\n2. **Parsing Marks**: Each student's marks are converted from a string into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Finding Max Marks**: For each subject, iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved. This information is stored in an array `max_marks`.\n4. **Checking Success**: For each student, compare their marks against the maximum marks for each subject. If a student matches the maximum mark in any subject, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the number of successful students by leveraging the maximum marks for each subject and comparing individual student marks against these maxima.",
