He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or suffix of the original string s. Each string is either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S), and I need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's in the order of the input.\n\nHmm, the input has 2n-2 strings, each of which is either a prefix or a suffix of length 1 to n-1. The goal is to assign each one as P or S correctly.\n\nWait, but how? Because some prefixes might overlap with suffixes, right? So I need to find a way to determine which are prefixes and which are suffixes based on their possible positions in the original string.\n\nLet me think about the structure. For each possible candidate string s, all the prefixes and suffixes must fit into it. But since I don't know s, I have to find a way to group the given strings into prefixes and suffixes such that for some s, all the prefixes are indeed the first k characters and the suffixes are the last k.\n\nBut how do I model this?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps we can build a trie of the given strings and see which ones could be prefixes and which could be suffixes. But I'm not sure if that's the right path.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find the correct order of the prefixes and suffixes. Like, for each possible k, the prefix of length k must be a prefix of all longer prefixes. Similarly, the suffix of length k must be a suffix of all longer suffixes.\n\nSo perhaps we can group the strings by their lengths. For each length l, there are two strings. One of them must be a prefix, and the other a suffix, or vice versa, but wait, no— because for each l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the input contains exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1. And each of these is either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nSo for each l, among the two strings of length l, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1:\n   - Take the two strings of length l.\n   - Determine which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce I have that, I can proceed to build the string step by step.\n\nBut how to determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix for each l?\n\nHmm, perhaps using the fact that the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the prefix of length l+1, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider the prefixes. The prefix of length l is a prefix of all longer prefixes. So for each l, the two candidates for length l must satisfy that the correct prefix for l is a prefix of the correct prefix for l+1. Similarly, the correct suffix for l must be a suffix of the correct suffix for l+1.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffixes may not follow that. Wait, the suffixes are for the original string s. So the suffix of length l is a substring of s ending at position n-l. So the suffix of l must be a suffix of the suffix of l+1. Because the suffix of l is the last l characters of s, and the suffix of l+1 is the last l+1, which includes the suffix of l.\n\nAh! So for the suffixes, the suffix for l must be equal to the last l characters of the suffix for l+1. Similarly, the prefix for l must be equal to the first l characters of the prefix for l+1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each l, the correct suffix of length l is the last l characters of the correct suffix of length l+1. Similarly for the prefix.\n\nSo, for each l, among the two possible candidates, one will be the prefix, the other the suffix. But how do I choose which is which?\n\nMaybe by checking for the next higher l.\n\nFor example, suppose for l=2, the two candidates are 'ab' and 'ba'. Which is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nWell, the prefix for l=2 must be a prefix of the prefix for l=3, and the suffix for l=2 must be a suffix of the suffix for l=3.\n\nSo perhaps I can process the strings starting from l=n-1 down to 1, and for each l, determine which of the two strings is the correct prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nWait, let's think about the highest l first. For l = n-1, the two strings are the possible prefix and suffix of s, but wait, no. Because s has length n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each given string is a prefix or suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`. The goal is to output a string where each character corresponds to 'P' for prefix or 'S' for suffix in the order of the input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Prefixes and Suffixes**: \n   - Prefixes are strings that start from the beginning of `s` and have lengths from 1 to n-1.\n   - Suffixes are strings that end at the end of `s` and also have lengths from 1 to n-1.\n   - For each length `l`, there are exactly two strings: one will be the correct prefix and the other the correct suffix.\n\n2. **Building the Solution**:\n   - We process the strings starting from the highest possible length down to 1. This allows us to determine the correct prefix and suffix for each length based on the higher lengths.\n   - For each length `l`, the correct prefix must be a prefix of the correct prefix of length `l+1`, and the correct suffix must be a suffix of the correct suffix of length `l+1`.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Read all input strings and group them by their lengths.\n   - Starting from the highest length (n-1) down to 1, determine which string is the correct prefix and which is the correct suffix.\n   - Assign 'P' or 'S' to each string in the input order based on the determined prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nprefix_suffix = {}\nfor i in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in prefix_suffix:\n        prefix_suffix[l] = []\n    prefix_suffix[l].append(s)\n\n# Create a list to store the result\nresult = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n\n# Start from the longest possible length and move downwards\nmax_len = n - 1\nfor l in range(max_len, 0, -1):\n    candidates = prefix_suffix.get(l, [])\n    # There should be exactly two candidates\n    if len(candidates) != 2:\n        continue\n    # Check both possibilities for prefix and suffix\n    for p in [candidates[0], candidates[1]]:\n        # Check if p can be a prefix\n        # Then check if the other can be a suffix\n        # Or vice versa\n        # Also, ensure that the next higher length's prefix and suffix align\n        # Assume p is the prefix for l\n        # Then the suffix for l should be the last l characters of the suffix for l+1\n        # So, for the current l, the suffix should match the suffix of l+1's suffix\n        # Let's get the next higher length's suffix\n        next_l = l + 1\n        if next_l not in prefix_suffix:\n            continue\n        next_candidates = prefix_suffix[next_l]\n        for s_candidate in next_candidates:\n            # Check if p is a prefix of the next l+1 prefix\n            if s_candidate.startswith(p):\n                # Now, check if the other candidate can be a suffix\n                # It should be the suffix of the next l+1 suffix\n                # So, the suffix of l should be the last l chars of the suffix of l+1\n                # Get the suffix for l+1\n                suffix_for_l_plus_1 = None\n                for s_p in next_candidates:\n                    if s_p.endswith(other_candidate):\n                        suffix_for_l_plus_1 = s_p\n                        break\n                if suffix_for_l_plus_1 is not None:\n                    # Assign p as prefix and other as suffix\n                    result[i*2] = 'P'\n                    result[i*2 + 1] = 'S'\n                    break\n            # Similarly, check if the other candidate is the prefix\n            if other_candidate.startswith(p):\n                # Then p is the suffix\n                pass\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach is to track for each length what the correct prefix and suffix are, then assign accordingly.\n\nLet me think about using a dictionary to keep track of the correct prefix and suffix for each length.\n\nSo, for each length l, starting from n-1 down to 1:\n   - The correct prefix for l must be the prefix of the correct prefix for l+1.\n   - The correct suffix for l must be the suffix of the correct suffix for l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, we can determine the correct prefix and suffix by checking which of the two candidates fits as the prefix (and the other as the suffix) based on the higher lengths.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Group the input strings by their lengths.\n2. For each length from n-1 down to 1:\n   a. Consider the two candidates for this length.\n   b. Check which candidate could be the prefix by seeing if it matches the known prefix of the next higher length.\n   c. The remaining candidate is the suffix.\n   d. Update the result array with 'P' and 'S' for these two candidates.\n3. Once all lengths are processed, construct the result string based on the assignments.\n\nThis approach ensures that each decision is made based on the constraints from higher lengths, ensuring consistency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nprefix_suffix = {}\n\n# Read all the input strings into a dictionary grouped by their lengths\nfor i in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in prefix_suffix:\n        prefix_suffix[l] = []\n    prefix_suffix[l].append(s)\n\nresult = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n\n# Process from the largest possible length down to 1\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    candidates = prefix_suffix[l]\n    if len(candidates) != 2:\n        continue  # This shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n    \n    # Assume each candidate could be the prefix and see if it fits\n    # The correct prefix must be a prefix of the prefix of l+1\n    # Similarly, the correct suffix must be a suffix of the suffix of l+1\n    # So, first find the correct prefix for l\n    possible_prefixes = []\n    possible_suffixes = []\n    \n    # Check candidate 0 as prefix\n    if l+1 in prefix_suffix:\n        for p in prefix_suffix[l+1]:\n            if candidates[0].startswith(p):\n                # Check if the other candidate can be the suffix\n                # The suffix for l should be a suffix of the suffix for l+1\n                for s in prefix_suffix[l+1]:\n                    if s.endswith(candidates[1]):\n                        possible_prefixes.append(candidates[0])\n                        possible_suffixes.append(candidates[1])\n                        break\n                if possible_prefixes and possible_suffixes:\n                    break\n    # If above didn't work, try candidate 1 as prefix\n    if not possible_prefixes:\n        if l+1 in prefix_suffix:\n            for p in prefix_suffix[l+1]:\n                if candidates[1].startswith(p):\n                    # Check if the other candidate can be the suffix\n                    for s in prefix_suffix[l+1]:\n                        if s.endswith(candidates[0]):\n                            possible_prefixes.append(candidates[1])\n                            possible_suffixes.append(candidates[0])\n                            break\n                    if possible_prefixes and possible_suffixes:\n                        break\n    \n    # Assign the possible prefix and suffix to the result\n    if possible_prefixes and possible_suffixes:\n        idx0 = result[l*2]\n        idx1 = result[l*2 + 1]\n        idx0 = possible_prefixes[0]\n        idx1 = possible_suffixes[0]\n        result[l*2] = 'P' if idx0 == possible_prefixes[0] else 'S'\n        result[l*2 + 1] = 'P' if idx1 == possible_suffixes[1] else 'S'\n\n# Now, process the lower lengths, but since we've built up the possible prefixes and suffixes correctly, this might not be necessary.
