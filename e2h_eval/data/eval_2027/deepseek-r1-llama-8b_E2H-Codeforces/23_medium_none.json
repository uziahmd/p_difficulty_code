In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu. \n\nFirst, let me understand what a mentsu is. From the description, a mentsu is either a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence). So, the goal is for her hand to include at least one triplet or sequence after adding some tiles.\n\nThe input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is a tile in the souzu suit with number 1. So, I'll need to parse these into a list of tiles.\n\nMy task is to find the minimal number of tiles she needs to add to her current three so that the total (after adding) contains at least one triplet or sequence.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Maybe I can generate all possible ways she can complete a triplet or a sequence by adding tiles and find the smallest number required.\n\nLet's break it down. For each possible triplet or sequence that could be formed, calculate how many tiles are missing from her current set and choose the one with the smallest required additions.\n\nWait, but considering all possibilities could be computationally heavy, but since the maximum number of possibilities is manageable, perhaps it's feasible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible triplet (all 9*3=27 possible triplets), check if she can form it by adding some tiles.\n2. Similarly, for each possible shuntsu (each suit has 7 possible sequences, like 1-2-3, up to 7-8-9), check if she can form it.\n3. For each of these possible mentsu candidates, determine how many tiles she already has in that mentsu, then compute how many more are needed.\n4. Find the minimum number of tiles across all possible candidates.\n\nBut wait, the current hand may have overlapping tiles in different mentsus. So, we need to consider all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: for each possible candidate mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), compute the minimal number of tiles needed to complete it. Then pick the minimum across all candidates.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the minimal required would be the smallest among all possible mentsus she can form.\n\nSo first, let's generate all possible mentsu candidates.\n\nFor triplets (koutsu):\nEach triplet is three identical tiles. There are 9 suits, each with a number from 1-9. So 9 * 9 = 81 possible triplets. Wait no: for each number (1-9), each suit (m, p, s). So 9 numbers * 3 suits = 27 possible triplets.\n\nFor shuntsu:\nEach shuntsu is a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, there are 7 possible shuntsu (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9). So 3 suits * 7 = 21 shuntsu.\n\nSo total candidates: 27 + 21 = 48.\n\nFor each of these 48 candidates, I need to compute how many tiles are needed to complete them based on the current hand.\n\nThen, the minimal number of tiles needed across all candidates is the answer.\n\nSo, how do I compute for a given candidate, how many tiles are missing in the current hand?\n\nFor example, suppose the candidate is the triplet '1m'. The current hand has three tiles. Let's see how many of the triplet's tiles are already present. If she has all three, then she needs 0. Otherwise, she needs enough to make three.\n\nWait, but since she can add any tiles, including duplicates, perhaps it's better to count how many tiles of that specific triplet are present. For example, for the triplet [x, x, x], the current hand may have a, b, c. For each tile in the triplet, check if it exists in the current hand. The count of such tiles is the number she already has. So, the number needed is 3 - count.\n\nWait, no. Because for a triplet, you need three copies. So, for example, if her current hand has two 1m tiles, she needs one more.\n\nSimilarly, for a shuntsu, like 1m-2m-3m: the current hand may have some of these. She needs to have all three in sequence. But how does that translate into the number of tiles she needs to add?\n\nWait, no. The shuntsu requires exactly one of each of the three tiles. So, the current hand may have some of them. Let's say she has two: 1m and 2m. Then she needs to get 3m, so one tile.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the order doesn't matter, and the mentsu is considered as a set. So, for a shuntsu, the required is having one of each of the three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nSo for a shuntsu candidate, the current hand may have some or all of the required tiles. For each of the three tiles in the shuntsu, count how many are present in the current hand. The number of tiles needed is the sum of (1 if not present else 0) for each of the three tiles. Because for each missing tile, she needs to add one.\n\nWait no. Because, for example, if the current hand has two 1m tiles, but none of the others. That's not useful for forming the shuntsu. She needs to have at least one of each of the three tiles.\n\nSo for a shuntsu, the count is how many of its three tiles are present in the current hand. The number of tiles needed is 3 minus that count. Because she needs to have all three, so for each missing one, she adds one.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each candidate, whether it's a triplet or shuntsu, compute the number of tiles in the candidate that are present in the current hand, subtract from 3, which gives the number needed.\n\nThe minimal such value across all 48 candidates is the answer.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Read the input, which is three strings. Each string represents a tile. So, for example, '1s' is a tile.\n\n2. Create a set of current tiles for quick look-up. So, each tile is a string like '1m', '9p', etc.\n\n3. Generate all possible mentsu candidates (triplets and shuntsu).\n\n4. For each candidate, determine how many of the required tiles are present in the current set.\n\n5. The number of tiles needed for that candidate is 3 minus that count.\n\n6. Keep track of the minimal number across all candidates.\n\nFinally, output the minimal number.\n\nNow, how to represent the mentsu candidates.\n\nFirst, for triplets:\n\nEach triplet is a list of three identical tiles. So, for each number (1-9) and each suit (m, p, s), create a triplet consisting of three copies of that tile.\n\nBut when checking against the current hand, it's sufficient to count how many times the tile appears. For example, if the current hand has two '1m's, then for the triplet '1m', she has two, so she needs one more.\n\nSo, for each triplet candidate, it's represented by a single tile (since all three are same), and the count is the number of that tile in the current hand.\n\nThus, for each triplet, the number of tiles needed is 3 - count.\n\nFor shuntsu:\n\nEach shuntsu consists of three distinct tiles in a sequence. For example, '1m', '2m', '3m'.\n\nSo, for each shuntsu, the candidate requires these three tiles, each exactly once. So, the number of tiles needed is the number of these three tiles that are missing from the current hand.\n\nWait, no. Because she can have multiple copies. For example, she may have two '1m's. But the shuntsu only requires at least one of each. So, for the shuntsu, the number of tiles needed is the count of how many of the three tiles are missing.\n\nSo, for each shuntsu, for each of the three tiles in it, check if it exists in the current hand. For each tile that's not present, add 1 to the required count.\n\nWait, no. Because even if she has two copies of a tile, it's counted as present. So, the presence is binary: does she have at least one copy of the tile in the shuntsu?\n\nSo for each tile in the shuntsu, check if it exists in the current hand (regardless of how many copies). So, the count is the number of tiles in the shuntsu that are not present in the current hand.\n\nWait no, because for the shuntsu, she needs to have all three tiles, but can have more than one of each. So, for the shuntsu, the number of tiles she needs to add is the number of tiles in the shuntsu that are missing from her current hand.\n\nBecause she can add any number of tiles, but the minimal is to add exactly the missing ones.\n\nSo, for a shuntsu, the required is 3 minus the number of tiles in the shuntsu present in the current hand.\n\nSo, for each candidate, whether triplet or shuntsu, the required is 3 - the count of tiles in the candidate that are present in the current hand.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each triplet candidate (like 1m, 1m, 1m), count how many 1m's are in the current hand. The required is 3 minus that count.\n\n- For each shuntsu candidate (like 1m, 2m, 3m), count how many of the three tiles are present in the current hand. Required is 3 minus that count.\n\nSo, the minimal required across all 48 candidates is the answer.\n\nSo, how do I implement this?\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. So, for example, the first sample input is ['1s', '2s', '3s'], which forms a shuntsu.\n\nI'll process each of the three tiles into a set for quick look-up.\n\ncurrent_tiles = {'1s', '2s', '3s'}\n\nThen, for each triplet:\n\nfor num in 1..9:\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        count = current_tiles.count(tile)\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < current_min:\n            current_min = required\n\nWait, but wait. Since the current_tiles is a set, count is O(1) for each tile. So, for 27 triplets, it's manageable.\n\nSimilarly, for each shuntsu:\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start_num in 1..7:\n        t1 = f\"{start_num}{suit}\"\n        t2 = f\"{start_num+1}{suit}\"\n        t3 = f\"{start_num+2}{suit}\"\n        count = 0\n        if t1 in current_tiles:\n            count +=1\n        if t2 in current_tiles:\n            count +=1\n        if t3 in current_tiles:\n            count +=1\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < current_min:\n            current_min = required\n\nSo, for each shuntsu, we check each of the three tiles in the sequence. For each, if it's present in current_tiles, count it. Then required is 3 - count.\n\nOnce all candidates are processed, the minimal required is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. For the triplet, the required is 3 - count, but count can be zero, leading to required 3. For the shuntsu, same thing.\n\nSo, the code will involve generating all 27 triplets and 21 shuntsu, computing the required for each, and finding the minimal required.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Read the three input tiles as a list, then convert to a set for O(1) lookups.\n\n2. Initialize min_required to a large number, like 4 (since adding 3 tiles is the maximum needed for a triplet or shuntsu).\n\n3. Generate all possible triplet candidates:\n\n   for num in range(1,10):\n       for suit in ['m','p','s']:\n           tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n           count_in_current = tile in current_tiles\n           count = 1 if count_in_current else 0\n           required = 3 - count\n           if required < min_required:\n               min_required = required\n\nWait, no. Wait, the current_tiles is a set. So, for a triplet tile, like '1m', the count is 1 if '1m' is in current_tiles, else 0. So, required is 3 - count.\n\nSo, for each triplet, the required is 3 - (1 if tile is present else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for each shuntsu, count is the number of its three tiles present, and required is 3 - count.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead the three tiles into a set.\n\nInitialize min_tiles to 4 (since the maximum needed is 3, but perhaps higher? No, the maximum is 3.)\n\nGenerate all 27 triplet candidates:\n\nfor num in 1..9:\n    for suit in ['m','p','s']:\n        tile = str(num)+suit\n        if tile in current_tiles:\n            req = 3 - 1\n        else:\n            req = 3\n        if req < min_tiles:\n            min_tiles = req\n\nThen, generate all 21 shuntsu candidates:\n\nfor suit in ['m','p','s']:\n    for start in 1..7:\n        t1 = str(start)+suit\n        t2 = str(start+1)+suit\n        t3 = str(start+2)+suit\n        count = 0\n        if t1 in current_tiles:\n            count +=1\n        if t2 in current_tiles:\n            count +=1\n        if t3 in current_tiles:\n            count +=1\n        req = 3 - count\n        if req < min_tiles:\n            min_tiles = req\n\nAfter processing all, print min_tiles.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, she already has a shuntsu. So, for that case, the required is 0.\n\nIn the second sample input, she has three 9m, which is a triplet. So required is 0.\n\nIn the third sample input, she has 3p,9m,2p. So, to form a shuntsu, she needs either 1p or 4p. Adding either of those gives a shuntsu (like 2p,3p,4p or 2p,3p,1p). Wait, wait, no. Let's see: the current tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nIf she adds 1p, the new tiles are 1p, 2p, 3p, which is a shuntsu. So required is 1.\n\nAlternatively, adding 4p would give 2p,3p,4p, which is also a shuntsu. So, required is 1.\n\nSo, in code, for the shuntsu 2p,3p,4p, the count is 2 (since 2p and 3p are present). So required is 1.\n\nYes, so the code would correctly find that.\n\nAnother test case: suppose she has ['1m','1m','2m']. For triplet 1m, she has two, so required is 1. For shuntsu 1m,2m,3m: she has two, so required is 1. So the minimal is 1.\n\nAnother case: she has ['1m','2m','3m']—so a shuntsu already. So required is 0.\n\nWhat about a case where she has ['1m','2m','4m']? For shuntsu 1m,2m,3m: she has two, so required 1. For shuntsu 2m,3m,4m: she has two, so required 1. So the minimal is 1.\n\nWhat if she has ['1m','1m','2m']? For triplet 1m: she has two, required 1. For shuntsu 1m,2m,3m: she has two, required 1. So minimal is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: she has no tiles that could form any mentsu, but needs to add all three. For example, she has ['1m','2p','3s'].\n\nIn this case, for all triplet candidates: she has none, so required is 3 for each. For shuntsu candidates: none of the sequences are formed, so required is 3 for each. So the minimal is 3.\n\nWait, but wait. Suppose she has ['1m','1m','2m']: she can form a triplet (1m) by adding one more. Or a shuntsu (1m,2m,3m) by adding 3m, which is one. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the input as three lines. Wait, no. The input is a single line containing three strings separated by spaces. So, for example, the first sample input is '1s 2s 3s' as a single string, split into three elements.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntiles = input().split()\ncurrent = set(tiles)\n\nmin_required = 4  # since 3 is the maximum needed, but initially set higher.\n\n# Check all triplets\nfor num in range(1, 10):\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        if tile in current:\n            req = 3 - 1\n        else:\n            req = 3\n        if req < min_required:\n            min_required = req\n\n# Check all shuntsu\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start in range(1, 8):  # 1 to 7 inclusive\n        t1 = f\"{start}{suit}\"\n        t2 = f\"{start+1}{suit}\"\n        t3 = f\"{start+2}{suit}\"\n        count = 0\n        if t1 in current:\n            count += 1\n        if t2 in current:\n            count += 1\n        if t3 in current:\n            count += 1\n        req = 3 - count\n        if req < min_required:\n            min_required = req\n\nprint(min_required)\n\nWait, but wait. For the triplet loop, in the code above, for each triplet, it's represented as a single tile. Because a triplet requires three identical tiles. So, for each triplet, the count is 1 if the tile is present, else 0. So required is 3 - count.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is read as three separate strings, each being a tile. So for the first sample, the input is three tiles: '1s', '2s', '3s' — which form a shuntsu, so the required is 0.\n\nIn code, for the shuntsu 1s,2s,3s: count is 3, req is 0.\n\nSo the code returns 0.\n\nSecond sample input is '9m 9m 9m' — a triplet. So required is 0.\n\nThird sample input is '3p 9m 2p': current tiles are 3p,9m,2p.\n\nLooking for shuntsu:\n\nIn the 'p' suit:\n\nstart=1: 1p,2p,3p. Current has 2p and 3p. So count is 2, req=1.\n\nstart=2: 2p,3p,4p. Current has 2p and 3p. Count is 2, req=1.\n\nstart=3: 3p,4p,5p. Only 3p is present. Count=1, req=2.\n\nSimilarly for other starts.\n\nSo, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: input is '1m 2m 4m'.\n\nFor shuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count is 2, req 1.\n\nShuntsu 2m,3m,4m: count is 2, req 1.\n\nTriplet 1m: count 1, req 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nAnother test case: input is '1m 2p 3s' — no shuntsu, no triplet.\n\nSo for all triplet candidates, required is 3.\n\nFor shuntsu candidates, all require 3.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nAnother test case: input is '1m 1m 2m'.\n\nTriplet 1m: count is 2, req=1.\n\nShuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count is 2, req=1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Are the triplet and shuntsu candidates correctly generated?\n\nYes.\n\n- Are the counts computed correctly?\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Mentsu**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). A triplet consists of three identical tiles, while a sequence consists of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n2. **Generate Candidates**: We generate all possible triplets and sequences (shuntsu) that Tokitsukaze could form. There are 27 possible triplets (9 numbers for each of 3 suits) and 21 possible sequences (7 sequences for each of 3 suits).\n3. **Check Current Tiles**: For each generated candidate, we check how many of the required tiles are already present in Tokitsukaze's hand.
