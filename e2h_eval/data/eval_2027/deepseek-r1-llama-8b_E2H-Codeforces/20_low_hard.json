For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about binary strings and choosing certain values for each string such that a multiset of these strings is 'beautiful'. Then, we need to count the number of ways to choose these c_s values so that the maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. So, given n, k, and f, we need to compute the number of valid assignments of c_s for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n, such that when you construct the largest possible beautiful multiset, its size is exactly f.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what makes a multiset beautiful. From the description, for every binary string s (of any length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. \n\nWait, so for each string s, the count of s's in the multiset is part of the constraints. But more importantly, any string t that is a proper prefix of s will also contribute to s's count. For example, if s is \"01\", then any string in the multiset that starts with \"01\" like \"010\" or \"011\" will add to the count for \"01\".\n\nSo the key here is that the counts for all prefixes of a string s must be considered when determining the maximum possible size of the multiset.\n\nI think the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming, considering the binary prefixes and their allowed counts.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Each binary string s has a set of prefixes, which are all the shorter binary strings that start with s. For example, \"110\" has prefixes \"1\", \"11\", and \"110\". The c_s value must be at least the number of times any of its prefixes appear in the multiset.\n\nWait, no. Because for s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum over all t that are prefixes of s (including s itself) of the count of t in the multiset. Wait, no, that's not right. Because for each string in the multiset, all of its prefixes contribute to the counts of those smaller strings.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the multiset includes \"00\", then both \"0\" and \"00\" are affected. For \"0\", any string in the multiset that starts with \"0\" (like \"00\") contributes to the count of \"0\". Similarly, for \"00\", only the string \"00\" contributes to its count.\n\nSo, for each string s, the count of s in the multiset plus the counts of its longer strings (if any) that have s as a prefix will determine the total number of strings that have s as a prefix. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because if a string t is a superstring of s, then s is a prefix of t, so t contributes to the count of s. So the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the sum over all t where s is a prefix of t of the count of t in the multiset.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model this with inclusion-exclusion or some kind of hierarchical constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size of the beautiful multiset can be determined by considering the constraints on each string s. Specifically, for each s, the count of s in the multiset must be <= c_s, and for every prefix p of s, the count of p in the multiset must be <= c_p.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because if s is a prefix of t, then t contributes to the count of s. So for s to be included in the multiset, not only does its own count matter but all of its longer variants as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about it again. For each string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of t's such that s is a prefix of t, multiplied by the count of t in the multiset. Or wait, no. It's the sum of counts of all t's that are extensions of s.\n\nFor example, if the multiset contains \"0\" once, \"00\" once, \"000\" once. Then for s = \"0\", the count is 3 (because \"0\", \"00\", \"000\" all have \"0\" as a prefix). For s = \"00\", the count is 2 (from \"00\" and \"000\"), and for s = \"000\", the count is 1.\n\nSo the count for s is the sum of the counts of all t where s is a prefix of t. So for each s, the sum of the counts of all t",
