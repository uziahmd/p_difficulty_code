Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any will do.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, given a regular polygon with n sides, we need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on the sides adjacent to v2. The angle at v2 should be as close to 'a' degrees as possible. And among all possible angles, we need the one that's closest, and if there's a tie, any solution is acceptable.\n\nWait, but how is this angle formed? Oh right, in a regular polygon, each internal angle can be calculated. For a regular n-gon, the internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the internal angle of the polygon itself. However, when considering angles formed by three points, it's a bit different.\n\nWait no, actually, in this problem, the angle is formed by two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So, the angle is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angles between consecutive vertices are equal. Each central angle is 360/n degrees. So, for example, in a square (n=4), each central angle is 90 degrees.\n\nSo, when selecting v1 and v3, their positions relative to v2 determine the measure of the angle at v2.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Suppose the polygon is arranged in a circle. Then, the points are equally spaced around the circle. So, for any vertex v2, the points v1 and v3 must be some steps away from v2 along the circumference, either clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nWait, but for the angle at v2, the size of the angle depends on the arc between v1 and v3 as seen from v2. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. So, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but only if the arc is not passing through the center. Wait, no— the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, if the points are on the circumference, then yes.\n\nWait, so if v2 is fixed, and v1 is k steps away in one direction, and v3 is m steps away in the other direction, then the angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc that's opposite. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle can be determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon. For example, in a triangle, each side is one step apart. So, choosing any three consecutive vertices will form an angle of 60 degrees, which is the internal angle of the triangle.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, n=3, a=15. The output is 1 2 3, meaning the angle is 60 degrees, which is the maximum possible angle in a triangle. So that makes sense because 60 is as close as possible to 15.\n\nBut in the second sample, n=4 and a=67. The possible angles are 45 and 90 degrees. 67 is closer to 45 (difference 22) than to 90 (23), so they choose 45.\n\nSo, the approach seems to be: for each possible v2, find the best pair of v1 and v3 such that the angle is as close as possible to 'a', and then pick the overall best.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each vertex v2 (from 1 to n), consider all possible pairs of vertices (v1, v3) where v1 and v3 are on the sides adjacent to v2. Wait, no. Actually, v1 and v3 are any two vertices, but their positions relative to v2 determine the angle. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, for a given v2, the angle is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 as viewed from v2. Because in a regular polygon, the angle at v2 will depend on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nWait, for example, in a square (n=4), each edge is 90 degrees. So, for v2=1, possible angles come from choosing v1 and v3 such that the arcs between v1 and v3 determine the angle.\n\nWait, in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently checking all possible configurations to find the optimal angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: In a regular polygon, each vertex is equidistant from its adjacent vertices. The central angle between two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n2. **Angle Formation**: For any vertex v2, the angle formed by two other vertices v1 and v3 can be determined by the number of steps between them relative to v2. The angle at v2 will be half the measure of the arc opposite to it.\n3. **Iterate Over Each Vertex as v2**: For each vertex v2, consider all possible pairs of vertices (v1, v3) such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to 'a'.\n4. **Calculate the Angle**: For each pair (v1, v3), calculate the angle at v2 using the inscribed angle theorem, which states that the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n5. **Track the Minimum Difference**: Keep track of the minimum difference between the calculated angle and 'a' across all configurations. If multiple configurations yield the same minimum difference, any can be chosen.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef compute_angle(n, k):\n    # Returns the angle at a certain vertex for step k\n    # k is the number of steps from v2 to v1 on one side\n    # and similarly, the other side has m steps, but for maximum coverage, we can loop through all possible\n    # but perhaps instead, for each v2, check all possible k from 1 to (n-1)//2, then compute the angle.\n    # The angle would be min(180 - (k * (360 / n)), 180 - ((n - k - 1) * (360 / n))) ?\n    # Wait, no.

So, if v1 is k steps clockwise and v3 is m steps counter-clockwise, the angle is (min(k + m, n - (k + m)) ) * (180 / n) / 2.\n    # Alternatively, the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 when viewed from v2.\n    # So, the arc length between v1 and v3 is s = min(k + m, n - (k + m)) where k and m are steps from v2 to each point.\n    # Wait, perhaps for a given v2, and two points, the angle is determined by the minimal arc between them as seen from v2.\n    # So, for each possible k (number of steps from v2 to v1), and for each possible m (steps from v2 to v3), the angle is (min((k + m) * (360 / n), (n - (k + m)) * (360 / n)) ) / 2.\n    # But since we are looking for the closest to 'a', perhaps it's sufficient to check all possible k and m, but that might be time-consuming for large n.\n    # Instead, perhaps for each v2, the best angle is achieved when the arc between v1 and v3 is as close as possible to 2a or 360 - 2a, depending on the direction.\n    # But maybe it's easier to precompute all possible angles for each v2 and find the closest one to 'a'.\n    \n    # Let's try a different approach.

For each v2, it checks all possible pairs of vertices (v1, v3) by considering steps k from 1 to (n-1)//2. The angle at v2 is calculated using the inscribed angle theorem, which gives half the measure of the intercepted arc. The solution keeps track of the configuration that yields the angle closest to 'a' and prints the corresponding vertices.
