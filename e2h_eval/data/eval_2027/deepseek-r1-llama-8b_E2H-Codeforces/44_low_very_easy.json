He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp who wants to solve his list of problems over k days. Each day he has to solve a contiguous sequence of problems from the list, and he can't skip any. So the way he splits them is into k consecutive segments that cover all n problems.\n\nEach day's profit is the maximum difficulty in that segment. The total profit is the sum of these maxima for each day. We need to find the way to split the list into exactly k such segments to maximize this total profit.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. For n=8, k=3, the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. They split it into [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. The maxes are 5,6,9, summing to 20.\n\nSo the goal is to make sure that each segment contributes as much as possible. Maybe the optimal strategy is to include as many high elements as possible in each segment without splitting them too early.\n\nWait, but how to model this? It seems like a dynamic programming problem because for each position, we can track the best way to split up to that point with a certain number of days used.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let's consider a DP approach where dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit for the first i problems using j days. Then, for each state, we can look back to some m < i, and compute dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for each possible m, we'd have to compute the max from m+1 to i. If n is up to 2000, then the time complexity could be O(n^2 * k), which for k up to 2000 would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat won't work. So I need a more efficient way to calculate the maximums quickly.\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute for all possible intervals [m+1, i] their maximum. But even that would take O(n^2) space, which for n=2000 is 4 million—manageable. Wait, but n is 2000, so 2000*2000 is 4 million, which is acceptable. So perhaps precomputing a 2D array max_val where max_val[i][j] is the maximum in a[i...j].\n\nHow to compute max_val efficiently. Well, we can compute it using a sliding window approach for each starting point. For each i from 0 to n-1, keep track of the current maximum as j increases. So for each i, we process j from i to n-1, keeping the current max, and storing it in max_val[i][j].\n\nThis will take O(n^2) time, which for n=2000 is 4 million operations—manageable.\n\nOnce we have max_val, the DP approach becomes feasible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute max_val for all intervals [i][j].\n2. Initialize a DP table where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit for the first i elements using j days.\n3. For each i, j, we can try all possible previous positions m, compute the profit from m+1 to i (which is max_val[m+1][i]), and add it to dp[m][j-1].\n4. The base case is when j=1: dp[i][1] is the maximum from 0 to i.\n\nWait, but what about the initial conditions? Also, since the segments must cover all n problems, the last day must end at n.\n\nLet me structure the DP.\n\nThe state is dp[i][j], which is the maximum total profit for the first i elements using j days.\n\nFor each i, j:\n\nIf j == 1: dp[i][j] = max_val[0][i-1] (since the entire first i elements are solved in one day).\n\nFor j > 1: For each possible m from 0 to i-1, we can split after m, so the last day is from m+1 to i. So dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + max_val[m+1][i-1]).\n\nWait, wait. The indices might be tricky. Let's clarify.\n\nAssuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's say the array is 0-based for the code.\n\nWait, no, in the code, the array is given as a list in Python, so probably 0-based.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is a_1, a_2,...a_n. So in code,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over exactly `k` days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous segment of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that segment. The goal is to distribute the problems into `k` segments such that the sum of these maxima is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Maximum Values**: First, we precompute a 2D array `max_val` where `max_val[i][j]` represents the maximum value in the subarray from index `i` to `j`. This helps us quickly determine the profit for any segment.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems using `j` days. The recurrence relation involves considering all possible previous positions `m` and computing the profit for the segment from `m+1` to `i`.\n3. **Initialization and Transition**: Initialize the base case where using one day to solve all problems up to `i` gives the maximum value of the subarray from 0 to `i-1`. For each state, transition by considering all possible previous splits and updating the DP table accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Precompute max_val[i][j] as the maximum from a[i] to a[j]\n    max_val = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_max = a[i]\n        max_val[i][i] = current_max\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if a[j] > current_max:\n                current_max = a[j]\n            max_val[i][j] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[0] * (k+1) for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(1, min(k, i+1)+1):\n            if j == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = max_val[0][i]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = 0\n                for m in range(i):\n                    if j-1 <= m + 1:\n                        current = dp[m][j-1] + max_val[m+1][i]\n                        if current > dp[i][j]:\n                            dp[i][j] = current\n    \n    # Now, reconstruct the t array\n    t = [0] * k\n    current_end = n - 1\n    for j in range(k-1, -1, -1):\n        for m in range(current_end, -1, -1):\n            if dp[m][j+1] != 0:\n                t[j] = m - t[j-1] if j > 0 else m + 1\n                current_end = m\n                break\n    \n    # Convert t to 1-based indices for output\n    t = [t[i]+1 for i in range(k)]\n    \n    print(sum(max_val[t[i]-1][t[i]] for i in range(k)))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, t)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: The `max_val` array is computed to store the maximum value for every possible subarray. This allows us to quickly determine the profit for any segment during the DP transitions.\n2. **DP Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with the base case where all problems are solved in a single day.\n3. **DP Transitions**: For each state `(i, j)`, we consider all possible previous positions `m` and update the DP table by adding the profit of the segment from `m+1` to `i`.\n4. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack to find the optimal way to split the problems into `k` segments to maximize the total profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible total profit while adhering to the constraints of the problem.",
