Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for exactly one hour and then goes out. But the smart part is that he can collect the burned candles and turn them into new ones. Specifically, every 'b' burned candles can be made into a new candle. The goal is to find out how many hours in total he can keep the candles burning by acting optimally.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. So initially, he has 'a' candles. Each of those burns for an hour, adding to the total time. Then, after they burn out, he collects the remains. For each group of 'b' burned candles, he gets one new candle, which then also burns for an hour. But when that new candle burns, it again becomes a burned candle, which he can use again if possible.\n\nWait, right. So the process is: burn all current candles, collect the remains, exchange them for new candles as much as possible, repeat until he can't make any more.\n\nSo the approach is to simulate this process step by step. Let me think about the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial 'a' candles.\n2. Burn them all, adding 'a' hours to the total.\n3. Collect 'a' burned candles.\n4. Exchange them for as many new candles as possible: new_candles = a // b.\n5. Add the number of new candles to the total hours (since each new candle burns for 1 hour).\n6. Now, the new_candles are added to the remaining burned candles. So the total burned is new_candles + (a % b), but wait, no— because when you make new_candles, each contributes to one more burned candle. So after exchanging, the new_candles will each burn for an hour, adding their count to the total burned.\n\nWait, maybe a better way to model this is:\n\n- total_hours = a\n- current_burned = a\n- while current_burned >= b:\n    new_candles = current_burned // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    current_burned = (current_burned % b) + new_candles  # Because the new candles will add to the remains and then get burned\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the loop continues until current_burned < b. Each iteration, we calculate how many new candles can be made from the current_burned, add that to the total, and then update current_burned to the remainder plus the new candles (which will themselves become burned).\n\nLet's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total_hours =4.\n\ncurrent_burned =4.\n\nSince 4 >=2, new_candles=4//2=2. Add 2 to total: 6.\n\ncurrent_burned =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, 2>=2: new_candles=1. Add 1 → total 7.\n\ncurrent_burned =0 +1=1, which is less than 2. Loop ends.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example given is 6 3.\n\nInitial total=6.\n\ncurrent_burned=6.\n\n6 >=3: new=2. Total becomes 8.\n\ncurrent_burned =6%3=0 +2=2, which is less than 3. So done. Output is 8.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5.\n\nBurn 5 → 5 hours. current_burned=5.\n\nMake 1 new candle. Add 1 → total 6.\n\ncurrent_burned becomes 0 +1=1 <5. Done.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nBurn 10 → 10.\n\ncurrent_burned=10.\n\nnew_candles=3 (10//3=3, since 3*3=9). Add 3 → total 13.\n\ncurrent_burned =10%3=1 +3=4 <3? No, 4 >=3.\n\nWait, 4 >=3: new_candles=1. Add 1 → total 14.\n\ncurrent_burned =4%3=1 +1=2 <3. Done.\n\nTotal is 14.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nStep 1: 10 burned → total 10. current_burned=10.\n\nMake 3 new, add 3 → total 13. Now current_burned =1+3=4.\n\nStep 2: 4 >=3 → new 1, add 1 → total 14. current_burned=1 +1=2.\n\nNo more. So yes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can create new candles from the remains of burned ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` candles, each burning for exactly one hour.\n2. **Burn Initial Candles**: The initial `a` candles will burn, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Recycle Burned Candles**: After burning, collect the remains and convert them into new candles. Specifically, every `b` burned candles can be turned into one new candle.\n4. **Repeat Process**: Continue burning the newly created candles and recycling their remains until it is no longer possible to create new candles.\n\nThe process involves:\n- Keeping track of the total hours.\n- Calculating how many new candles can be made from the burned remains.\n- Updating the count of burned candles to include both the remainder and the newly created ones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent_burned = a\n\nwhile current_burned >= b:\n    new = current_burned // b\n    total += new\n    current_burned = (current_burned % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input values `a` and `b`.\n2. **Total Hours Calculation**: Start with the initial number of candles `a`, which directly contributes to the total hours.\n3. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Use a loop to repeatedly create new candles from the burned remains. In each iteration:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made.\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the count of burned candles to include both the remainder and the newly created ones.\n4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when the number of burned candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be created.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iteratively converting burned candles into new ones until no more conversions are possible.",
