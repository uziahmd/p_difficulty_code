A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends wanting to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources, and I need to calculate the maximum number each friend can make based on the available resources.\n\nLet me break down the input and what each variable represents.\n\nWe have n friends. They bought k bottles of drink. Each bottle has l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nAnd then there's p grams of salt.\n\nEach toast per friend needs nl milliliters, a slice, and np grams.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice, and np grams of salt. But for each toast, right? Because each toast requires that per friend.\n\nSo for each toast, all friends must have their required amount.\n\nSo the total drink needed for t toasts is n * t * nl. Because each of the n friends drinks nl ml per toast.\n\nSimilarly, the total lime slices needed are n * t, because each friend uses one per toast.\n\nSalt: each friend uses np grams per toast, so total salt needed is n * t * np.\n\nNow, we have to find the maximum t such that all these constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l\n   The maximum possible toasts based on drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, since each toast requires n * nl (because each of n friends takes nl), the max t from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\n2. Calculate total_lime_slices = c * d\n   Max toasts from lime is (c*d) // n, because each toast requires n slices (one per friend).\n\n3. Total_salt is p\n   Max toasts from salt is p // (n * np), because each toast uses n * np grams.\n\nThen, the actual maximum t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut wait, what if any of the denominators are zero? No, because all inputs are positive integers. So division is safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the three possible maximums.\n- Take the minimum of them.\n- That's the answer.\n\nSo let's think about the example given.\n\nFirst sample input:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute:\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n=3, nl=3. So 20/(3*3)=20/9=2.222..., so 2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 10*8=80. 80 /3=26.666, so 26.\n\nsalt: p=100. n=3, np=1. 100/(3*1)=33.333, so 33.\n\nThe min is 2, which is the correct output.\n\nAnother example in the input: second case is 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nTotal drink: 100*10=1000. n=5, nl=4. 1000/(5*4)=50.\n\nLime: 1*19=19 slices. 19/(5) =3.8 →3.\n\nSalt: 90/(5*3)=6. So min(50,3,6) is 3, which matches the output.\n\nThird test case: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nDrink: 1000*1000=1e6. 10 friends, each needs 50ml per toast. So 1e6/(10*50)=20,000?\n\nWait 1e6 divided by (10*50) is 1e6 /500=2000. So 2000.\n\nLime: 25 *23=575 slices. 575/(10) =57.5 →57.\n\nSalt: 1/(10*1)=0.1 →0.\n\nSo min(2000,57,0) is 0. So output is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input as a single line, split into integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_slices = c * d\n\ntoasts_lime = lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, salt_toasts)\n\nThen print max_toasts.\n\nWait, but wait: what if any denominator is zero",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each friend needs a certain amount of drink, a lime slice, and salt for each toast.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of each resource available.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts from Each Resource**:\n   - From drink: The total drink available divided by the amount needed per toast per friend.\n   - From lime slices: The total lime slices available divided by the number of friends (each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - From salt: The total salt available divided by the amount needed per toast per friend.\n4. **Find the Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest value derived from the above calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoasts_lime = total_lime // n\n\ntoasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle to get the total drink available.\n- **Toast Calculation from Drink**: Divide the total drink by the product of the number of friends and the drink required per toast.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime to get the total lime slices available.\n- **Toast Calculation from Lime**: Divide the total lime slices by the number of friends.\n- **Salt Calculation**: Use the total salt available and divide by the product of the number of friends and the salt required per toast.\n- **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value from the three toast calculations gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, considering all constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of toasts each friend can enjoy without running out of any required resource.",
