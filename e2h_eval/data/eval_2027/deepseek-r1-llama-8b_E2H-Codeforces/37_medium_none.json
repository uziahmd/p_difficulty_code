    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a permutation of an array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set and empty set), the sum of the elements in the original array a and the sum in the permuted array b are different. Hmm, that sounds tricky.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that for every non-empty subset S (where 0 < k < n), the sum of the elements in a at those positions should be different from the sum in b. So for any subset size between 1 and n-1, the sum must differ between a and b.\n\nSo how can I approach this? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's understand what subsets we're considering. For example, if n is 3, subsets of size 1 and 2. For each of these, the sum in a must not equal the sum in b.\n\nHmm, the key here is that for all possible subsets S (excluding the full and empty), the sum in a and the sum in b must differ.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to arrange the elements in b such that when you take any non-empty subset (but not all or none), the sum in a is different from the sum in b.\n\nBut wait, how do we ensure that for all possible subsets, the sums are different? Because the number of subsets is 2^n - 2, which is manageable for small n (like up to 22), but for n=22, that's 2^22 - 2 which is way too big to handle directly.\n\nSo, for n=22, brute-forcing all permutations is impossible because 22! is way too big. We need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties required for b.\n\nWhat if the sum of all elements in a is s. Then, for any subset S where |S|=k, the sum in a is s_S = sum(a_i for i in S). Similarly, in b, the sum would be s'_S = sum(b_i for i in S).\n\nWe need s_S != s'_S for all 0 < k < n.\n\nWait, but s is the same for all subsets in a because it's the sum of all elements. So s' for b must satisfy that for any subset S (size k), s'_S != s_S.\n\nBut how does s relate to the sum of any subset? Well, s is the total sum of a. For a particular subset S, s_S is part of s. But in b, the arrangement could change which elements are in which subsets.\n\nWait, maybe the arrangement needs to make sure that for any proper subset, the sum in a is different from the sum in b.\n\nHmm. What's the minimal condition that b must satisfy?\n\nAn alternative approach: Perhaps the permutation b should be such that all the prefixes of b have distinct sums compared to a. Wait, that might not cover all subsets, but maybe it's a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element in b is different from the first element in a. Because then, any subset that includes the first element will have a different sum in b than in a.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose in a, the first element is a_1, and in b it's some other element x. Then any subset that includes the first position in a will have a sum that differs by x - a_1.\n\nBut subsets that don't include the first position in a may still have the same sum as in a. Hmm, so that's not sufficient.\n\nWait, maybe more conditions are needed. Like, the second element also needs to differ in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way this can be achieved is if all the elements in b are arranged in such a way that their cumulative sums are unique in a certain way.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the permutation b should have the property that the sum of any two different subsets S and T (both of size k) in a and b result in different sums. Or perhaps, for all possible subsets, the sum in b is different from the sum in a.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a permutation where the prefix sums of b are all unique. Because then, any subset's sum in b would be the difference between two prefix sums, and if all prefix sums are unique, then any subset sum is unique. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient.\n\nWait, the prefix sum approach might help. Let's think about the prefix sums of a and b.\n\nSuppose we compute the prefix sums of a and b. For b to satisfy the condition, for any subset S, the sum in a and the sum in b must be different. So for the prefix sums, if all the prefix sums of b are different from those of a, perhaps that would help.\n\nWait, but that's just for the prefixes. What about other subsets?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the multiset of all possible subset sums in a and b are completely disjoint except for the empty set and the full set. Because for any non-empty proper subset, the sum in a must differ from the sum in b.\n\nBut that seems very restrictive. How can we achieve that?\n\nWait, for n=22, it's impossible to generate all possible subset sums and compare them. So perhaps the approach is to find a permutation where the subset sums in b do not collide with those in a for any non-empty proper subset.\n\nWait, but how can we construct such a permutation?\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to find a permutation where the prefix sums are all unique, and for each position i, the element at i is the smallest possible that doesn't cause any conflicts.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given:\n\nSample Input:\n4\n1000 100 10 1\n\nSample Output:\n100 1 1000 10\n\nWait, the output is [100, 1, 1000, 10].\n\nSo the a array is [1000, 100, 10, 1], and b is [100,1,1000,10].\n\nLet's see why this works.\n\nFor any subset S in a and b, the sums must differ.\n\nFor example, for subsets of size 1: Each element in a is present, but in b, the elements are rearranged. So each single element sum in a is different from b's.\n\nFor subsets of size 2: For example, in a, the sum of 1000+100 is 1100. In b, the sum of 100+1 is 101. That's different.\n\nSimilarly, other subsets would have different sums.\n\nBut how was this permutation chosen? It looks like the permutation starts with the middle element, then the smallest, then the largest, then the next smallest.\n\nWait, perhaps the strategy is to arrange the elements in such a way that the prefix sums are all unique and do not match those of a.\n\nWait, but for the sample input, the a array is [1000, 100, 10, 1]. Its prefix sums are:\n\nAfter 1st element: 1000\n\nAfter 2nd: 1100\n\nAfter 3rd: 1110\n\nAfter 4th: 1111.\n\nIn the output b, the prefix sums are:\n\n100 → 100\n\n101 → 101\n\n1101 → 1101\n\n1111 → 1111.\n\nSo for the first element, 100 is different from 1000.\n\nSecond element: 1 added makes 101, which is different from 1100.\n\nThird: 1000 added makes 1101, which is different from 1110.\n\nFourth: 10 added makes 1111, same as a's total sum.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the last element is 10. So the sum is 1111.\n\nBut in a, the sum of all elements is 1111. So the sum of the entire subset in b is the same as in a.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the subset containing all indices is not considered. So that's okay.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to arrange the permutation such that for all k from 1 to n-1, the sum of the first k elements in b is different from the sum of any subset of size k in a.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the sum of the first k elements is a specific subset, but there are other subsets of size k that might have the same sum in a and b.\n\nSo perhaps ensuring that the prefix sums of b are unique and do not match any prefix sums of a is a way to go.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a permutation where the prefix sums are all distinct and do not coincide with the prefix sums of a.\n\nBecause then, for any subset, the sum in b would be the difference of two prefix sums, and since all prefix sums are unique, each subset sum would be unique.\n\nWait, but how does that help with comparing to a's subset sums?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently.\n\nWe need for every non-empty subset S (excluding the full set), sum_a(S) ≠ sum_b(S).\n\nSo, the sum of a's subset S must not equal the sum of b's subset S.\n\nIf we can arrange that for all subsets S, sum_a(S) ≠ sum_b(S), then the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut how can we arrange that?\n\nOne approach is to ensure that the elements in b are arranged such that for any S, the sum in b is different from a's sum for that S.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: Since all elements are distinct, perhaps arranging them in such a way that the prefix sums are all unique, and each step adds a new value that ensures that the sum increases in a way that avoids collisions with a's prefix sums.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a permutation where the prefix sums of b are all distinct and none of them are present in a's prefix sums except possibly the total sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's consider that for any subset S, the sum in a is sum_a(S) and in b is sum_b(S). We need sum_a(S) ≠ sum_b(S).\n\nBut sum_a(S) is fixed for each S. So for each S, sum_b(S) must be different from sum_a(S).\n\nHow can we arrange this for all S?\n\nWait, one way is to make sure that for every possible subset S, the sum in b is different from the sum in a.\n\nBut that's a lot to handle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to arrange the permutation so that the prefix sums are all distinct and that none of the prefix sums of b are equal to any of a's prefix sums except possibly the full sum.\n\nWait, because if the prefix sums of b are all unique and not present in a's prefix sums (except maybe the full sum), then for any subset S, sum_b(S) would be the difference between two prefix sums of b, which are unique, and thus any sum_b(S) would be unique.\n\nBut how does that help in ensuring that sum_b(S) is different from sum_a(S)?\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: We need the set of all subset sums (for all non-empty proper subsets) of a to be disjoint from the set of all subset sums of b.\n\nSo the two sets are completely disjoint.\n\nThat's a lot to manage.\n\nBut for small n, perhaps we can find such a permutation.\n\nWait, but for n=22, that's 2^22 - 2 subsets, which is about 4 million. Comparing all possible subsets is not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a way to construct the permutation without checking all possible subsets.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. For each subset S, sum_b(S) is the sum of the elements in S of b. We need this to be different from sum_a(S) for all S (non-empty, not full).\n\nBut it's unclear how to model this.\n\nWait, another thought: The problem is similar to a concept called \"subset-sum avoiding\" or something similar. But I'm not familiar with standard algorithms for this.\n\nPerhaps another way to look at it is to note that the sum of the entire array in b is the same as in a. So, for the full subset, the sum is the same, but we are allowed to ignore that.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to find a permutation where for every proper subset S, the sum in b is different from that in a.\n\nBut again, how to construct this permutation?\n\nLet's think about the problem for small n.\n\nFor n=1: Not applicable, since n is 1, and the subset S must have 0 < k < 1, which is impossible. So the condition is automatically satisfied. So any permutation (which is just the same array) is acceptable.\n\nFor n=2: We need to swap the two elements if their individual elements are the same. Wait, no, because the array has distinct elements. Wait, no, because for n=2, the subsets are size 1. So for each element, the sum in a and b must be different.\n\nWait, for n=2, a is [a1, a2], and b is [a2, a1]. For subset {1}, sum_a is a1, sum_b is a2. For subset {2}, sum_a is a2, sum_b is a1. So if a1 != a2, which they are, then this is acceptable.\n\nWait, no, because in the problem statement, the arrays a and b are permutations. So for n=2, swapping the elements will satisfy the condition.\n\nSo the sample seems to be for n=4.\n\nWait, perhaps for larger n, we can arrange the permutation in a way that the prefix sums are all distinct and not present in a's prefix sums.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample:\n\na's prefix sums are 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111.\n\nb's prefix sums are 100, 101, 1101, 1111.\n\nSo, for each k from 1 to 3, the sum after k elements in b is different from a's sum after k elements.\n\nAnd the sum after 4 elements is same.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to arrange the permutation so that each step adds an element that doesn't make the prefix sum equal to any of a's prefix sums.\n\nSo, for each position i in the permutation, we choose an element that hasn't been used yet, such that the sum up to i in b is not equal to any prefix sum of a up to i, nor any other prefix sum of a.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of arranging elements to have unique prefix sums.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to construct b is as follows:\n\nStart with an empty array.\n\nAt each step, add an element x from the remaining elements, such that the new prefix sum (sum + x) is not present in the prefix sums of a.\n\nIf we can do this, then the prefix sums of b will all be unique and not present in a's prefix sums, except possibly the final sum.\n\nWhich would ensure that for any subset S, the sum in b is different from a's sum.\n\nBecause any subset S corresponds to a certain range in the prefix sums. Since all prefix sums are unique, the sum for S is unique, and since none of them are in a's prefix sums, they must be different.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because the sum for S could be a subset sum that's not a prefix sum.\n\nWait, for example, if a is [1, 2], then the subset sums are 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut if b is [2, 1], its subset sums are 2, 1, 3.\n\nSo the prefix sums of a are 1, 3, and the prefix sums of b are 2, 3.\n\nSo for subset {1} in a is 1, in b is 2: different.\n\nSubset {2} in a is 2, in b is 1: different.\n\nSubset {1,2}: 3 in both.\n\nBut the condition requires that for all non-empty proper subsets, the sums are different. So this arrangement would not work, because the subset {1,2} is not allowed, but in this case, the sum is same.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the subset S must be 0 < k < n. So for n=2, the subset sizes are 1. So the condition is satisfied if the individual elements are different.\n\nAh right, because in the case of n=2, we only need to check subsets of size 1. So the example I gave earlier for n=2 would work.\n\nSo back to the general case.\n\nIf the permutation is arranged such that the prefix sums of b are all unique and do not coincide with any prefix sum of a, except possibly the total sum, then for any subset S of size k, the sum in b would be different from a's sum for that subset.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nBecause for any subset S of size k, the sum in a is some value, and the sum in b is another. If the prefix sums of b are all unique and not present in a's prefix sums, then the sum for S can't be equal to a's sum.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nTake a as [a1, a2, a3], and b as [x, y, z], arranged such that all prefix sums of b are unique and not present in a's prefix sums.\n\nSuppose a's prefix sums are s1, s2, s3, s4.\n\nThen, the sum for any subset S in a is some value, but in b, the sum would be a difference between two prefix sums.\n\nSince all prefix sums of b are unique and not in a's prefix sums, the sum for S cannot be equal to a's sum.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach would work.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Compute all prefix sums of a.\n\n2. Find a permutation of a's elements such that, when building b step by step, adding each element x, the new prefix sum (current prefix + x) is not present in a's prefix sums.\n\n3. Additionally, ensure that the order of adding x's doesn't create duplicate prefix sums within b itself.\n\nWait, but how to implement this.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n- Start with an empty b array.\n\n- Compute the prefix sums of a, store them in a set.\n\n- At each step, choose an element x from the remaining elements, and check if adding x to the current sum would result in a new sum that is not present in a's prefix sums.\n\n- Also, the new sum must not be equal to any previous prefix sum in b.\n\n- Once x is selected, add it to b and update the current sum.\n\n- Proceed until all elements are added.\n\nBut wait, how do we know that this process will always work? For example, there might be cases where no such permutation exists.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a backtracking approach to try all possible permutations, but for n=22, that's impossible. So we need a heuristic.\n\nBut given that n is up to 22, which is manageable with bitmask DP, but perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, but looking at the constraints, n can be up to 22, which is manageable with bitmask techniques, but not with permutations.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to greedily build the permutation.\n\nThe idea is:\n\n- Start with an empty prefix sum.\n\n- At each step, choose an element x from the remaining elements such that the new prefix sum (current + x) is not present in a's prefix sums.\n\n- Also, this new prefix sum must not have been used before in the prefix sums of b.\n\nBy doing this, the prefix sums of b are unique and not in a's prefix sums, which should ensure that for any subset S, the sum in a is different from the sum in b.\n\nWait, but is this sufficient?\n\nLet's see.\n\nSuppose in a, the prefix sums are s_0=0, s_1=a1, s_2=a1+a2, etc.\n\nIn b, the prefix sums are t_0=0, t_1=x, t_2=x+y, etc.\n\nWe want t_i not in the set {s_0, s_1, ..., s_n}.\n\nSo, for any i, t_i is not equal to any s_j.\n\nNow, for any subset S, the sum is t_k - t_{i} for some i < k.\n\nSince all t's are unique, this sum is unique.\n\nBut how does this ensure that it's different from the corresponding a's sum?\n\nBecause in a, the sum for subset S is s_k - s_i.\n\nWe need s_k - s_i ≠ t_k - t_i.\n\nBut since t_i is not in the set of s's, it's possible that s_k - s_i equals t_k - t_i.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nFor example, suppose a has elements [1,3], so s_0=0, s_1=1, s_2=4.\n\nb is [3,1], t_0=0, t_1=3, t_2=4.\n\nSo t_2 is equal to s_2.\n\nSo for subset {1,2}, the sum in a is 4, sum in b is 4. Which is invalid.\n\nSo the approach of making t_i not in s's is insufficient.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the initial approach is flawed.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the earlier idea? It's that the sum of a subset S in a can be equal to the sum in b, even if the t_i's are not in the s's.\n\nSo, the earlier approach isn't sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition needs to be stronger.\n\nAlternative approach: Make sure that for every possible subset S in a and b, the sum in a is different from the sum in b.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: We can represent the sum of a subset as a vector in binary space, and ensure that for any subset, the sum in a and the sum in b differ in at least one bit.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is related to linear algebra, and we need to find a permutation where the differences between the a and b subset sums are non-zero.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into ensuring that the difference between the subset sums of a and b is non-zero for all non-empty proper subsets.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of the characteristic vectors. Each element is included or not included in a subset. So, for each subset S, the sum in a is sum_a(S) and in b is sum_b(S). We need sum_a(S) != sum_b(S) for all S ≠ empty and S ≠ full.\n\nSo, for each S, sum_a(S) - sum_b(S) ≠ 0.\n\nBut how can we arrange this for all S.\n\nWait, another observation: For the entire array, the sum of all elements in a is equal to the sum in b. So sum_a(full) = sum_b(full).\n\nBut that's allowed since the full subset is excluded.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be approached by ensuring that for all other subsets S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S).\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to find a permutation where the sum of any proper subset in a is different from the sum of the same subset in b.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother idea: Let's try to arrange the elements such that the sum of any two elements in a is different from the sum of any two in b. But that's not sufficient, but perhaps it's a start.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by ensuring that the multiset of all subset sums (for non-empty proper subsets) of a and b are completely disjoint.\n\nSo, for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_a(S) ≠ sum_b(S).\n\nBut how to arrange that.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to construct b is to arrange the elements such that the sum of any two elements in a is different from the sum of any two in b, but that's not sufficient either.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's time to look for hints or think about the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a permutation where the multiset of subset sums (excluding empty and full) for a and b are completely disjoint.\n\nBut again, for n=22, this seems computationally impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to arrange the permutation such that the first element is different from a's first element. Then, for any subset that includes the first element, the sum will differ.\n\nBut then, subsets that don't include the first element may still have the same sum as in a.\n\nSo, perhaps this is not sufficient.\n\nWait, but if the first element is different, then for any subset S that includes the first element in a, the sum in a is a1 + ... + xi, and in b it's b1 + ... + xi. Since a1 != b1, their sums will differ by (b1 - a1). So, for any subset S including the first element, the sum in a and b differ.\n\nBut what about subsets that don't include the first element?\n\nIn that case, the sum in a is the same as in b for that subset if the rest of the elements form the same subset.\n\nSo, to avoid that, the way the elements are arranged beyond the first must prevent any subset from having the same sum as in a.\n\nHmm, but this seems difficult.\n\nAnother idea: If the sum of all elements except the first in a is equal to the sum of some other combination in b, then the subset consisting of those elements would have the same sum in a and b.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to avoid this is to arrange the elements in such a way that the sum of any proper subset (excluding the full set) is unique and not present in the a's subset sums.\n\nBut again, for n=22, this seems impossible to check.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by choosing the permutation in a way that the sum of any two elements is unique. But that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let's look for patterns or think about the problem in terms of mathematical properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by using the concept of linear independence. Each element can be thought of as a vector, and the sum of subsets as combinations. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find a permutation where the difference between the a and b subset sums is non-zero for all subsets S.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the condition is equivalent to saying that the characteristic vectors of the subset sums (in a and b) are orthogonal in some way.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nGiven that time is limited, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern or a way to construct the permutation step by step.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to construct b is as follows:\n\n- Sort the array a in a certain way.\n\n- Then, permute the elements such that the prefix sums are unique and not overlapping with a's prefix sums.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the array in a way that allows us to build the permutation step by step.\n\n2. For each step, select the smallest possible element that doesn't cause a conflict with the prefix sums.\n\nBut how to determine the sorting order.\n\nAlternatively, sort the array based on some criteria, such as trying to place elements in a way that the prefix sums grow in a way that avoids collisions.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nSort the elements in increasing order, then try to build the permutation by selecting elements in a way that the prefix sums are all unique and do not match any prefix sum in a.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the sorted a is [1,10,100,1000]. The permutation is [100,1,1000,10].\n\nSo, the first element is the middle-sized element, followed by the smallest, then the largest, then the next smallest.\n\nHmm, perhaps the strategy is to alternate between placing larger and smaller elements to create varied prefix sums.\n\nBut without a clear algorithm, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: For each position i in the permutation, select the element that has not been used yet and which, when added to the current sum, creates a prefix sum that is not present in a's prefix sums and also not present in the prefix sums of b so far.\n\nThis is a greedy approach, but it may fail in some cases.\n\nBut for the purposes of code, perhaps this can be implemented with backtracking.\n\nHowever, for n=22, a backtracking approach is impossible due to time constraints.\n\nThus, perhaps we need to find a deterministic way to arrange the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by simply reversing the array. Let's see.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\na = [1000, 100, 10, 1]\n\nReversed a is [1,10,100,1000]. Let's see the prefix sums: 1,11, 111, 1111.\n\nCompare to a's prefix sums: 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111.\n\nSo, for the first element, 1 vs 1000: different.\n\nSecond: 11 vs 1100: different.\n\nThird: 111 vs 1110: different.\n\nFourth: 1111 vs 1111: same.\n\nSo, this would not work because the full sum is same.\n\nBut for the other subsets, perhaps the reversed array works.\n\nBut what about subsets of size 3.\n\nIn a, the sum of the first three elements is 1000+100+10=1110.\n\nIn the reversed array, the sum is 1+10+100=111.\n\nWhich is different.\n\nSo for n=4, the reversed array would have the prefix sums 1,11,111,1111.\n\na's prefix sums are 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111.\n\nSo for any subset S of size k <4, the sum in a and reversed array are different.\n\nThus, perhaps the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement's sample output is [100,1,1000,10], not the reversed array.\n\nBut perhaps the reversed array is a valid permutation.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to reverse the array.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the output is [100,1,1000,10], which is not the reversed array.\n\nBut perhaps the reversed array is also a valid solution.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, any valid solution is acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to reverse the array.\n\nBut let's test for n=2.\n\na is [1,2], reversed is [2,1].\n\nSubsets of size 1: 1 vs 2, 2 vs 1. Both are different.\n\nSo, yes, it's acceptable.\n\nAnother test case: a is [3,1,2].\n\nReversed is [2,1,3].\n\nPrefix sums of a: 3,4,6.\n\nPrefix sums of reversed: 2,3,6.\n\nCheck for all non-empty proper subsets.\n\nSubsets of size 1: 3,4,6.\n\nIn reversed: 2,3,6.\n\nSo, the sum 3 is present in both a and reversed, but it's in the permutation.\n\nWait, but the sum for subset {2} in a is 1, in reversed it's 1.\n\nNo, wait, a is [3,1,2], reversed is [2,1,3].\n\nWait, the subset {2} in a is the element 1, sum is 1.\n\nIn reversed, the subset {2} is 1, same sum.\n\nSo, the condition is violated.\n\nThus, the reversed array approach does not work for all cases.\n\nSo, the reversed array is not a universal solution.\n\nThus, the initial idea is incorrect.\n\nSo, what else can I think of.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: We can try to find a permutation where the sum of any k elements in b is different from the sum of any k elements in a, for all 1 ≤k <n.\n\nBut again, how to construct this.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is to find a permutation where for every element, the element is placed in such a way that when added to any previous elements, the sum is unique and not present in a's subset sums.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: The problem requires that for all subsets S, sum_b(S) ≠ sum_a(S). So, the sum function for b must be injective on the set of non-empty proper subsets.\n\nWait, but for a set of size n, the number of non-empty proper subsets is 2^n - 2. So, for n=22, that's 4 million subsets. So, the sum function must map each subset to a unique value, and also, none of these values should coincide with a's subset sums.\n\nBut I don't see how to construct such a permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to ensuring that the multiset of subset sums of a and b are disjoint, except for the full sum.\n\nBut again, for n=22, it's impossible to precompute all subset sums.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem is to find a permutation where the prefix sums of b are all unique and not present in a's prefix sums, except possibly the total sum.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sums of a, store them in a set.\n\n2. Try to build the permutation b step by step.\n\n   a. Start with an empty b array and current_sum = 0.\n\n   b. For each step, choose an element x from the remaining elements.\n\n   c. Compute the new_sum = current_sum + x.\n\n   d. Check if new_sum is not present in a's prefix sums.\n\n   e. Also, check if new_sum is not already in b's prefix sums.\n\n   f. If both conditions are met, add x to b, update current_sum, and proceed.\n\n   g. If no such x exists, backtrack and try a different choice.\n\n3. If a permutation is found, output it; else, output -1.\n\nBut for n=22, this approach is not feasible with a naive backtracking method.\n\nThus, we need a heuristic to construct the permutation greedily.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to sort the elements in a certain way, then build the permutation step by step, always choosing the next element that keeps the prefix sums unique and not conflicting with a's.\n\nBut what's the correct order to sort the elements.\n\nWait, perhaps the elements should be sorted in decreasing order, but that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the elements should be sorted in a way that alternately adds high and low elements to create varied prefix sums.\n\nBut without a clear algorithm, it's difficult.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to try all possible permutations, but that's impossible for n=22.\n\nThus, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or think of the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a graph problem. Each state is a partial permutation, and edges represent adding an unused element. The goal is to reach a complete permutation where all prefix sums are unique and not present in a's prefix sums.\n\nBut even with that, for n=22, it's computationally expensive.\n\nWait, but considering that n is up to 22, which is manageable with bitmask DP, perhaps a dynamic programming approach can be used.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by noting that the condition is equivalent to requiring that the multiset of subset sums (excluding empty and full) of a and b are disjoint.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a permutation where the subset sums of a and b do not overlap except for the full sum.\n\nSo, the approach is to find such a permutation.\n\nBut again, for n=22, this seems impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be solved by ensuring that the permutation is such that the first element is different from a's first element, and the second element is different from a's second element, and so on.\n\nBut that's not sufficient, as the example earlier shows.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by ensuring that the difference between the prefix sums of a and b is always non-zero.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider the difference between the prefix sums of a and b.\n\nFor each position i, let delta_i = t_i - s_i, where t_i is the prefix sum of b up to i, and s_i is the prefix sum of a up to i.\n\nWe need delta_i not to be present in any s_j for j < i.\n\nMoreover, the delta_i should be such that for any subset S, the sum in a and b differ.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deltas can be arranged in a way that any subset sum in a and b differ.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nPerhaps it's time to think about writing code that tries to construct the permutation step by step, greedily.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Compute the prefix sums of a, store them in a set called a_prefix_sums.\n\n- Create a list of elements in a.\n\n- Initialize an empty list for b.\n\n- Keep track of the current sum in b (start at 0).\n\n- For each step, iterate through the remaining elements, and for each candidate x:\n\n   a. Compute new_sum = current_sum + x.\n\n   b. Check if new_sum is not in a_prefix_sums.\n\n   c. Also, check if new_sum is not in b's prefix sums (including 0 and new_sum).\n\n   d. If both conditions are met, select x, add to b, update current_sum, remove x from the list, and proceed to the next step.\n\n- If at any step no x can be found, backtrack.\n\nBut for n=22, this approach is not feasible with a naive implementation.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem requires a clever heuristic that can find a permutation quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by simply reversing the array, but as earlier example shows, this may not always work.\n\nBut perhaps it's worth trying.\n\nIn the sample input, the reversed array would be [1,10,100,1000], which is different from the sample output.\n\nBut it's unclear if this approach works.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the problem is easier than it seems. Maybe the condition is automatically satisfied if the permutation is such that the first element",
