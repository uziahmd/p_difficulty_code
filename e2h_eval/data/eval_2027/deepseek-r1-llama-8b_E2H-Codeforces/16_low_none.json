Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about moving from home to university in Crazy Town, which is divided into blocks by roads. Each road is an infinite line. The key point is that you can move between adjacent blocks in one step. But how do we determine if two blocks are adjacent?\n\nHmm, the problem says that two blocks are considered adjacent if their shared border has a non-zero length. So, for example, if two blocks meet at a single point (like a corner), that doesn't count as a shared border. They must share a line segment longer than zero.\n\nThe task is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nSo, what's the approach here? Well, each step allows us to cross a road. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. But wait, no—each step is moving between adjacent blocks via a shared border, which implies that the movement is along a road. Because roads divide the plane into regions, and the borders are parts of the roads.\n\nWait, no. The shared border is part of a road. Because each road is a line, and the blocks are separated by that line. So when you move from one block to another across a road, you're crossing that line. So each step is crossing a single road.\n\nAh, right! So each step corresponds to crossing exactly one road. So the problem reduces to finding how many roads separate the home and university points. Because each such road would require a step.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose there are multiple roads between home and university. Each time you cross a road, you can reach a new block. But how does it work?\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines (roads) that separate the home and university points. Because each such line acts as a barrier that you must cross, and each crossing takes one step.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the minimal path would be to cross each separating line once.\n\nSo the plan is: for each road, determine whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of it. If yes, then this road contributes to the count. The total number of such roads is the answer.\n\nWait, but how do we determine whether two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nFor each line a*x + b*y + c = 0, compute the value f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If f1 and f2 have opposite signs, then the two points are on opposite sides of the line, meaning they are separated by that line. So each such line adds 1 to the step count.\n\nSo the algorithm becomes:\n\n1. For each of the n roads:\n   a. Compute the value of the line equation at home (x1,y1) and university (x2,y2).\n   b. Check if these two values have different signs.\n   c. If yes, increment the count.\n\n2. The count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nBecause each separating line must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step.\n\nSo the steps are straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: 1 1\nUniversity: -1 -1\nn=3\nLines:\n0 1 0 → y=0\n1 0 0 → x=0\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3=0\n\nFor each line:\n\nLine 1: 0*1 +1*1 +0=1, 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1. So signs are + and -. Opposite. Count +=1.\n\nLine 2:1*1 +0*1 +0=1, 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1. Signs differ. Count +=1.\n\nLine3:1*1+1*1-3= 1+1-3= -1. For university: 1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3= -1-1-3= -5. Both negative. Same sign. So no count.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother test case: suppose home and university are on the same side of all lines. Then the answer is 0 steps.\n\nWhat if a line has both points on same side? It's not a separator, so no step needed.\n\nSo the code needs to compute for each line whether the two points are on opposite sides.\n\nSo now, the code steps:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1)\nRead university (x2, y2)\nRead n\nFor each of n lines:\n   Read a, b, c\n   compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   compute f2 = a*x",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road defined by an infinite line.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each road is an infinite line that divides the plane into regions (blocks).\n   - Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, which takes one step.\n   - The goal is to find the minimum number of such steps required.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For each road (line), check if the home and university are on opposite sides of the line. If they are, crossing this road is necessary, contributing one step to the total count.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, compute the values of the line equation at the home and university coordinates.\n   - Check if these values have opposite signs, indicating that the points are on opposite sides of the line.\n   - Count the number of such roads as this represents the minimum steps needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    count = 0\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Checking Each Road**: For each road, it computes the value of the line equation at both home and university. If these values have opposite signs, it means the points are on opposite sides of the line, necessitating a step.\n- **Counting Steps**: The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from home to university.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging geometric properties of lines and their separation of points, ensuring an optimal and correct solution.",
