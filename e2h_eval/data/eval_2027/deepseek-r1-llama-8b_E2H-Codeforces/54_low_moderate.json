Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any will do.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, given a regular polygon with n sides, we need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on the sides adjacent to v2. The angle at v2 should be as close to 'a' degrees as possible. And among all possible angles, we need the one that's closest, and if there's a tie, any solution is acceptable.\n\nWait, but how is this angle formed? Oh right, in a regular polygon, each internal angle can be calculated. For a regular n-gon, the internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But when considering the angle formed by three points, I think it's the external angle or something else.\n\nWait no, wait. Let's think differently. Suppose we have a regular polygon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So for any three consecutive vertices, say i, i+1, i+2, the angle at i+1 would form an angle based on the positions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible angles that can be formed by choosing three vertices in the polygon.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the angle at a vertex v2 (say vertex k) when connected to two other vertices can be determined based on the number of steps between them. For example, if we pick vertices k, k+m, k-n (mod n), then the angle at k would depend on m and n.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is determined by the number of edges skipped on either side. Like, if between v2 and v1 there are m steps, and between v2 and v3 there are k steps, then the angle is based on those m and k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle is equal to the central angle between the two points, divided by some factor. Because in a regular polygon, the central angle is 360/n. So the inscribed angle might be half that, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's consider the triangle formed by the center of the polygon and the three vertices. The central angles for the sides from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 would determine the angle at v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 is equal to (m * 180 - 180*(m + k))/something. Hmm, maybe I should model it more precisely.\n\nLet me think: in a regular polygon, each edge subtends a central angle of θ = 360/n degrees. When you pick three vertices, v1, v2, v3, arranged in order around the polygon, the angle at v2 can be determined by the arcs between them.\n\nWait, but in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle (like the angle at v2 in triangle v1v2v3) is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. So the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, which is the sum of the arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, for triangle v1v2v3, the angle at v2 intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't contain v2. So the measure of that arc is (d) * θ, where d is the number of edges between v1 and v3, moving the shorter way around the polygon.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (d * θ)/2 degrees.\n\nBut wait, since θ is 360/n, the angle would be (d*360/(n)) / 2 = 180d/(n) degrees.\n\nYes! So, for any triplet of vertices, the angle at v2 is 180*d/(n), where d is the minimal number of edges between v1 and v3 along the polygon's perimeter.\n\nWait, but that's only for consecutive triplets? Or does it hold for any selection of v1, v2, v3?\n\nNo, because the angle depends on the arc between v1 and v3, regardless of where v2 is. So, for any v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is 180 * d /n, where d is the minimal step count between v1 and v3, as viewed from v2.\n\nWait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently calculating the possible angles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular n-gon has its vertices equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between any two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For any three vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 can be determined by the minimal arc between v1 and v3. This angle is given by (180 * d) / n degrees, where d is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the shorter path.\n3. **Optimal Angle Search**: We need to find the triplet (v1, v2, v3) such that the angle at v2 is closest to 'a'. This involves checking all possible values of d (from 1 to floor(n/2)) and calculating the corresponding angle.\n4. **Efficient Search**: Iterate through all possible values of d and compute the angle for each case. Track the closest angle found and record the corresponding vertices.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v = []\n\nfor d in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n    current_angle = 180 * d // n\n    diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n    if diff < best_diff or (diff == best_diff and (current_angle > a)):\n        # Update best\n        best_diff = diff\n        best_v = [d]\n    elif diff == best_diff and (current_angle < a):\n        # If same diff but current is smaller, but we want to find any, so keep previous\n        pass\n\n# Now, for each possible d that gives best_diff, find the vertices\ncandidates = []\nfor d in best_v:\n    for start in range(1, n+1):\n        v2 = start\n        v1 = (v2 - d - 1) % n + 1\n        v3 = (v2 + d - 1) % n + 1\n        if v1 != v3:\n            candidates.append((v1, v2, v3))\n\n# Find the lex smallest candidate\ncandidates.sort()\nprint(candidates[0][0], candidates[0][1], candidates[0][2])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n2. **Iterating Over Possible Distances**: For each possible distance d from 1 to n//2, calculate the angle formed by the vertices separated by d edges.\n3. **Tracking Closest Angle**: Keep track of the closest angle found and the corresponding vertices. If multiple angles are equally close, any valid triplet is acceptable.\n4. **Generating Vertices**: For each optimal distance d, generate the triplet of vertices and ensure they are distinct.\n5. **Output the Result**: Print the triplet with the smallest lexicographical order if there are multiple valid solutions.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal vertices by leveraging the geometric properties of regular polygons and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
