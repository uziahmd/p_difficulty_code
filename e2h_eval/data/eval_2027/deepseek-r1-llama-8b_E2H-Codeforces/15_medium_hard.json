They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find all winning integers x such that there's a permutation p of 1 to 2^n where the team with skill x becomes the champion. The tournament structure is a knockout style with each phase determining which teams move on based on the given string s.\n\nFirst, let me understand the tournament structure and how the phases work. The tournament has n phases. In phase i (starting from 0?), the number of games is 2^{n-i}, right? Because each phase halves the number of teams until we get down to one.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial phase has 2^{n} teams, so 2^{n-1} games in the first phase, then 2^{n-2} games in the second phase, and so on until the last phase has 1 game.\n\nEach phase's matches are structured in a certain way. For example, in phase 1 (the first phase), the teams are paired as 1v2, 3v4, etc. Then, the winners proceed to the next phase. So phase 1 is the first elimination round, phase 2 is the quarterfinals, phase 3 is the semifinals, etc., until phase n is the final.\n\nThe string s represents the outcome of each phase. For each phase i (from 0 to n-1?), the character s[i] determines whether higher or lower skilled teams win. If s[i] is '0', then in each match of phase i, the lower-skilled team wins. If '1', higher-skilled wins.\n\nWait, but what about the order of the phases? Let's say for n=3, the phases are:\n\nPhase 0: 4 games (since 2^3=8 teams). These are 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, 7v8. Each game has a winner, and the 4 winners go to phase 1.\n\nPhase 1: 2 games. The winners from 1v2 play against 3v4's winner, and similarly 5v6 vs 7v8. Each game produces two winners, who then go to phase 2.\n\nPhase 2: 1 game between those two, determining the champion.\n\nSo the phases are ordered from 0 to n-1, with each phase reducing the number of teams by half.\n\nNow, for each phase i (i runs from 0 to n-1), the result is determined by s[i]. So in phase i, each match is either a higher or lower team winning.\n\nThe problem is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nI think the approach is to model the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial matches. Each internal node represents a higher-level match.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 18, the total number of nodes is 2^{18+1}-1 = 262143, which is manageable with some efficient DP.\n\nWait, but for n=18, 2^18 is 262144, which is manageable, but maybe it's better to think in terms of the binary representation.\n\nAnother thought: for each phase, the way the teams are grouped depends on the phase. For phase i, the grouping is based on the current bracket. For example, in phase 0, the groupings are consecutive pairs. In phase 1, the groupings are blocks of four, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a match at a certain phase. Each match in phase i has 2^{i} children in phase i-1.\n\nAlternatively, each match in phase i has two subtrees, each representing the progression from phase i-1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to represent for each position in the bracket, the possible paths a team can take to reach the final.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each phase i, the way the teams are grouped into matches and how they progress based on the rules of each phase.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n-i}. Each match is between two teams, and the winner proceeds to the next phase.\n\nBut the structure of these matches depends on the phase. For phase 0, the matches are 1v2, 3v4, etc. For phase 1, the matches are (winners of 1v2) vs (winners of 3v4), (5v6 vs7v8), etc.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps for phase i, the matches are between groups of size 2^i. So for phase 0, each match is between two consecutive teams, for phase 1, each match is between the winners of two pairs, so each group is of size 4, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the tournament can be represented as a binary tree where each level corresponds to a phase, and each node corresponds to a match. The leaves are the initial matches, and each non-leaf node represents a match between two winners from the previous level.\n\nGiven this structure, perhaps the problem can be approached by building this binary tree and then determining for each possible path to the root (champion) what the necessary conditions are.\n\nBut even that might not be straightforward, considering that the permutation p must be such that the champion x is the winner under the given s rules.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. To have x as the champion, x must win all its matches in each phase, but also, for each phase, the other participants must be arranged in such a way that x can emerge as the winner.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model for each possible match in each phase, whether the higher or lower skilled team wins, and track the required constraints on the permutation p.\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider the tournament as a series of rounds, each round being a phase. For each round, the teams are grouped into matches, and the winners proceed to the next round. The permutation p determines the skills of the teams, and the rules of each phase determine which teams can win their matches.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, in every phase, x must win its match, but also, the other teams in the same group must have been arranged such that x can win each time.\n\nWait, but for each phase i, the way the teams are grouped depends on the phase. So, for phase i, each match is between two teams from the same group of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase, the way the teams are matched depends on the phase's index. For example, in phase 0, it's the first round, and the groupings are sequential. In phase 1, the groupings are the previous phase's winners divided into blocks of size 2^{i}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each phase i can be considered as having 2^{n - i} matches, each of which is a sub-bracket of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet's think about the structure of the tournament. Each phase i has 2^{n-i} matches. The total number of teams going into phase i is 2^{i+1}. For example, phase 0 has 2^{n} teams, producing 2^{n-1} winners; phase 1 has 2^{n-1} teams, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, phase 0 has 2^{n} teams, and each match reduces the number of teams by one per match, but since it's a knockout, each phase i has 2^{n - i} matches. So phase 0 has 2^{n-1} matches, resulting in 2^{n-1} winners. Phase 1 has 2^{n-2} matches, resulting in 2^{n-2} winners, and so on until phase n-1 has 1 match, resulting in 1 winner.\n\nSo each phase i (0-based) has 2^{n - i} matches, and the number of teams before phase i is 2^{i + 1}.\n\nWait, because phase 0 starts with 2^n teams. So for phase i, the number of teams is 2^{i+1}, which is halved in each match, but each match reduces the count by one, so 2^{n - i} matches are needed.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is: for a given x, can we arrange the permutation p such that x ends up as the champion?\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, in every phase i, x must win its match. Moreover, the arrangement of the other teams in the bracket must allow x to proceed through each phase.\n\nBut how to model the constraints imposed by the phase rules.\n\nAnother angle: for each phase i, the way the teams are grouped into matches is fixed. For example, in phase 0, it's 1v2, 3v4, etc. In phase 1, the winners of 1v2 and 3v4 form a group, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in phase 1, each match is between two winners from phase 0. So, for example, in phase 1, the first match is the winner of 1v2 vs the winner of 3v4. The next match is the winner of 5v6 vs the winner of 7v8, and so on.\n\nSo, the groupings in phase 1 are based on the initial groupings. So phase 1's matches are between the first pair of phase 0 winners, the second pair, etc.\n\nSimilarly, phase 2's matches are between the winners of phase 1's first and second matches.\n\nThis suggests that the structure is a binary tree, where each node in phase i has two children in phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a match in a certain phase. The leaves are the initial matches in phase 0, and each internal node represents a match in a higher phase.\n\nFor each internal node, the two children are the two matches that feed into it. So for phase i, each match is formed by combining two matches from phase i-1.\n\nGiven this structure, perhaps for each match in phase i, we can determine which two matches in phase i-1 it depends on.\n\nOnce the structure is built, we can model for each match whether the higher or lower skilled team must win, based on the phase's rule (s[i]).\n\nWait, but each phase has its own rule. So for phase i, during the matches in that phase, the winner is determined by s[i].\n\nSo, for each match in phase i, the winner must be the team with higher skill if s[i] is '1', or the lower skill if s[i] is '0'.\n\nBut wait, in phase 0, the matches are between consecutive teams. So for phase 0, each match is between 2k-1 and 2k, for k=1 to 2^{n-1}.\n\nIn phase 1, the matches are between the winners of 1v2 and 3v4, and so on.\n\nSo, for phase i, each match is between two submatches from phase i-1. So the group of 2^{i+1} teams is partitioned into 2^{i} groups of 2 teams each, then phase 0 matches are formed, and then phase i-1 is processed, and so on.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps for each phase i, the matches are formed by grouping the 2^{i+1} teams into 2^i groups of 2, then each group forms a match in phase 0, which then feeds into phase i matches.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the tournament as a binary heap-like structure, where each node represents a match, and each match has two children (the two submatches that feed into it).\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure how to model this. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the binary representations of the team indices.\n\nWait, perhaps each team's path to the final can be represented as a binary string, where each bit indicates which side of the match it took in each phase.\n\nWait, for example, in phase 0, a team can be the left or right child in the next phase. So for team x, we can represent its journey through the tournament as a binary decision at each phase.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each phase i, the matches are formed by grouping the 2^{i+1} teams into 2^i consecutive pairs. So for phase 0, it's just the initial 2^n teams paired as 1v2, 3v4, etc. For phase 1, the winners are grouped again into 2^1 pairs, so each pair consists of two phase 0 winners. So the first pair is winners of 1v2 and 3v4, the next pair is 5v6 and 7v8, and so on.\n\nSo, phase i is formed by grouping the 2^{i+1} winners into 2^i groups of 2, each group consisting of two consecutive phase i-1 winners.\n\nSo, for phase i, the matches are between consecutive pairs of phase i-1 winners.\n\nIf I can model this, perhaps I can represent the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a match in a certain phase. Each node has two children, which are the two submatches that produce its participants.\n\nThen, for each node, I can determine the necessary constraints on the permutation p based on the phase's rule (s[i]) and the structure of the submatches.\n\nWait, perhaps for each match in phase i, which is formed by two submatches (left and right), the winner is determined by the rule s[i]. So, for each match in phase i, the winner must be the higher or lower skilled team based on s[i], depending on whether the higher or lower team wins.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible permutations.\n\nWait, perhaps for each match, the winner must be a certain subset of the possible teams, depending on the rules. Then, the problem reduces to finding a permutation where x is the root of the tournament tree, and for each match along x's path, the winner is x and satisfies the phase's rule.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: Since the permutation p is arbitrary, except that it's a permutation of 1..2^n, perhaps the only constraints are that for x to be the champion, in each phase i, the match that x participates in must have x as the winner according to s[i]. Additionally, for each of the other matches that x would have to face in the bracket, the other participants must be arranged such that x can win.\n\nWait, but that's a bit vague. How do the other matches affect x's ability to win?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tournament structure can be seen as a binary tree where each match is a node. For x to win, it must win all matches along the path from the leaf (initial match) to the root (champion). But each internal node has two children, which are the submatches that lead to it.\n\nThus, for each match in the path of x, x must be the winner. Moreover, for each internal node in this path, the two children (submatches) must have produced x as the winner, which depends on their own phase rules.\n\nThis seems recursive. So, for each phase i, the match in that phase is part of x's path. So, for each such match, x must be the winner, and the other participant must be a team that was the winner of their own submatch, subject to the phase's rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model for each possible match in the tournament tree whether it's possible for a certain set of teams to appear as the winner of that match, given the phase's rule. Then, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the matches along its path in the tournament tree, which are determined by the phase rules.\n\nSo, for each match m, we can compute the set of possible winners that can emerge from m, given the phase rule and the structure of the submatches leading to m.\n\nBut the challenge is that the structure of the submatches is determined by the phase and the tournament's grouping.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nEach match m in phase i is formed by two submatches m_left and m_right. The two winners of m_left and m_right then compete in m.\n\nThe winner of m is determined by s[i]: if s[i] is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nSo, for m to have x as the winner, either:\n\n- s[i] is '0' and x is the lower-skilled of the two winners of m_left and m_right, or\n- s[i] is '1' and x is the higher-skilled.\n\nAdditionally, the winners of m_left and m_right must themselves satisfy their own phase rules.\n\nSo, for each match m in the tournament, we can model the possible winners as follows:\n\nIf m is a leaf (phase 0), then the winner is simply the higher or lower-skilled of its two teams, depending on s[0]. So for a phase 0 match between a and b, if s[0] is '0', the winner is min(a, b); else, it's max(a, b).\n\nIf m is an internal node (phase i > 0), then the winner is determined by s[i] based on the winners of m_left and m_right. So, for x to be the winner of m, x must be the maximum or minimum of the winners of m_left and m_right, depending on s[i].\n\nThus, for each match m, we can precompute the possible winners, given the phase's rule and the structure of m's submatches.\n\nBut how to represent this in code.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this using a recursive function. For each match m, represented by its phase i and its left and right submatches, we can compute the possible winners.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the number of matches is 2^19 - 1, which is around 500k. That's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree structure, where each match m has its phase i, and its left and right submatches.\n\n2. For each match m, compute the set of possible winners that can emerge from m, given the phase's rule s[i] and the possible winners from its submatches.\n\n3. Starting from the root (the final match), check if x can be the winner by seeing if x is in the possible winners set of the root, considering all constraints along the path.\n\nWait, but how do we model the path from x's initial match to the root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the matches along the path from the leaf (initial match) to the root.\n\nBut the problem is that the structure of the tournament may require x to participate in different matches in each phase.\n\nWait, perhaps for x to be the champion, in each phase i, x must be the winner of its own match in phase i, and the other participants in that match must have come from their respective submatches.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bitmask problem, where each bit represents whether a team is in a certain position in the bracket.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the grouping is such that the teams are in blocks of size 2^{i+1}, and within each block, the first half is paired with the second half.\n\nWait, for phase i, the 2^{i+1} teams are split into 2^i groups of 2, and each group forms a phase 0 match.\n\nSo, for phase i, the group is formed by taking consecutive 2^{i+1} teams, then splitting them into pairs, each of which forms a phase 0 match.\n\nWait, perhaps the groupings can be represented by their positions in the permutation.\n\nBut this seems tricky.\n\nAnother approach: for each phase i, the matches are determined by the current grouping of the 2^{i+1} teams. So, for phase 0, the matches are 1v2, 3v4, ..., 2^{n} - 1 v 2^{n}.\n\nFor phase 1, the matches are between the winners of the first two phase 0 matches, then the next two, and so on.\n\nSo, phase 1's first match is between the winners of 1v2 and 3v4. Phase 1's second match is between 5v6 and 7v8, etc.\n\nSimilarly, phase 2's matches are between the winners of phase 1's first two matches, and so on.\n\nThus, for each phase i, the matches are formed by grouping the previous phase's winners into 2^{i} groups of 2, each group forming a match.\n\nSo, for phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}.\n\nThus, for each phase i, the matches can be determined by their starting positions.\n\nWait, perhaps for phase i, the starting team is 1 + 2^{i} * k, where k is 0, 1, ..., 2^{i} - 1. Each group is of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nFor example, phase 0: groups are 2 teams each (start at 1,3,5, etc.), phase 1: groups of 4 teams, so 1-4,5-8, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps for phase i, the starting index is 1 + 2^i * k, for k in 0..2^i -1.\n\nAnd each group consists of 2^{i+1} consecutive teams.\n\nSo, for phase i, the number of matches is 2^{i}.\n\nEach match in phase i is formed by two consecutive submatches from phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this by building a structure where for each phase i, the matches are formed by taking the winners of phase i-1's matches, grouped in pairs.\n\nSo, for phase i, the j-th match is formed by the winners of the 2j-1-th and 2j-th matches of phase i-1.\n\nThus, the structure can be built recursively.\n\nBut how to model the possible winners for each match.\n\nPerhaps, for each match m in phase i, the possible winners are determined by the winners of m's left and right submatches, based on s[i].\n\nSo, for each match m in phase i, the possible winners can be computed as follows:\n\n- Let left_winner be the possible winners of the left submatch.\n- Let right_winner be the possible winners of the right submatch.\n- If s[i] is '0', then the winner of m is the minimum of left_winner and right_winner.\n- If s[i] is '1', then the winner is the maximum.\n\nSo, for each match m, the possible winners are the union of all possible combinations of left_winner and right_winner, according to the rule.\n\nBut for the root match (the final), x must be in the possible winners set.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Build the tournament structure, where each match has its phase and its left and right submatches.\n\n2. For each match, compute the possible winners based on the phase's rule and the possible winners of the submatches.\n\n3. Starting from the root, propagate the possible winners down to the leaves.\n\nWait, but how to build the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent each match as a tuple (i, left, right), where i is the phase, and left and right are the indices of the left and right submatches.\n\nBut building this structure for n=18 would require handling 2^18+1-1 = 262143 matches.\n\nBut 262k is manageable.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n- Precompute the tournament structure as a binary tree. Each match has a phase i, and two children (submatches) from phase i-1.\n\n- For each phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n - i}.\n\n- For each match in phase i, the left and right submatches are the (j*2 -1)th and (j*2)th matches of phase i-1, respectively, where j ranges from 1 to 2^{i-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps more precisely:\n\nFor phase i, the first match is composed of the winners of match 1 and match 2 of phase i-1.\n\nThe second match is winners of match 3 and 4 of phase i-1.\n\nAnd so on, until the 2^{i} matches of phase i are formed.\n\nSo, for phase i, the j-th match is formed by the winners of the (2j-1)th and 2j-th matches of phase i-1.\n\nThus, the structure can be built recursively.\n\nOnce the structure is built, for each match, we can compute the possible winners.\n\nThe computation is done as follows:\n\nFor a match m in phase i:\n\n- If it's a leaf match (i=0), then the possible winners are {min(a,b), max(a,b)} if s[0] is '0', or {max(a,b)} if s[0] is '1' and the higher team wins.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a leaf match, it's between two specific teams. The possible winner depends on the rule s[i]. So, for phase 0, the match is between two specific teams. So, for the leaf match, the possible winner is determined by s[0].\n\nSo, for a leaf match (phase 0), the possible winner is either team a or team b, where a < b, based on s[0]. If s[0] is '0', then the lower team (a) wins; else, the higher (b) wins.\n\nWait, but the permutation is arbitrary. So, for a leaf match between a and b, the possible winner is a or b, depending on s[0].\n\nSo, for a leaf match, the possible winners are:\n\nif s[0] == '0': {a, b} where a < b, but since a can be any two distinct numbers, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. For a leaf match, the possible winner depends on the two teams in that match. But the permutation p can arrange the teams in any way, as long as it's a permutation.\n\nSo, for a leaf match m in phase 0, the two teams can be any two distinct numbers. The possible winner is either of them, depending on the rule.\n\nBut in the context of the entire permutation, the two teams in a leaf match are determined by the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe another idea is needed.\n\nAlternative approach: For each team x, determine if it's possible for x to be the winner of all the matches in the path from the leaf to the root, given the phase rules.\n\nBut how to model the path.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can simulate its journey through each phase, determining the necessary constraints on the other teams in the bracket.\n\nLet me think about the phases:\n\nIn phase 0, x must win its match. Suppose x is in a leaf match. Then, the other team in that match must be either less than x (if s[0] is '0') or greater than x (if s[0] is '1'). Because x will win based on s[0].\n\nIn phase 1, x must win its match. This match is against the winner of another phase 0 match. So, x must be the winner of the match against another team y, which itself is the winner of its phase 0 match.\n\nSo, for x to win phase 1's match, the other participant y must be either less than x (if s[1] is '0') or higher than x (if s[1] is '1').\n\nWait, but the other participant y comes from another phase 0 match, which has its own rule. So, the arrangement of the other teams affects whether x can proceed.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps we can choose the other participants in such a way that x can win each phase.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the condition is that x must be the winner of the match in that phase, which depends on s[i] and the arrangement of the other teams.\n\nBut how to model this for all phases.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking for each x whether, for each phase i, the position of x in the bracket allows it to meet certain conditions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the tournament as a binary tree where each node is a match. For each match, the winner is determined by the phase's rule and the winners of its two children. The key is to represent for each match, which teams can be the winner.\n\nBut with n=18, the number of matches is 2^19-1=262143, which is manageable.\n\nWe can represent for each match m, the possible winners as a set.\n\nWe can compute this bottom-up, starting from the leaves.\n\nFor each leaf match (phase 0), the possible winners are either of the two teams in the match, depending on s[0].\n\nFor a non-leaf match m in phase i, the possible winners are determined by the possible winners of its two children (submatches) and the rule s[i].\n\nSo, for each match m:\n\npossible_winners[m] = \n\n   if s[i] == '0':\n\n       for a in possible_winners[left_child], b in possible_winners[right_child]:\n\n           add min(a, b) to possible_winners[m]\n\n   else:\n\n       for a in possible_winners[left_child], b in possible_winners[right_child]:\n\n           add max(a, b) to possible_winners[m]\n\nBut wait, this approach would generate all possible combinations, but for n=18, the number of possible winners per match could be very large.\n\nWait, no. Because the permutation is a single permutation, each match's possible winners are constrained by the structure of the bracket.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of determining whether x can be the champion, we only need to know whether x is in the possible winners of the root match.\n\nWait, but how does this account for the fact that x must win all the matches along its path.\n\nAh, perhaps this approach is not sufficient, because for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the matches along the path from the leaf to the root. But the above approach computes all possible winners for each match, regardless of the path.\n\nWait, but perhaps the structure of the tournament ensures that the champion must be the winner of the root match, which is determined by the possible winners of its two children, and so on.\n\nThus, for x to be the champion, x must be in the possible winners of the root match.\n\nBut wait, the root match's possible winners are determined by the possible winners of its two children, which are the winners of phase n-1 matches.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to: is x present in the possible winners of the root match?\n\nIf yes, then x can be the champion.\n\nBut is this correct?\n\nWait, because the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the bracket such that x can win all matches, but the possible winners for each match may include multiple options, but x must be one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to compute for each match m, the set of possible winners, given the phase's rule and the possible winners of its children.\n\nThen, the root's possible winners are the set of possible champions.\n\nThus, the answer is all x such that x is in the root's possible winners.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this captures all constraints correctly.\n\nLet me test this approach on the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n\n101\n\nThe phases are 0,1,2.\n\ns = '101'\n\nPhase 0: s[0] = '1' → higher team wins.\n\nPhase 1: s[1] = '0' → lower team wins.\n\nPhase 2: s[2] = '1' → higher team wins.\n\nLet's build the possible winners for each match.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to manually compute for small n.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps I can proceed with the code approach.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the tournament structure as a binary tree, where each match has its phase and children.\n\n- Compute for each match, the possible winners based on the phase rule and the children's possible winners.\n\n- The root's possible winners are the set of possible champions.\n\n- Output all x in this set.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the permutation p is a permutation of 1 to 2^n. So, the possible winners for each match depend on the actual arrangement of the teams, but we're trying to find if there exists at least one permutation where x can be the champion.\n\nThus, the approach is correct: for each match, compute the possible winners, and the root's possible winners are the x's that can be champions.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and s.\n\n2. Build the tournament structure as a binary tree, where each match has its phase and left and right children.\n\n3. For each match, compute the possible winners:\n\n   a. If it's a leaf match (phase 0), the possible winners are the two teams in the match, ordered such that the higher or lower wins based on s[0].\n\n   b. For internal matches, the possible winners are the combinations of the left and right submatches' possible winners, according to the phase's rule.\n\n4. After processing all matches, the possible winners for the root are the candidates for x.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the matches.\n\nEach match can be represented by an index, and for each index, we store:\n\n- phase i.\n\n- left and right children (their indices in the list of matches).\n\nBut for n=18, the number of matches is 2^19-1=262143, which is manageable.\n\nWe can create a list 'matches', where each element is a dictionary with keys 'i', 'left', 'right'.\n\nWe can build this list recursively.\n\nFor phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n-i}.\n\nWait, for phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n - i}.\n\nWait, for phase 0, it's 2^{n} / 2 = 2^{n-1} matches.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   for j in 0 to 2^{n-i} -1:\n\n       create a match m.\n\n       if i ==0: it's a leaf match.\n\n           the left and right children are the next two matches in phase i=0.\n\n       else:\n\n           the left and right children are the (j*2)th and (j*2+1)th matches of phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps the construction can be done as follows:\n\nInitialize a list 'matches' as empty.\n\ncurrent_phase = 0\n\ncurrent_match_count = 2 ** (n - current_phase)\n\nfor j in 0 ... current_match_count -1:\n\n   create a new match m.\n\n   m['phase'] = current_phase\n\n   if current_phase ==0:\n\n       m['is_leaf'] = True\n\n   else:\n\n       left_child_index = 2*j\n\n       right_child_index = 2*j +1\n\n       m['left'] = matches[left_child_index]\n\n       m['right'] = matches[right_child_index]\n\n   matches.append(m)\n\n   current_phase +=1\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because for phase 1, each match is formed by two phase 0 matches.\n\nWait, perhaps for phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n - i}.\n\nThus, for i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   num_matches_i = 2^{n - i}\n\n   for j in 0 ... num_matches_i -1:\n\n       if i ==0:\n\n           m is a leaf match.\n\n           left and right are the next two matches in phase i.\n\n       else:\n\n           m's left is the j-th match of phase i-1.\n\n           m's right is the (j+1)-th match of phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps the construction needs to be done in a way that for phase i, the j-th match is formed by the j-th and (j+1)-th matches of phase i-1.\n\nWait, no. Because for phase i, each match is formed by two consecutive matches from phase i-1.\n\nFor example, phase 1 is built from phase 0 matches. The first match of phase 1 is formed by the first and second matches of phase 0. The second match of phase 1 is formed by the third and fourth matches of phase 0, etc.\n\nSo, for phase i, the j-th match is formed by the (2j-1)-th and 2j-th matches of phase i-1.\n\nThus, when building phase i, for each j, the left child is matches[2j-1] and the right child is matches[2j].\n\nBut this is only valid if the phase i-1 has enough matches.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to build the matches in levels, starting from phase 0.\n\nFor phase 0, the matches are 0 to 2^{n-1} -1.\n\nFor phase 1, each match j is formed by matches[2j] and matches[2j+1] from phase 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize a list 'matches' to hold all matches.\n\ncurrent_phase = 0\n\ncurrent_level_matches = 2 ** (n - current_phase)\n\nfor j in range(current_level_matches):\n\n    m = Match()\n\n    m.phase = current_phase\n\n    if current_phase ==0:\n\n        # it's a leaf match.\n\n        # the two teams are not known yet; but for the purposes of the structure, it's just placeholder.\n\n        # but for our algorithm, we don't need the actual teams, since the possible winners are determined by the phase rules and the possible winners of the children.\n\n        # So, for the leaf matches, their possible winners are determined by their own rule.\n\n        # So,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which integers can be the champion of a tournament based on given rules for each phase. The tournament structure is a knockout style where each phase halves the number of teams until only one remains.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of multiple phases, each with a specific rule determining which team wins each match. The structure is represented as a binary tree where each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial matches in the first phase.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule specified by a character '0' or '1'. If '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Possible Winners Calculation**: For each match, compute the possible winners based on the phase's rule and the results of its submatches. This is done recursively, starting from the leaves (initial matches) and moving up to the root (final match).\n4. **Root Match Winners**: The root match's possible winners are the candidates for the champion. Collect all such winners and output them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Build the list of matches\n    max_matches = 2 ** (n + 1)\n    matches = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        phase = i\n        num_matches = 2 ** (n - phase)\n        for j in range(num_matches):\n            left_idx = 2 * j\n            right_idx = 2 * j + 1\n            m = {\n                'phase': phase,\n                'left': matches[left_idx] if left_idx < len(matches) else None,\n                'right': matches[right_idx] if right_idx < len(matches) else None,\n                'possible_winners': set()\n            }\n            matches.append(m)\n    \n    # Process matches in reverse order (bottom-up approach)\n    for m in reversed(matches):\n        phase = m['phase']\n        if phase == 0:\n            # Leaf match: two teams, but since permutation is arbitrary, it's about possible winners\n            # For leaf match, it's between two consecutive teams in the bracket\n            # Wait, no: the actual pairs depend on the phase 0 grouping\n            # So perhaps this approach isn't correct for the actual teams, but for the purpose of possible winners, we can represent the possible min and max\n            # Since the permutation can arrange any way, the possible winners for a leaf match are either of the two possible teams in that pair\n            # But how?
