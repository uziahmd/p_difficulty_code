Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters of the guest and host, they should exactly match the pile, without any extra letters left over or missing.\n\nHmm, so the input has three lines. The first line is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile. All are uppercase letters. I need to determine if the pile can be rearranged to form both names together.\n\nSo, the approach here seems straightforward. We can count the frequency of each character in the guest name, then do the same for the host name, add those counts together, and then compare with the counts from the pile. If all counts match, then output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, right. Because if the combined letters of guest and host have certain frequencies, the pile must have exactly those frequencies. Any extra or missing letters would make it invalid.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the three lines from input. Let's say:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, I need to process each string into a character count. Maybe using a Counter from the collections module.\n\nSo, import Counter from collections.\n\nThen, create counters for guest, host, and pile.\n\nBut wait, the guest and host names combined should equal the pile. So:\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nWe can create a counter for combined and another for the pile. Then check if these two counters are equal.\n\nYes! That makes sense. Because if the sum of the guest and host is the same as the pile, then we can permute the pile to form both names.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the three strings.\n2. Concatenate guest and host to get the expected combined string.\n3. Create a Counter for the combined string.\n4. Create a Counter for the pile.\n5. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES; else, NO.\n\nThat sounds simple enough.\n\nNow, what about edge cases? For example, empty strings? But according to the problem statement, each line is not empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nAnother case: what if the pile has the exact same letters but in a different order? Well, the Counter comparison takes care of that since it's based on counts, not order.\n\nWhat about when the guest or host is longer than the pile? Like, suppose the combined length is more than the pile's length. Then the counters won't match, so it will correctly return NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no, the input is three lines: guest, host, pile. Oh right, the sample input is given as three lines, but in the example, the output is ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'], which corresponds to each case.\n\nWait, no. The sample shows the input as an array of three strings, but in reality, the input is three lines, each read as a separate string. So in code, I just read three lines.\n\nIn the first sample, the guest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ. Combined, their letters should be SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Wait, no, the pile is the third line, which is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, maybe the way the sample is presented is as three inputs, each being a string.\n\nSo, for the first sample, the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', and pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nWait, no, the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'? Or wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nInput\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nBut in reality,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host exactly, without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines from the input, which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name to form a combined string.\n3. **Character Counting:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in both the combined string and the pile of letters.\n4. **Comparison:** Compare the two counters. If they are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the guest's and host's names exactly, otherwise, it cannot.\n\nThis approach ensures that we check for both the presence and absence of each character exactly as required by the problem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines from input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Create counters for the combined string and the pile\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n# Compare the two counters\nif counter_combined == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input consists of three lines, each containing a string. We read these strings and strip any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Combining Names:** By concatenating the guest's and host's names, we create a single string that represents all the characters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Counting Characters:** Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The comparison between the two counters tells us if every character in the combined string is exactly matched by the pile, considering both their counts and types.\n\nThis method efficiently checks for the exact match of characters using their frequencies, ensuring that no extra or missing characters are present.",
