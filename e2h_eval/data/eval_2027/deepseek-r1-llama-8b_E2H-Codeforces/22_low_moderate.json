After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. We have n students and m subjects. Each student has m marks, each from 1-9. For each subject, we need to find out which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the max in any subject. The count of such students is what we need to output.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line gives n and m. Then, there are n lines, each representing a student's marks for m subjects. These lines are strings of digits, no spaces. So for example, '223' represents three subjects where the student got 2, 2, 3.\n\n2. For each subject across all students, determine the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if in any subject they have the maximum mark. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nWait, but how do I structure the data? Maybe for each subject, store the maximum value and which student(s) achieved it. Then, for each student, check if they are the maximum in any of the subjects.\n\nAlternatively, for each student, for each subject, see if their mark is the highest among all students for that subject.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each subject j (from 0 to m-1), I'll track the maximum mark and the list of students who have it. Then, for each student, if they are in any of these lists for any subject, they're successful.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the data structures. I can represent each student's marks as a list. Then, for each subject j, iterate through all students, find the maximum mark, and record which students have that mark.\n\nWait, but for each subject, I just need to know the maximum value, and then for each student, whether their mark for that subject equals the maximum.\n\nSo perhaps for each subject, I can compute the maximum, and then for each student, if any of their marks equals that subject's maximum, then they are successful.\n\nThat might be more efficient than building a list of students per subject.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- For each subject j:\n   - Iterate through all students and find their j-th mark.\n   - Find the maximum mark in this subject.\n- Once I have all the maximums for each subject, for each student, check if in any subject j, their mark equals the maximum of j.\n\nThen, count the number of students where this is true.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the input is given as a single string, but the sample input shows something like ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '...']—no, wait, maybe that's not accurate. Wait, looking back, the user wrote the input as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. So the input is read as a single string, split into lines.\n\nSo in Python, perhaps we can read all lines at once.\n\nWait, perhaps in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, each being a line. But in reality, the input will be read via stdin, so in code, perhaps using something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\ngrades = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nYes.\n\nEach grade string is length m, each character is a digit.\n\nSo for each student i, their marks are grades[i], a string of length m.\n\nNow, for each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n\n- collect all the j-th characters from each student's grades.\n- find the maximum value in that column.\n- store it as max_marks[j].\n\nOnce we have max_marks for all j, then for each student, we check if any of their marks in any j equals max_marks[j].\n\nIf yes, count them.\n\nSo in code:\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        current = int(grades[i][j])\n        if current > max_val:\n            max_val = current\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\nThen, for each student i, check if any of their j-th marks equals max_marks[j].\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    success = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if int(grades[i][",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is defined as one who is the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The first line contains two integers, `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The next `n` lines contain strings representing the marks for each subject by each student.\n2. **Track Maximum Marks**: For each subject, iterate through all students to find the maximum mark achieved in that subject.\n3. **Determine Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any of the subjects. If they do, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        current = int(grades[i][j])\n        if current > max_val:\n            max_val = current\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if int(grades[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break  # No need to check further once found\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line. The first line gives the number of students and subjects. Each subsequent line represents a student's marks for each subject.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject, we determine the highest mark achieved by any student. This is stored in an array `max_marks` where each index corresponds to a subject.\n3. **Checking Success**: For each student, we check each subject mark against the maximum mark for that subject. If a student has the maximum mark in any subject, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the number of successful students by leveraging nested loops and array indexing, ensuring we handle all edge cases within the problem constraints.",
