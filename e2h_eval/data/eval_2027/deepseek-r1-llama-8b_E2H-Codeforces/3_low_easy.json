Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l in length. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d so that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's consider what the street looks like. It's a line from 0 to l. Each lantern covers a segment of [ai - d, ai + d], but we have to ensure that this doesn't go beyond 0 or l. Wait, no—actually, any part beyond 0 or l isn't part of the street. So each lantern's coverage is the intersection of [ai -d, ai +d] with [0, l]. But since the street is only between 0 and l, the effective coverage is max(0, ai -d) to min(l, ai +d).\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to model the entire street as being covered without worrying about individual lanterns' positions. Because the union of all their coverages must include the entire street.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the smallest d such that for every point x on [0, l], there exists at least one lantern i where |x - ai| ≤ d.\n\nAlternatively, the entire interval [0, l] must be covered by the union of the intervals [ai -d, ai +d], each possibly clipped to [0, l].\n\nWait, but the union of all these intervals must cover [0, l]. So the minimal d is the smallest value such that the merged intervals from all lanterns, each of which contributes an interval around ai with radius d, cover the entire street.\n\nHow can we compute this minimal d?\n\nI think we can model this as finding the maximum gap between adjacent lanterns, considering their coverage. Because the minimal d must be such that the coverage from each lantern overlaps sufficiently to eliminate any gaps.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a better way is to sort the lantern positions and then look for the largest distance between consecutive points, including the start and end of the street.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we sort the lanterns, the street is divided into segments between them. The minimal required d must be at least half the maximum distance between two consecutive points (including the edges), because otherwise, the middle of that segment wouldn't be covered.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Compute the coverage of each lantern when d is determined.\n3. The minimal d is the maximum of the minimal required for each of these gaps.\n\nBut how do we compute the minimal d for each gap?\n\nFor a single gap between two points a and b (a < b), the minimal d required to cover the entire gap is (b - a)/2. Because if you place a lantern in the middle, covering from (a + (b-a)/2 -d) to (b - (b-a)/2 +d), but wait, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, the minimal d to cover the entire [a, b] is such that the coverage of each lantern's left and right ends must meet.\n\nWait, no. For a single gap between two lanterns, say at positions a and b, the maximal distance from any point in [a, b] to the nearest lantern is the maximum of (a - prev_point) / 2 and (next_point - b) / 2, but wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, think about the worst case for a particular gap. For a gap between two lanterns, the minimal d needed is the maximum of the distances from either end of the gap to the nearest lantern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as for each pair of consecutive points in the sorted list, plus the start (0) and end (l), calculate the required d for that segment.\n\nWait, here's the idea: when you have two points, a and b, the minimal d required so that the segment [a, b] is covered is the maximum of (b - a)/2, because each point in the middle needs to be covered by at least one lantern. But wait, that might not be accurate. Let's think about the example.\n\nIn the sample input 2, the lanterns are at 2 and 5. The street is from 0 to 5. The first lantern covers [0,4] when d=2, and the second covers [3,7], but since l is 5, it's [3,5]. So combined, they cover the entire street.\n\nWhat is the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns?",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns cover the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lantern positions and ensuring these gaps are covered by the radius \\( d \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps us efficiently compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Compute Gaps**: Calculate the gaps between each pair of consecutive lantern positions. Additionally, consider the start (0) and end (l) of the street as points to ensure coverage at both ends.\n3. **Determine Minimum Radius**: For each gap, compute the required radius \\( d \\) to cover the gap. The maximum of these values across all gaps will be the minimum radius needed to cover the entire street.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Add 0 and l to the list to handle the edges\n    a = [0] + a + [l]\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_gap = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n        prev = a[i-1]\n        current = a[i]\n        gap = current - prev\n        # The minimal d needed is half the gap\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        if required_d > max_gap:\n            max_gap = required_d\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_gap))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the computation of gaps between consecutive points.\n2. **Gaps Calculation**: By considering the start and end of the street, we ensure that the first and last gaps are also evaluated.\n3. **Radius Calculation**: For each gap, the required radius is half the length of the gap. This ensures that the midpoint of each gap is covered, thus eliminating any uncovered segments.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum radius \\( d \\) by focusing on the largest gap between consecutive lanterns, ensuring that the entire street is covered with the smallest possible radius.",
