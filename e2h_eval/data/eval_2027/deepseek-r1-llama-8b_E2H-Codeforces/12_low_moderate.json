The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order of the tasks matters because she has to process them in the order given.\n\nHmm, I need to find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first test case, n=4, m=3, and the tasks are 3,2,3. The output is 6. The sequence is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. That makes sense because she needs to get to 2 after the second task and then to 3 for the third.\n\nWait, but the tasks are processed in order. So the first task is 3: she has to reach 3 by the end of processing it. But since that's the first task, she starts at 1, goes to 2 (cost 1), then 3 (another 1), total 2 so far. Then the second task is 2: she can do that from 3 by going back to 2, which is 3 steps? Or wait, no, because moving is along the ring. From 3 to 2 is one step clockwise? Wait, no. Because the ring is circular. Wait, house 1 is connected to 2 and n. So for n=4, the arrangement is 1-2-3-4-1.\n\nSo movement is only possible in the clockwise direction, right? Or wait, traffic is one way and clockwise. So you can't move counter-clockwise. So from house 4, you can only go to 1. So movement is only in the clockwise direction, meaning each house is connected to the next higher-numbered house, except for the last which connects back to 1.\n\nSo when Xenia is at 3, to get to 2, she has to go through 4 and 1, then 2. That would take 3 steps. So for the second task, she's at 3, and needs to get to 2. So she moves from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 units of time. So after the second task, the time is 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nThen the third task is again 3. She's already at 2, so she needs to go from 2 →3, which is 1 step. So total time is 5 +1 =6.\n\nSo the key is that each time, she has to reach the required house for the current task, considering all the previous tasks.\n\nI think the approach here is to process each task in the order they are given. For each task i, we need to calculate the minimal steps needed to reach a_i from the previous position. But wait, since the positions are on a ring, it's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, the initial position is 1. Then for the first task, she has to go to a_1. So the time added is the distance from 1 to a_1, moving clockwise.\n\nFor the second task, she has to go to a_2, but from the position where she was after processing the first task. So for each step, we track her current position.\n\nBut how do we model the distance? Since the ring is circular, the distance from x to y is min( (y -x) mod n, (x - y) mod n )? Wait no, because movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So the distance from x to y is (y -x) if y >=x, else (n -x + y). Because you can't go counter-clockwise.\n\nWait, let's think: moving from x to y in a ring where you can only go clockwise. So if y is ahead of x, the distance is (y -x). If y is behind x, you have to go around the ring to reach y. So the distance is (y -x) mod n, but since mod returns non-negative, perhaps not. Alternatively, the distance is (y -x) if y >=x, else (n -x + y).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each task, we can compute the required movement as the distance from the current position to the new a_i.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1, time =0.\n\nFor each task in the list a:\n    new_position = a_i\n    distance =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and can only move clockwise along the ringroad. Each task requires her to be at a specific house by the time she completes all previous tasks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Xenia starts at house number 1. We will track her current position and the total time taken as she moves through each task.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task, calculate the shortest clockwise distance from her current position to the required house for that task.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance from house `x` to house `y` in a clockwise direction on a ringroad is computed as:\n   - If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the distance is `y - x`.\n   - If `y` is less than `x`, the distance is `(n - x) + y`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n4. **Update Position and Time**: After computing the distance for each task, update Xenia's current position and accumulate the total time taken.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    # Calculate the distance from current_pos to a\n    if a >= current_pos:\n        dist = a - current_pos\n    else:\n        dist = (n - current_pos) + a\n    total_time += dist\n    current_pos = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 with zero time elapsed.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, determine the clockwise distance from the current position to the required house.\n- **Update Time and Position**: Add the calculated distance to the total time and update the current position to the new house.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal time required by considering each task in sequence and moving only in the allowed direction. The solution handles all edge cases, including when tasks require revisiting previous houses.",
