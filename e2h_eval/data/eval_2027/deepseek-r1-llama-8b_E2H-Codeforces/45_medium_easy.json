There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the tournament is a single-elimination bracket, but the structure isn't fixed. The organizers arrange the grid such that any two players can face each other only if their previous game counts differ by at most one.\n\nWait, so each time a player plays a game, they have to have either the same or one more or one fewer number of games than their opponent.\n\nI think the problem boils down to finding the longest possible path a player can take through a tree where each edge represents a game, and the difference in the number of games between connected nodes is at most one.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's better to model this as building a binary tree where each node represents a game. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think recursively. For a given number of players, what's the maximum number of games the winner can play?\n\nLet me look at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 2 → Output: 1\nThat's straightforward. One game between the two.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 3 → Output: 2\nThe winner plays two games. Like, first against one player, then against another.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:4 → Output:2\nWait, why isn't it 3? Oh, because in the third sample, the explanation says that after the winner has played two games (against 2 and 3), he can't play against 4 since the difference is 2. So the structure must be arranged in a way that allows the maximum games for the winner without violating the rule.\n\nAnother example: n=10 → output 4.\n\nSo how to model this?\n\nMaybe think about the maximum number of games the winner can play as the largest k such that 2^k -1 ≤n.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=2: 2^1-1=1 ≤2 → k=1.\nn=3: 2^2-1=3 ≤3 → k=2.\nn=4: 2^2-1=3 <4, but 2^3-1=7>4. Wait, but the output for n=4 is 2.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is the floor of log2(n+1) or something similar.\n\nWait, wait. Let's try to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the sample outputs:\n\nn | output\n--- | ---\n2 →1\n3 →2\n4 →2\n10→4\n\nWait, for n=10, output is 4.\n\nWhat's 2^4 =16. 10 is less than that. Hmm, but maybe the pattern is the maximum number of games is the largest m such that 2^{m} <= n+1?\n\nWait, for n=2: 2+1=3, 2^1=2 <=3, m=1.\n\nn=3: 3+1=4, 2^2=4 <=4 → m=2.\n\nn=4: 4+1=5, 2^2=4 <=5 → m=2.\n\nn=10:10+1=11, 2^3=8<=11, 2^4=16>11. So m=3? But the output is 4.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m where the sum 1+2+...+m ≤n.\n\nWait, sum of 1 to m is m(m+1)/2.\n\nFor n=2: sum 1=1 ≤2 → m=1.\n\nn=3: sum 1+2=3 ≤3 → m=2.\n\nn=4: sum 1+2=3 ≤4 → m=2.\n\nn=10: sum 1+2+3+4=10 ≤10 → m=4.\n\nYes! That matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest m such that m(m+1)/2 ≤n.\n\nWait, let's test it with n=10: 4*5/2=10 ≤10 → yes, m=4.\n\nWhat about n=5: 1+2+3=6>5. So m would be 2, since 2*3/2=3≤5. So for n=5, the maximum is 2?\n\nBut let's see: can the winner play 3 games?\n\nWait, n=5.\n\nTo have 3 games, the sum 1+2+3=6 >5, which is larger than n. So it's impossible. So maximum is 3-1=2.\n\nWait, but wait: n=5 is 5 players. How can the winner play 3 games?\n\nHmm, maybe it's possible. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the winner has to play 3 games. Each game requires that the opponent has a game count differing by at most one.\n\nSo, first game: opponent has 0 games. So that's okay.\n\nSecond game: opponent must have 1 or 0 games. If they have 0, then the winner has 1.\n\nThird game: opponent must have 1 or 2.\n\nWait, but the opponent could be someone who has already played 1 game.\n\nSo, the structure could be:\n\nGame 1: W vs A (W wins, A is eliminated)\nGame 2: W vs B (B has 0 games before this, since B could have been waiting in the next round)\nWait, but after game 1, W has 1 game, so in game 2, B must have 0 or 1 games. So if B has 0, that's okay.\n\nThen, game 3: W vs C (C has 0 games, so allowed.)\n\nSo total 3 games.\n\nBut wait, how many players are required for this?\n\nIn each game, the winner progresses. So for 3 games, the winner needs to beat 3 opponents.\n\nEach opponent could have played 0, 0, and 0 games respectively.\n\nSo total players needed: 1 (winner) +3 (opponents) =4.\n\nWait, but n=5 is 5 players, so maybe it's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. So the sum idea may not hold.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum number of games is the largest m where the sum from 1 to m is ≤n.\n\nBut in the case of n=5, the sum up to m=3 is 6>5, so m=2.\n\nBut can the winner play 2 games? Yes, but perhaps even 3.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nWait, the sum of 1+2+3=6>5, so it's impossible. So the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, but maybe the arrangement is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m where 2^m -1 ≤n.\n\nWait, for n=2: 2^1-1=1 ≤2 → m=1.\n\nn=3: 2^2-1=3 ≤3 → m=2.\n\nn=4: 2^3-1=7>4 → m=2 (since 2^2-1=3 ≤4).\n\nWait, but n=4's output is 2, which fits.\n\nn=10: 2^4-1=15>10 → m=3 since 2^3-1=7 ≤10.\n\nBut the sample output is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nSo perhaps that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should model the problem differently.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have either 0,1, or 2 games played before that match.\n\nWait, because in the prior step, the opponent could have played one or zero games.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to finding a path where each step increases the game count by 1, but you can't have more than one difference.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m such that the sum 1+2+...+m ≤n.\n\nBut when n=5, 1+2+3=6>5. So m=2.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the winner can have 2 games, but can we get 3?\n\nHmm, maybe I should think of it as the maximum possible is the floor of log2(2n) or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about how the tournament can be structured.\n\nThe winner must play in each round until they win all their matches. Each time they play, their opponent must have a game count that's either equal to theirs or one less.\n\nSo for the winner to have m games, they must have beaten m opponents, each of whom has played 0, 1, ..., m-1 games.\n\nWait, but that might not be necessary. Because, for example, in the second game of the winner, their opponent could have played one game, meaning they had a prior game.\n\nSo the winner's m-th game opponent could have played m-1 games.\n\nSo the total number of players needed is 1 (winner) + sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (number of players in each game for each opponent). \n\nWait, no, because each opponent can have their own path leading up to the game.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of players required for the winner to have m games is 2^m -1.\n\nBecause in a binary tournament bracket, you need 2^m -1 players to have a path where each game is against an opponent who has exactly one fewer game.\n\nWait, for example, m=1: 1 player (winner) + 1 opponent → 2 players. 2^1=2, but 2-1=1.\n\nWait, 2^m -1 is 1 for m=1.\n\nWait, for m=2: 2^2-1=3 players. So the winner plays two games, each against an opponent who has played 0 games.\n\nWait, but in the sample input n=3, the output is 2. So yes, that works.\n\nWait, for m=3: 2^3-1=7 players.\n\nSo for n=7, the output is 3.\n\nWait, but according to the initial sum approach, for n=7, 1+2+3=6 ≤7 → m=3. So both approaches agree.\n\nBut for n=4, the sum approach gives m=2, but 2^3-1=7>4. So the sum approach gives m=2, which matches the sample.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for n=5, the maximum games is 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let me re-examine.\n\nIf the maximum number of games is m, then the minimal number of players required is 2^m -1.\n\nSo for m=3, 7 players are needed.\n\nSo for n=5, since 5<7, m can't be 3. So the maximum is m=2.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nIs there a way for the winner to play 3 games when n=5?\n\nThe winner's first game: opponent has 0 games.\n\nSecond game: opponent has 1 game.\n\nThird game: opponent has 2 games.\n\nBut wait, in the second game, the opponent has 1 game, which implies that the opponent has already won once. So that opponent must have come from a game where they had 0 games.\n\nSo the third game requires that the opponent has 2 games, which implies that they have played two matches, each time facing opponents with 0 and 1 games.\n\nSo the total players needed would be:\n\nWinner (has 3 games) → 3 opponents.\n\nEach of these opponents have their own paths.\n\nOpponent 1: 0 → plays against someone with 0, loses.\n\nOpponent 2: 1 → must have played against someone with 0, then lost to the winner.\n\nOpponent 3: 2 → played two games. Their first opponent has 0, their second opponent has 1.\n\nSo for opponent 3, their path is:\n\nGame 1: vs X (X has 0 games) → X is eliminated.\n\nGame 2: vs Y (Y has 1 game) → Y is eliminated.\n\nSo opponents 3 requires two players (X and Y) plus themselves.\n\nSo overall, the winner needs:\n\n- 3 opponents (A, B, C).\n\nA: played 0 games.\n\nB: played 1 game (vs someone else).\n\nC: played 2 games (vs someone, then vs someone else).\n\nAnd for C's games:\n\nPlayer C's first game: vs D (D has 0 games).\n\nPlayer C's second game: vs E (E has 1 game).\n\nSo now, the total players are:\n\nWinner (W), A, B, C, D, E.\n\nTotal 6 players.\n\nBut n=5 is 5 players. So it's not possible.\n\nThus, for n=5, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the sum approach seems to give the correct answer.\n\nSo the problem is to find the largest m where m(m+1)/2 ≤n.\n\nSo the approach is: compute the maximum m such that m(m+1)/2 ≤n.\n\nSo, for a given n, find m.\n\nHow to compute m?\n\nWe can solve the quadratic equation m² + m - 2n ≤0.\n\nThe positive root is [-1 + sqrt(1 +8n)] / 2.\n\nTake the floor of that value.\n\nSo for n=10:\n\nsqrt(81) =9 → (9-1)/2=4.\n\nSo m=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nFor n=5:\n\nsqrt(41)=~6.4 → (6.4-1)/2= ~2.7 → floor is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the plan is to compute m as the integer part of (sqrt(8n +1) -1)/2.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the input n.\n\n2. Compute m as the floor of (sqrt(8n +1) -1)/2.\n\n3. Output m.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting:\n\nSample Input 2: n=2 → (sqrt(17)-1)/2 ≈ (4.123-1)/2≈1.56 → floor 1.\n\nSample Input 3: n=3 → (sqrt(25)-1)/2= (5-1)/2=2.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4 → (sqrt(33)-1)/2≈(5.744-1)/2≈2.37→2.\n\nSample Input 10: (sqrt(81)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4.\n\nYes, all samples pass.\n\nWhat about n=1? Well, the constraints say n≥2, so no problem.\n\nWhat about n=6?\n\nCompute m: 8*6+1=49 → sqrt(49)=7 → (7-1)/2=3.\n\nSum 1+2+3=6 ≤6. So m=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nWe can read n as integer, compute m using the formula, and print m.\n\nBut wait, due to floating point precision issues, perhaps it's better to compute m via a loop.\n\nAlternatively, in Python, using math.sqrt.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nm = (math.sqrt(8*n +1) -1)//2\nprint(m)\n\nWait, but wait: for n=10, 8n+1=81, sqrt is 9, 9-1=8, divided by 2 is 4. So correct.\n\nBut what about when 8n+1 is a perfect square, like n=3: 8*3+1=25, sqrt is 5. (5-1)/2=2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example, n=6: 49, 7-1=6, /2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the final code is as above.\n",
