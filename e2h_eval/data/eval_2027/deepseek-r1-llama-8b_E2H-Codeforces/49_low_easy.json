They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about reconstructing the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on some given roads. Each road has two numbers: the GCD and LCM of the two lawns it connects. My task is to determine if there's a possible arrangement of the mushroom counts that satisfies all these roads, and if so, output any one such arrangement.\n\nHmm. So the input gives me n lawns and m roads. Each road is between two lawns, say u and v, and has GCD(g) and LCM(l). The constraints are that for each pair u-v, the GCD of their mushroom counts must be g, and their LCM must be l.\n\nWait, but what's the relationship between GCD and LCM? Oh right, for any two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So if I know the GCD and LCM for a pair, I can compute a and b up to a multiple. Because if a and b are in terms of their product, then a = (g * k), b = (g * l /k), where k is such that g*k and g*l/k are co-prime. Or maybe I should think in terms of ratios.\n\nWait, more accurately, let's say the two numbers are x and y. Then GCD(x,y) = g and LCM(x,y) = l. Since g divides both x and y, we can write x = g * a, y = g * b, where a and b are coprime integers. Then, LCM(x,y) = g * a * b. So l = g * a * b. Therefore, a * b = l / g.\n\nSo for each edge, the pair (x,y) must satisfy x = g*a, y = g*b, with a*b = l/g. Also, since a and b must be coprime, because otherwise, the GCD could be higher.\n\nBut wait, wait. Because if a and b are not coprime, then the GCD of x and y would be g * d, where d is the GCD of a and b. That would mean that the given GCD is larger than what's computed from the provided g. So the given GCD must indeed be the actual GCD, which implies that a and b are coprime.\n\nSo for each edge, the possible values of x and y must be multiples of g, and when divided by g, they must multiply to l/g, and be coprime.\n\nHmm, so for each edge, the possible pairs (x, y) are multiples of g, such that (x/g) and (y/g) are coprime, and their product is l/g.\n\nSo, the approach is to model this as a graph where each node's value must satisfy certain constraints with its neighbors.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled using a system of equations or constraints, and solved with some form of Union-Find structure or BFS/DFS with constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a system where each variable (the mushroom count for a lawn) can be expressed in terms of others, and then check for consistency.\n\nWait, another thought: each edge gives us a constraint between two variables. For example, if the edge is between u and v, then the values x_u and x_v must satisfy x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, where a*b = l/g and GCD(a,b)=1.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to assign each variable a value, and then for each edge, enforce the constraints on the connected variables.\n\nBut how do we manage this? It seems like a problem that can be approached with a BFS or DFS, assigning values as we go and checking for consistency.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. We can represent the problem as a graph where each node is a lawn, and edges have the constraints as discussed.\n2. We need to assign a value to each node such that all edges' constraints are satisfied.\n3. This looks similar to a problem where variables are connected by equations, and we need to find consistent assignments.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this using a BFS approach where we process nodes and assign values based on the constraints, ensuring that each new assignment doesn't conflict with existing ones.\n\nLet's outline the approach:\n\n- For each node, we can track its current assigned value. Initially, all are unknown.\n- For each edge, we can see if the two nodes have been assigned values, and check if those values satisfy the edge's GCD and LCM. If not, the configuration is impossible.\n- If one of the nodes is unassigned, we can try to assign a value based on the other node and the edge's constraints.\n- However, since edges can form",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to reconstruct the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on given roads and their respective GCD and LCM values. If possible, we should output any valid arrangement; otherwise, we should indicate that it's not possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each node is a lawn and each edge has constraints (GCD and LCM) between two nodes.\n2. **Constraints Analysis**: For each edge between nodes u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we know that the product of the values at u and v must be equal to g * l. This can be broken down into possible pairs (a, b) such that a * b = l/g and GCD(a, b) = 1.\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to explore possible values for each node starting from an unassigned node. For each edge, check if the current assignments satisfy the constraints. If they do, continue; otherwise, backtrack and try different values.\n4. **Union-Find with Constraints**: Use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of connected components and ensure that all constraints within a component are satisfied without conflicts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[ptr])-1  # Convert to 0-based index\n        ptr +=1\n        v = int(input[ptr])-1\n        ptr +=1\n        g = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        edges.append( (u, v, g, l) )\n\n    # We'll represent the graph as a dictionary where each node points to its adjacent edges\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for u, v, g, l in edges:\n        graph[u].append( (v, g, l) )\n        graph[v].append( (u, g, l) )\n\n    value = [None] * n\n    possible = True\n\n    # Try to assign values using BFS\n    for start in range(n):\n        if value[start] is None:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(start)\n            value[start] = 0  # Placeholder; will be filled during BFS\n\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                for (v, g, l) in graph[u]:\n                    if value[v] is None:\n                        # Compute possible a and b\n                        product = l // g\n                        if product == 0:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n                        # Find all possible (a, b) pairs such that a*b=product and GCD(a,b)=1\n                        factors = []\n                        for a in range(1, int(product**0.5)+1):\n                            if product % a == 0:\n                                b = product // a\n                                if math.gcd(a, b) == 1:\n                                    factors.append( (a, b) )\n                        if not factors:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n                        # Assign a and b\n                        for a, b in factors:\n                            if value[v] == 0:\n                                value[v] = g * a\n                                # Also, check if the other direction works\n                                # Because x_u = g*a and x_v = g*b, then from u's perspective, v must have x_v = g*b'\n                                # So when u was processed, it would have assigned x_u = g*a, so v must have x_v = g*b' where a*b' = l/g\n                                # Wait, no, because for the edge u-v, it's the same edge, so a*b = l/g and a and b are coprime.\n                                # So for the reverse, if u's value is known, then v's value must be g*b where b = (l/g)/a, but only if a and b are coprimes.\n                                # So perhaps when processing u, we can find possible v's value.\n                                # But since we're processing in BFS, maybe it's better to handle this when both are unassigned.\n                                # Alternatively, when one is assigned, compute possible value for the other.\n                                # Let's proceed as follows: when processing u, and v is unassigned, try all possible a and b, assign v's value, and see if it works with u's value.\n                                # Then, process v similarly.\n\n                                # Now, check if the assignment is consistent with u's value\n                                # From u's perspective: x_u = g * a', x_v = g * b', and a'*b' = l/g\n                                # Since x_u is known as g*a, then a' must be a, and b' must be b.\n                                # So, if u's value is already set, then v's value must be g * (l/g / a)\n                                # So let's compute what v's value should be based on u's value.\n                                # So, if value[u] is set, then we can compute what value[v] should be.\n                                # Otherwise, when we assign value[v], we have to make sure that when we process u, it can also be assigned consistently.\n                                # Hmm, this seems a bit tangled.\n\n                                # Alternative approach: When processing u, for each edge (u, v), if v is unassigned, assign it a possible value and proceed.
