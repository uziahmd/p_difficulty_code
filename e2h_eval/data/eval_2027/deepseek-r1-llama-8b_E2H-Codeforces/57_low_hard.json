His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have in an Olympiad based on his total points. The teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x points. The input gives us two lists: one for the first tour scores and another for the second tour, but they're not sorted or linked to specific participants. Our task is to determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could achieve.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem: each participant has a score from the first tour and a score from the second tour. The sum of these two determines their rank. If two people have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order, which affects the rank. So, for the best rank, we want as few people as possible to have a higher sum than Vasya's. For the worst rank, we want as many people as possible to have a higher sum than Vasya's.\n\nBut wait, since the sums are used to sort, the best possible rank is 1 if Vasya's sum is the maximum. But that's only possible if his sum is larger than all others. Similarly, the worst case is when as many as possible have a higher sum than him.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because the a_i and b_j are given in arbitrary order, and we don't know which a corresponds to which b.\n\nWait, the key point is that for each participant, their total is a[i] + b[j], but the a's and b's are given in arbitrary order. So for the best possible rank, we want to find the minimal number of participants whose a + b is greater than Vasya's possible sum. And for the worst, the maximal number.\n\nBut since the a's and b's are separate, it's tricky because the pairing between a and b determines the other participants' sums.\n\nSo, the approach might be:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. Because Vasya could have any such pair as his own.\n\n2. For each possible pair (i,j), compute the sum s = a_i + b_j. Then, compute the best and worst possible ranks based on this s.\n\nWait, but this could be computationally expensive if n is large. However, n is up to 105, so trying all possible i and j (105*105=11025 options) is manageable.\n\nFor each possible pair (i,j):\n\n- Calculate s = a[i] + b[j]. \n\nThen, for this s, compute how many participants have a sum greater than s, and how many have equal to s. \n\nThe best possible rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > s. Because if Vasya's sum is s, then those with higher sums come before him, and those with equal can be either above or below.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum is used to sort in descending order. So, participants are arranged from highest sum to lowest. Those with the same sum can be ordered arbitrarily. So, in the best case, Vasya is placed as high as possible among those with sum s. So, for best rank, the number of participants with sum > s is the number of people ahead of him. His best rank is 1 plus that number, because he can be placed just after them. But for worst case, all participants with sum > s come before him, and within those with sum s, he is placed last. So, in that case, his rank is (number of people with sum > s) + (number of people with sum == s).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the rank is determined by the total sum. So for the best possible rank, Vasya is considered as the top of those with sum s. So, the number of participants with sum > s is the number of people above him. So his best possible rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum > s). Because all those people are definitely above him.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, all participants with sum > s come before him, and all participants with sum == s can also be placed before him. So, the worst possible rank is (number of participants with sum > s) + (number of participants with sum == s).\n\nSo, for each possible s (which is a_i + b_j, where s >=x), we calculate:\n\nbest_rank = 1 + (number of participants with sum > s)\nworst_rank = (number of participants with sum > s) + (number of participants with sum == s)\n\nThen, among all possible s (all a_i + b_j >=x), find the minimum best_rank and the maximum worst_rank.\n\nWait, but why is that? Because for each possible s, we can compute",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points. The problem involves analyzing two lists of scores from two different tours, where each participant's total score is the sum of their scores from both tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Each participant has scores from two tours. The total score is the sum of these two scores. The goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can achieve given that his total score is at least `x`.\n\n2. **Generate Possible Scores**: For each participant, compute all possible sums of their scores from the two tours. These sums represent potential total scores for Vasya.\n\n3. **Calculate Ranks for Each Potential Score**:\n   - **Best Rank**: For each potential total score, calculate how many participants have a higher score than Vasya. The best rank is 1 plus this count.\n   - **Worst Rank**: For each potential total score, calculate how many participants have a higher score and how many have the same score as Vasya. The worst rank is the sum of these counts.\n\n4. **Determine Optimal Ranks**: Track the minimum best rank and maximum worst rank across all possible total scores that meet or exceed `x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Generate all possible pairs (i,j) where i is index in a and j in b\nall_pairs = itertools.product(range(n), range(n))\n\nbest_rank_min = float('inf')\nworst_rank_max = -float('inf')\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        s = a[i] + b[j]\n        if s < x:\n            continue  # Skip since Vasya's total must be >=x\n        # Calculate number of participants with sum > s\n        greater = 0\n        equal = 0\n        for k in range(n):\n            sa = a[k] + b[k]\n            if sa > s:\n                greater += 1\n            elif sa == s:\n                equal += 1\n        # Best rank scenario: as few people as possible above him\n        best_rank = 1 + greater\n        # Worst rank scenario: as many as possible above and equal\n        worst_rank = greater + equal\n        # Update the min and max\n        if best_rank < best_rank_min:\n            best_rank_min = best_rank\n        if worst_rank > worst_rank_max:\n            worst_rank_max = worst_rank\n\nprint(f\"{best_rank_min} {worst_rank_max}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Generating Pairs**: We consider all possible pairs of indices from the two lists of scores to form potential total scores for Vasya.\n- **Rank Calculation**: For each potential total score, we determine how many participants have higher scores (contributing to Vasya's best rank) and how many have the same score (contributing to Vasya's worst rank).\n- **Optimal Ranks**: By iterating through all possible scores, we keep track of the minimum best rank and maximum worst rank, ensuring we find the optimal possible positions for Vasya.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures we consider all possible scenarios to determine the best and worst ranks accurately.",
