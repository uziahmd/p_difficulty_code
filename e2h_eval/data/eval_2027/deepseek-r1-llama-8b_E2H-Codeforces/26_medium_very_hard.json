    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, z. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is: Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. The triangle is non-degenerate if x + y > z.\n\nHmm, so the conditions are:\n\n1. x is between A and B (inclusive)\n2. y is between B and C (inclusive), but also y >= x because x ≤ B ≤ y.\n3. z is between C and D (inclusive), but also z >= y because y ≤ C ≤ z.\n4. Also, the triangle inequality must hold: x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait—since the triangle is non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. However, since z is the largest side (because x <= y <= z), it's sufficient to check x + y > z. Because if that's true, then x + z > y and y + z > x will automatically hold since z is larger than or equal to y and x.\n\nSo the key condition is x + y > z.\n\nNow, the problem is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) that satisfy these constraints.\n\nBut considering the ranges, especially since A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, we need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all possibilities, which would be too slow.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, note that for each x in [A, B], y must be in [max(x, B), C], and z must be in [max(y, C), D]. But since y ≥ B, and z ≥ C, so the lower bounds for y and z are straightforward.\n\nWait, actually, since x can be up to B, and y is at least B, but since x ≤ B and y >= B, then y can start from B, but wait no: x is ≤ B, but y is >= B because x ≤ B ≤ y. So for a given x, y can range from max(B, x) to C. But since x is at most B, max(B, x) is just B. So for a given x, y starts at B and goes up to C.\n\nSimilarly, z starts at C and goes up to D.\n\nBut then, for each x and y, z can be as small as C, but as large as min(D, x + y - 1). Because z has to be less than x + y.\n\nWait, but z must also be at least y, because y ≤ C ≤ z. So z is in [y, D], but also z < x + y.\n\nSo for each (x, y), the valid z's are those that are in [max(y, x + y - 1)]... Wait, no. Wait, z must be >= y and <= D, and also z < x + y.\n\nSo the upper limit is min(D, x + y - 1). And the lower limit is y, since z >= y.\n\nSo the number of z's for each (x, y) is the count of integers z where y ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nBut wait, if min(D, x + y - 1) is less than y, then there are zero z's for this (x, y). Otherwise, it's the difference plus one.\n\nWait, let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, provided a ≤ b. If a > b, then zero.\n\nSo for each (x, y), the number of z's is:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - y + 1) = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - y + 1)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - y + 1) \n\n= max(0, min(D, x + y -1 - y +1)) \nWait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, min(D, x + y - 1) could be either D or x + y -1, whichever is smaller.\n\nIf x + y -1 >= D, then z can be up to D, and the count is D - y + 1.\n\nElse, z can be up to x + y -1, so the count is (x + y -1) - y + 1 = x.\n\nSo, count_z is:\n\nif x + y - 1 >= D:\n    count_z = D - y + 1\nelse:\n    count_z = x\n\nBut wait, what if x + y -1 < y? Then, since z must be >= y, but x + y -1 is less than y, that implies x + y -1 < y → x -1 < 0 → x < 1. But x is at least A, which is >=1. So x can't be less than 1. So x is at least 1, so x + y -1 >= y when x >= 2?\n\nWait, x + y -1 >= y → x >= 1. Which is always true.\n\nSo, for any x >=1 and y >= B (which is at least A, which is >=1), x + y -1 >= y.\n\nWait, yes, because x >=1. So x + y -1 = y + (x-1) >= y.\n\nThus, for any x >=1 and y >= B >=1, x + y -1 >= y.\n\nSo, the lower bound for z is y, and the upper bound is the minimum of D and x+y-1.\n\nTherefore, for each (x, y), the number of z's is:\n\nz_max = min(D, x + y - 1)\ncount_z = z_max - y + 1\n\nBut only if z_max >= y. Else, count_z is zero.\n\nWait, but since x >=1, x + y -1 >= y, so z_max >= y.\n\nSo for any (x, y), z_max >= y.\n\nSo count_z is always z_max - y + 1.\n\nBut z_max can't exceed D.\n\nSo, the formula for count_z is:\n\ncount_z = min(D, x + y - 1) - y + 1 = min(D, x + y -1) - y + 1.\n\nWhich is same as:\n\nif x + y -1 <= D:\n    count_z = x\nelse:\n    count_z = D - y + 1\n\nBecause:\n\nmin(D, x + y -1) - y +1 = [if x + y -1 <= D] → (x + y -1 - y +1) = x. Else, (D - y +1).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], and for each y in [B, C], we calculate count_z and add it to the total.\n\nThe problem is that the constraints are up to 5e5, and if we loop through all x and y, it would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)), which can be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too much for Python; it's impossible to process in time.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the key is to find a way to compute the sum over x and y of count_z without iterating each pair.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nLet me denote the variables:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], and y in [B, C], the count_z is:\n\nif x + y -1 <= D:\n    count_z = x\nelse:\n    count_z = D - y + 1\n\nBut since D can be up to 5e5, and x and y can be up to that, perhaps we can find a way to partition the x and y into regions where the condition x + y -1 <= D holds, and where it doesn't.\n\nSo, for a given x, y can vary from B to C.\n\nWe can find for each x, the range of y where x + y -1 <= D. Let's call this y_low and y_high.\n\nWait, solving for y:\n\nx + y -1 <= D → y <= D - x + 1.\n\nSo for a given x, y can be up to min(C, D - x + 1).\n\nWait, but y has to be at least B and at most C. So for each x, the maximum y that satisfies x + y -1 <= D is y_max1 = min(C, D - x + 1). And the minimum y is B.\n\nSo for each x, the y values that satisfy the condition x + y -1 <= D are y in [B, y_max1].\n\nIn this case, count_z is x for each such y.\n\nFor the remaining y's (from y_max1 + 1 to C), the count_z is (D - y + 1).\n\nSo for each x, the total contribution is:\n\nsum_{y=B}^{y_max1} x + sum_{y=y_max1+1}^{C} (D - y + 1)\n\nWhere y_max1 is min(C, D - x + 1).\n\nBut if D - x + 1 < B, then y_max1 is less than B, so there are no y's in that region, and all y's are in the second region.\n\nSimilarly, if D - x + 1 >= C, then all y's are in the first region.\n\nSo, let's formalize this.\n\nFor each x in [A, B], compute:\n\ny_max1 = min(C, D - x + 1)\n\nif y_max1 < B:\n\n   then all y in [B, C] fall into the second region.\n\nelse:\n\n   split into two parts: y in [B, y_max1] (first region) and y in [y_max1+1, C] (second region)\n\nSo, for each x, the total contribution is:\n\nif y_max1 < B:\n\n   sum_second_region = sum_{y=B}^C (D - y + 1)\n\nelse:\n\n   sum_first_region = x * (y_max1 - B + 1)\n\n   sum_second_region = sum_{y=y_max1+1}^C (D - y + 1)\n\nThen, the total for x is sum_first_region + sum_second_region.\n\nBut even this approach, if we have to process each x in [A, B], which can be up to 5e5, and for each x do some calculations, it may be manageable if the per-x processing is O(1). Because 5e5 is manageable for Python.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   For each x, compute y_max1 = min(C, D - x + 1)\n\n   if y_max1 < B:\n\n      All y in [B, C] are in the second region.\n\n      So the contribution is sum from y=B to C of (D - y + 1)\n\n      How to compute this sum?\n\n      It's an arithmetic series.\n\n      The number of terms is C - B + 1.\n\n      The first term when y=B: D - B + 1.\n\n      The last term when y=C: D - C + 1.\n\n      So sum_second = (number_of_terms) * (first + last) / 2\n\n      But if D - C + 1 is negative, then the sum is zero.\n\n      Wait, but if D < y_min, then D - y + 1 could be negative, meaning that for some y, (D - y + 1) is negative. But in that case, since z must be >= y, but D - y +1 < y → D < y -1 +1 → D < y.\n\n      So if D < y, then D - y +1 is <= 0, which means no z exists for that y. So in that case, the contribution for that y is zero.\n\n      So, for the sum, we need to compute the sum of (D - y +1) for y in [B, C], but only when D - y +1 >= 0.\n\n      Wait, but in the condition where y_max1 is less than B, that means for all y >= B, D - y +1 < x + something? Or more accurately, for all y in [B, C], x + y -1 > D → so z can't be less than x + y -1, but z can't exceed D. So for these y, z can be at most D, but since x + y -1 > D, then z can be up to D, but that's still >= y.\n\n      So, for these y, count_z is D - y + 1, but only if D >= y.\n\n      Wait, no: because z must be >= y and <= D. So if D < y, then no z exists. So for each y, if D < y, count_z is zero.\n\n      So the sum should consider only y where D >= y.\n\n      So for each x, when y_max1 < B, the sum is sum_{y=B}^C max(0, D - y + 1).\n\n      Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the range of y where D - y + 1 >= 0 → y <= D +1.\n\nBut since y is at most C, which is <= D, this is always true. Because y <= D.\n\nSo, for any y in [B, C], D - y +1 >= 1? No, wait:\n\ny can be up to C, which is <= D. So D - y +1 >= D - D +1 = 1 >=1. So yes, D - y +1 >=1 for y <= D.\n\nWait, no. Suppose y = D, then D - y +1 = 1. If y = D+1, but y can't be more than C, which is <= D.\n\nSo for any y in [B, C], D - y +1 is >= 1.\n\nWait, no: suppose y = D, then D - y +1 = 1.\n\nIf y is larger than D, but in our case y can't be larger than C, which is <= D. So y is <= D.\n\nSo for all y in [B, C], D - y +1 >= 0.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ny can be as big as C, which is <= D.\n\nSo D - y +1 >= D - D +1 = 1 >=0.\n\nSo yes, for all y in [B, C], D - y +1 is >= 1.\n\nThus, when y_max1 < B, the contribution for x is sum_{y=B}^C (D - y + 1).\n\nWhich is an arithmetic series.\n\nThe sum is equal to (C - B + 1) * ( (D - B + 1) + (D - C + 1) ) / 2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nsum_second = (C - B + 1) * (2*(D - (B + C)/2 + 1 )) / 2 ?\n\nWait, no, the arithmetic series sum is n*(a1 + an)/2, where n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, a1 = D - B + 1, an = D - C + 1.\n\nSo sum_second = (C - B + 1) * ( (D - B + 1) + (D - C + 1) ) // 2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nsum_second = (C - B + 1) * (2D - B - C + 2) // 2.\n\nWhich can be written as (C - B + 1) * (2D - B - C + 2) // 2.\n\nBut we have to make sure that 2D - B - C + 2 is positive.\n\nWait, but 2D - B - C + 2 could be negative if D is very small. But in that case, the sum is zero.\n\nWait, no. Because when y_max1 < B, it implies that for all y >= B, x + y -1 > D. So, for each y in [B, C], x + y -1 > D → x + y > D + 1.\n\nBut since x >= A >=1, and y >= B >= x (since x <= B and y >= B).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nSo, for each x, compute the sum over y in [B, C] of count_z for each y.\n\nBut count_z is:\n\nif x + y -1 <= D → count_z = x.\n\nelse → count_z = D - y + 1.\n\nSo, the sum is sum_{y=B}^C [x if x + y -1 <= D else (D - y + 1)].\n\nBut this can be rewritten as x * (number of y's where x + y -1 <= D) + sum_{y in other region} (D - y +1).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each x:\n\n1. Compute the cutoff y value where x + y -1 = D → y = D - x + 1.\n\n2. Let y_max1 = min(C, D - x + 1).\n\n   So, for y <= y_max1: count_z is x.\n\n   For y > y_max1: count_z is D - y + 1.\n\n3. Now, if y_max1 < B, then all y are in the second region.\n\n   So, sum is sum_{y=B}^C (D - y + 1).\n\n4. Else, if y_max1 >= C, then all y are in the first region.\n\n   Sum is x multiplied by (C - B + 1).\n\n5. Else, split into two regions: y from B to y_max1, and y from y_max1+1 to C.\n\n   Sum is x*(y_max1 - B + 1) + sum_{y=y_max1+1}^C (D - y +1).\n\nSo, for each x, the sum is as above.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nCompute for each x in [A, B]:\n\n   y_max1 = min(C, D - x + 1)\n\n   if y_max1 < B:\n\n      sum_y = sum_{y=B}^C (D - y + 1) → arithmetic series.\n\n   elif y_max1 >= C:\n\n      sum_y = x * (C - B + 1)\n\n   else:\n\n      sum_part1 = x * (y_max1 - B + 1)\n\n      sum_part2 = sum_{y=y_max1+1}^C (D - y + 1)\n\n      sum_y = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nNow, the question is how to compute sum_part2.\n\nsum_part2 is the sum from y = s to e (s = y_max1 + 1, e = C) of (D - y + 1).\n\nThis is an arithmetic series starting at (D - s + 1) and ending at (D - e + 1), with (e - s + 1) terms.\n\nSo the sum is (number of terms) * (first + last) / 2.\n\nBut again, we have to handle cases where s > e, in which case sum_part2 is zero.\n\nSo, putting it all together, for each x, we can compute the sum quickly with these conditions.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute this for all x in [A, B], but in a way that's efficient.\n\nBut given that B can be up to 5e5, looping through each x is acceptable.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   Compute y_max1 = min(C, D - x + 1)\n\n   if y_max1 < B:\n\n      compute sum_second as the sum from B to C of (D - y + 1)\n\n   elif y_max1 >= C:\n\n      sum_y += x * (C - B + 1)\n\n   else:\n\n      compute sum_part1 = x * (y_max1 - B + 1)\n\n      compute s = y_max1 + 1\n\n      e = C\n\n      if s > e:\n\n          sum_part2 = 0\n\n      else:\n\n          first = D - s + 1\n\n          last = D - e + 1\n\n          num_terms = e - s + 1\n\n          sum_part2 = (num_terms * (first + last)) // 2\n\n      sum_y = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\n   Add sum_y to the total.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, the main issue is to compute sum_second correctly.\n\nLet me compute sum_second for the case where y_max1 < B.\n\nsum_second is sum_{y=B}^C (D - y + 1) = sum_{k = D - C + 1}^{D - B + 1} k\n\nWait, because when y increases by 1, D - y + 1 decreases by 1.\n\nSo, the terms form a decreasing sequence from (D - B + 1) down to (D - C + 1).\n\nSo, the sum is the sum of an arithmetic series from a to b, where a = D - B + 1, b = D - C + 1, and the number of terms is (C - B + 1).\n\nWait, wait, no. Because y runs from B to C, so for each y, D - y + 1 is D - B +1, D - (B+1)+1, ..., D - C +1.\n\nSo the series is D - B +1, D - (B+1)+1, ..., D - C +1.\n\nWhich is the same as (D - B +1) + (D - (B+1) +1) + ... + (D - C +1).\n\nThis is a sequence of (C - B + 1) terms, starting from (D - B +1) and decreasing by 1 each step until (D - C +1).\n\nSo, the sum is (C - B +1) * ( (D - B +1) + (D - C +1) ) / 2.\n\nWhich can be written as (C - B +1) * (2D - B - C + 2) / 2.\n\nBut we must ensure that the sum is non-negative.\n\nWait, 2D - B - C + 2 could be negative if D is very small.\n\nBut in that case, the individual terms might be negative, but earlier analysis showed that for y in [B, C], D >= y, so D - y +1 >= 1.\n\nWait, no: D - y +1 >= 1 because y <= D.\n\nSo, each term is >=1, so the sum is positive.\n\nSo, 2D - B - C + 2 can be negative only if D is small, but in that case, the terms would be negative, but that's impossible because D >= y >= B.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because D can be less than B, but in the problem statement, the constraints are A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So D is at least as big as C, which is >= B.\n\nSo, D is at least B.\n\nSo, D - B +1 >= 1.\n\nAnd for any y in [B, C], D - y +1 >= D - C +1 >= D - D +1 = 1.\n\nSo, all terms are >=1, so their sum is positive.\n\nThus, the formula for sum_second is safe.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code structure is:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the total as 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   y_max1 = min(C, D - x + 1)\n\n   if y_max1 < B:\n\n      # All y in [B, C] are in second region.\n\n      n = C - B + 1\n\n      a = D - B + 1\n\n      b = D - C + 1\n\n      sum_second = n * (a + b) // 2\n\n      total += sum_second\n\n   elif y_max1 >= C:\n\n      # All y in [B, C] are in first region.\n\n      n = C - B + 1\n\n      sum_first = x * n\n\n      total += sum_first\n\n   else:\n\n      # Split into two regions.\n\n      part1 = x * (y_max1 - B + 1)\n\n      s = y_max1 + 1\n\n      e = C\n\n      if s > e:\n\n          part2 = 0\n\n      else:\n\n          n = e - s + 1\n\n          a = D - s + 1\n\n          b = D - e + 1\n\n          part2 = n * (a + b) // 2\n\n      total += part1 + part2\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, but what about when D - x + 1 is negative?\n\nNo, because x can be as big as B, and D >= C >= B.\n\nSo D - x +1 >= D - B +1 >= 1.\n\nBecause D >= B, so D - B +1 >=1.\n\nSo y_max1 is at least 1, but could be less than B.\n\nSo, for example, if D - x +1 < B, then y_max1 is less than B.\n\nSo, the code handles that.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nLet's compute for each x:\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nCase x=1:\n\ny_max1 = min(3, 4 -1 +1) = min(3, 4) → 3.\n\nSince y_max1=3 >= B=2.\n\nSo, split into two regions.\n\nPart1: x * (3 -2 +1) = 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nPart2: s=4, e=3 → s>e, so part2=0.\n\nTotal for x=1: 2.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the count for x=1 is 1, because y=3 is the only option, and z can be 3 or 4, but wait, x=1, y=3: x + y =4 → z must be less than 4. But z can be at most min(4, 3) → 3.\n\nWait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, in the sample, when x=1 and y=3:\n\nz can be from 3 to min(4, 1+3-1=3). So z can be 3 only.\n\nSo count_z is 1.\n\nBut according to the code:\n\nFor x=1, y_max1=3.\n\nSo for y in [2,3], all are in first region.\n\nSo part1 is x*(3-2+1) = 1*2=2.\n\nWhich suggests that for x=1, the sum is 2.\n\nBut in reality, for y=2 and y=3:\n\ny=2: x=1, y=2. x + y -1 =2 <=4 → count_z=1.\n\ny=3: x=1, y=3. x + y -1=3 <=4 → count_z=1.\n\nSo sum for x=1 is 1+1=2. But according to the sample, x=1 contributes 1 triangle.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample says that the triangles are (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). So for x=1, there is one triangle: (1,3,3).\n\nBut according to the code, for x=1, sum is 2, which suggests two triangles. So something is wrong.\n\nAh, I see! Because in the code, for x=1 and y=2, the count_z is x=1, but z can be 2 or higher.\n\nWait, wait: for x=1, y=2.\n\nz can be from 2 to min(4, 1+2-1=2). So z can only be 2.\n\nSo count_z is 1.\n\nSimilarly for y=3, z can be 3 → count_z=1.\n\nSo total is 2.\n\nBut according to the sample, x=1 contributes one triangle: (1,3,3).\n\nBut why isn't (1,2,2) considered a triangle?\n\nBecause x=1, y=2, z=2.\n\nCheck x + y > z: 1+2=3>2 → yes, it is a triangle.\n\nSo why isn't it counted in the sample?\n\nLooking back at the sample explanation: the first example lists four triangles, including (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). So (1,2,2) is not listed.\n\nWait, that's strange. Because according to the problem statement, x can be 1, y can be 2, z can be 2. So it's a valid triangle.\n\nBut in the sample output, it's not counted. So why?\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1 is '1 2 3 4'.\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nSo x can be 1 or 2.\n\ny can be 2 or 3.\n\nz can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo, for x=1, y=2:\n\nz must be >= y=2 and <= min(D=4, x+y-1=1+2-1=2). So z can be 2.\n\nSo triangle (1,2,2): x=1, y=2, z=2.\n\nIs this a valid triangle?\n\nYes, because 1+2>2 → 3>2.\n\nSo why isn't it included in the sample output?\n\nWait, looking at the sample output, it's 4. So the sample counts four triangles, including (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4).\n\nSo why isn't (1,2,2) counted?\n\nAh! Because in the problem statement, the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D.\n\nSo x can be between A and B, inclusive. y can be between B and C, inclusive. z can be between C and D, inclusive.\n\nIn the case of x=1, y=2, z=2:\n\ny is 2, which is >= B=2, but z is 2, which is < C=3. So z is 2, which is less than C=3.\n\nBut in the problem statement, z must be >= C, because C <= D, and y <= C <= z.\n\nSo z must be >= C.\n\nAh! Oh right! So I completely missed that condition.\n\nSo z must be >= C.\n\nSo in the initial problem statement, the conditions are:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D.\n\nWhich implies that z >= C.\n\nSo for z, it's in [C, D].\n\nSo for the case x=1, y=2, z must be >=3 (since C=3). So z cannot be 2.\n\nSo that explains why (1,2,2) is not counted.\n\nSo my previous analysis was incorrect.\n\nThus, the condition for z is:\n\nz >= C, and z <= D.\n\nAnd, z < x + y.\n\nSo, in the code, the count_z is the number of integers z where:\n\nz >= C, z <= D, and z < x + y.\n\nSo, the lower bound for z is C, not y.\n\nSo, the correction is: for each (x, y), z can be in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\nThus, the count_z is max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y -1) >= C.\n\nElse, count_z is zero.\n\nWait, because z has to be >= C, and <= min(D, x + y -1).\n\nSo, for each (x, y):\n\nif x + y -1 < C → no z exists.\n\nElse, z can be from C to min(D, x + y -1).\n\nSo, the count is:\n\nz_upper = min(D, x + y -1)\n\nif z_upper < C → count_z = 0\n\nelse → count_z = z_upper - C + 1\n\nSo, this changes everything.\n\nThis is a critical mistake in my earlier approach.\n\nSo, the new condition is:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1)\n\nif min(D, x + y -1) >= C.\n\nElse, zero.\n\nSo, for each (x, y), the count_z is:\n\nz_min = C\n\nz_max = min(D, x + y -1)\n\nif z_max < z_min → 0\n\nelse → z_max - z_min + 1.\n\nSo, the formula for count_z is:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y -1) >= C else 0.\n\nSo, this is a significant change.\n\nThus, the earlier approach was wrong because I forgot that z must be >= C.\n\nSo, the problem requires that z >= C.\n\nSo, the steps now are:\n\nFor each (x, y), z must be >= C, and <= min(D, x + y -1).\n\nSo, for x and y, the count is:\n\nif x + y -1 < C → 0.\n\nElse:\n\nz_upper = min(D, x + y -1)\n\ncount_z = z_upper - C + 1.\n\nBut z_upper can't be less than C.\n\nSo, the count_z is max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).\n\nSo, the revised approach is:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], and y in [B, C]:\n\n   if x + y -1 < C:\n\n       count_z = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       z_upper = min(D, x + y -1)\n\n       count_z = z_upper - C + 1\n\nSo, the sum for each x is sum over y in [B, C] of count_z.\n\nThis is a major change, and I need to re-evaluate the approach.\n\nSo, now, the code must account for this.\n\nSo, for each x, the sum is sum_{y=B}^C [ if x + y -1 >= C → min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1 else 0 ].\n\nThis complicates the calculation.\n\nSo, the plan is to find for each x, the range of y where x + y -1 >= C. For those y, count_z is (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1). For others, count_z is zero.\n\nSo, for each x, the sum is:\n\nsum_{y in S} (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1), where S is the set of y in [B, C] where x + y -1 >= C.\n\nElse, 0.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the minimal y for which x + y -1 >= C.\n\nSolving for y:\n\ny >= C - x + 1.\n\nSo, the minimal y is y_min = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nBecause y has to be >= B.\n\nSo, for each x, the valid y's are in [y_min, C].\n\nFor each such y, count_z is min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1.\n\nSo, for each x:\n\n   y_min = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_min > C:\n\n       sum_y = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       for y in [y_min, C]:\n\n           if x + y -1 <= D:\n\n               count_z = x + y -1 - C + 1 = x + y - C\n\n           else:\n\n               count_z = D - C + 1\n\nSo, for y in [y_min, y_max1], where y_max1 = min(C, D - x + 1), count_z is (x + y - C) as long as y <= D - x +1.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nx + y -1 <= D → y <= D -x +1.\n\nSo, for y in [y_min, min(D - x +1, C)], count_z is (x + y - C).\n\nFor y in [min(D -x +1, C) + 1, C], count_z is (D - C +1).\n\nWait, no:\n\nIf y is in [y_min, y_max1], where y_max1 is min(D -x +1, C), then x + y -1 <= D → count_z is (x + y -1 - C +1) = x + y - C.\n\nIf y > y_max1, then x + y -1 > D → count_z is (D - C +1).\n\nBut y can't exceed C.\n\nSo, for each x:\n\ny_min = max(B, C - x +1)\n\ny_max1 = min(C, D - x +1)\n\nif y_min > C:\n\n   sum_y = 0\n\nelif y_max1 < y_min:\n\n   sum_y = 0\n\nelse:\n\n   sum_part1 is the sum for y in [y",
