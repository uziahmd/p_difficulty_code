The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of their fans is maximized. Each district i has 2^i fans. We need to remove exactly k districts, and after removing them, all the remaining should be reachable from each other, meaning they form a single connected tree.\n\nHmm. So the idea is to find the largest possible sum by choosing which k districts to remove. But wait, since removing a district disconnects its subtree, maybe we're looking for a way to split the tree into subtrees and choose the one with the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but the remaining districts must form a connected component. So perhaps the optimal solution is to find a subtree that includes as many high-value nodes as possible, and then remove the rest of the districts outside this subtree. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the minimum number of nodes to remove to keep the tree connected while maximizing the sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as finding a subtree where the sum of 2^i for all nodes in the subtree is as large as possible, and then the remaining nodes are those in this subtree. Wait, but the tree is connected, so the subtree itself is connected. So perhaps we can find the largest possible connected component after removing k nodes, and then select the best such component.\n\nBut how do we approach this? Let's think differently.\n\nEach node contributes 2^i to the total sum. So higher-numbered nodes contribute exponentially more. Therefore, to maximize the sum, we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut when we remove a node, all its children are disconnected if we don't include any part of their subtree. Wait, no: if you remove a node, you're cutting all connections from it to the rest of the tree. So the remaining tree will consist of the connected component that doesn't include this node.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the president wants to remove k contestants, and the remaining ones must form a connected component. So the strategy is to choose a connected subgraph (a tree) of the original tree, containing as many high-value nodes as possible, and then remove all the nodes not in this subgraph.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subtree S of the original tree, such that |S| = n - k, and the sum of 2^i for i in S is maximized. Then, the nodes to remove are those not in S.\n\nBut how do we find such a subtree S?\n\nWait, the original tree is connected. So any subtree S is also connected because it's a subset of a tree. So our goal is to find the subtree S with exactly m = n -k nodes, which has the maximum possible sum of 2^i for i in S.\n\nBecause higher-numbered nodes contribute more, the optimal S would include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the approach is to find a subtree that includes the highest possible numbers, preferably including the root or certain high nodes.\n\nWait, but in a tree, each node except the root has exactly one parent. So the structure is hierarchical.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by keeping a path that starts at some node and extends up to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, while ensuring that the size is m = n -k.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3. So m = 6-3=3.\n\nThe tree is built with edges:\n2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3.\n\nSo the structure is like this:\n\n2 is connected to 1,3,4,6. 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the nodes are arranged as 2 as the central node, with 1,3,4 as children, and 6 as another child which connects to 5.\n\nThe optimal selection is to remove 1,3,4. So the remaining nodes are 2,5,6.\n\nTheir sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32+64=100.\n\nIf instead, we kept 3 nodes including 6,5,2, that's same as above.\n\nWait, but why not keep 3,2,6,5? Their sum is 8+4+32+64=108, which is larger than 100. Oh, but that's 4 nodes, which is more than m=3. So no, can't do that.\n\nAh right, because m=3.\n\nSo the problem is to choose a subtree of size m that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the strategy is: find a subtree of size m that includes the largest possible 2^i terms.\n\nHow do we find such a subtree?\n\nIdea: Since each node's contribution is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, the optimal subtree is the one that includes as many as possible of the largest-numbered nodes.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain that includes the highest-numbered nodes, and as many as needed.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Sort all the nodes in decreasing order of their value (since higher i means higher 2^i).\n2. Find a path in the tree that includes the top m nodes in this sorted list, and forms a connected subtree.\n3. The nodes not in this subtree are the ones to remove.\n\nWait, but in a tree, any subtree is a connected acyclic graph. So the nodes selected must form a connected subtree.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to select the m highest-numbered nodes, arrange them in a path, and see if they form a connected subtree. If not, adjust accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For each node, calculate the number of descendants (including itself) in the subtree if we make it the root of a subtree. Then, find the subtree of size m that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the sum is based on 2^i, which is exponential, the best strategy is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So the optimal subtree S is the one that includes the top m nodes in the tree, arranged in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo perhaps the process is:\n\n- Identify the m nodes with the highest indices (since 2^i is higher for higher i).\n- Check if these m nodes form a connected subtree. If yes, then S is that set.\n- If not, find a way to connect them by adding lower-numbered nodes to form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but the tree is arbitrary. So perhaps the m highest nodes may not form a connected subtree.\n\nFor example, suppose the tree is a chain: 1-2-3-4-...-n. Then the m highest nodes will form a connected subtree.\n\nBut if the tree is more branched, perhaps the m highest nodes are spread out in different branches, making it impossible for them to form a connected subtree without including certain lower-numbered nodes.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a connected subtree that includes as many of the top m nodes as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, we can model this as finding a subtree that includes the top x nodes, where x is as large as possible, and the subtree is connected.\n\nWait, but x needs to be exactly m.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as trying to find a subtree S of size m, which is connected, and contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible. The sum is maximized when S includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nTherefore, the optimal S is the one that includes the maximum number of high-numbered nodes, and is connected.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. Compute for each node, the number of nodes in its subtree (including itself). This is done via a post-order traversal.\n\n2. Then, for each node, determine the maximum number of nodes in its subtree that can be included in the final S. We want as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe problem can be thought of as choosing a subtree S of size m, which is connected, and which includes the maximum possible sum of 2^i.\n\nSince 2^i is maximum for the largest i's, the strategy is to include as many of the largest i's as possible.\n\nThus, the optimal S is the subtree that consists of a path that starts from some node and goes up to include the largest possible nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal S is a path that starts from the highest-numbered node and includes as many as possible towards the root.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the tree structure.\n\nIn a tree, the subtree can be any connected subgraph. So, for example, a star-shaped tree: a central node connected to many leaves.\n\nIn such a case, the optimal S would include the central node plus as many leaves as possible.\n\nBut 2^i is higher for higher i. So leaves with higher indices are better.\n\nSo, in the star-shaped tree, the optimal S is to include the central node and the m-1 leaves with the highest indices.\n\nWait, but that depends on whether the central node is higher in index than the leaves.\n\nNo, wait, the central node has an index, say, c. The leaves have indices l_1, l_2, ..., l_k. If c is less than all l_i, then including c would allow us to include all l_i, but since c is in the subtree, that's allowed.\n\nWait, but in that case, the central node is part of the subtree, which allows all the leaves to be connected.\n\nSo, the sum would be 2^c plus the sum of the m-1 largest leaves.\n\nBut if c is larger than some of the leaves, then including c might exclude some leaves unless the subtree includes them.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal S is the subtree that includes a certain range of nodes, such as all nodes from a certain point up to the root.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The problem is similar to finding a subtree with exactly m nodes, connected, and with the maximum possible sum of 2^i.\n\nTo find such a subtree, perhaps we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) of the tree, starting from the highest-numbered node.\n\n2. At each step, decide whether to include a node in the current subtree. The aim is to collect as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but ensuring that the subtree remains connected.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to greedily include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So during the traversal, whenever we have space left in the subtree (we can still include more nodes), we include the next highest-numbered node, provided it can be part of a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, considering the tree is a general tree, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that includes the highest m nodes, but that's only possible if they lie along a single path.\n\nOtherwise, perhaps we need to find a way to connect the highest m nodes by including some connecting nodes.\n\nWait, but that might require including some lower-numbered nodes, which could reduce the total sum.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is to find a subtree that includes as many of the highest-numbered nodes as possible, possibly requiring to include some lower nodes to maintain connectivity.\n\nWait, but the trade-off is that including a lower-numbered node (which has a smaller 2^i) may allow us to include more higher-numbered nodes.\n\nThis seems complex.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to consider the following: the optimal subtree S must include all the highest (m) nodes in the tree. However, if these nodes cannot form a connected subtree, then S must include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes to include.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal S is the subtree that includes all the nodes with the highest (m) values, but if they are not connected, then find a way to connect them by including the minimal possible number of lower nodes.\n\nWait, but that's vague.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to realize that the problem is equivalent to finding a subtree of size m, which is connected, and whose sum of 2^i is maximum.\n\nSo the task is to find such a subtree.\n\nGiven that the sum is based on 2^i, the nodes' contributions are heavily weighted towards higher i.\n\nSo the optimal subtree is the one that includes as many high i as possible, regardless of their positions.\n\nBut the problem is to find the connected subtree.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Identify the m nodes with the highest i's. Let's call this set T.\n\n- Now, check if T is a connected subtree. If yes, then S = T.\n\n- If not, find a way to connect them by adding the minimal possible number of lower i nodes.\n\nBut even this approach may not directly work, as T may not be connected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal S is a subtree that includes all the nodes in T, plus a minimal number of other nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by finding the subtree that includes the m nodes with the highest 2^i, and then include any necessary nodes to form a connected subtree.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree.\n\nEach node has a parent (except the root). So the tree is a collection of nodes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\nThe subtree S must form a connected component. So all nodes in S must be reachable from each other via the original tree's paths.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to selecting a subtree S of size m, connected, and with maximum sum.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as finding the subtree S where the sum of 2^i is maximum among all possible connected subtrees of size m.\n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can use a priority queue approach, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a problem where for each node, we calculate the maximum number of nodes in its subtree, and the sum of 2^i for those nodes. Then, we can use a greedy approach to select the best possible subtree.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since each node's contribution is 2^i, which grows exponentially, the best strategy is to include as many of the highest-numbered nodes as possible, regardless of their position in the tree. So the optimal S is the largest possible subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the subtree that includes the m nodes with the highest i's and see if they form a connected component. If not, find a way to connect them by adding the minimal number of lower i nodes.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a subtree that includes a path that covers the highest possible nodes.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal S is the subtree rooted at the highest node, and includes all possible nodes in the direction of the highest possible path.\n\nAlternatively, think about the tree's structure.\n\nSuppose the tree is a straight line: 1-2-3-4-...-n.\n\nThen, the optimal S would be the last m nodes, which form a connected subtree.\n\nIn this case, the sum is 2^{n-m+1} + ... + 2^n.\n\nWhich is (2^{n-m+1} * (2^m - 1)).\n\nSo, the sum is maximized by including the highest m nodes.\n\nBut in a more complex tree, perhaps the optimal S is a subtree that includes a certain branch that has the highest nodes.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the node u, which is part of a subtree that includes as many of the top m nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal S is the subtree that includes a certain 'chain' of nodes, starting from the highest node and going down.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find the subtree that includes the m nodes with the highest 2^i, and then ensure that they are connected.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is as follows:\n\n1. Identify the m nodes with the highest 2^i values. These are the nodes with the highest i.\n\n2. Check if these m nodes form a connected subtree. If yes, then S is that set.\n\n3. If not, find the minimal number of additional nodes needed to connect them into a connected subtree. Then, add those to S.\n\nBut the problem is, how to find which additional nodes to include.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal S is the subtree that includes all the nodes in a path that starts at the highest node and goes down, collecting as many nodes as needed to reach m.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal S is the subtree that includes all the ancestors of some high nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: To find the subtree S, we can model it as a tree where the nodes are ordered such that the sum of their 2^i is maximized.\n\nThis can be approached by using a priority queue (max-heap) where we keep track of the current path.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to finding a tree with m nodes that has the maximum sum of node values, which is a known problem.\n\nWait, but in that problem, each node has a value, and the sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in the subtree. So perhaps the approach is similar.\n\nYes! That's the key.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree of size m, with the maximum sum of 2^i for all nodes in the subtree.\n\nThis is a classic problem. How is it solved?\n\nWell, for each node, we can compute the size of its subtree and the sum of 2^i for all nodes in its subtree. Then, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the best candidates.\n\nWait, but I'm not exactly sure.\n\nWait, here's an approach inspired by the maximum sum subtree problem:\n\n1. For each node, compute the sum of 2^i in its subtree (including itself) and the number of nodes in that subtree.\n\n2. Using a max-heap (priority queue), we can keep track of the current best subtree candidates.\n\n3. Initially, push all leaves into the heap, each with their own sum and size.\n\n4. Then, repeatedly extract the maximum sum subtree, and for each node in that subtree, check if adding the current node's parent to the subtree would increase the sum. If so, merge the two subtrees and update the heap.\n\nBut wait, this is for finding the maximum sum subtree of any size, which isn't directly applicable here since we need a fixed size m.\n\nHmm, that complicates things.\n\nSo perhaps, to adapt this approach for a fixed size m, we can proceed as follows:\n\n- We need to find a connected subtree of exactly m nodes with the maximum sum.\n\n- So, for each node, we can precompute the sizes of its subtree.\n\n- Then, for each possible subtree size m, we can find the maximum sum.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e6, we need an efficient way.\n\nWait, but in our problem, m is n -k, which is fixed once k is given.\n\nSo perhaps the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess the tree to compute for each node the size of its subtree and the sum of 2^i in its subtree.\n\n2. Use a priority queue (max-heap) that keeps track of the best subtrees for various sizes.\n\n3. For each possible subtree size, we want to find the maximum sum for that size.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure how to implement this.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to use a dynamic programming method where for each node, we consider merging its children's subtrees.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: The problem is to find a connected subtree of size m that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a chain of m nodes, all with high indices.\n\nBut how to find such a chain in the tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the chain must start from the highest node and go down, but the exact path depends on the tree's structure.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Start from the highest node, and traverse the tree upwards, counting the nodes.\n\n- Keep track of the current count of nodes in the subtree.\n\n- When the count reaches m, stop.\n\n- The subtree will include all the nodes along this path.\n\nBut this may not always give the maximum sum, because sometimes including a side branch could add more high nodes.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's think about the first sample input:\n\nThe nodes are 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nThe tree structure is:\n\n2 connected to 1,3,4,6.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the nodes 6,5 are in a branch.\n\nThe optimal S is {2,5,6}, which includes 3 nodes. Their sum is 4+32+64=100.\n\nBut if we consider the path from 6 to 2 to 3 to ... etc., that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal S is the subtree consisting of 2,5,6.\n\nBut how did that happen?\n\nBecause in the initial approach of taking the highest m nodes (6,5,4,3,2,1?), but m is 3, so the top 3 are 6,5,2?\n\nWait, but 6 is higher than 5, which is higher than 2.\n\nWait, but 2's subtree includes 1,3,4,6,5. So if we take 2's subtree, it's size is 5.\n\nBut m is 3, so perhaps we can find a subtree within it.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal S is the subtree that includes 6,5, and 2.\n\nBut that's 3 nodes, which sums to 64 +32 +4=100.\n\nBut why not include 6,5, and 2, but also 3 and 4? Because that would make the sum higher, but the size would be 5, which is larger than m=3.\n\nSo, the problem is to choose exactly m nodes.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to find a subtree that includes the m highest nodes, but if they are not connected, then find the minimal way to connect them.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: Since each node's value is 2^i, the sum is maximized by including as many high i's as possible. So the optimal S is the subtree that includes the m highest i's, connected in a way that forms a subtree.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Collect the m nodes with the highest i's.\n\n2. Check if these m nodes form a connected subtree.\n\n   a. If yes, output them.\n\n   b. If not, find a way to connect them by adding the minimal number of lower i's.\n\nBut how to find the minimal number of nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the m nodes are not connected, but they can be connected via their parents.\n\nSo the minimal number of nodes to add is the number of 'branches' that need to be connected.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal S is a subtree that is a path that includes the m highest nodes, but if that's not possible, then we need to include some lower nodes to form a connected subtree.\n\nBut again, the implementation is unclear.\n\nAlternative Approach: Instead of thinking about the nodes, perhaps think in terms of the subtree's structure.\n\nWe can model the tree as a collection of nodes, each with their children.\n\nWe can then perform a post-order traversal to compute for each node the size of its subtree and the sum of 2^i in its subtree.\n\nOnce we have this information, we can try to find a subtree of size m with the maximum sum.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the m nodes with the highest 2^i, and their arrangement in the tree allows them to be connected.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nAnother Idea: The optimal subtree S must include the root of the original tree, but that's not necessarily true.\n\nWait, in the first sample, the root is 2, and the optimal S includes 2,5,6.\n\nSo the root is part of S.\n\nBut perhaps in other cases, the root is not part of S.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but if the root is not part of S, then S is a connected subtree that is a branch off the root. But if the root is part of S, then S is a larger subtree.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal S is the one that includes the root, but that's not always the case.\n\nWait, but the root's value is 2^r, which is quite significant. So including it would add to the sum.\n\nSo perhaps including the root is beneficial.\n\nBut how to know.\n\nPerhaps the optimal approach is to try all possibilities of including the root or not, and choose the one that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, this approach is impractical.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each node, compute the maximum sum of a subtree rooted at that node with exactly s nodes, where s ranges from 1 to the size of the subtree.\n\nThen, for each node, we can find the maximum sum for s = m.\n\nBut again, with n up to 1e6, this may be manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to perform a post-order traversal, and for each node, combine the results from its children.\n\nFor each node u, we can store a list of pairs (size, sum), representing the possible subtree sizes and their corresponding sum when rooted at u.\n\nThen, for each u, we can generate new possible subtree sizes by combining with its children.\n\nBut with n=1e6, this approach would be too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is maximized by including as many high i as possible, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain of m nodes, each being the next highest in the tree.\n\nThus, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Find the node with the highest i, say u.\n\n- Then, find the next highest node v that is in the subtree of u.\n\n- Continue this until we collect m nodes.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain that starts at the highest node and includes as many nodes as possible in the direction of the root.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample, the highest node is 6. Its parent is 2. So the subtree includes 6, 2, and 5. That's 3 nodes, which is m=3.\n\nBut wait, 6,5,2: sum is 64+32+4=100.\n\nIs there a better option?\n\nWhat about including 6,2,3,4? That's 4 nodes, but m=3, so not allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal S is the subtree that includes the highest node, and as many nodes as possible in its parent path.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Find the node u with the highest i.\n\n2. Then, walk up the tree from u, adding nodes until the subtree size reaches m.\n\n3. The resulting subtree is the path from u to the root, or until we have enough nodes.\n\nBut again, this may not capture all possibilities, especially when the tree is not a straight line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that starts at the highest node and goes down towards the leaves.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that includes all the nodes along the path from the highest node down to some ancestor, such that the total number of nodes is m.\n\nBut again, how to implement this.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest m nodes, connected through their parent relationships.\n\nSo, to find this, we can perform a BFS starting from the highest nodes, and collect the minimal number of nodes to form a connected subtree.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree S that is a path of exactly m nodes, which includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the minimal number of edges to cut to isolate the subtree S, but that's probably not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal S is the subtree that includes all the nodes in a certain connected component, and we can find it by considering the subtree sizes.\n\nSo, for each node, compute the size of its subtree. Then, for each node, we can consider that the subtree S includes this node and some of its descendants.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into selecting a subtree S of size m, which is connected, and whose sum of 2^i is maximum.\n\nSince 2^i is increasing, the sum is maximized when the subtree includes as many high i as possible.\n\nThus, the optimal subtree S must include the m highest i's, but they must form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Collect the m highest i's.\n\n2. Check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, output them.\n\n3. If not, find the minimal set of nodes to add to connect them, then output the combined set.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, but how to find if the m highest i's form a connected subtree.\n\nIn the first sample, the m=3 highest i's are 6,5,2.\n\nWait, 6 is connected to 2, and 2 is connected to 5 via the edge between 6 and 5.\n\nWait, no, in the first sample, the edges are 2-6, 6-5. So 6 and 5 are connected, and 6 is connected to 2. So 6,2,5 are connected.\n\nSo in that case, S is {2,5,6}.\n\nSo the sum is 4 +32 +64 = 100.\n\nSo the m=3 highest i's are 6,5,2, which form a connected subtree.\n\nThus, the output is correct.\n\nAnother example: consider a tree where the highest m nodes are spread across different branches.\n\nFor example, imagine a star-shaped tree with the root at 10, and leaves at 9,8,...,5.\n\nIf m=3, then the highest three nodes are 10,9,8.\n\nBut 10 is connected to 9 and 8, so the subtree {10,9,8} is connected.\n\nThus, S is these three nodes.\n\nSum is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8.\n\nWhich is indeed the maximum possible.\n\nAnother example: Imagine a tree where the highest m nodes are in separate branches.\n\nFor example, node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 7, each of which are leaves.\n\nIf m=3, the highest nodes are 10,9,8.\n\nBut 10 is connected to both 9 and 8, so the subtree {10,9,8} is connected.\n\nThus, S is these nodes.\n\nSum is 2^10 +2^9 +2^8.\n\nThus, the approach works.\n\nBut what if the tree is more complex.\n\nConsider a tree where the highest m nodes are in separate subtrees under a common parent.\n\nFor example, node 10 is connected to 9, which is connected to 8, which is connected to 7, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nSo, the key idea is that the m highest i's will form a connected subtree if their parent nodes allow it.\n\nBut how to verify if they are connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the m highest i's form a connected subtree if their lowest common ancestor is somewhere in the tree.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, for example, if the tree is like this:\n\n1 is connected to 2, which is connected to 3.\n\nSo it's a straight line.\n\nm=3, the highest nodes are 3,2,1.\n\nThey form a connected subtree.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: tree is 1-2-4-5, and 3 is a leaf connected to 1.\n\nSo, the tree looks like 1 connected to 2,4,3.\n\nThe highest nodes are 5,4,3.\n\nBut 5 is connected to 4, which is connected to 1, which is connected to 3.\n\nSo 5,4,3 are connected via 4-1-3.\n\nThus, the subtree {5,4,3} is connected.\n\nThus, the sum is 2^5 +2^4 +2^3.\n\nBut wait, 3 is connected to 1, which is connected to 4 and 2 and 5.\n\nSo yes, they are connected.\n\nThus, the approach would work.\n\nBut what if the tree is like this: 10 is connected to 9, which is connected to 8, etc., and 10 is also connected to 20, which is connected to 19, etc.\n\nm=3: the highest nodes are 20,19,10.\n\nAre they connected?\n\nYes, because 20 is connected to 10, so all three are connected.\n\nThus, S is {20,19,10}.\n\nSum is 2^20 + 2^19 +2^10.\n\nWhich is the maximum possible.\n\nSo, in all these examples, the m highest i's form a connected subtree.\n\nBut is this always the case?\n\nNo. Consider a tree where the highest m nodes are in separate branches, but not connected via their parents.\n\nWait, but in a tree, every node is connected through a unique path.\n\nThus, any two nodes are connected via exactly one path.\n\nSo, for the m highest i's, their paths must meet somewhere.\n\nThus, they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but wait: for any two nodes in the m highest, there exists a path connecting them.\n\nThus, the entire set of m nodes is connected.\n\nSo, the subtree S is the set of all m highest nodes.\n\nThus, the solution is to collect the m highest i's, and output them.\n\nWait, that's a big insight.\n\nBecause in a tree, any two nodes are connected via exactly one path.\n\nThus, for any set of m nodes, they form a connected subtree if and only if they are connected via their existing paths.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. For example, consider a tree where node A is connected to node B, which is connected to node C. Now, if we select nodes A, C, and D (where D is a leaf connected to B), the nodes A and C are connected via B, and C and D are connected via B. Thus, all four are connected.\n\nWait, but the point is, any m nodes will be connected via their existing paths in the tree.\n\nThus, the m highest nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nThus, the optimal S is the set of the m highest i's.\n\nThus, the solution is to select the m highest i's, which form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the list of all nodes sorted in descending order of i.\n\n2. Take the first m nodes.\n\n3. Output them.\n\nWait, but wait: in the first sample, the m=3 highest nodes are 6,5,2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn the second sample, which is not given, but for example, if n=8, k=4, m=4.\n\nThe highest 4 nodes are 8,7,6,5.\n\nAre they connected?\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nThe tree is:\n\nEdges:\n\n2-6\n\n2-7\n\n7-8\n\n7-5\n\nSo, 8 is connected to 7, which is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nSo the nodes 8,7,5,2 are connected.\n\nThus, their subtree includes these four nodes, which is connected.\n\nThus, the sum is 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^5 + 2^2.\n\nWhich is 256 +128 +32 +4=420.\n\nThus, the output would be 2 5 7 8.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, the output is ['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5'] for different k's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the sample input, for n=6, k=3, the output is 1 3 4.\n\nWait, but according to our approach, the m=3 highest nodes are 6,5,2. So why is the output 1,3,4?\n\nThat contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier reasoning is incorrect.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nThe nodes are 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nThe edges are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n2-3\n\n2-4\n\n6-5.\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\n2 is connected to 1,3,4,6.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo, the highest m=3 nodes are 6,5,2.\n\nBut in the sample output, the removed nodes are 1,3,4.\n\nWhich implies that the S is {2,5,6}.\n\nWhich is indeed the set of m=3 nodes.\n\nSo the sample output is correct.\n\nThus, according to our approach, the output is the m highest nodes, which in this case is 6,5,2.\n\nBut the sample output is [1,3,4], which are the nodes to be removed.\n\nWait, no, the output is the nodes to be removed, which are not in S.\n\nWait, wait: the output is the list of nodes to remove, which are not in S.\n\nIn the first sample, S is {2,5,6}.\n\nThus, the nodes to remove are 1,3,4.\n\nSo the output is [1,3,4].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the approach of selecting the m highest nodes as S is correct.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort all the nodes in descending order of i.\n\n2. Select the first m nodes.\n\n3. The nodes not in this set are to be removed.\n\nThus, the solution is straightforward.\n\nBut wait, why in the first sample the m=3 highest nodes are 6,5,2, and S is {2,5,6}.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code is simply:\n\nSort all nodes in descending order of i.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component with the maximum possible sum of fans. Each district's fan count is given by \\(2^i\\) for district \\(i\\), and removing a district disconnects its subtree.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to maximize the total number of fans while ensuring the remaining districts form a connected tree. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more to the total fan count, so we should prioritize keeping these districts.\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal solution involves selecting the largest possible connected subtree that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible. This is because higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more to the total fan count.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We will sort the districts in descending order of their indices. The top \\(n - k\\) districts from this sorted list form the largest connected subtree, as any two nodes in a tree are connected by exactly one path.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the districts takes \\(O(n \\log n)\\), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    # Read edges\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n\n    # Sort nodes in descending order\n    nodes = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    nodes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Select the first m nodes\n    m = n - k\n    selected = nodes[:m]\n\n    # Now, find all nodes not in 'selected' and output them in sorted order\n    removed = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in selected:\n            removed.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the removed list\n    removed.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, removed)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts \\(n\\) and the number of districts \\(k\\) to remove. The edges of the tree are then read and stored.\n2. **Sorting Nodes**: The districts are sorted in descending order based on their indices to prioritize higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Selecting Subtree**: The top \\(n - k\\) districts from the sorted list form the largest connected subtree, ensuring the maximum fan count.\n4. **Removing Nodes**: The nodes not in the selected subtree are identified and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal set of districts to remove, ensuring the remaining districts form a connected component with the highest possible fan count.",
