For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about binary strings and choosing certain values for each string such that a multiset of these strings is 'beautiful'. Then, we need to count the number of ways to choose these c_s values so that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nWe are given n, k, f. We consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to n. For each such string s, we choose c_s from 0 to k. A multiset is beautiful if for every string s (including those of length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of ways to choose all c_s such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And since the answer can be huge, we need to output it modulo 998244353.\n\nWait, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset depends on the choices of c_s. So for each possible choice of c_s, the maximum beautiful multiset is determined. We need to count how many such choices of c_s lead to the maximum being exactly f.\n\nSo the approach is: for each possible selection of c_s (each c_s can be between 0 and k), compute what the maximum beautiful multiset size is, and then count how many selections have this maximum equal to f.\n\nBut considering that the number of possible selections is way too big (since for each string of length up to n, which is up to 2^15 = 32768 strings, each with k+1 options), this approach is computationally impossible for n=15.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. The maximum beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints imposed by each string s. Each s contributes a constraint that the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where the constraints form a tree-like structure. Because for longer strings, their prefixes are the shorter ones.\n\nFor example, for the string \"00\", its prefixes are \"0\" and \"00\". So the count for \"00\" being a prefix affects both \"0\" and \"00\".\n\nWait, but the constraints are such that for any s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s. But the count for a longer string is automatically included in the counts for its shorter prefixes.\n\nWait, no. Because when you have a string t that is a prefix of s, any occurrence of s as a prefix implies an occurrence of t as a prefix. So the count for s is part of the count for t.\n\nTherefore, the constraints are hierarchical. The maximum beautiful multiset's size is constrained by the most restrictive of these.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum beautiful multiset is determined by the sum over certain variables, but more likely, the minimal c_s among all the required constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum possible beautiful multiset is the minimum of some function based on the c_s's.\n\nI'm not quite sure yet. Let me think differently.\n\nEach binary string s has a certain set of descendants: all binary strings that start with s. For the multiset to be beautiful, the number of times each s appears (as a prefix) in the multiset must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a given string s, the number of times any string in the multiset that starts with s must be <= c_s. So for each s, the count of such strings is the sum of the counts of all t where s is a prefix of t.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because for each t in the multiset, it contributes 1 to all of its prefixes s. So the total number of times s appears as a prefix in the multiset is equal to the sum over all t in the multiset where s is a prefix of t.\n\nSo for each s, the sum of the counts of all t that are extensions of s (including s itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for each t in the multiset, it contributes 1 to all of its prefixes. So for s, the count is the number of elements in the multiset that are in the subtree rooted at s. So the count for s is the sum of the multiplicities of all t that are extensions of s.\n\nThus, the condition for the multiset to be beautiful is that for each s, the sum of the multiplicities of all t that are in the subtree of s (i.e., all t that have s as a prefix) must be <= c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum beautiful multiset is the largest possible such collection of strings, under these constraints. So for each s, the sum of the multiplicities of its subtree must be <= c_s.\n\nTo maximize the total number of strings in the multiset, we need to find a way to assign multiplicities to each string, ensuring that for each s, the sum of its subtree is <= c_s. The maximum possible is achieved when for each s, the sum is exactly c_s.\n\nWait, because if you have any remaining capacity in c_s, you can take it by adding more strings that have s as a prefix. So the maximum is the sum over s of min(c_s, ...). Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps the maximum is the sum for each s of c_s minus the sum of the children's c_t.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to a tree where each node s can have a certain capacity, and the maximum number of strings is determined by the sum of the capacities along the tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is equal to the sum over all s of (c_s - sum of c_t for t that are proper prefixes of s).\n\nBecause for each string s, the number of times s can appear is limited by c_s, but also by the fact that longer strings (which are prefixed by s) can't contribute more than their own c_t.\n\nWait, let me think recursively. For each s, the maximum number of times s can appear is c_s minus the sum of the maximum counts for each proper suffix of s. Because the longer strings (like s + 0 or s + 1) are built upon s, and their counts are already accounted for.\n\nNo, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe the correct way is to model the problem as a tree, where each node represents a string s, and the edges represent adding a bit. Then, for each node s, the maximum number of times it can appear is c_s minus the sum of the maximum counts of its children.\n\nWait, but the children of s are the strings formed by appending 0 or 1 to s. So for each s, the maximum number of times it can appear is c_s minus the sum of the maximum counts of its two children.\n\nWait, yes! Because the sum of the counts for the children (s0 and s1) can't exceed c_s0 and c_s1 respectively. So the maximum for s is c_s minus (count of s0 + count of s1).\n\nWait, but if the counts of s0 and s1 are determined first, then the count of s can be up to c_s - (count of s0 + count of s1). So the order in which we process the nodes matters.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be modeled as a tree where each node s has two children: s0 and s1. The maximum count for s is c_s minus the sum of the counts of its children. This is similar to a post-order traversal.\n\nSo the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the sum of the counts for all nodes, which is computed as the sum of (c_s - sum of children counts) for each node.\n\nWait, but for the root nodes (the empty string?), perhaps not. Or perhaps we're considering all possible non-empty strings up to length n.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For each string s, sorted in reverse order (from longest to shortest), compute the maximum count m_s, which is the minimum between c_s and (m_{s0} + m_{s1}), since the sum of the counts of s0 and s1 can't exceed c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because m_s is the maximum number of times s can appear. It can't be more than c_s, but also, the sum of s0 and s1 can't exceed m_s.\n\nWait, wait. Let me rephrase.\n\nEach node s has two children: s0 and s1. For s to be included in the multiset, each occurrence of s requires that either s0 or s1 is also included. But since each occurrence of s0 and s1 can be considered as adding to the counts of s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum count for s is the minimum of c_s and (m_{s0} + m_{s1}).\n\nBecause the sum of the counts of s0 and s1 can't exceed m_s. Otherwise, s can't be added without violating the constraints of s0 or s1.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nm_s = min(c_s, m_{s0} + m_{s1}).\n\nAnd the total maximum size is the sum of m_s for all s.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for s to be present, the sum of its children must allow it. If m_{s0} + m_{s1} >= c_s, then s can be added up to c_s times. Otherwise, it can be added only m_{s0} + m_{s1} times.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of s0 and s1's counts is the total number of strings that have s as a prefix. So for s to be allowed, the sum of s0 and s1's counts must be <= c_s.\n\nSo the maximum m_s is the minimum of c_s and (m_{s0} + m_{s1}).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because m_s can be as high as c_s, but subject to the condition that m_{s0} + m_{s1} <= m_s. Because each occurrence of s contributes to the counts of s0 and s1.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as:\n\nm_s is the maximum number of times s can appear. Each occurrence of s adds 1 to s0 and s1 (if they exist). So the sum of s0's count and s1's count must be <= m_s. Because each time s appears, it's a parent to s0 and s1.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because each time s appears, it's one string in the multiset. So for s, the number of times it appears is m_s. For each such occurrence, s contributes 1 to the count of its prefixes.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.\n\nEach string t in the multiset contributes 1 to the count of all its prefixes s. So for each s, the sum of m_t for all t that are extensions of s (including s itself) is the total number of times s appears as a prefix in the multiset.\n\nBut that sum must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for each t in the multiset, it is a string that has s as a prefix if and only if s is a prefix of t. So for each t, it contributes 1 to all s that are prefixes of t.\n\nSo for s, the count is the sum of m_t for all t that are in the multiset and have s as a prefix.\n\nBut in our problem, the multiset is such that for each s, this sum is <= c_s.\n\nSo the maximum possible m_s is c_s minus the sum of the counts of its proper prefixes? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum m_s is such that for s, the sum of m_t for t in the multiset that are proper prefixes of s is <= m_s.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a tree, where each node s has two children: s0 and s1. The maximum m_s is constrained by the sum of m_{s0} and m_{s1}, because each occurrence of s contributes to the count of s0 and s1.\n\nWait, that might make more sense.\n\nSo for s, the maximum number of times it can appear in the multiset is m_s, which must satisfy:\n\nm_{s0} + m_{s1} <= m_s.\n\nBecause each occurrence of s adds 1 to both s0 and s1's counts.\n\nWait, but no. Because each occurrence of s is a single string, and when you add it, it's counted towards s's own count and towards s0 and s1's counts (if they are longer than s). So for s, the sum of m_{s0} and m_{s1} must be <= m_s.\n\nBecause each occurrence of s contributes 1 to s0 and s1's counts, so the sum of s0's and s1's counts is the number of times s is used, which is m_s.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the key. So for each s, the sum of the counts of its children (s0 and s1) must be <= m_s. Because each child's count is the number of times that child is used, which in turn is contributed by the parent s.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nm_{s0} + m_{s1} <= m_s.\n\nBut also, m_s cannot exceed c_s, because the sum of its children's counts can't be more than c_s. Wait, no— the sum can't exceed m_s, which is bounded by c_s. So m_s must be at least m_{s0} + m_{s1}.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because if m_s is less than m_{s0} + m_{s1}, then the sum would be more than m_s, which violates the condition.\n\nSo the condition is that m_s >= m_{s0} + m_{s1}.\n\nBut also, m_s can't exceed c_s, because the sum of the children's counts can't exceed c_s.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to formalize it.\n\nFor each string s:\n\nsum_{t is a child of s} m_t <= m_s\n\nand\n\nm_s <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for s, the sum of m_t for all t that have s as a prefix is the sum of m_s, m_{s0}, m_{s1}, etc. But that sum must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think recursively.\n\nThe maximum possible m_s is the minimum between c_s and (c_{s0} + c_{s1})... No, that doesn't sound right.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum m_s is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the m_t for t that are children of s.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the strings in order of decreasing length. For each string s, the maximum number of times it can appear is the minimum between c_s and (m_{s0} + m_{s1}).\n\nWait, because m_{s0} and m_{s1} are the maximum counts of those children. Each time you add s, it contributes 1 to s0 and s1. So the sum of s0 and s1 can't exceed m_s.\n\nSo, m_s = min(c_s, m_{s0} + m_{s1}).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for example, for the root node (the empty string?), perhaps not, because we're considering all non-empty strings. Wait, the root in this tree would be the empty string, but since we're only considering strings of length 1 to n, perhaps the processing starts from the leaves (length n) and goes down.\n\nWait, no. Because for a string of length l, its children are the strings of length l+1 obtained by appending 0 or 1. So, the processing should be done in reverse order of the string lengths. That is, process the strings in order of decreasing length.\n\nSo, for each string s, starting from the longest (length n), then n-1, down to 1.\n\nFor each s, m_s = min(c_s, m_{s0} + m_{s1}).\n\nBut wait, what about the base case? For the strings of length n, they don't have any children, so m_s = min(c_s, 0) = 0.\n\nWait, no. For a string s of length n, its children are s0 and s1, which are longer than n, but since our max length is n, s0 and s1 do not exist. So for s of length n, m_s is just min(c_s, 0), which is zero.\n\nSo the maximum m_s for s of length n is zero. Then, for s of length n-1, their m_s is min(c_s, m_{s0} + m_{s1}).\n\nWait, but for s of length n-1, s0 and s1 are of length n, which have m_s0 and m_s1 as zero. So m_s = min(c_s, 0 + 0) = min(c_s, 0) = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because then for all s of length <n, their m_s would be zero. Which would imply that the maximum beautiful multiset is zero, which is not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let's think about the example given in the problem statement.\n\nIn the sample input, for n=2, the multiset {11,01,00,01} is considered. Let's see:\n\nFor s=0: c_0 is 3. The sum of m_00 and m_01 and m_0 (but wait, s=0 is a prefix of 00, 01, 10, 11, but in the multiset, only 00, 01, etc. are present.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum m_s is the sum of the m_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s plus the m_s itself.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the c_s values. Each string s contributes a constraint that the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nBut the sum of all such counts across s is the same as the total number of strings in the multiset multiplied by their length. Because each string contributes to each of its prefixes.\n\nWait, that's a key insight. Let me think about it.\n\nEach string t in the multiset contributes 1 to the count of each of its prefixes s. So, the total sum over all s of (number of times s is a prefix in the multiset) is equal to the sum over t in the multiset of (length of t). Because for each t, it contributes 1 to each of its prefixes, which are all of length less than or equal to t.\n\nBut according to the constraints, for each s, the count (number of times it's a prefix) is <= c_s. So the sum of all counts is <= sum of c_s for all s.\n\nBut the sum of all counts is also equal to the sum of the lengths of all t in the multiset. Let's denote the multiset as M, and |M| as the size of M. Then sum_{s} (count(s)) = sum_{t in M} len(t).\n\nSo sum_{t in M} len(t) <= sum_{s} c_s.\n\nBut the maximum possible |M| is such that sum_{t in M} len(t) is as large as possible, given the constraints.\n\nWait, but how does this relate to the c_s's?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible |M| is the maximum value such that there exists a way to choose the counts of each t, subject to sum_{t in M} len(t) <= sum c_s, and for each s, the sum of counts of t that are extensions of s is <= c_s.\n\nHmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.\n\nAnother approach: the maximum size is determined by the sum of the c_s minus the sum of the c_t for the children.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is the sum of c_s minus the sum of the c_t for the children of s.\n\nNo, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, let's think about the sample input.\n\nIn the first sample, n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nThe possible c_0 can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for n=1, the binary strings are \"0\" and \"1\". So c_0 and c_1 are each chosen from 0 to 42.\n\nThe maximum beautiful multiset size is f=2.\n\nThe three valid selections are:\n\n1. c_0=0, c_1=2 → the multiset can have \"1\" once, but wait, wait. Wait, the maximum m_0 is min(c_0, m_00 + m_01 + m_0's other children). Since n=1, for s=0, its children are 00 and 01, but those are beyond n=1. So m_0 is min(c_0, 0) = 0. Similarly, m_1 is min(c_1, 0) = 0. So the maximum is 0, but in this case, the sample says that the maximum is 2. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum m_s is not computed as per the previous approach, but rather, the maximum is the sum of m_s for all s, and each m_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of m_{children}.\n\nWait, let's go back to the sample.\n\nIn the first sample, n=1, so the strings are \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nSuppose c_0=2, c_1=0.\n\nThen for s=0: m_0 = min(2, m_00 + m_01) → but m_00 and m_01 are zero because they are longer than n=1. So m_0 = 2.\n\nBut wait, that can't be because m_0 is the count of \"0\" in the multiset. But wait, the multiset can't have any string that has \"0\" as a prefix beyond \"0\" itself. So the maximum m_0 is 2, but since \"0\" is a string of length 1, and it's the only string that can contribute to the count of \"0\".\n\nBut in reality, the maximum m_0 is 2, but how does that relate to the constraints for the multiset.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the sum of m_s for all s, where m_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of m_t for all t that are immediate children of s.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case.\n\nSo for each s, m_s = min(c_s, sum of m_{s0} and m_{s1}).\n\nIn the first sample, for s=0, m_0 = min(c_0, 0) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for s=1, m_1 = min(c_1, 0) = 0.\n\nBut in the sample, when c_0=2 and c_1=0, the maximum is 2. So perhaps my model is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is that the maximum m_s for a string s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of m_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum m_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of m_t for t in the entire subtree rooted at s, except s itself.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the maximum size is the sum over all s of (c_s - sum of c_t for t in the subtree of s, excluding s itself). But that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is determined by the sum of c_s for all s, but with certain dependencies due to the tree structure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as a directed acyclic graph where each node is a string, and each node points to its children. Then, the constraints form a system of inequalities that must be satisfied for the counts m_s.\n\nThe maximum total is the sum of m_s, and each m_s is constrained by m_s >= m_{s0} + m_{s1}.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because m_s is the count of s in the multiset, which contributes 1 to s0 and s1's counts.\n\nWait, perhaps m_s is the number of times s is chosen, and for each s, the sum of m_{s0} and m_{s1} must be <= m_s.\n\nBecause each occurrence of s contributes 1 to both s0 and s1's counts.\n\nSo for s, m_{s0} + m_{s1} <= m_s.\n\nAdditionally, m_s <= c_s.\n\nSo the maximum m_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of m_{s0} and m_{s1}.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nBut in the first sample, when c_0=2 and c_1=0:\n\nm_0 = min(2, m_{00} + m_{01}) = min(2, 0+0) = 0.\n\nm_1 = min(0, m_{10} + m_{11}) = 0.\n\nTotal is 0, but in the sample, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial model is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misunderstood how the counts contribute.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nEach string t in the multiset contributes 1 to the count of all s that are prefixes of t.\n\nSo for each s, the count is the number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix.\n\nSo for the sample where c_0=2 and c_1=0, the multiset could be {\"0\", \"0\"}.\n\nSo for s=0, the count is 2, which is <= c_0=2.\n\nFor s=1, the count is 0, which is <= c_1=0.\n\nBut in this case, the sum of the counts is 2 + 0 = 2, which equals f=2.\n\nSo the maximum size is 2.\n\nSo how does this fit into the earlier model?\n\nIn this scenario, for s=0, the count is 2, which comes from the two \"0\"s.\n\nBut for s=0, the sum of the counts of its children (s0 and s1) is zero, since those are of length 2.\n\nSo according to the earlier model, m_0 would be min(c_0, 0) = 0, but in reality, m_0 is 2.\n\nThis suggests that the model is wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the model needs to be adjusted.\n\nAlternative Idea: The count for s is the sum of m_t for all t that are proper extensions of s, plus m_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for each t that is an extension of s, it contributes 1 to s's count.\n\nWait, no. For t that is an extension of s, s is a prefix of t, so t contributes 1 to s's count.\n\nThus, the count for s is the sum of m_t for all t in the multiset where s is a prefix of t.\n\nSo for s, the count is sum_{t is in M and s is prefix of t} 1.\n\nWhich is equal to the sum of m_t for t in the subtree of s (excluding s itself).\n\nPlus m_s, which is the count of s in M.\n\nWait, no. Because s itself is in the multiset, and it's a prefix of itself.\n\nSo the count for s is m_s (the number of times s is in M) plus the sum of m_t for t in M that are longer than s and have s as a prefix.\n\nThus, the count for s is m_s + sum_{t is a child of s} m_t.\n\nSo, for each s, the constraint is:\n\nm_s + sum_{t is child of s} m_t <= c_s.\n\nThis makes more sense.\n\nSo the condition for each s is m_s + sum of m_t (for t in the children of s) <= c_s.\n\nSo now, for each s, we have this condition, and the goal is to find the maximum possible sum of m_s, where m_s >= 0, and the above condition holds for all s.\n\nMoreover, for the leaves (strings of length n), they have no children, so their condition is m_s <= c_s.\n\nSo for the root of the tree (empty string), which is not part of our consideration, but the sum of m_s for all s in the multiset, along with their children's m_t, must satisfy all the constraints.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding m_s for all s (strings of length 1 to n) such that for each s:\n\nm_s + sum_{t is child of s} m_t <= c_s.\n\nAnd the objective is to maximize sum_{s} m_s.\n\nOnce we have this, the maximum size is f, and we need to find the number of c assignments that allow exactly this maximum.\n\nSo, the key is to model the problem as a system of constraints and find for each possible assignment of c_s, what is the maximum sum m_s, and count the c assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut since n is up to 15, the number of strings is 2^15-1, which is 32767. That's manageable.\n\nWait, no, because for each possible c_s, the computation would be O(2^n), which is 3e4 * 3e4 is 1e9, which is way too big.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: We can represent the constraints as a tree, and model the maximum sum m as a function of the c_s. Then, for each possible c assignment, compute the maximum sum m, and count the number of c assignments where this maximum is f.\n\nBut for n=15, the number of strings is 32767, which is manageable for certain dynamic programming approaches.\n\nBut even that may be challenging, given that k can be up to 2e5.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum sum m is a linear function of the c_s's. Let's explore that.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each string s, the maximum m_s can be determined based on the c_s and the c_t of its children.\n\nWait, but the condition is m_s + sum_{t in children} m_t <= c_s.\n\nTo maximize the total sum, for each s, we want to choose m_s as large as possible, subject to the constraints.\n\nThis is a classic optimization problem on a tree, where each node has a constraint involving its own variable and its children's variables.\n\nWe can model this using dynamic programming, processing the tree in post-order.\n\nFor each node s, the maximum m_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum m_t for its children t.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nProcessing from leaves (longest strings) to root (shortest strings).\n\nFor a leaf node s (length n), it has no children. So the constraint is m_s <= c_s. To maximize the sum, m_s is set to min(c_s, ...). But since it's a leaf, the sum of children is zero, so the constraint is m_s <= c_s. So m_s can be up to c_s.\n\nWait, but wait: the condition is m_s + sum_children m_t <= c_s. For a leaf, sum_children is zero, so m_s <= c_s. So m_s is c_s.\n\nSo for a leaf, m_s = c_s.\n\nFor a node s with children t1 and t2, the condition is m_s + m_t1 + m_t2 <= c_s.\n\nTo maximize the sum, m_s should be as large as possible, so m_s is min(c_s, m_t1 + m_t2).\n\nBecause m_s can be as high as possible, but cannot exceed c_s, and also the sum of children's m_t must be <= m_s.\n\nWait, because m_s + m_t1 + m_t2 <= c_s.\n\nSo m_s can be up to min(c_s, m_t1 + m_t2).\n\nWait, no. Because m_t1 and m_t2 are fixed. So m_s can be as high as possible, but the sum m_s + m_t1 + m_t2 must be <= c_s.\n\nSo m_s <= c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2).\n\nBut also, m_s can't be negative. So m_s is the minimum between c_s and (c_s - m_t1 - m_t2).\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because the sum must be <= c_s, so m_s <= c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2).\n\nBut since m_t1 and m_t2 are known, m_s can be as large as possible, but not exceeding c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2).\n\nSo the maximum m_s is min(c_s, c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2)).\n\nBut that would be zero if c_s < m_t1 + m_t2.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, let's think again. For a node s with children t1 and t2, the condition is m_s + m_t1 + m_t2 <= c_s.\n\nWe want to maximize the sum of m's. So for s, the maximum m_s is c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2), but it can't be negative.\n\nSo m_s = max(0, c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2)).\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because m_t1 and m_t2 are fixed for their respective nodes.\n\nSo the maximum m_s is the minimum between c_s and (c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2)), which simplifies to max(0, c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2)).\n\nBut wait, why can't m_s be larger than c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2)? Because the condition is m_s + m_t1 + m_t2 <= c_s.\n\nSo, for example, if c_s is 5, m_t1 is 2, m_t2 is 3, then m_s can be up to 0, because 5 - (2+3)=0.\n\nSo m_s is 0.\n\nIn another case, if c_s is 10, m_t1 is 3, m_t2 is 4, then m_s can be up to 3, because 10 - 7 =3.\n\nSo m_s = 3.\n\nSo the general formula is m_s = max(0, c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2)).\n\nWait, but what if m_t1 + m_t2 exceeds c_s? Then m_s would be zero, which would mean that no occurrences of s can be in the multiset, because s's count plus the sum of its children's counts would exceed c_s.\n\nThus, the formula for m_s is max(0, c_s - (m_t1 + m_t2)).\n\nSo this gives us a way to compute m_s for each string s in post-order.\n\nThus, the maximum sum is the sum of all m_s, which is computed as the sum of max(0, c_s - (sum of m_t for children t)).\n\nBut wait, the sum is not the sum of all m_s, but the sum of the m_s's, which are the counts for each string in the multiset.\n\nWait, no. The m_s is the count of s in the multiset. So the total sum is the sum of m_s for all s.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each possible c_s assignment, compute the sum of m_s as defined by the post-order traversal, and count the number of c assignments where this sum is exactly f.\n\nBut for n=15, the number of strings is 2^15 - 1 = 32767, which is manageable.\n\nBut with k up to 2e5, and f up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to compute the number of c assignments where the sum is exactly f.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for each string s, the list of its children (appending 0 and 1).\n\n2. Process the strings in post-order (from longest to shortest length).\n\n3. For each string s, define a variable m_s, which is the maximum count of s in the multiset, given the c_s's.\n\n   m_s = max(0, c_s - sum of m_t for t in children of s).\n\n4. The total sum is the sum of all m_s. We need to find the number of c assignments where this sum is exactly f.\n\nBut wait, the sum of m_s is dependent on the c assignments, and we need to count the number of c assignments where this sum is exactly f.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can model this as a DP problem, where we compute for each string s, the possible contributions to the sum, and track the total sum.\n\nBut for n=15, the number of strings is 32767, which is manageable.\n\nBut each string's contribution depends on the c_s's of all the nodes in its subtree.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the problem using a generating function approach.\n\nEach node s contributes a term to the generating function, which represents the possible ways to choose c_s such that the sum of m_s is accounted for.\n\nBut the dependencies between the nodes complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, since the tree is a binary trie, perhaps we can process the nodes in a bottom-up manner and compute the contribution of each node to the generating function.\n\nEach node's contribution depends on the contributions of its children.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, we can compute a generating function that",
