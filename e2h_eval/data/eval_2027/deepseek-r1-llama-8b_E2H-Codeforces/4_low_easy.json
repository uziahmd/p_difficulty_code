The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about the game Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds. In each round, both choose their moves based on their respective sequences A and B. The loser gets a red spot, except when it's a draw, then nothing happens.\n\nMy task is to compute how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm. So for each round, I need to determine who loses, and add one to their count.\n\nFirst, let's think about how the players choose their moves. Nikephoros cycles through his sequence A in order, starting from the first element each time. Similarly, Polycarpus cycles through B. But wait, how? Like, for each round i (starting from 0 or 1?), they pick the i-th element of their cycle. Wait, no— the problem says they show the items in a cyclic way, starting from the first each time. So for each round, the move is determined by the current position in the sequence, cycling back as needed.\n\nSo for the first round, it's a1 vs b1. Second round, a2 vs b2. Third, a3 vs b3. Then a1 vs b4, a2 vs b5, etc., until all n rounds are done.\n\nWait no, that's not correct. Because the sequences are used cyclically for each player. So for each round, the choice is based on the same index modulo the length of the sequence.\n\nFor example, if A has length m, then for round i (starting from 0), the move is A[i % m]. Same for B: B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each round, we can calculate which move each player plays.\n\nThen, for each such pair, determine who wins. If it's a draw, no one gets a spot. Otherwise, the winner gets a spot.\n\nWait, no. The winner is the one whose move beats the other. So, for example, if A's move is R and B's is S, R beats S, so B (the S player) loses. So in that case, B gets a red spot.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the loser is the one getting pinched. So in each round, the person who loses (i.e., the one who's move doesn't beat the other) gets a red spot.\n\nSo, for each round:\n\n- Compare A's move and B's move.\n- Determine the winner.\n- If there's a winner (not a draw), the loser gets a red spot.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get the move from A: a_move = A[round % len(A)]\n   b. Get the move from B: b_move = B[round % len(B)]\n   c. Determine if a_move beats b_move, or vice versa.\n   d. If a_move beats b_move: then B loses (so Polycarpus gets a spot)\n   e. Else if b_move beats a_move: A loses (Nikephoros gets a spot)\n   f. Else: no one gets a spot.\n\nSo, the plan is to loop through each of the n rounds, compute the moves for each, determine the outcome, and tally the spots.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable since each iteration is O(1). So even with n=2e5, it's feasible.\n\nNow, the question is, how to represent the moves and efficiently compute whether one move beats the other.\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\nRock (R) beats Scissors (S)\nScissors (S) beat Paper (P)\nPaper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\nSo, for a given a_move and b_move, we can create a helper function that returns whether a_move beats b_move.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute all possible outcomes.\n\nAnother approach is to assign each move a value, like R=0, S=1, P=2, and compute the difference.\n\nWait, because:\n\nIf a_move is R (0) and b_move is S (1), then 0 - 1 = -1, which might not help directly.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: for a given a_move and b_move, see what beats what.\n\nLike, for a_move and b_move, determine the winner.\n\nLet's think:\n\nCase 1: a_move == b_move → draw, no spots.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck the relationships:\n\nIf a_move is R, it beats S.\n\nSo, if a_move is R and b_move is S → a wins, b loses.\n\nIf a_move is S, it beats P → a wins, b loses.\n\nIf a_move is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on each player after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors rounds. Each round is played based on specific sequences chosen by each player, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each have their own sequences of moves. The loser of each round gets a red spot. The key is to simulate each round efficiently and count the red spots.\n2. **Cyclic Moves**: Each player's moves are cyclically determined by their respective sequences. For each round, the move is determined by the current position in the sequence modulo the length of the sequence.\n3. **Determine the Winner**: For each round, compare the moves of both players. Based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors, determine the winner and assign a red spot accordingly.\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Given the constraints, iterating through each round and using modular arithmetic to cycle through the sequences ensures that the solution is efficient even for the upper limit of input size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\na_len = len(A)\nb_len = len(B)\n\nr_nike = 0\nr_poly = 0\n\nfor round in range(n):\n    # Get the current move for each player\n    a_move = A[round % a_len]\n    b_move = B[round % b_len]\n    \n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue\n    # Determine who loses\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n       (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n       (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n        r_poly += 1\n    else:\n        r_nike += 1\n\nprint(r_nike, r_poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B` are read from the input.\n2. **Initialization**: Variables to count the red spots for both players are initialized.\n3. **Simulate Each Round**: For each round, the current move for each player is determined using the modulo operation to cycle through their sequences.\n4. **Determine the Loser**: If the moves result in a draw, no red spot is awarded. Otherwise, the player whose move does not win gets a red spot.\n5. **Output the Result**: After processing all rounds, the counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles up to the maximum constraint of 200,000 rounds, ensuring that the solution is both correct and performant.",
