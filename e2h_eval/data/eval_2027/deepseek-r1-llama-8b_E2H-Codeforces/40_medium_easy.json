    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about permutations and counting certain pairs of them. Hmm. The task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we need to output this count modulo a given mod.\n\nWait, right. So for each pair where p < q lex order and inv(p) > inv(q), we count it. The challenge is to compute this efficiently for n up to 500.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what's needed here. The brute force approach would be to generate all possible pairs, check the conditions, and count. But with n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me break down the problem. We need to consider all possible p and q where p is lex smaller than q, and inv(p) > inv(q). So perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, tracking some state that allows us to compute the required counts.\n\nFirst, let's think about the inversion count. The inversion count is the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j and a_i > a_j. So for any permutation, its inversion count is between 0 and n*(n-1)/2.\n\nNow, considering lex order: a permutation p is lex smaller than q if, at the first position where they differ, p has a smaller number than q. So for example, [1,3,2] is less than [1,4,2] because 3 <4 at the second position.\n\nSo the problem requires considering all p < q (lex) and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nHmm. How can we model this?\n\nAn alternative way is to realize that for each permutation p, we can count the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have an inversion count less than inv(p). Then summing over all p.\n\nBut even that approach might be computationally heavy, as for each p, we'd need to process all q's that are lex larger.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can precompute for each possible inversion count k, the number of permutations with that inversion count and a certain lex order property. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Since both p and q are permutations, perhaps the lex order and inversion count are related in a way that can be modeled combinatorially.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this using DP where the state includes the current position, some information about the elements chosen so far, and the inversion count so far.\n\nBut with n up to 500, a straightforward DP approach may not be feasible due to the high computational requirements.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem by considering all possible pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me see if there's a mathematical way to compute this.\n\nLet me denote S as the total number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p < q. For n ≥ 2, S is equal to T(n) = (n! * (n! -1)) / 2, since each pair is ordered and each is unique.\n\nBut in our case, we need only those pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). So perhaps we can express the answer as the sum over all p, q where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the total number of such pairs as the sum over all p of the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nSo the answer is sum_{p} (number of q > p lex and inv(q) < inv(p)).\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the properties of inversions and lex order.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to model this using generating functions or inclusion-exclusion. Or perhaps using some combinatorial transforms.\n\nWait, another idea: Since p < q in lex order, for each position i, the first differing element determines the lex order. So when building p and q, the choice at the first differing position affects the rest.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to use this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p can be determined, and among those, we need to know how many have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nBut again, without knowing the structure of these q's, it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe it's useful to note that the inversion count of a permutation is a function that can be built incrementally as we construct the permutation.\n\nSo perhaps during the construction of p and q, we can track their inversion counts.\n\nBut considering that p and q are two different permutations, this complicates things.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the problem can be split into two parts. First, compute the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q. Then subtract the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) ≤ inv(q). But then, how do we compute the latter?\n\nWait, but that's equivalent to the original problem. So perhaps the problem is to find the difference between the total S and the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) ≤ inv(q).\n\nHmm. So the answer is S - A, where A is the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) ≤ inv(q).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this problem using dynamic programming where for each permutation p, we track its inversion count and also track for each possible q that is lex larger than p and has a lower inversion count.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a DP where we process each permutation step by step, keeping track of the necessary information.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nWe can model the process of building p and q as sequences of choices. For each step, we choose the next element in p and q, ensuring that p is lex smaller than q, and track the inversion counts.\n\nWait, but p and q are separate permutations, so their choices are interdependent.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of the relative inversion counts between p and q.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress here. Let's try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps the key insight is that for any two permutations p and q where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q) or not. So the problem is to count the pairs where the former holds.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: Consider all possible pairs (p, q) where p and q are permutations. Among these, how many satisfy p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nWe can model this as the sum over all possible inversion counts k, of the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) = k, and inv(q) < k.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can compute for each possible k, the number of p's with inv(p) =k, multiplied by the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have inv(q) <k.\n\nBut again, for each p, it's hard to compute the number of q's that meet the criteria.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the problem differently. Let's consider all possible pairs of permutations (p, q), p < q, and compute whether inv(p) > inv(q). Perhaps we can find a generating function or a combinatorial formula that captures this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry or a mathematical property that allows us to compute the answer without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nWait, considering that for each pair (p, q) where p < q, the condition is inv(p) > inv(q). So perhaps the answer is equal to the number of such pairs minus the number of pairs where inv(p) <= inv(q).\n\nBut wait, no: the answer is exactly the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). So that approach doesn't directly help.\n\nWait, but perhaps the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is S = (n!)*(n! -1)/2. So the answer could be expressed as S minus the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) <= inv(q). But again, I don't see a direct way to compute this.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think about the expected value of inv(p) compared to inv(q) for p < q. But that might not lead anywhere concrete.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the problem with dynamic programming that tracks both the state of p and q as they're being built.\n\nEach permutation can be represented as a sequence of choices. For example, when building p, each step selects the next element from the remaining elements, and similarly for q.\n\nBut since p and q are being built together, perhaps the state can include the current positions in p and q, and the inversion counts so far.\n\nBut for n=500, that's going to be a problem because the state space becomes too large.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the relative order between p and q as we build them step by step.\n\nAt each step i, we choose the next element for p and the next element for q. We need to ensure that p remains lex smaller than q. Additionally, we track the inversion counts for both p and q.\n\nBut even this approach might be too slow for n=500.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the constraints on p and q.\n\nSince p is lex smaller than q, the first position where they differ must have p's element smaller than q's. So, for each step, until the first differing position is found, p and q must be identical in their previous choices.\n\nWait, no. For example, if p and q are being built, the first position where they differ will determine the lex order. So until that position is reached, all earlier positions must be the same.\n\nSo, the first time p and q have differing elements, that's the point that determines p < q.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to model the building of p and q up to the first differing position, and then model the rest.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p) can be computed.\n\nBut for each p, how do we find the number of such q's?\n\nWait, let's think about the structure of q. Since q must be lex greater than p, the first position where q differs from p must have a larger element than p.\n\nSo, for a given p, the set of possible q's is determined by the choices made after the first differing position.\n\nBut again, computing this for each p is expensive.\n\nHmm. Another idea: perhaps the inversion count of p and q are independent of each other except for certain constraints.\n\nWait, but no. Because the inversion counts depend on the entire permutation, including the choices made for q after the first differing position.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for problems where the inversion count is considered alongside lex order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into considering all possible pairs (p, q) and compute the number of such pairs based on some combinatorial properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached using the concept of \"dominance\" in permutations. Lexicographical order is similar to the dominance order.\n\nBut I'm not familiar enough with the properties to make progress.\n\nAnother thought: Let's imagine that for each permutation p, we can compute the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have a lower inversion count.\n\nSo the answer is the sum over all p of f(p), where f(p) is the number of q's lex larger than p with inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nIf I can find f(p) for each p efficiently, then the sum would give the desired result.\n\nSo the question is, how to compute f(p) for each p.\n\nHmm. Let's consider p and the first position where q differs from p. Let's say that at position k, p has a value a, and q has a value b, where b > a. Then, for q, the rest of the permutation (positions k+1 to n) can be filled in any way, but the inversion count of q must be less than that of p.\n\nWait, but the inversion count of p is fixed, and the inversion count of q depends on the entire permutation.\n\nHmm. So perhaps, for each p, the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have inv(q) < inv(p) can be determined by considering the earliest position where q can differ from p, and then for each possible choice at that position, compute the number of valid permutations for the rest.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible k (the position where p and q first differ), and for each possible choice of b (the element in q at position k), we can compute the number of ways to choose the rest of q's elements such that the inversion count of q is less than inv(p).\n\nBut again, for n=500, this may not be feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps for each permutation p, we can precompute its inversion count. Then, for each possible position k, and for each possible b > a (where a is p[k], and q[k] is b), we can compute the number of ways to choose the remaining elements in q such that the total inversion count is less than inv(p).\n\nBut even this approach may be computationally expensive.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the maximum n is 500. So, for each p, the number of possible positions k is up to 500. For each k, the number of possible b's is up to 500 - k. So, for each p, the number of possible (k, b) is O(n^2), which for 500! is impossible.\n\nBut wait, 500! is way too big. So this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of considering each p individually, perhaps find a way to model the problem in terms of the inversion counts and lex order.\n\nWait, perhaps the inversion count and lex order can be connected via some combinatorial properties. For instance, lex order tends to have higher inversion counts because the earlier elements are smaller, leading to more inversions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for example, the identity permutation has 0 inversions and is the lex smallest. The reverse permutation has the maximum inversion count and is the lex largest.\n\nSo, perhaps for p < q, inv(p) can be less than, equal to, or greater than inv(q). But how often does inv(p) > inv(q) happen?\n\nHmm. It's not obvious.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the problem can be transformed into counting the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's denote this number as X.\n\nThen, the answer is X mod mod.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a generating function or some combinatorial identity that allows us to compute X efficiently.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible inversion count k, we can compute how many p's have inversion count k, and for each such p, compute the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have inversion count less than k.\n\nBut again, for each p, this requires knowing the number of q's, which is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible pair of inversion counts (k, l), the number of p's with inv(p)=k and q's with inv(q)=l, and p < q. Then, sum over all k > l.\n\nBut even this approach requires knowing the counts for each (k, l), which is challenging.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's better to think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming where the state is the current position and some information about the inversion counts and lex order.\n\nWait, let's model the problem as building p and q step by step.\n\nAt each step, we choose the next element for p and q. The goal is to have p < q in lex order, and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how to model the inversion counts as we build p and q.\n\nWait, when building p and q, each step adds an element to p and an element to q. Depending on the choices made, the inversion counts increase accordingly.\n\nBut since p and q are being built independently (except for the lex order constraint), perhaps this can be handled.\n\nWait, but the lex order constraint requires that at the first differing position, p's element is smaller than q's. So, until that point, p and q must be identical.\n\nSo perhaps, the process can be broken down into three phases:\n\n1. Before the first differing position: p and q are identical.\n2. At the first differing position: p's element is smaller than q's.\n3. After the first differing position: p and q can be anything, as long as p < q.\n\nSo, for each possible first differing position k, and for each possible pair of elements a and b where a < b, we can compute the number of ways to build p and q such that:\n\n- For positions 1 to k-1, p[i] = q[i].\n- p[k] = a, q[k] = b, with a < b.\n- For the remaining positions (k+1 to n), p and q can be filled in any way, but p must remain lex smaller than q.\n\nWait, but for positions after k, since p and q have already differed at k, the rest can be anything.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to considering each possible k, and for each possible a < b, compute the number of pairs p and q that satisfy the above conditions.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. The inversion count of p is the sum of the inversions in the first k-1 elements, plus the inversions introduced by the k-th element, and the rest.\n\nSimilarly for q.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the inversion counts can be split into three parts: before k, at k, and after k.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the lex order is determined by the first differing position, perhaps for each possible k, and for each possible a < b, the number of p's and q's can be computed as follows:\n\n- For the first k-1 elements, p and q are identical.\n- At position k, p has a, q has b, with a < b.\n- For the remaining n -k elements, p and q are arbitrary, but the overall p must be lex smaller than q.\n\nWait, but after position k, p and q can differ, but since p is already lex smaller, the rest can be any.\n\nSo, for each k, and a < b, the number of such pairs is (number of ways to choose the first k elements with p and q identical up to k-1, and p[k]=a, q[k]=b) multiplied by the number of ways to complete p and q beyond k.\n\nBut then, for each such scenario, the inversion counts for p and q must be considered.\n\nHmm. This seems tricky, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor a given k (the first differing position), a (p[k]), and b (q[k], where a < b):\n\n- The first k elements of p are fixed as [p_1, p_2, ..., p_k], where p_1 = p_2 = ... = p_{k-1}, and p_k = a.\n\n- Similarly, the first k elements of q are [q_1, q_2, ..., q_k], where q_1 = ... = q_{k-1}, and q_k = b.\n\n- For the remaining n -k elements, p and q can be any permutations of the remaining elements. So, the number of ways to choose the rest is (n -k)! for p and (n -k)! for q, but since p and q are separate, it's (n -k)! * (n -k)! ?\n\nWait, no. Because for the remaining elements, p and q are both being built as permutations, but the remaining elements are all distinct. So, for p, the remaining elements form a permutation, and similarly for q.\n\nWait, no: after choosing the first k elements, the remaining elements for p and q are the same set, but since p and q are different permutations, the remaining elements for p and q are the same set but arranged differently.\n\nWait, no. Once the first k elements are chosen for p and q, the remaining elements are fixed for both p and q. So for p, the remaining n -k elements are some subset, and for q, the same subset. Wait, no: p and q are both permutations of 1..n. So, the first k elements for p are a subset of size k, and for q, it's the same subset? Or is it different?\n\nNo, p and q are both permutations, so their first k elements are both size k subsets of {1, ..., n}, but not necessarily the same.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first k-1 positions, p and q are identical. So for the first k elements, p and q have the same elements in the first k-1 positions, and then at position k, p has a, q has b, a < b.\n\nSo, the first k elements of p are [p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1}, a], and the first k elements of q are [p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1}, b].\n\nThus, the first k elements for p and q share the first k-1 elements, and then differ at position k.\n\nSo, the remaining elements for p are the ones not in the first k elements, and similarly for q.\n\nWait, but since p and q are permutations, the remaining elements for p and q are the same as the remaining elements in the original set.\n\nSo, for the remaining n -k elements, both p and q must be permutations of the remaining elements.\n\nThus, for each k, a, b, the number of possible p and q is:\n\nC(k-1) * (n -k)!^2, where C(k-1) is the number of ways to choose the first k-1 elements (since p and q are identical up to k-1).\n\nWait, but C(k-1) is the number of possible (p_1, ..., p_{k-1}) where p and q are identical in these positions.\n\nWait, for the first k-1 positions, p and q must be identical. So the first k-1 elements are the same for both p and q. So, the number of ways to choose these elements is the number of ways to arrange a sequence of length k-1, which is (k-1)!.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the first k-1 elements of p and q are the same. So, the first k-1 elements are determined once, and for each such choice, the rest can vary.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of ways to choose the first k-1 elements is (k-1)!.\n\nThen, at position k, p has a, q has b, a < b. So, the number of possible a and b is the number of pairs where a is in the first k-1 elements, and b is in the remaining elements, and a < b.\n\nWait, no. Because the first k-1 elements are the same for p and q, and the k-th position is where they differ.\n\nSo, for a and b, a can be any element in the first k-1 elements, and b can be any element in the remaining n - (k-1) elements.\n\nBut since a must be in the first k-1 elements, and b must be in the remaining, and a < b, the number of possible (a, b) pairs is the sum over a in the first k-1 elements, and b in the remaining, such that a < b.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, but perhaps the first k-1 elements are a specific set S of size k-1. Then, the elements not in S are T of size n - (k-1) = n -k +1.\n\nSo, for each a in S, and each b in T, if a < b, then this is a valid pair (a, b).\n\nSo, the number of such pairs is |{ (a, b) | a ∈ S, b ∈ T, a < b }|.\n\nWhich is equal to the number of a in S that are less than all elements in T.\n\nBecause for each a in S, the number of b in T that are greater than a is the number of elements in T that are larger than a.\n\nWait, no. For each a in S, the number of b in T where b > a is |T| - (number of elements in T less than a).\n\nWait, the elements in T are fixed, but for a given a, the elements in T greater than a can vary.\n\nSo, to compute the total number of valid (a, b) pairs, we can precompute for each S (subset of size k-1) the sum over a in S of the number of elements in T that are greater than a.\n\nBut with n=500, this is not feasible.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, the set S is a subset of {1, 2, ..., n}, size k-1. The set T is {1, 2, ..., n} \\ S.\n\nSo, for each S, the number of (a, b) pairs is the sum for a in S of the number of elements in T that are larger than a.\n\nWhich is the same as the sum for a in S of (number of elements in T greater than a).\n\nBut T is the complement of S.\n\nWait, let's consider all elements in T. For a given a in S, the number of elements in T that are larger than a is equal to the number of elements in T that are > a.\n\nThis can be written as |T ∩ (a+1, ..., n)|.\n\nBut since T is the complement of S, |T ∩ (a+1, ..., n)| = (n - a) - |S ∩ (a+1, ..., n)|.\n\nWait, but S is a subset of size k-1, which may not be contiguous.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given S, the minimal element in S is m, and the maximal element in T is M. Then, for a < M, the count is something.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe total number of possible first differing positions is k, which can be from 1 to n.\n\nFor each k, the first k-1 elements are the same in p and q. So, the number of ways to choose the first k-1 elements is (k-1)!.\n\nThen, at position k, p has a and q has b, with a < b.\n\nThe number of possible (a, b) pairs is the number of pairs where a is in the first k-1 elements and b is in the remaining elements, and a < b.\n\nLet me denote S as the first k-1 elements, and T as the remaining elements.\n\nThe number of (a, b) pairs is the sum over a in S of the number of elements in T that are greater than a.\n\nBut for a given S, this sum is equal to the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in S, b is in T, and a < b.\n\nWhich can be written as |{ (a, b) : a ∈ S, b ∈ T, a < b }|.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of (a, b) pairs is the sum over all possible S of size k-1 of the number of (a, b) pairs for that S.\n\nBut this is still unclear.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each k, the number of such pairs is (k-1)! multiplied by the sum over all S of size k-1 of the number of (a, b) pairs for S.\n\nBut that's probably not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given k, the number of (a, b) pairs is (k-1)! multiplied by (m), where m is the average number of such pairs per S.\n\nBut again, not helpful.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem is about counting pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the number of such pairs by considering the parity of the inversion counts.\n\nWait, but I don't think inversion parity directly affects the lex order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as a bipartite graph where edges represent p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), and we need to count the number of edges. But again, this doesn't directly help.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution lies in recognizing that the number of such pairs is equal to the sum over all p of the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have an inversion count less than p's.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p can be computed as (n! - rank(p)), where rank(p) is the number of permutations lex smaller than p.\n\nAnd the number of q's with inv(q) < inv(p) can be precomputed for each possible inversion count.\n\nBut then, for each p, we'd need to find the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p). But how?\n\nHmm. But the problem is that the number of q's that are lex greater than p is (n! - rank(p)), but among those, how many have inv(q) < inv(p)?\n\nThis seems difficult.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem is to find the count of (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), perhaps the answer is equal to the sum over all p of the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p). \n\nSo, the key is to find for each p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nPerhaps we can model this with dynamic programming where we track for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nBut with n=500, this is not feasible directly.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be broken down into considering the inversion count and the lex order as separate parameters in a dynamic programming state.\n\nSo, the state could be (position, current_inversion_count_p, current_inversion_count_q, is_lex_smaller). But for n=500, this would be impossible.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the inversion count can be up to 500*499/2 = around 124750, perhaps it's manageable to track inversion counts in the state.\n\nBut combining this with the lex order is tricky.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem can be addressed by considering the following:\n\nThe number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nWhich can be written as the sum over all p < q of 1_{inv(p) > inv(q)}.\n\nBut how to compute this sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a 2D dynamic programming problem where for each permutation p and q, we track whether p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut again, for n=500, this is not feasible.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem of counting the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's denote this as X.\n\nWe can model X as the sum over all p of the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nSo, X = sum_{p} f(p), where f(p) is the number of q's > p and inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nNow, for each p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p is (n! - rank(p)), where rank(p) is the number of permutations lex smaller than p.\n\nBut among these, we need to count how many have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nHmm. So f(p) is the count of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nBut how to compute f(p) for each p.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p is (n! - rank(p)), and the number of q's that have inv(q) < inv(p) is Y_p. So, f(p) is the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p). So, f(p) = the number of q's in the set {q | q > p lex} ∩ {q | inv(q) < inv(p)}.\n\nBut without knowing Y_p, this is not helpful.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p is (n! - rank(p)), and the probability that a random q > p lex has inv(q) < inv(p) is some value. Then, the expected value multiplied by the number of such q's could approximate f(p), but this is probably not exact.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by noting that for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p is (n! - rank(p)). Among these q's, the number with inv(q) < inv(p) is f(p).\n\nSo, the total X is the sum over p of f(p).\n\nBut how to compute f(p).\n\nAnother Idea: The inversion count is a statistic on permutations. Perhaps we can precompute for each possible inversion count k, the number of q's with inv(q) = l, and for each p with inv(p) =k, compute the sum over l <k of the number of q's with inv(q)=l and q > p.\n\nBut again, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this with a dynamic programming approach where the state is the current position, the current inversion count for p and q, and whether p is lex smaller than q.\n\nBut with n=500, this seems impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for a mathematical pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nLet me consider small values of n to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nFor n=1: There are no pairs, so the answer is 0.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nAll possible pairs are (p, q) where p < q.\n\nThere are two permutations:\n\np1 = [1,2], inv(p1)=0.\n\np2 = [2,1], inv(p2)=1.\n\nSo, the pairs are (p1, p2) and (p2, p1). But p < q is only one pair: (p1, p2).\n\nIn this case, inv(p1)=0 < inv(p2)=1. So, the condition inv(p) > inv(q) is not satisfied. So the answer is 0.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the sample input for n=4 is 17. So perhaps for n=2, the answer is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nTotal permutations:6.\n\nCompute for each pair (p, q) where p < q.\n\nCompute inv(p) and inv(q):\n\nList all 6 permutations and their inv counts:\n\n1.

For n=3, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is 6*5/2=15.\n\nWait, but for each pair, we need to check if inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet me list all 15 pairs and compute inv(p) and inv(q):\n\n1. p1=(1,2,3), inv=0; q2=(1,3,2), inv=1 → 0>1?
