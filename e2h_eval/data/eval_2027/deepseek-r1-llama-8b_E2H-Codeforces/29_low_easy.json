Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then there are multiple queries where each query is like \"di → ti\". For each digit di in the current string, replace it with the substring ti. After all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored when interpreting the number, but wait no, the note says that after replacement, leading zeros are not removed. Oh right, because in the third example, the output is 777, which comes from 222 replaced by 0 for each 2, making 000, but then another substitution: 0 becomes 7, so 777. So leading zeros in the intermediate steps are kept, but when converting to a number, the leading zeros are ignored. Wait, the problem statement says: when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore the leading zeros. Also, if s is empty, it's considered zero.\n\nWait, no. The problem says: when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore the leading zeros. So the final string might start with some zeros, but when converting to a number, those leading zeros are skipped. But wait, the problem also says that the substitutions can result in leading zeros. So how do we handle that?\n\nHmm, but for the purpose of computing the numeric value, we need to ignore leading zeros. So the approach would be to process all substitutions, build the string, then parse it into a number, stripping leading zeros (if any) except if it's all zeros.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that for the computation, leading zeros are ignored. So for example, if the final string is '00123', the numeric value is 123, so mod 1e9+7 would be 123.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently? Because the string could get very long, but since n is up to 105 and each substitution can add up to 105 characters, the total length could be up to around 10^4 or more. But for a programming competition problem, even O(1e5) is manageable.\n\nWait, but building the entire string might be possible, but let's think about the constraints:\n\ns is up to 105 characters initially. Each substitution can replace a single character with a string of up to 105 characters (since sum of lengths of ti is up to 105). And there are up to 105 substitutions. So in the worst case, each substitution replaces a single character into a longer string, leading to 105 * 105 = 11025 characters. That's manageable.\n\nSo perhaps the straightforward approach is to process each substitution in order, replacing each occurrence of the current di with ti, and then build the resulting string.\n\nBut wait, substitution order matters. Each substitution affects the string as it is at that point.\n\nFor example, if substitution A is applied first, changing some characters, then substitution B is applied, which may refer to a digit that was introduced by substitution A.\n\nSo, the substitutions must be processed in the order given.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n\n- For each query, from first to last, perform the substitution.\n\n- For each query, di is a single character, and ti is the replacement string.\n\n- We need to find every occurrence of di in the current string and replace it with ti.\n\nWait, but this can be done via a simple loop: for each query, iterate through each character in the current string, and whenever a character equals di, replace it with ti.\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because ti can be a multi-character string. So, for example, if di is '2' and ti is '00', then each '2' in the current string is replaced by '00'.\n\nYes, so for each substitution, we need to go through each character in the current string and replace each occurrence of di with ti.\n\nBut doing this naively for each substitution could be time-consuming if the string becomes large. But given the constraints, it's manageable.\n\nSo the algorithm steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. Read n, the number of queries.\n\n3. For each query, process it in order:\n\n   a. Split the query into di and ti. The format is \"di->ti\", so we can split on the \"->\" to get these two parts.\n\n   b. For each character in the current string:\n\n      i. If the character is equal to di, replace it with ti.\n\n      ii. Else, leave it as is.\n\n   c. Update the string with the new version.\n\nBut wait, that's not efficient for each substitution because for each substitution, if the string is large, say 1e4, and the substitution",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the numeric value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each query specifies replacing a digit with another substring, and these replacements are applied in the given order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Read the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit with the given substring. This is done by iterating through each character of the current string and applying the substitution where necessary.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a numeric value, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().strip()\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    \n    # Replace all occurrences of di in s with ti\n    new_s = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    s = ''.join(new_s)\n\n# Compute the numeric value, ignoring leading zeros\nif not s:\n    print(0 % MOD)\nelse:\n    # Strip leading zeros\n    if s[0] == '0':\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for i, c in enumerate(s):\n            if c != '0':\n                first_non_zero = i\n                break\n        if first_non_zero is None:\n            print(0 % MOD)\n        else:\n            s = s[first_non_zero:]\n    num = int(s) % MOD\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string and the number of queries are read from standard input.\n2. **Processing Each Query**: Each query is split into the digit to be replaced (`di`) and the replacement substring (`ti`). The current string is then updated by replacing every occurrence of `di` with `ti`.\n3. **Handling Leading Zeros**: After processing all queries, the resulting string is converted to a number, ignoring any leading zeros to ensure the correct numeric value is computed.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: The final numeric value is taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that all substitutions are applied correctly and efficiently, even for the maximum constraints, providing the correct result in a timely manner.",
