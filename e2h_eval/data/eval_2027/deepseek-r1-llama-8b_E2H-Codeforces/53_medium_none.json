    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap, so that's something to consider.\n\nLet me think about the approach. So the problem is similar to finding the longest repeated substring. I remember that there's a sliding window technique for such problems, especially when dealing with substrings.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with the examples provided.\n\nIn the first example, the input is 'abcd'. Since all characters are unique, the only possible substrings that repeat are single characters. So the maximum length is 1.\n\nWait, but wait—the output is 0. Oh, wait no. Wait, the output given in the example is ['0', '3', '2'], but looking back, maybe I misread. Wait, the sample input shows three cases: 'abcd' outputs 0? Or wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let me check.\n\nWait, the sample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and the output is ['0', '3', '2']. Hmm, so for 'abcd', the output is 0? That doesn't make sense because each character occurs once. Oh wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Oh, no—wait, the output is a list of the three cases. So for 'abcd', the longest substring that appears at least twice has length zero? Or maybe the output is the maximum length found for each case. Wait, no, the output is three numbers corresponding to each input string.\n\nSo for 'abcd', the maximum possible is zero? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see: the problem says the output is one number per test case. So in the first case, 'abcd' is four characters, all unique. So the only way a substring can appear twice is if it's of length 1. But wait, each character appears only once. So the maximum length is 0, which implies that no such substring exists? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\" So if there's no such substring, then the length is zero. So in the case of 'abcd', since every possible substring longer than zero occurs only once, the answer is zero.\n\nWait, but wait—if the substring is of length one, like 'a' occurs once, 'b' once, etc. So for 'abcd', the answer is zero because none of the substrings of any length ≥1 appear at least twice. So the output is zero.\n\nSo for the first sample, the output is zero.\n\nThen, for 'ababa', the output is 3. So what's the substring of length 3 that appears at least twice? Let's see: the string is a b a b a. The substrings of length 3 are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (1-3), and 'aba' (2-4). So 'aba' appears twice. So the maximum is 3.\n\nFor 'zzz', the substrings of length 2 are 'zz' appearing twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the sample makes sense.\n\nNow, how do I approach the problem?\n\nI think the approach is to check all possible substrings, starting from the longest possible, and see if any of them appears more than once. Once we find the longest such substring, we return its length.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n2. For each length L, check all possible substrings of that length whether they appear again in the string.\n3. If any substring of length L appears at least twice, return L as the answer.\n4. If none found for L, decrease L by 1 and repeat.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n- For each L, collect all substrings of length L and see if any appears more than once.\n- To do this efficiently, perhaps use a set to store seen substrings. As we iterate through each substring of length L, we check if it's already in the set. If yes, return L. If not, add it to the set.\n\nThis approach should work, but for each L, we might have to process O(n) substrings. The maximum possible L is n-1, where n is the length of the string. So the time complexity would be O(n^2), which is acceptable for n up to 100, as 100^2 is 10,000 operations.\n\nSo let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input string.\n\nThen, for L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n   create a set to track substrings of length L.\n\n   for i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr is in the set: return L\n\n       else: add substr to the set\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, none found, return 0.\n\nWait, but wait: for L, the maximum possible is len(s) - 1. Because the smallest possible substring that can appear twice is of length 1, but in some cases, even longer.\n\nWait, for example, in 'ababa', the maximum is 3, which is len(s)-1=5-1=4? No, wait 5-3=2. Hmm, perhaps I need to loop L from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1, because a substring of length len(s) can't appear more than once.\n\nSo, for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   for each i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       check if it's present elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, for 'ababa', the maximum L is 3, which is less than len(s)-1 (which is 4). So perhaps the loop should go down to 1, but break early if found.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct loop is to try L from len(s)-1 down to 1, and for each L, check if any substring of length L appears at least twice. The first L for which this is true is the answer.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\n# If no substrings found, return 0.\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but wait: for the loop, the upper limit is len(s)-1. Because for L equal to len(s), there's only one substring, so it can't appear twice. So L starts from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, let's test this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\n\nlen(s) is 4. So L starts from 3 down to 1.\n\nFor L=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'abc', 'bcd'.\n\nCheck if any appears again. 'abc' is new, 'bcd' is new. So no.\n\nThen L=2: substrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique.\n\nL=1: substrings 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. All unique.\n\nThus, returns 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → len is 5.\n\nSo L starts from 4 down to 1.\n\nFor L=4:\n\nsubstrings 'abab', 'baba'. Not same.\n\nNo repeats, so proceed.\n\nL=3:\n\nsubstrings are:\n\ni=0: 'aba'\n\ni=1: 'bab'\n\ni=2: 'aba'\n\nWhen i=0, substr 'aba' added.\n\ni=2, substr 'aba' is checked and found in 'seen' → return 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → len is 3.\n\nL starts from 2 down to 1.\n\nL=2: substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). When i=0, add 'zz' to seen. Then i=1, substr is 'zz' which is in seen. So return 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → the maximum L is 4, since 'aaaa' appears multiple times.\n\nWait, no. The entire string is 'aaaaa'. Substrings of length 4 are 'aaaa' starting at 0 and 1. So L=4 is the maximum. So the code should return 4.\n\nWait, according to the code, for L=4, it will find the substrings 'aaaa' and 'aaaa' when i=0 and 1. So 'aaaa' is added to 'seen' when i=0. Then when i=1, substr 'aaaa' is found in 'seen', so returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' → the maximum L is 3, as 'abc' appears twice.\n\nYes, the code would catch that.\n\nWhat about when the string is of length 1? Like 'a' → the output is 0.\n\nBecause L starts from 0, but the loop starts from len(s)-1=0, and the loop is from 0 downto 1? Wait, no. Because len(s) is 1, len(s)-1 is 0, so the loop is for L in range(0, 0, -1), which is empty. So the code proceeds to the end and returns 0. Correct.\n\nWhat about a string like 'abab'? The substrings of length 3: 'aba' and 'bab'. No duplicates. Then L=2: 'ab' at i=0, 'ba' at i=1, 'ab' at i=2. So when i=2, substr 'ab' is found in seen (added when i=0). So returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nWait, but wait: the code for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1). So for len(s) = 1, len(s)-1 is 0, so the loop doesn't run. So the code returns 0.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aa' → the substrings of length 1 are 'a' and 'a'. So the code returns 1.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nlen(s)=2. So L starts at 1.\n\nLoop for L=1:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 2-1+1-1= 0 to 1-1=0? Wait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, for L=1, len(s)-L+1 = 2-1+1=2. So i runs from 0 to 2-1=1.\n\nSo for i=0: substr 'a' → add to seen.\n\ni=1: substr 'a' → check if in seen. It is, so return 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'abacaba' → the maximum L is 3, perhaps? Or longer?\n\nWait, 'aba' appears multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, 'abacaba' has substrings like 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bac' (1-3), 'aca' (2-4), 'cab' (3-5), 'aba' (4-6). So 'aba' appears twice. So the maximum is 3.\n\nYes, the code would find that.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nRead the string from standard input. The input is given as a list? Or as a single line.\n\nLooking back, the problem statement says: the first input line contains the string.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, loop L from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nFor each L, create a set.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n   substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n   if substr in seen: return L.\n\n   else, add to seen.\n\nIf no substrings found, return 0.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → output 0.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → output 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → output 2.\n\nWhich matches the expected outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → code returns 4.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' → returns 3.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabb' → the maximum L is 4, as 'aabb' appears twice.\n\nWait, in 'aabbaabb', substrings of length 4:\n\npositions 0-3: 'aabb'\n\npositions 2-5: 'bbaa'\n\npositions 4-7: 'aabb' → which is same as the first.\n\nSo when L=4, during i=4, substr 'aabb' is added to seen, but wait no: let's see.\n\nWait, for L=4:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 8-4=4 (since len(s) is 8).\n\nWait, i can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nAt i=0: substr 'aabb' → added to seen.\n\ni=1: 'abba' → added.\n\ni=2: 'bbaa' → added.\n\ni=3: 'baab' → added.\n\ni=4: substr is s[4:8] = 'aabb' → which is in seen (added at i=0). So returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, considering efficiency: for a string of length 100, the worst case is O(100^2) operations, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead the string.\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   for each i from 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in seen: output L.\n\n       else: add to seen.\n\nIf no L found, output 0.\n\nImplementing that in Python.\n\nWait, but in Python, the range function is exclusive on the upper bound. So for len(s) = 5, len(s)-1 is 4, and the range is from 4 down to 1, inclusive. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit()\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but in the case where n is 1, len(s)-1 is 0, so the loop doesn't run, and we print 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using a sliding window technique combined with a set to efficiently check for repeated substrings. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Substring Lengths**: Start from the longest possible substring length and decrease down to 1. This ensures that we find the longest repeating substring as early as possible.\n2. **Check Each Substring**: For each length `L`, generate all possible substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings.\n3. **Check for Repeats**: As we generate each substring, check if it has been seen before. If it has, print the current length `L` and exit. If not, add the substring to the set.\n4. **Handle Edge Cases**: If no repeating substring is found after checking all possible lengths, return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and ensuring we check from the longest possible substrings first.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Loop Through Lengths**: The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from `n-1` down to 1.\n3. **Track Substrings**: For each length `L`, an inner loop generates all substrings of that length. Each substring is checked against a set of previously seen substrings.\n4. **Check for Duplicates**: If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, so we print the length `L` and exit. If no duplicates are found for any length, we print 0.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the longest repeating substring is found quickly using a combination of sliding window and set operations.",
