    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How do we calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nHmm. For the first ring, the plate is w x h. The perimeter would be the sum of all the outer cells. But wait, for a rectangle, the perimeter in terms of cells is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each row has h cells, but the first and last are counted once each for each row, except the corners which are counted twice. Wait no, perhaps a better way is to calculate the perimeter as 2*(width + height) - 4. Because the perimeter includes all the outer edges, which for a grid is (width * 2) + (height * 2) - 4 (subtracting the four corners which are counted twice).\n\nWait, let's take an example. For a 3x3 grid: the perimeter is 8 cells. Let's compute using the formula 2*(3+3) -4 = 6*2 -4=12-4=8. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the sample input where the first ring gives 28.\n\nYes, so the number of cells in the i-th ring is 2*(w_i + h_i) -4, where w_i = w -4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1). But wait, wait. Because when you add a ring, it's not just the perimeter of the current rectangle. Because each ring is a new border, but it's built upon the previous. Or perhaps each ring is considered as a separate perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps the i-th ring is the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). So for each ring from 1 to k, we calculate the perimeter of that particular rectangle and sum them up.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the total gilded cells is the sum for each ring i from 1 to k of (2*(w_i + h_i) -4), where w_i = w -4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1).\n\nWait, but wait: for the second ring, the rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4), right? So the perimeter is 2*((w-4)+(h-4)) -4. So for each ring, we compute this value.\n\nBut what if after subtracting 4*(i-1) from w or h, the result is less than or equal to zero? Well, according to the constraints, k is at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ), so it's ensured that all rings can be formed.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n   - Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   - Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   - Add 2*(current_w + current_h) -4 to total\n- Output total\n\nWait, but let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1\nCompute for i=1:\ncurrent_w =3, current_h=3\ncells = 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Total is 8. Matches sample output.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1\ni=1: 7+9=16, 2*16=32-4=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2\nFor i=1: 7+9=16, 32-4=28.\ni=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5.\nPerimeter: 2*(3+5) -4= 16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nRing 1: 5x5 → 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16\nRing 2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1 → 2*(2) -4=0. So total is 16+0=16?\n\nWait, but wait: 1x1 can't form a ring. Hmm, but according to the problem statement, each ring is a border around a rectangle of size (w-4(i-1)) x (h-4(i-1)). So when that rectangle is 1x1, the perimeter is 2*(1+1) -4=4-4=0. So adding zero.\n\nBut wait, when w=5 and h=5, k=2. So the second ring is 1x1. So the ring is 0 cells. So total is 16+0=16.\n\nIs that correct? Well, in the problem statement, the i-th ring is based on the inner rectangle. So yes, if the inner rectangle is 1x1, then the ring has zero cells.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=10, h=10, k=3.\n\nRing 1: 10x10 → 2*(20) -4=36\nRing 2: 10-4=6x10-4=6 → 2*(6+6) -4=24-4=20\nRing 3: 6-4=2x6-4=2 → 2*(4) -4=4\nTotal:36+20+4=60.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total to 0.\n\nLoop from i=1 to i=k:\n\n   current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   add perimeter to total.\n\nPrint total.\n\nSo in Python, the code would look like this.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h is less than or equal to zero? But according to the problem's constraints, k is chosen such that it doesn't happen. So we don't have to handle that case.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nThe input is a single line with three integers w, h, k.\n\nIn Python, we can read from stdin, split the input line into integers.\n\nThen compute the sum as above.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    cw = w - 4*(i-1)\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nTesting this with the samples:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSecond sample:7 9 1 → 28.\n\nThird sample:7 9 2 → 28 + (3+5)*2-4= 12 → 40.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test: w=5, h=5, k=2 → 16 + 0 =16.\n\nAnother test: w=10, h=10, k=3 → 36+20+4=60.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of successively smaller rectangles inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells on each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is calculated as the perimeter of the current rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h) - 4`.\n3. **Summing Up**: We sum the perimeters of all the rings from 1 to `k` to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` which represent the width, height, and number of rings respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height of the rectangle that forms the ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n4. **Accumulate Total**: Sum the perimeters of all the rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that all edge cases are handled as per the problem constraints.",
