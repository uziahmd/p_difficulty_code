After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark than them for that particular subject.\n\nHmm, so how do I approach this? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input consists of n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m characters, each being from 1 to 9. For example, if a student's row is '223', then for subject 1, they got 2, subject 2: 2, subject 3: 3.\n\nMy task is to find out, for each student, whether they are the best in any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nSo, I need to process each student's marks across all subjects and check if for at least one subject, their mark is the maximum in that subject across all students.\n\nWait, but how do I track the maximum marks per subject?\n\nI think I can create an array or a dictionary where for each subject, we keep track of the highest mark achieved by any student.\n\nThen, for each student, we compare their marks against these max marks for each subject. If any of their marks equals the corresponding max, then the student is successful.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and m from the first line.\n2. Read the next n lines, each representing a student's marks.\n3. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark across all students.\n4. For each student, check if any of their subject marks equals the max for that subject.\n5. Count the number of students who have at least one such case.\n6. Output this count.\n\nWait, but how to represent the data. Let's see.\n\nEach student's marks can be stored as a list of integers. So for each student, we have a list of m integers.\n\nFor the max marks per subject, we can have a list of size m, where each element is the maximum of that subject across all students.\n\nOnce we have that max list, for each student, we iterate through their marks and see if any of them equals the corresponding max in the max list.\n\nIf yes, increment the successful count.\n\nThat's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation in Python.\n\nFirst, reading the input. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow, each line being a string of length m, consisting of digits.\n\nSo, for each line, we can split into individual characters, convert each to an integer, and store as a list.\n\nBut wait, the input might come as a single string per line, like '223' for the first sample. So for each student, their string is processed into a list of integers.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- Read n and m: using input().split(), but need to handle the first line which may have leading or trailing spaces? Or perhaps just split into two parts.\n\nWait, the first line is \"3 3\\n...\", so split() should give ['3','3'], which is correct.\n\nThen, for each of the next n lines:\n\nstudent = input().strip()\n\nmarks = [int(c) for c in student]\n\nSo each student's marks are a list of integers.\n\nNow, for each subject s (from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum mark across all students in that subject.\n\nHow? For each subject index, iterate through all students and find the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, collect all the marks from all students, then take the maximum.\n\nYes, that's feasible.\n\nSo, for each subject s:\n\nmax_mark = max( [ student[s] for student in all_students ] )\n\nWe can store this in a list called subject_max.\n\nOnce we have subject_max, for each student, we check if any of their marks in their list equals the corresponding value in subject_max.\n\nSo, for each student in all_students:\n\nis_successful = False\n\nfor i in range(m):\n\n   if student_marks[i] == subject_max[i]:\n\n       is_successful = True\n\n       break\n\nif is_successful: count +=1\n\nYes.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nall_students = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    all_students.append(marks)\n\nsubject_max = [0]*m\n\nfor s in range(m):\n\n    max_val = -1\n\n    for student in all_students:\n\n        if student[s] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = student[s]\n\n    subject_max[s] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in all_students:\n\n    for s in range(m):\n\n        if student[s] == subject_max[s]:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is defined as one who is the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark than them for that particular subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`.\n2. **Store Student Marks**: For each student, read their marks for all subjects and store these marks as a list of integers.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nsubject_max = [0] * m\n\nfor s in range(m):\n    max_val = -1\n    for student in students:\n        if student[s] > max_val:\n            max_val = student[s]\n    subject_max[s] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for s in range(m):\n        if student[s] == subject_max[s]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's marks across `m` subjects.\n2. **Storing Marks**: Each student's marks are converted into a list of integers for easier comparison.\n3. **Finding Max Marks**: For each subject, iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This is stored in an array `subject_max` where each index corresponds to a subject.\n4. **Checking Success**: For each student, compare their marks against the maximum marks for each subject. If they match in any subject, the student is marked as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the number of successful students by leveraging the maximum marks for each subject and comparing individual student marks against these maxima.",
