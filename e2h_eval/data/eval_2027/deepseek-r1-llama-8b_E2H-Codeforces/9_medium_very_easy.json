Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting souvenirs such that their total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is maximized. Petya has n souvenirs, each with a weight between 1 and 3, and a cost. We need to choose a subset where the sum of weights is ≤m, and the sum of costs is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, the constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So we need an efficient solution.\n\nLet me think about the approach. This sounds like a variation of the knapsack problem. But since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can find a way to handle this efficiently without using a full DP approach which might be too slow for n=1e5.\n\nWait, in the standard 0-1 knapsack problem, when items are many but the weight is small, sometimes we can group items by their weight and process them accordingly. Since here the maximum weight is 3, perhaps we can split the items into groups based on their weight.\n\nSo, let's categorize the items into three groups: weight 1, weight 2, and weight 3.\n\nEach group will have a list of costs. For each group, we can sort the costs in descending order because taking higher cost items first would maximize the total cost.\n\nOnce all items are sorted, the problem reduces to selecting some number of each group's items such that 1*a + 2*b + 3*c ≤ m, and a, b, c are non-negative integers, and we want to maximize the sum (sum_a) + (sum_b) + (sum_c), where sum_a is the sum of the top a items from group 1, etc.\n\nBut how do we find the optimal a, b, c?\n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute the prefix sums for each group. That is, for group 1, compute the sum for taking 0, 1, 2, ... items, and similarly for groups 2 and 3.\n\nThen, for all possible a, we can find the best possible b and c such that 1*a + 2*b + 3*c ≤ m, and then find the maximum total sum.\n\nBut the issue is that m can be up to 3e5, and a can be up to the size of group 1. So iterating over a might not be feasible if group 1 is large.\n\nWait, but group 1 is sorted in descending order, so taking more items gives higher cost. Similarly for groups 2 and 3.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible a, the maximum possible b and c can be found quickly. But with a up to 1e5, and similar for b and c, this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider all possible a, and for each a, compute the remaining weight capacity and then solve for b and c optimally.\n\nYes, that makes sense. For each a, the remaining weight is rem = m - a. If rem <0, skip. Then, for the rem, we can take as much as possible from group 2 and then group 3.\n\nWait, but group 2 and group 3 also have their own limits. So perhaps for each a, the maximum b is floor(rem / 2), but no—because group 2's items are sorted, and for each possible b, we can take up to the min of the available items and rem//2.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, we can compute the maximum possible b and c as follows:\n\nAfter choosing a items of group 1, the remaining weight is rem = m - a.\n\nWe need to select b from group 2 and c from group 3 such that 2b + 3c ≤ rem.\n\nAgain, this is similar to a two-dimensional knapsack problem, but since the weights are 2 and 3, maybe we can find a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed a, we can calculate the best possible (b,c) pair. How?\n\nFor each a, the rem is fixed. So for group 2, we can take k items, and for group 3, we can take l items, such that 2k + 3l ≤ rem. The goal is to maximize the sum of group2's top k items plus group3's top l items.\n\nBut how do we find the optimal k and l quickly?\n\nAnother thought: For group 2 and 3, after sorting, the maximum sum for a given weight limit can be found efficiently using a method similar to the unbounded knapsack, but optimized for the specific weights.\n\nWait, but group 2 is sorted in descending order, same for group 3. So for group 2, the prefix sum array is increasing. Similarly for group3.\n\nFor a fixed rem, the maximum 2b + 3c ≤ rem. So for each possible b, the maximum c is floor( (rem - 2b)/3 ), but we need to find the b that maximizes the sum.\n\nBut considering that b can be up to rem//2, which could be up to 15e4 (since m is up to 3e5). So for each a, checking all possible b might be too slow.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nAlternative idea: For each a, compute the maximum possible b and c by considering that for group 2, the sum is computed as the prefix sum, and for each possible b, c can be determined as (rem - 2b) //3, but only if rem >= 2b.\n\nBut even that could be O(1e5 * 1e5) operations, which is 1e10—way too slow.\n\nSo that approach won't work.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps for the two groups (group2 and group3), we can precompute a two-dimensional array that for any possible weight w, keeps track of the maximum sum achievable using group2 and group3. But since rem can be up to 3e5, and group2 and group3 can have up to 1e5 items each, this might be manageable.\n\nWait, but the maximum weight for group2 is 2*1e5 = 2e5, but the rem can be up to 3e5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a 2D dynamic programming problem where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum achievable using group2's first i items and group3's first j items, with a total weight of 2i +3j.\n\nBut again, with i up to 1e5 and j up to 1e5, this would be O(1e10), which is impossible.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, what other approaches can we take?\n\nAnother angle: Since the weights are 1,2,3, perhaps we can use a different kind of DP that tracks the maximum cost for each possible weight. Let's think about it.\n\nWe can create a DP array where dp[w] represents the maximum cost achievable with a total weight exactly w. Then, for each item, we can update the dp array accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is dp[0] = 0, and all others are perhaps negative infinity or zero.\n\nBut considering that the maximum weight is 3e5, and we have n up to 1e5, this might be manageable.\n\nWait, let's see. For each item, which can be of weight 1, 2, or 3, we can process it and update the dp array.\n\nBut in this case, since the items are 0-1 (each can be taken once), the standard 0-1 knapsack approach applies.\n\nSo for each item, we iterate from high to low weight, and for each possible weight, we check if adding the current item improves the maximum cost.\n\nBut the issue is that n is 1e5 and m is 3e5, which would result in a time complexity of O(n*m), which is 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible either.\n\nHmm, so what else can we do? Since the weights are small (only 1,2,3), perhaps there's a way to exploit that.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's separate the items into the three groups. For each group, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, for each possible a (number of items taken from group1), we can calculate the maximum possible sum for group2 and group3 given the remaining weight.\n\nBut the challenge is to find the optimal b and c for each a quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, the maximum possible sum for group2 and group3 can be found using a two-step approach.\n\nFor each a:\n\n1. Compute rem = m - a. If rem < 0, skip.\n2. Now, for group2 and group3, find the maximum sum such that 2b + 3c ≤ rem.\n   To do this, for group2, the maximum possible b is min(b_max, rem//2), where b_max is the number of items in group2.\n   Similarly, for group3, the maximum c is min(c_max, (rem - 2b)/3).\n\nBut since trying all possible b is too slow, perhaps we can find the optimal b and c using a mathematical approach.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed rem, the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of group2's top b items plus group3's top c items, subject to 2b + 3c ≤ rem.\n\nThis is similar to the classic two-variable optimization problem.\n\nIdea: For a given rem, precompute the best possible (b,c) pair.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can try to loop through possible b values, but that's O(rem/2) for each a, which is again too slow.\n\nAlternative approach: Since group2 is sorted, the prefix sum is non-decreasing. Similarly for group3. So for a given rem, the optimal b and c can be found by trying possible c values, and for each c, compute the maximum possible b.\n\nWait, but even that is O(m) per a, which is still too slow.\n\nAnother Idea: For group2 and group3, we can precompute for all possible rem values the maximum sum achievable.\n\nBut rem can be up to 3e5, which is manageable if we can compute it efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute a DP array for group2 and group3, considering their combined weights.\n\nLet me think. Let's create a DP array where dp[w] is the maximum sum achievable using group2 and group3 with total weight exactly w.\n\nWe can initialize dp as all zeros except for dp[0] which is zero. Then, for each item in group2, we process it in reverse order, updating the dp array. Similarly for group3.\n\nWait, no, because group2 and group3 are separate; perhaps we can combine them.\n\nWait, another approach: For each possible weight, compute the maximum sum from group2 and group3.\n\nLet me model this as a two-step process:\n\n1. Preprocess group2 to have a prefix sum array, say sum2, where sum2[k] is the sum of the first k items in group2.\n2. Similarly, preprocess group3 with sum3[l] as the sum of the first l items in group3.\n\nNow, for a given rem, we need to find the maximum sum S = sum2[b] + sum3[c], where 2b + 3c ≤ rem.\n\nWe can try to find the optimal b and c.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible b (from 0 to min(len(sum2)-1, rem//2)), compute the maximum c such that 3c ≤ rem - 2b, and then take the maximum sum.\n\nBut again, this is O(rem/2) for each a, which is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find the optimal b for a given rem by binary search.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if for each rem, we precompute the maximum sum of group2 and group3.\n\nWait, perhaps we can compute for all possible rem up to 3e5, the maximum sum for group2 and group3. This can be done with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort and compute prefix sums for group1, group2, group3.\n\n2. Initialize a DP array where dp[w] represents the maximum sum achievable with group2 and group3, with total weight w.\n\n3. Iterate through each item in group2 and group3, and update the dp array accordingly.\n\nWait, but group2 and group3 are separate, so perhaps the approach is to first compute the dp for group2, then for group3.\n\nWait, perhaps we can compute the dp for group2 and group3 together.\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\n- Start with dp[0] = 0.\n\n- For each item in group2, with value v and cost w, we process it by considering adding it to existing states.\n\n- Then, for each item in group3, do the same.\n\nWait, but the standard knapsack approach processes items one by one, but since group2 and group3 are separate, perhaps we can compute the maximum for any combination of group2 and group3.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible weight w, compute the maximum sum by including some items from group2 and group3.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- Precompute the prefix sums for group1, group2, group3.\n\n- Compute a DP array for group2 and group3, where dp[w] is the maximum sum achievable using any combination of group2 and group3 with total weight w.\n\nThis can be done by initializing dp as 0 for w=0, and then for each item in group2, processing it as in 0-1 knapsack, then doing the same for group3.\n\nWait, but group2 and group3 are processed separately, and the DP is built considering both groups.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\nInitialize dp as [ -infinity for _ in range(m+1) ]\ndp[0] = 0\n\nProcess group2:\nfor each item in group2:\n    for w in range(m, item.weight-1, -1):\n        if dp[w - item.weight] + item.cost > dp[w]:\n            dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.cost\n\nThen, process group3:\nfor each item in group3:\n    for w in range(m, item.weight-1, -1):\n        if dp[w - item.weight] + item.cost > dp[w]:\n            dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.cost\n\nWait, but group2 and group3 are processed as separate 0-1 knapsacks, and the DP is built incrementally.\n\nYes, this way, dp[w] will contain the maximum sum achievable by any combination of group2 and group3 with total weight w.\n\nOnce this DP is built, for each a (number of group1 items taken), we can compute rem = m - a. If rem <0, skip.\n\nThen, the maximum sum for this a is sum1[a] + dp[rem].\n\nWe can then find the maximum over all a of sum1[a] + dp[rem], where rem = m - a.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read all items, split into group1, group2, group3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. Compute the DP for group2 and group3 as described.\n\n5. For each a from 0 to len(group1's prefix sum), compute rem = m - a. If rem <0, continue.\n\n6. Look up dp[rem], add sum1[a], keep track of the maximum.\n\n7. The answer is the maximum sum across all a.\n\nNow, the question is whether this approach is efficient enough.\n\nLet's analyze the steps.\n\nGroup1 has up to 1e5 items. Sorting is O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nGroup2 and group3 may also have up to 1e5 each.\n\nProcessing group2: for each item, we process the DP from m down to item.weight.\n\nIf m is 3e5 and group2 has 1e5 items, the total operations are 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10, which is way too slow.\n\nSame for group3.\n\nThis approach is not feasible because of the O(n*m) complexity.\n\nSo, we need a better way.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the weight of each item is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can find a way to compute the group2 and group3 DP in a way that's linear in m.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the group2 and group3 DP in a way that's similar to the coin change problem, but with the coins being the items themselves.\n\nWait, but group2 and group3 are 0-1 knapsacks, not unbounded. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the items can be considered as part of a single group, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the maximum weight is 3, perhaps for each possible weight modulo 3, we can manage the DP in a way that's more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for group2 and group3, we can precompute for each possible weight w the maximum sum achievable by considering the items' weights as 2 and 3.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the earlier DP approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key insight is that since the items are limited to weight 1, 2, 3, the overall problem can be transformed into a problem where the group2 and group3 are considered as two groups with fixed weights, and the problem becomes finding the maximum sum for a given weight.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each possible weight up to m, the maximum sum from group2 and group3.\n\nBut group2 and group3 are 0-1 knapsacks, so their processing is more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to note that for group2 and group3, the maximum weight is 2*1e5 + 3*1e5 = 5e5, but our m is 3e5. So perhaps we can cap the DP at m.\n\nSo, during the DP processing, we can ignore any weight beyond m.\n\nBut the problem is that group2 and group3 have 1e5 items each, leading to O(1e5 * 3e5) operations, which is 3e10—still way too slow.\n\nHmm, so what's another way?\n\nWait, perhaps we can note that for group2 and group3, the maximum weight we can contribute is m. So for each item in group2, when processing it, we can iterate from m down to the item's weight, but only up to m.\n\nSimilarly for group3.\n\nBut that's still O(1e5 * 3e5) operations.\n\nWhich is way too slow.\n\nSo, that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the items are sorted, perhaps for group2 and group3, we can find that taking a certain number of items in group2 and group3 yields the maximum sum for a given weight.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible weight w, we can compute the maximum sum achievable by group2 and group3.\n\nBut again, the problem is the time.\n\nWait, maybe it's possible to model the group2 and group3 DP in a way that allows us to compute the maximum sum for any weight w in O(1) time, but I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for group2 and group3, the maximum sum can be precomputed for all possible weights, but it's unclear how.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the weight of group2 is 2, and group3 is 3, perhaps we can process the group2 and group3 items in a way that leverages their weights to reduce the computational steps.\n\nWait, for group2, each item contributes 2 to the weight. So for any weight w, the maximum number of group2 items we can take is min(k, w//2), where k is the number of group2 items.\n\nSimilarly, for group3, each item contributes 3.\n\nWait, but again, it's unclear.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute for group2 and group3, the maximum sum for each possible weight, and then for each a, find the best combination.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nWait, let's think about the problem again. The key points are:\n\n- Items can be of weight 1, 2, or 3.\n\n- The maximum weight is m, up to 3e5.\n\n- We need to select a subset of items where the total weight is <=m, and the sum of costs is maximized.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a 0-1 knapsack with items of varying weights, but the number of items is too large for a standard approach.\n\nSo perhaps the solution lies in grouping the items by their weight and then using a more efficient approach.\n\nWait, perhaps for group2, since each item is weight 2, and group3 is weight 3, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nWe can represent the maximum sum for group2 and group3 for each possible weight modulo 3.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible remainder r (0,1,2) when the weight is divided by 3, we can track the maximum sum for that remainder.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find that for group2 and group3, the maximum sum for a given weight can be represented in terms of the number of group2 and group3 items taken.\n\nBut again, not seeing it.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's time to look for hints or think about similar problems.\n\nWait, I recall that when the weight of items is small, a different approach can be used. For example, in cases where the weight is up to 3, you can use multiple passes over the items, each time considering the current weight modulo 3.\n\nWait, perhaps for group2 and group3, we can process them in a way that takes advantage of their weights.\n\nWait, here's an Idea inspired by the \"meet-in-the-middle\" approach but perhaps not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, for group2 and group3, since their weights are 2 and 3, perhaps for each possible remainder mod 3, we can compute the maximum sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another Idea: Since the group2 and group3 can be processed in any order, perhaps for each possible weight w, we can find the maximum sum by considering how much weight comes from group2 and group3.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial approach, and see if we can find a way to compute the group2 and group3 DP efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the group2 and group3 can be processed as separate 0-1 knapsacks, but with optimizations.\n\nWait, for group2, each item has weight 2. So, when processing group2, for each item, we can process the DP in steps of 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process group2 and group3 in a way that for each possible weight, we only consider adding items that fit.\n\nBut without further progress, perhaps I should think of alternative ways.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where each group is handled as a set of items with the same weight, and then for each possible count of each group, compute the maximum sum.\n\nBut that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, another Idea: Since group1 is independent, perhaps for each a in group1, the remaining weight is m - a. Then, for group2 and group3, we can find the maximum sum for that rem.\n\nIf we can compute group2 and group3's maximum sum for any rem in O(1) time, then the overall solution would be O(n) which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the key is to find a way to precompute for all possible rem (up to m), the maximum sum from group2 and group3.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's imagine that group2 and group3 are treated as two separate knapsacks, and for each possible rem, we can compute the best sum from group2 and group3.\n\nBut how to do this quickly.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute for each possible rem, the maximum sum from group2 and group3.\n\nWait, but that's exactly what the earlier DP approach does, but it's computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since group2 and group3 are 0-1 knapsacks, perhaps for each possible rem, we can compute the maximum sum using a greedy approach.\n\nBut that's not correct because it's possible that taking a less costly item with a lower weight could allow more items to be taken overall, leading to a higher sum.\n\nSo, a greedy approach won't work.\n\nWait, but perhaps for group2 and group3, their items are sorted in descending order. So for any rem, the optimal selection is to take as many high-cost items as possible, without exceeding the weight.\n\nSo, perhaps for a given rem, the optimal sum is achieved by taking the top b items from group2 and top c items from group3, such that 2b + 3c <= rem, and the sum is maximized.\n\nBut again, how to find b and c quickly.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for each rem, the maximum sum can be found by trying all possible c, and for each c, compute the maximum b.\n\nBut rem can be up to 3e5, and for each rem, this could be O(rem/3) steps, which is 1e5 steps per rem.\n\nBut group1 has up to 1e5 a's, so 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 steps—way too slow.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the group2 and group3 can be merged into a single group, considering their weights. But since they're 0-1 knapsacks, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps for group2 and group3, we can precompute for all possible rem, the maximum sum.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the group2 and group3 as a single knapsack problem, where for each possible weight, the maximum sum is kept.\n\nBut again, with group2 and group3 being 1e5 items each, this approach is too slow.\n\nSo, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the solution is to realize that the problem can be approached by considering the three groups and precomputing their prefix sums, then for each possible a (number of group1 items taken), compute the best possible sum from group2 and group3 for the remaining weight.\n\nBut the problem is that for group2 and group3, the processing is too slow.\n\nWait, but what if the group2 and group3 are processed in a way that for each possible weight, the maximum sum is stored, but in a way that is updated incrementally.\n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\n- Sort group2 and group3 in descending order.\n\n- Precompute the prefix sums for group2 and group3.\n\n- For each a from 0 to len(group1), compute rem = m - a.\n\n   If rem <0: skip.\n\n   Now, for group2, find the maximum b such that 2b <= rem. The maximum b is min(len(group2), rem//2).\n\n   Similarly, for group3, find the maximum c such that 3c <= rem.\n\n   But that's not necessarily optimal because taking a combination of b and c may yield a higher sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can try all possible b's up to a certain point, say up to 100, and for each, compute the best c.\n\nBut that's an approximation and may not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for group2 and group3, the maximum sum for a given rem can be found by trying all possible c's, and for each c, the maximum b is floor( (rem - 3c)/2 ), and the sum is sum2[b] + sum3[c]. But again, this is O(rem/3) for each a, which is too slow.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires a clever way to compute the group2 and group3 DP in a way that's manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the group2 and group3 can be processed together, and for each item, we process them in a way that's compatible with the small weight.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the group2 and group3 are 0-1 knapsacks, perhaps we can use a sliding window approach for their processing.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved using a branch and bound approach, but that's not practical for coding.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps for group2 and group3, we can precompute the best possible sum for every possible weight, up to m, using a two-pointer approach.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing how to apply this.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's time to look for a solution approach that someone else has used for similar problems.\n\nWait, after some research, I remember that for problems where the weights are small, it's possible to use a different approach. For instance, in the case of coins with denominations 1,2,5, etc., it's possible to use a BFS-like approach to find the minimal number of coins needed to reach a certain amount.\n\nBut in our case, it's a 0-1 knapsack problem, which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the group2 and group3 can be processed in a way that their combined contribution is considered, leveraging their small weights.\n\nWait, here's a new Idea:\n\nFor each possible a, we can compute rem = m - a.\n\nThen, for group2 and group3, we can model the problem as follows: find the maximum sum where 2b + 3c <= rem.\n\nWe can model this as a 2D problem, but perhaps we can find a way to compute this quickly.\n\nWait, for group2 and group3, the prefix sums are sum2 and sum3.\n\nWe can precompute for each possible rem, the maximum sum s = sum2[b] + sum3[c], where 2b + 3c <= rem.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible rem, we can iterate through possible c values, and for each c, compute the maximum possible b.\n\nBut with rem up to 3e5, and group2 and group3 having up to 1e5 items each, this would be O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps for group2 and group3, we can precompute for all possible rem, the maximum sum by considering that group2 and group3 can be added in any order, and for each rem, we can find the optimal c and b.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that group2 and group3 are independent, so for a given rem, the maximum sum is the maximum over all possible c (number of group3 items taken) of (sum3[c] + the maximum sum from group2 for (rem -3c)).\n\nYes! Because 2b + 3c <= rem => b can be at most (rem -3c)/2.\n\nSo for each c, compute the maximum b possible, and then the sum is sum3[c] + sum2[b].\n\nSo, for each rem, the maximum sum is the maximum over c of (sum3[c] + sum2[b]), where b is the maximum possible for (rem -3c) >=0.\n\nBut how to find this quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each rem, we can iterate c from 0 to min(rem//3, len(group3)), and for each c, compute the maximum possible b.\n\nBut with rem up to 3e5, and group3 up to 1e5, this would be O(1e5 * 3e5) = 3e10 operations, which is too slow.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to optimize this.\n\nWait, perhaps for group3, the sum3 increases with c, but 3c increases as well. So for a fixed rem, the function sum3[c] + sum2[ (rem-3c)//2 ] may have a single peak, and we can find the optimal c quickly.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for group3, the sum3 is non-decreasing as c increases, and the term 3c also increases. So for a fixed rem, as c increases, the allowed b decreases, which may cause the sum to increase up to a certain point and then decrease.\n\nThus, the function is unimodal, and we can use ternary search to find the optimal c.\n\nThat's an interesting Idea.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nFor a given rem, the function f(c) = sum3[c] + sum2[(rem - 3c)/2], where c ranges from 0 to min(rem//3, len(group3)).\n\nSince sum3[c] is non-decreasing and sum2[b] is non-decreasing as c increases (because rem-3c decreases, which allows fewer b's to be taken, but the sum2 is the maximum sum for b).\n\nWait, no, as c increases, rem-3c decreases, so the maximum b is (rem-3c)//2, which could be smaller, leading to a smaller sum2. So f(c) may have a maximum somewhere in the middle.\n\nThus, f(c) is unimodal, meaning it increases to a certain point and then decreases.\n\nThis allows us to perform a ternary search on c to find the maximum f(c) quickly.\n\nIf that's the case, for each rem, we can perform a ternary search on c to find the optimal value in O(log K) time, where K is the maximum possible c.\n\nGiven that, for each a, the rem is m -a, and for each rem, we can perform a ternary search on c in O(log (1e5)) steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read all items, split into group1, group2, group3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. For group2 and group3, precompute the prefix sums.\n\n5. For each a (number of group1 items taken), compute rem = m - a. If rem <0, skip.\n\n6. For this rem, find the optimal c in group3 and b in group2 such that 2b +3c <= rem, and the sum is maximized.\n\n   a. For group3, iterate c from 0 to min( len(group3), rem//3 )\n\n   b. For each c, compute the maximum possible b: b_max = (rem -3c) // 2\n\n   c. Take sum3[c] + sum2[b_max]\n\n   d. Keep track of the maximum sum.\n\n   e. However, to avoid iterating all c, perform a ternary search on c to find the optimal value.\n\nBut ternary search requires that the function is unimodal, which may not be the case here. So perhaps we can instead use a binary search approach, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each rem, we can find the optimal c by trying all possible c in a small range around the expected optimal point.\n\nWait, but for a ternary search, it's essential that the function is strictly increasing then strictly decreasing, which may not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each rem, the function f(c) has a single peak, so ternary search is applicable.\n\nBut I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each rem, we can compute the optimal c in O(1) time by considering the trade-off between the number of items taken from group3 and group2.\n\nBut without knowing, perhaps it's better to proceed with the ternary search approach.\n\nSo, for each a, rem = m - a.\n\nIf rem <0: continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the maximum sum s = sum1[a] + max_sum_group23(rem), where max_sum_group23(rem) is the maximum sum from group2 and group3 with total weight <= rem.\n\nTo compute max_sum_group23(rem):\n\nWe can loop c from 0 to min( len(group3), rem//3 ), and for each c, compute the maximum b as (rem -3c) //2, then compute sum3[c] + sum2[b].\n\nBut with c up to 1e5, this is 1e5 operations per a, which is 1e10 operations—too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the maximum sum for group2 and group3 can be found by trying all possible c up to a small limit, say 100, and pick the best. But this is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible c is when 3c is just under rem, but that depends on the sum3 and sum2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal c is when 3c is approximately equal to (2 * b_max), but without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAnother Idea: Since group2 and group3 are sorted, perhaps the optimal c is near rem /3, and for each rem, we can try a few nearby c values to find the maximum.\n\nBut this is heuristic and may not work for all test cases.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with the initial approach, despite the high computational cost, but given that n is up to 1e5, perhaps it's manageable with some optimizations.\n\nWait, but group2 and group3 have 1e5 items each, and processing each would require 3e5 steps, leading to 3e10 steps, which is way beyond what can be processed in reasonable time.\n\nSo perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a multi-dimensional knapsack, but with the constraints that the weight is small.\n\nWait, another Idea: For group2 and group3, perhaps we can precompute for each possible weight w, the maximum sum achievable.\n\nThis can be done with a dynamic programming approach, but with optimizations.\n\nLet me outline this approach:\n\nInitialize a dp array of size m+1, where dp[w] is the maximum sum achievable using group2 and group3 with total weight w.\n\nInitialize dp[0] =0.\n\nProcess",

Each group is then sorted by cost in descending order to prioritize higher costs.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Prefix sums for each group allow quick calculation of the total cost for any number of items taken from that group.\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: A DP array is used to store the maximum cost achievable for each possible weight combination of groups 2 and 3. This array is built by iterating over each item and updating the possible weights.\n4. **Maximizing Total Cost**: For each possible number of items taken from group 1, the remaining weight capacity is calculated. The DP array is then used to find the optimal combination of items from groups 2 and 3 for the remaining weight, ensuring the maximum total cost is achieved.",
