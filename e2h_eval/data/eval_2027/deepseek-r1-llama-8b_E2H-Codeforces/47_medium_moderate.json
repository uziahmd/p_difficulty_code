    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the smallest non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest k.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The LCM of two numbers is equal to (product of the two numbers) divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). So, LCM(x, y) = x*y / GCD(x, y). \n\nWait, but in our case, both numbers are a +k and b +k. Let's denote d = GCD(a, b). Then, since a and b can be written as a = d * m and b = d * n, where m and n are coprime (their GCD is 1). \n\nSo when we add k to both, a + k = d*m + k and b +k = d*n + k. Let's factor this: d*(m) + k = k + d*m, and similarly for the other term. Let me think about the GCD of these two terms.\n\nWait, what's the GCD of (a + k) and (b +k)? Let's compute GCD(a +k, b +k). Since a +k - (b +k) = a - b. So the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is the same as GCD(d*m +k, d*n +k). Hmm, maybe I can find a way to express this.\n\nAlternatively, since a and b have a GCD of d, their difference is d*(m -n), assuming m > n without loss of generality. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the expression (a +k) and (b +k). Their difference is a - b. So, GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(a - b + 2k, a +k). Wait, no, because the GCD(a +k, b +k) is the same as GCD(b +k, a +k - (b +k)) which is GCD(b +k, a - b). Or wait, more accurately, GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(b +k, a - b). Because:\n\nGCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(b +k, (a +k) - (b +k)) = GCD(b +k, a - b).\n\nSo, let me denote c = a - b. Then GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(c + 2k, c), right? Wait, no. Wait, b +k is added, so (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b = c. So the GCD is GCD(b +k, c). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think of it as GCD(c + 2k, c). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the correct formula is GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(b +k, a - b). Because a +k and b +k differ by (a - b). So the GCD is the same as the GCD of (b +k) and (a - b). Let me denote c = a - b. So GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(c, b +k).\n\nWait, but c can be positive or negative. Since GCD is always positive, maybe I should take absolute value. So c = |a - b|, perhaps?\n\nYes, because GCD is symmetric. So, let's define c = |a - b|. Then, GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(c, (b +k)). \n\nWait, but (b +k) is one of the terms. So, for example, if a is larger than b, then a +k - (b +k) is a - b, which is c.\n\nSo, the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is equal to GCD(c, b +k). But since c is fixed, perhaps we can find k such that this GCD is as large as possible. Because, since LCM is (a +k)(b +k)/d, where d is the GCD, making d larger would reduce the LCM.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see: LCM(x, y) = x*y / GCD(x, y). So, for fixed x*y, a larger GCD reduces the LCM. But here, x and y are a +k and b +k, which depend on k. So, perhaps the strategy is to maximize the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k), thereby minimizing the LCM.\n\nBut how can we maximize the GCD? Well, the GCD is at least 1, obviously. So, the maximum possible is when (a +k) and (b +k) are multiples of some d > 1.\n\nBut how do we find the best k?\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Let's denote s = a +k, t = b +k. So, s and t are two numbers differing by c = |a - b|.\n\nSo, s and t must satisfy s - t = c, and we need to minimize LCM(s, t).\n\nBut since s - t = c is fixed, perhaps the optimal s and t are such that their GCD is as large as possible. Because LCM is (s*t)/g, where g is the GCD. So, to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize g, given that s and t are as small as possible.\n\nWait, but s and t are a +k and b +k, so they depend on k. So, the problem is to find k >=0 such that s and t have the maximum possible GCD, while also being as small as possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal k is such that s and t are both multiples of some divisor of c. Because then, their GCD will be at least that divisor, which could be large.\n\nSo, the plan is: find all possible divisors d of c, then for each d, find the smallest k such that both s and t are divisible by d, and then compute the LCM for those cases, choosing the one with the smallest LCM.\n\nWait, but c is |a - b|. If a == b, then c is zero. In that case, adding k to both makes them equal, so the LCM is just a +k, which is minimized when k is zero. So in this case, the answer is k=0.\n\nOtherwise, for c !=0, we need to proceed.\n\nSo, let's first handle the case where a == b. Then, the answer is k=0.\n\nElse, c = |a - b|.\n\nWe can factorize c into its prime factors, and for each possible divisor d of c, we can try to find the smallest k such that d divides both s and t. Because then, the GCD(s, t) will be at least d, which is a good candidate for maximizing the GCD.\n\nWait, but s and t are s = a +k, t = b +k. So, s - t = c = |a - b|. So, if d divides both s and t, then d must divide their difference c. So, any d that divides c is a possible candidate.\n\nSo, the approach is to iterate over all possible divisors d of c. For each d, find the minimal k >=0 such that (a +k) mod d == 0 and (b +k) mod d == 0. Then, compute the LCM for each such case and choose the one with the smallest LCM. If multiple k's lead to the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find all the divisors of c? Because c can be up to 1e9, but the number of divisors is manageable (since for 1e9, the maximum number of divisors is 100 or so).\n\nWait, but even better, the approach is to find all possible d that divide c, and for each d, compute the minimal k that satisfies the conditions.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute c = |a - b|. If c is zero, output k=0.\n\n2. Else, find all the divisors of c, including 1 and c.\n\n3. For each divisor d, check if (a +k) is divisible by d and (b +k) is divisible by d. So, a +k ≡ 0 mod d, and b +k ≡ 0 mod d.\n\nSince a +k ≡ b +k mod d, subtracting gives (a - b) ≡ 0 mod d, which is true because c is a multiple of d.\n\nSo, for each d, we can find k_min, the minimal k such that k ≡ (-a) mod d, and also ensure that k is >=0.\n\nWait, since a +k must be divisible by d, k ≡ (-a) mod d. So, k = m*d - a mod d. Wait, perhaps I should write it as k ≡ (-a) mod d. So the minimal k is (d - (a % d)) % d. Because (a +k) mod d = 0 implies k ≡ (-a) mod d.\n\nWait, let's say a mod d is r. Then, k must be congruent to (d - r) mod d. So, the minimal k is (d - r) if r != 0, else 0.\n\nWait, yes. So, for each d, the minimal k is (d - (a % d)) % d. Because, for example, if a is already divisible by d, then a mod d is zero, so k is zero. Otherwise, it's the remainder needed to reach the next multiple.\n\nBut wait, what about the condition that (b +k) is also divisible by d? Since d divides c, which is (a - b), then (b +k) = (a +k) - c. So, if (a +k) is divisible by d, then (b +k) is also divisible by d because c is a multiple of d. So, for each d, ensuring that a +k is divisible by d automatically ensures that b +k is also divisible by d.\n\nSo, for each d, the minimal k is (d - (a % d)) % d. But wait, a % d can be zero, so when a is a multiple of d, the minimal k is zero.\n\nOnce we find k for each d, we can compute s = a +k and t = b +k. The LCM of s and t is (s * t) / GCD(s, t). But since d divides both s and t, the GCD is at least d. So, the LCM is (s * t) / GCD(s, t). But s and t can be written as s = d * m and t = d * n, where m and n are coprime, because we've chosen d to be a divisor of c, but m and n may not be coprime? Wait, no. Because s and t are both multiples of d, but their GCD is exactly d multiplied by the GCD of (m, n). Wait, no: since s and t are both multiples of d, their GCD is d multiplied by the GCD of (s/d, t/d). But since s - t is c, which is a multiple of d, then s/d - t/d is c/d, which is an integer. So, the GCD of (s/d, t/d) is the same as GCD(m, n), which was earlier considered as 1 because we had a = d*m and b = d*n, and m and n are coprime.\n\nWait, no. Because in the initial step, we wrote a = d*m, b = d*n, with m and n coprimes. But when we add k, which is (d - (a mod d)) mod d, then s = a +k is a multiple of d. Similarly, t is a multiple of d.\n\nBut after adding k, s = a +k is d*m + k. Since k is (d - (a mod d)), that makes a +k a multiple of d. So, s = d * (m + something). Similarly, t = d * (n + something). But m and n are coprimes, so s/d and t/d are m' and n', which may or may not be coprimes.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to compute for each d the value of k, then compute s and t, and then compute their GCD and LCM.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each divisor d of c, compute k = (d - (a % d)) % d.\n\n- Then, compute s = a +k and t = b +k.\n\n- Compute the GCD of s and t, which is at least d.\n\n- Compute the LCM of s and t.\n\n- Keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nBut wait, since for each d, the GCD is at least d, but could be larger. How do we know that the current d is the best possible? Because perhaps a higher d (divisor of c) would result in a larger GCD, hence a smaller LCM.\n\nWait, but the approach of considering all divisors of c is based on the idea that the optimal k must make the GCD of s and t as large as possible. Because a larger GCD leads to a smaller LCM.\n\nSo, considering all divisors of c ensures that we're checking all possible GCDs that could be achieved. Because any GCD of s and t must divide c, as s - t is c.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the maximum possible GCD of s and t, which is a divisor of c, and then among all possible d's, find which one gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for a certain d, the LCM is smaller than for a larger d. Because, although the GCD is higher, the product s*t might be larger. So, it's possible that a larger d might not lead to a smaller LCM.\n\nSo, to find the minimal LCM, we have to compute for each possible d (divisor of c), the corresponding k, compute s and t, compute their GCD and LCM, and keep track of the minimal LCM and the smallest k that achieves it.\n\nBut considering that the number of divisors of c is limited (up to around 10^5 for very composite numbers, but for 1e9 it's manageable), this approach is feasible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute c = abs(a - b). If c is zero, return k=0.\n\n2. Find all divisors of c.\n\n3. For each divisor d of c:\n\n   a. Compute k = (d - (a % d)) % d. This ensures that (a +k) is divisible by d.\n\n   b. Compute s = a +k, t = b +k.\n\n   c. Compute g = GCD(s, t). Since s and t differ by c, which is a multiple of d, g is a multiple of d. But since d is a divisor of c, the maximum possible g is d multiplied by the GCD of (s/d, t/d).\n\n   d. Compute the LCM of s and t.\n\n4. Among all these possibilities, select the one with the smallest LCM. If there's a tie, choose the smallest k.\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider k=0, because sometimes it might give the minimal LCM. But wait, when d is c, the divisor of c is c itself. So, in that case, when d = c, then k is (c - (a % c)) % c. But a % c is a, since c = |a - b|, but when a and b are different, c is positive. So, when d=c, then a % d is a mod c, which is a. So, k would be (c - a) mod c. But if a < c, then a mod c is a, so k = c - a. But wait, in that case, s = a + (c - a) = c, and t = b + (c - a) = (b - a) + c. Wait, but c is |a - b|, so if a > b, c = a - b. So, t = b + (c - a) = (b - a) + c = c + (b -a) = c - (a - b) = 0? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's clarify:\n\nIf a > b, then c = a - b. So, when d = c, then a mod d is a mod (a - b). Since a > b, a mod d is a - (a//d)*d. Wait, for example, if a = 10, b = 6, c =4. Then, a mod c is 2. So, k = (4 -2) = 2. So, s = 12, t =8. Their GCD is 4, which is the same as d. So, LCM is 24.\n\nBut in the sample input, the correct k is 2, giving LCM 24. So, that's correct.\n\nBut what about when d is c, but the k computed is larger than necessary? Or perhaps that's the only possible option.\n\nSo, the process is to generate all possible d's, compute k, compute s and t, and their LCM, then pick the minimal.\n\nBut now, the question is: how do I find all the divisors of c?\n\nWell, to find all divisors of a number, we can factorize it into its prime factors, then generate all possible products.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a function to find all divisors of a given number c.\n\nBut for c up to 1e9, this is feasible.\n\nNow, the steps for code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute c = abs(a - b).\n\nIf c is zero:\n\n   Output k=0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Find all divisors of c.\n\n   For each divisor d in the list of divisors:\n\n      Compute k = (d - (a % d)) % d.\n\n      Compute s = a +k, t = b +k.\n\n      Compute g = gcd(s, t).\n\n      Compute lcm = (s * t) // g.\n\n      Keep track of the minimal lcm and the corresponding k.\n\n   Also, include the possibility of k=0. Because for k=0, d is the GCD of a and b.\n\nWait, but in the code above, when d is the GCD of a and b, then perhaps k=0 is already included.\n\nWait, no. Because when d is a divisor of c, and for k=0, then s =a, t =b. So, their GCD is the GCD of a and b, which is d0, where d0 is the GCD of a and b. But in our case, c is |a -b|, and d0 is a divisor of c. Because, the GCD of a and b is a divisor of their difference.\n\nYes, because any common divisor of a and b must divide their difference. So, d0 divides c.\n\nSo, when we loop through all d's, including d0, the case of k=0 is already covered. So, we don't need to separately consider k=0.\n\nWait, but for d0, k is (d0 - (a mod d0)) mod d0. Since a mod d0 is zero (because d0 divides a), k is zero. So yes, when d is d0, the k is zero.\n\nSo, the code will cover all possible k's, including zero.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 5 10, the output is zero. Because a equals b when k is zero? No, wait the sample input is 5 10. Oh no, wait the sample input is ['5 10'], and the output is '0'.\n\nWait, in that case, a is 5, b is 10. So, c is 5.\n\nSo, the divisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nFor d=1: k = (1 - 5%1) mod 1 = (1 -0) mod1=0. So, s=5, t=10. GCD is 5, LCM is 10.\n\nFor d=5: k = (5 - 5%5) mod5 = (5 -0) mod5 =0. So, s=5, t=10. Same as before.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 10, achieved at k=0.\n\nSo, the code correctly includes that.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is 6 and 10. c is 4.\n\nDivisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor d=1: k=0. s=6, t=10. GCD is 2. LCM is 30.\n\nFor d=2: k = (2 - 6%2) mod2 = (2-0) mod2=0. s=6, t=10. Same as above.\n\nFor d=4: k=(4 -6%4) mod4 = (4-2) mod4=2. So, s=8, t=12. GCD is 4. LCM is 24.\n\nSo, the minimal is 24, achieved at k=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about other divisors? Suppose c is 12.\n\nThen, the divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nEach of these d's will be considered.\n\nNow, for each d, compute k, s, t, their GCD and LCM.\n\nThen, pick the minimal LCM and the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for a particular d, the computed k is not minimal in terms of LCM, but another d may give a better result.\n\nSo, in the code, I need to collect all possible (k, lcm) pairs and choose the one with the minimal lcm, and if there's a tie, the smallest k.\n\nSo, in code, I can:\n\nInitialize min_lcm as a very large number.\n\nInitialize best_k as None.\n\nLoop over each d in the list of divisors:\n\n   compute k.\n\n   compute s = a +k, t = b +k.\n\n   compute g = gcd(s, t)\n\n   compute lcm = s*t // g\n\n   if lcm < min_lcm:\n\n       update min_lcm and best_k.\n\n   elif lcm == min_lcm:\n\n       if k < best_k:\n\n           update best_k.\n\nSo, the code can proceed this way.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement functions to find all the divisors of a number.\n\nImplementing a function to find all divisors of c:\n\nWe can do this by factorizing c into primes, then generating all possible products.\n\nBut for c up to 1e9, trial division is manageable.\n\nSo, the function to find all divisors:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    if n ==0:\n\n        return []\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1):\n\n        if n%i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but for n=0, the problem is undefined, but in our case, c is |a -b|, which is at least zero. So, when c is zero, we handle it separately.\n\nSo, this function should work.\n\nBut let me test for n=4:\n\ni=1: 4%1=0 → add 1 and 4.\n\ni=2: 4%2=0 → add 2 and 2 (but set avoids duplicates, so only 2 is added once.\n\nSo, the set becomes {1,2,4}.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: n=6.\n\ni=1: adds 1,6.\n\ni=2: 6%2=0 → add 2,3.\n\ni=3: 6%3=0 → add 3,2 → already present.\n\ni= sqrt(6) is ~2.44, so i runs up to 2.\n\nSo, the set is {1,2,3,6}, correct.\n\nSo, the function works.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: a = b.\n\nThen c=0, so output is 0.\n\nCase 2: a = 5, b = 10.\n\nAs discussed, returns k=0.\n\nCase 3: a=21, b=31. c=10.\n\nDivisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.\n\nCompute for each d:\n\nd=1: k=0. s=21, t=31. GCD is 1. LCM=21*31=651.\n\nd=2: a mod 2 is 1. So k=2-1=1. s=22, t=32. GCD is 2. LCM= (22*32)/2=352.\n\nd=5: a mod5 is 1. So k=5-1=4. s=25, t=35. GCD is 5. LCM= (25*35)/5=175.\n\nd=10: a mod10 is 1. So k=10-1=9. s=30, t=40. GCD is 10. LCM= (30*40)/10=120.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 120, achieved at k=9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\nAnother test case: a=6, b=10.\n\nAs earlier, the code correctly finds k=2.\n\nNow, what about when a=7 and b=14.\n\nc=7.\n\nDivisors: 1,7.\n\nFor d=1: k=0. s=7, t=14. GCD is7. LCM is 14.\n\nFor d=7: a mod7=0. So k=0. s=7, t=14. Same as above.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 14, achieved at k=0.\n\nAnother test: a=8, b=12.\n\nc=4.\n\nDivisors: 1,2,4.\n\nd=1: k=0 → s=8, t=12 → GCD 4 → LCM 24.\n\nd=2: a mod2=0 →k=0 → same as above.\n\nd=4: a mod4=0 →k=0 → same.\n\nSo, minimal LCM is 24, k=0.\n\nBut what if a=9, b=15.\n\nc=6.\n\ndivisors:1,2,3,6.\n\nd=1: k=0. s=9, t=15. GCD 3. LCM 45.\n\nd=2: a mod2=1 →k=1. s=10, t=16. GCD 2. LCM 80.\n\nd=3: a mod3=0 →k=0. s=9, t=15. LCM 45.\n\nd=6: a mod6=3 →k=3. s=12, t=18. GCD6. LCM 36.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 36, achieved at k=3.\n\nThus, the code would find this.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nc = abs(a - b)\n\nif c ==0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   find all divisors of c.\n\n   for each d in divisors:\n\n       k = (d - (a %d)) %d\n\n       s = a +k\n\n       t = b +k\n\n       g = gcd(s, t)\n\n       lcm = s * t // g\n\n       compare to find the minimal lcm, and minimal k.\n\nFinally, output the best k.\n\nBut wait, in code, when computing k, for a %d, which is a modulo d, but a can be larger than d. For example, a=10, d=3: a mod d is 1.\n\nSo, k = (3 -1) =2. So, s =12, t=13.\n\nWait, but in this case, t = b +k. Wait, but in this case, b is a -c, so perhaps it's better to compute t as (b +k).\n\nWait, but when c is |a -b|, then t = b +k = (a +k) - c +k? No, wait, a +k - (b +k) is a -b = c.\n\nSo, for any d, the GCD is GCD(c, b +k). But since c is a multiple of d, the GCD is at least d.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut first, we need to handle the case when c is zero.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    if n ==0:\n\n        return []\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n\n        if n %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nc = abs(a -b)\n\nif c ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(c)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = None\n\n    for d in divisors:\n\n        # compute k\n\n        rem = a % d\n\n        k = (d - rem) %d\n\n        s = a +k\n\n        t = b +k\n\n        g = math.gcd(s, t)\n\n        lcm = (s * t) // g\n\n        # compare\n\n        if lcm < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = lcm\n\n            best_k = k\n\n        elif lcm == min_lcm:\n\n            if k < best_k:\n\n                best_k = k\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, when d is a divisor of c, but in the calculation of s and t, perhaps there is a case where the same k is computed for multiple d's. But the code correctly tracks the minimal k.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['6 10']\n\nIn code:\n\nc=4.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor d=1:\n\nk=0 → s=6, t=10 → GCD is 2 → LCM is 30.\n\nFor d=2:\n\nk=0 → same as above.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nk=2 → s=8, t=12 → GCD 4 → LCM 24.\n\nSo, the code correctly picks k=2.\n\nSample Input 2: '21 31'\n\nc=10.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor d=1: k=0 → s=21, t=31 → GCD 1 → LCM 651.\n\nd=2: k=1 → s=22, t=32 → GCD 2 → LCM 352.\n\nd=5: k=4 → s=25, t=35 → GCD5 → LCM 175.\n\nd=10: k=9 → s=30, t=40 → GCD10 → LCM 120.\n\nSo, the code picks k=9, which is correct.\n\nSample Input 3: '5 10' → a=5, b=10. c=5.\n\ndivisors are 1,5.\n\nd=1: k=0 → s=5, t=10 → GCD5 → LCM10.\n\nd=5: k=0 → same.\n\nSo, code picks k=0.\n\nAll samples pass.\n\nAnother test case: a=8, b=12 → c=4.\n\ndivisors 1,2,4.\n\nd=1: k=0 → s=8, t=12 → GCD4 → LCM24.\n\nd=2: k=0 → same.\n\nd=4: k=0 → same.\n\nSo, code chooses k=0.\n\nAnother test: a=9, b=15 → c=6.\n\ndivisors 1,2,3,6.\n\nd=1: k=0 → s=9, t=15 → GCD3 → LCM45.\n\nd=2: a mod2=1 →k=1 → s=10, t=16 → GCD2 → LCM80.\n\nd=3: a mod3=0 →k=0 → same as d=1.\n\nd=6: a mod6=3 →k=3 → s=12, t=18 → GCD6 → LCM36.\n\nSo, code selects k=3.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nWhat about when a=10, b=14. c=4.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,4.\n\nd=1: k=0 → s=10, t=14 → GCD2 → LCM70.\n\nd=2: k=0 → same.\n\nd=4: a mod4=2 →k=2 → s=12, t=16 → GCD4 → LCM48.\n\nSo, code picks k=2, which gives LCM48.\n\nAnother case: a=7, b=14 → c=7.\n\ndivisors 1,7.\n\nd=1: k=0 → s=7, t=14 → GCD7 → LCM14.\n\nd=7: k=0 → same.\n\nSo, minimal LCM is 14, k=0.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when a=10, b=15. c=5.\n\ndivisors are 1,5.\n\nd=1: k=0 → s=10, t=15 → GCD5 → LCM30.\n\nd=5: a mod5=0 →k=0 → same.\n\nSo, code returns k=0.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=5. c=2.\n\ndivisors are 1,2.\n\nd=1: k=0 → s=3, t=5 → GCD1 → LCM15.\n\nd=2: a mod2=1 →k=1 → s=4, t=6 → GCD2 → LCM12.\n\nSo, code picks k=1, which gives LCM12.\n\nWhich is indeed better than 15.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when a=0, but according to the problem statement, a and b are at least 1, so we don't have to handle a=0.\n\nAnother edge case: a=1, b=1e9.\n\nc=999999999.\n\ndivisors of c would include 1, 3, etc., but in code, it's manageable.\n\nBut for the code, the function get_divisors is called, which for 1e9 is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the Python code is as outlined.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The goal is to minimize the LCM of two numbers \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). \n   - The key observation is that the LCM of two numbers can be minimized by maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). This is because the LCM of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is given by \\( \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} \\).\n   - We need to find \\( k \\) such that \\( \\text{GCD}(a + k, b + k) \\) is as large as possible.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is crucial. Let \\( c = |a - b| \\). The GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of \\( c \\).\n   - By considering all divisors of \\( c \\), we can determine the optimal \\( k \\) that maximizes the GCD, thereby minimizing the LCM.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute \\( c \\) as the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - If \\( c \\) is zero, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal, and the optimal \\( k \\) is 0.\n   - For each divisor \\( d \\) of \\( c \\), compute the smallest \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are multiples of \\( d \\).\n   - Calculate the LCM for each valid \\( k \\) and track the minimum LCM and corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Consideration**:\n   - Finding all divisors of \\( c \\) involves iterating up to \\( \\sqrt{c} \\), which is efficient even for large values of \\( c \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nc = abs(a - b)\n\nif c == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    divisors = get_divisors(c)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    for d in divisors:\n        rem = a % d\n        k = (d - rem) % d\n        s = a + k\n        t = b + k\n        g = math.gcd(s, t)\n        lcm = (s * t) // g\n        if lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = lcm\n            best_k = k\n        elif lcm == min_lcm:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Divisor Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of a number \\( n \\) by iterating up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) and adding both the divisor and its complement.\n- **Main Logic**: After computing \\( c \\), we handle the special case where \\( c = 0 \\) separately. For each divisor \\( d \\) of \\( c \\), we compute the smallest \\( k \\) that makes both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) multiples of \\( d \\). We then calculate the LCM for each \\( k \\) and keep track of the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, providing an optimal solution within reasonable time complexity.",
