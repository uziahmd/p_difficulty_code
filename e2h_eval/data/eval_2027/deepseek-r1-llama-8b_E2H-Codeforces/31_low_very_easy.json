Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But he can't find some, so we need to determine the minimal number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nWe are given:\n- n: the number of found cards.\n- x: the maximum absolute value any card can have (so each card is between -x and x, inclusive).\n- The second line has n integers, which are the numbers on the found cards.\n\nOur task is to compute the minimum number of cards needed to add such that the sum of all cards (found plus added) is zero.\n\nWait, but wait: initially, Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So when Natasha hid them, she took some subset, leaving Vanya with these found cards. Now, the ones he didn't find are still available for him to find. So when he's looking for more, he can find any of those missing cards—those that are in the set {-x, ..., x} but not present in the current found set.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: what's the smallest number of additional cards (from the possible ones not yet found) that he can add to make the total sum zero.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial set is all possible cards from -x to x, including. So the found cards are a subset of this. So the missing cards are all the other possible ones that are in the initial set but not in the found set.\n\nSo when Vanya finds more cards, they must be from this missing set.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the current sum of the found cards.\n2. Determine what additional cards are needed to reach a sum of zero.\n3. Find the minimal number of such cards.\n\nLet me think about the steps in detail.\n\nFirst, compute the sum S of the found cards. Then, the target is to add some cards (from the missing ones) so that the total sum is zero. So the sum of the added cards must be equal to -S.\n\nBut the added cards can only be from the missing set. So what is the missing set?\n\nThe missing set consists of all integers k where |k| ≤ x and k is not present in the found cards.\n\nSo, for example, if x is 2, and the found cards are [-1,1,2], then the missing cards are -2.\n\nNow, the key is to find the minimal number of cards from the missing set whose sum is equal to (-S). Because adding their sum will bring the total to zero.\n\nSo, how to find the minimal number of cards from the missing set that sum up to T = (-S).\n\nWait, but the missing set may not contain all possible values, but only those not present in the found set.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: given T (the required sum), find the minimal number of elements from the missing set M that sum to T.\n\nWhat's the minimal number of elements needed? It depends on the values in M and T.\n\nI think the first step is to calculate S, the sum of the found cards. Then, T is -S. We need to find the minimal number of elements from M (the missing set) that sum to T.\n\nSo, how do we compute M?\n\nM is the set of all integers k in [-x, x] not present in the found cards.\n\nOnce we have M, we need to find the minimal number of elements from M that add up to T.\n\nWait, but M could be empty. For example, if all possible cards are found, then M is empty. In that case, it's impossible to reach the desired sum unless S is zero.\n\nSo, in that case, if S is zero, then no cards are needed. Otherwise, it's impossible, but according to the problem statement, Vanya can find any number of cards as needed since the initial set is infinite. Wait, no: the problem says that Vanya had infinitely many cards, but after Natasha hid them, he found n of them. So the initial set is still there, but the found set is a subset of it. So, when he looks for more, he can find any of the remaining ones.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that he can find any of the missing cards. So M is the set of all possible cards except the found ones.\n\nSo, when M is empty, meaning all possible cards are found, then he can't find any more. So in that case, if the sum S of the found cards is zero, no more cards are needed. Otherwise, it's impossible. But according to the problem statement, is that possible?\n\nWait, the problem says that the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value. So M is the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. The cards can only have values between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum \\( S \\) of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum for Additional Cards**: The sum of the additional cards needed is \\( T = -S \\). This is because the total sum needs to be zero.\n3. **Identify Missing Cards**: Identify the set of missing cards, which are the integers between -x and x that are not present in the found cards.\n4. **Find Minimum Number of Cards**: Determine the smallest number of cards from the missing set that sum up to \\( T \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Calculate the sum of the found cards\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\nrequired_sum = -current_sum\n\n# Create the set of all possible card values\npossible = set(range(-x, x + 1))\n\n# Determine the missing cards\nmissing = []\nfor num in possible:\n    if num not in cards:\n        missing.append(num)\n\n# Check if no missing cards are available\nif not missing:\n    if required_sum == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\nelse:\n    # We need to find the minimal number of elements from 'missing' that sum to 'required_sum'\n    # To minimize the count, we should try using the largest possible values first\n    # Sort the missing in ascending order for efficient checking\n    missing.sort()\n    \n    # Use a greedy approach: take as many large elements as possible\n    total = 0\n    count = 0\n    for num in reversed(missing):\n        if total + num <= required_sum:\n            total += num\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    if total == required_sum:\n        print(count)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more we need to balance it out to zero.\n2. **Missing Cards Identification**: We identify all possible card values within the range [-x, x] that are not present in the found cards. These are the candidates for additional cards.\n3. **Greedy Approach**: To find the minimal number of additional cards, we use a greedy approach by selecting the largest possible values first. This helps in minimizing the number of cards used, as larger values contribute more to the sum quickly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimal number of additional cards needed or determine if it's impossible to achieve the desired sum with the given constraints.",
