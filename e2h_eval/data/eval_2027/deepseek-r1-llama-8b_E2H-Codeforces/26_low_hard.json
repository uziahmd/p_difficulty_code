Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, z. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is: Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. The triangle is non-degenerate if x + y > z.\n\nHmm, so the conditions are:\n\n1. x is between A and B (inclusive)\n2. y is between B and C (inclusive), but also y >= x\n3. z is between C and D (inclusive), and z <= D\n4. Also, x + y > z for the triangle to be non-degenerate.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that in the inequality, it's A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So, the constraints on x, y, z are as follows:\n\nx must be in [A, B]\ny must be in [B, C], and since y >= x, because x ≤ B and y starts at B.\nz must be in [C, D], and z >= y, because y ≤ C and z starts at C.\n\nSo, the ranges are:\nx ∈ [A, B]\ny ∈ [max(x, B), C]\nBut wait, no. Because x can be up to B, and y has to be ≥ B and ≥ x. But since B is the upper limit for x, x can't be larger than B. So y is between B and C, but since y must be ≥ x (since x ≤ B and y ≥ B), but x can vary within [A,B], so y can be from B to C, but for each x, y can start from x if x ≤ B, but wait no. Because x can be up to B, and y must be >= B, which is the same as x's maximum. So for a given x, y can range from max(x, B) to C. But since x is at most B, max(x, B) is just B. So for any x in [A, B], y can be from B to C, but only if B ≤ y ≤ C. Oh right, because y is in [B, C], but also y must be ≥ x, but x is ≤ B. So for a given x, y can be from B to C, but since B could be less than C, but y also needs to be ≥ x, but since x is ≤ B, and B could be less than C, then y is from B to C.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For example, suppose A=1, B=2, C=3. Then x can be 1 or 2. For x=1, y can be 2,3 (since y has to be ≥ B=2). For x=2, y can be 2,3. So yes, for any x in [A, B], y is in [B, C].\n\nSo the first thing is to iterate through all possible x, y, z values within their respective ranges, but that's not feasible because the ranges can be up to 5e5, which is way too big for brute force.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to compute the count without iterating through all possibilities.\n\nLet's think about the constraints:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], and for each y in [B, C], and for each z in [max(y, C), D], we need to check if x + y > z.\n\nBut even that seems computationally heavy if done naively. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nWe need to count the number of triples (x, y, z) such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\n\nand x + y > z.\n\nAlso, since y can be anything between B and C, but for each x, y can be in [B, C], but also y must be >= x? No, wait the initial condition says that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C. So y is always >= B, and x is <= B. So for a given x, y can be from B up to C, but since y is >= B, which is >= x (since x <= B), so y is automatically >= x. So no, y doesn't need to be >= x beyond that. So the y can be from B to C.\n\nSo the variables are x, y, z with ranges:\n\nx ∈ [A, B]\n\ny ∈ [B, C]\n\nz ∈ [C, D]\n\nAnd x + y > z.\n\nAdditionally, since z has to be",
