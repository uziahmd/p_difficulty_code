In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, each with a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). The goal is to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu).\n\nHmm. So the task is to determine for each possible starting point (the three initial tiles), what is the minimal number of additional tiles needed to form a mentsu. Then output these three numbers.\n\nWait, no—the input is three separate cases. Oh wait, no, looking back: the input is three strings, each representing a tile. So the initial hand consists of three tiles, and we need to compute for each of them how many more tiles are needed.\n\nWait, no, maybe the problem is that the input is three separate tiles, but perhaps they belong to different sets. Wait, no—looking at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, it's three strings, each with three tiles. But then the output is three numbers. Oh, wait, maybe each string represents the state of a player, but no, the problem says \"three tiles in her hand.\" So the initial hand is three tiles. So the output is a single integer—the minimum number of extra tiles needed across all possible options. Wait no, the output in the example is three integers, each for the three tiles? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nInput:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nThe output is ['0', '0', '1']. So for each of the three initial hands, compute the minimal tiles needed.\n\nAh, right. Because each of the three initial hands is a separate scenario. So each line in the input corresponds to a different starting point, and the output is three numbers, one for each.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the three initial hands, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu.\n\nNow, the challenge is to write a function that, given three tiles, finds the minimal number of tiles to add to form at least one mentsu.\n\nSo first, I'll think about how to represent the tiles and check for possible mentsu after adding some tiles.\n\nEach tile is a string like '1m' etc. So I can parse each tile into a suit and a number.\n\nThe plan is:\n\nFor each of the three initial hands:\n\n1. Generate all possible ways to add 0, 1, 2, 3, ... tiles (up to a maximum needed) such that the total tiles (initial + added) can form a mentsu.\n\n2. Find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut considering that adding any tile is allowed, including duplicates, perhaps the best way is to find all possible mentsu that can be formed by the initial tiles plus any number of additional tiles, and determine the minimal number required.\n\nWait, but for each possible mentsu, calculate the minimal number of tiles needed to complete it from the initial hand.\n\nThen, among all possible mentsu, find the one that requires the least addition.\n\nBut since there are potentially many mentsu, this might be computationally intensive, but given the small size, it's manageable.\n\nSo let's break down the steps:\n\nFirst, for each initial hand, process it into a frequency dictionary, where for each suit, we have the counts of each number.\n\nFor example, if the initial hand is ['1s', '2s', '3s'], then for suit 's', the counts are 1:1, 2:1, 3:1.\n\nThen, for each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), check if the initial hand plus some tiles can form this mentsu. Compute the minimal number of tiles needed to complete this mentsu, and track the minimal across all mentsu.\n\nWait, but perhaps the mentsu could be part of a larger set. For example, if the initial hand has four tiles forming two triplets, but that's not necessary because the problem only requires at least one mentsu.\n\nSo for each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), calculate how many tiles are missing in the initial hand, and determine the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut wait, the initial hand has three tiles, so the added tiles can bring the total up. So for each possible mentsu, we can see how much is already present and how much needs to be added.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is as follows:\n\nFor each possible mentsu (each possible triplet or sequence):\n\n- Check how many of the",
