Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about moving between blocks in Crazy Town. Each block is a region divided by roads, which are lines on the plane. Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, but the movement is only allowed if they share a border of non-zero length. So each step is crossing one road.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from my home's block to the university's block.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model how each road affects the possible path. Since each step is a cross over a single road, maybe the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points. Or wait, perhaps it's similar to the concept of regions divided by hyperplanes and the number of such planes that separate the two points.\n\nWait, in computational geometry, there's a concept called the arrangement of lines, and each line divides the plane into two parts. The number of lines that separate two points is the minimal number of steps required to go from one point to the other, moving through these regions.\n\nSo, for each road (line), I can determine whether the home and the university are on opposite sides of it. If yes, then that line contributes to the count because you need to cross it once. So the minimal steps would be the number of such lines.\n\nBut wait, no. Because sometimes, two lines may intersect, and crossing both could take you from the starting region to the destination region via two different steps. But each step is a single crossing of a single line. So if the lines don't all pass through a common point, then each line that separates the two points must be crossed once.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each separating line acts as a barrier that you must cross at least once. So the minimal number of steps is simply the count of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each road (line), check if the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of such lines. That's the minimal number of steps.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nEach line is given by ai*x + bi*y + ci = 0.\n\nFor a point (x0, y0), substituting into the line equation gives ai*x0 + bi*y0 + ci. This value's sign determines which side of the line the point is on.\n\nIf for a line, the home and university have values with opposite signs, then the line separates them.\n\nSo for each line, compute s_h = ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci and s_u = ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci. If s_h * s_u < 0, then the line separates the two points.\n\nThus, the answer is the number of lines where this condition holds.\n\nWait, but what if the line doesn't separate them? Then, their regions are on the same side of the line, so you don't need to cross it.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read home coordinates (x1, y1).\n- Read university coordinates (x2, y2).\n- Read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n- For each line, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n- Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n- If s1*s2 < 0, increment the count.\n- Output the count.\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, let's think about the example provided.\n\nIn the sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), University is (-1,-1). There are 3 roads.\n\nFirst road: 0x + 1y + 0 =0 → y=0. Home is (1,1) → s1=1*1 + 0*1 +0=1>0. University is (-1,-1): 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1<0. So s1*s2=-1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y+0=0 → x=0. Home is x=1>0, university x=-1<0 → count +=1.\n\nThird road:1x+1y-3=0. For home:1+1-3= -1. For university: (-1)+(-1)-3= -5. Both negative. So s1*s2= positive. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: if two lines cross each other, but both separate the points, then the count is 2, meaning you need to cross both lines.\n\nSo, the code is simple.\n\nNow, considering the constraints:\n\nn can be up to 300, which is manageable.\n\nEach calculation is O(1), so overall time is acceptable.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Integer overflow?",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a road defined by a line equation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The town is divided into blocks by roads (lines). Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. If two points are on opposite sides of a line, you must cross that line at least once.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road (line), check if the home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, count that road as a necessary crossing.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of home and university.\n   - For each road, determine the side of the line where home and university lie.\n   - Count the number of lines where home and university lie on opposite sides.\n4. **Efficiency**: Each line check is done in constant time, making the solution efficient even for the maximum input size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Line Check**: For each line, compute the value of the line equation at home and university. If these values have opposite signs, the line separates the two points.\n- **Counting Crossings**: Each separating line contributes to the count, which represents the minimum steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of steps by leveraging geometric properties of lines and their separation of points.",
