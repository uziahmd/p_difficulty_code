Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about moving between blocks in Crazy Town. Each block is a region divided by roads, which are lines on the plane. The movement between blocks is allowed only if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, each step can move from one block to an adjacent block, but not just across a point where two roads intersect.\n\nMy task is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from my home's block to the university's block. Both home and university are not on any road, which is important because that means each lies entirely within a single block.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Well, the key here is to determine which side of each road the home and university are on. Because for each road, if the home and university are on opposite sides, then that road separates their blocks, meaning there's a boundary between them. The minimal steps would be determined by the number of such separating roads, but perhaps not directly—because maybe some roads are redundant or grouped in a way that affects the path.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each road that separates the two points contributes a certain 'barrier' that must be crossed. But since moving through steps allows crossing multiple roads at once (if they form a connected path), the minimal number of steps might not just be the count of separating roads. Or maybe it is?\n\nWait, think about it differently. Each time you cross a road, you change the region you're in. So, if home and university are separated by k different roads, then you need to cross each of those roads once. But wait, maybe some roads can be crossed together, as long as their boundaries are adjacent. Hmm, but roads are straight lines; their arrangement could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road contributes a necessary crossing, and each crossing can be done in a single step if the roads are arranged in a way that allows it. Or perhaps each road is a separate step.\n\nWait, no. Because imagine three roads all passing through the same point, creating a sort of cross. If the home and university are on opposite sides of all three, then you'd have to cross each road, but maybe you can't do them all in one step. So, perhaps the minimal steps are the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nWait, but how do roads affect the regions? Each road divides the plane into two parts. So, for each road, home and university are either on the same side or opposite sides. If they're on opposite sides, then that road contributes 1 to the minimal steps.\n\nSo, the minimal number of steps is the count of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem: let's see.\n\nIn the example, the output is 2 for both home and university. Looking at the input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 3 roads.\n\nRoad 1: 0x + 1y - 0 = 0 → y=0. Home is (1,1) which is above, university is (-1,-1) which is below. So this road separates them.\n\nRoad 2: 1x + 0y + 0 =0 → x=0. Home is to the right, university to the left. So this also separates.\n\nRoad 3: 1x + 1y -3 =0 → x + y =3. For home: 1+1=2 <3 → below. University: -1 + (-1)= -2 <3 → also below. So both are on the same side. So this road doesn't separate them.\n\nSo total roads separating them: 2. Hence, the output is 2.\n\nYes, that matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems to be: for each road, check whether home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of lines (roads) where home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\nHow do we compute that? For each line ax + by + c =0, substitute the home and university coordinates and see if the products of the results are less than zero. If so, they are on opposite sides, hence this road contributes to the count.\n\nSo, for each line, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If f1 * f2 < 0, then the points are on opposite sides.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\n- Read home (x1,y1) and university (x2,y2).\n\n- For each of n roads, read a, b, c.\n\n- For each road, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\n- Compute f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\n- If f1*f2 < 0, increment the count.\n\n- Finally, output the count.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, considering the constraints:\n\nn can be up to 300, which is manageable.\n\nEach a, b, c can be up to 1e6 in absolute value, but when multiplied with x1, y1, etc., which are up to 1e6, the product can be up to (1e6)^3, which is 1e18. So using 64-bit integers is safe in Python.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor each of n lines:\n\n   Read a, b, c.\n\n   Compute f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n   Compute f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n   If f1 * f2 < 0:\n\n       count +=1\n\nPrint count.\n\nWait, that's it? That's the solution?\n\nBut why does this work? Because each separating line contributes exactly one step, as you have to cross each line once, regardless of how other lines are arranged. Because each such line is a boundary that must be crossed, and each crossing can be done in one step.\n\nYes, because each such line is a boundary that separates the two regions. So to move from the home's block to the university's block, you need to cross each such line once.\n\nSo the minimal steps are exactly the number of such lines.\n\nThis makes the problem much simpler than it initially seemed.\n\nSo the code is as described.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nCompute for each line:\n\nFirst line: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. For university: 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1. 1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: 1*1 +0*1 +0=1. For university: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0= -1. 1*-1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nTotal count is 2. Output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if two lines are parallel and cross each other, but home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then the count is 2.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of strings, each string representing a line. Or, wait, looking at the input format:\n\nThe first line is home coordinates, second is university, third is n, then n lines follow.\n\nSo, the code can read each line accordingly.\n\nIn Python, reading via input() may have issues with large inputs, but for n=300, it's manageable.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from the first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from the second line.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nThe first line is '1 1', which is read as x1=1, y1=1.\n\nSecond line is '-1 -1' → x2=-1, y2=-1.\n\nThird line is 2.\n\nThen, two lines:\n\nLine 1: 0 1 0 → val1=0*1+1*1+0=1. val2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count becomes 1.\n\nLine 2: 1 0 0 → val1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1. val2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 =-1. Product is -1 <0 → count becomes 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose a line that doesn't separate the points. For example, home and university are on same side.\n\nE.g., line 3x +4y +5=0.\n\nCompute for home (1,1): 3+4+5=12>0.\n\nUniversity (2,2): 6+8+5=19>0. So same sign → not counted.\n\nSo code correctly ignores it.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads in Crazy Town are defined by linear equations, and each road divides the plane into two regions. The goal is to determine how many such roads separate the home block from the university block. Each separating road contributes exactly one step because you must cross it to move between blocks.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), we can determine on which side of the road a point (home or university) lies. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road separates their respective blocks, and thus must be crossed.\n\n3. **Algorithm**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at the coordinates of the home and the university. If these values have opposite signs, the road separates the two points, and we count this road as a necessary step.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints, checking each road in this manner is efficient and feasible within the problem's limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads. Each subsequent line provides the coefficients of a road's equation.\n\n2. **Checking Each Road**: For each road, compute the value of the equation at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, it means the road separates the two points, and we increment our step count.\n\n3. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimum number of steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the necessary steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation of points, ensuring an optimal solution within the given constraints.",
