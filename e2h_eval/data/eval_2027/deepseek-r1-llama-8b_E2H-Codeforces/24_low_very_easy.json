She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right. But she can't move beyond the currently available tabs because some may already be closed.\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position.\n\nSo, for example, if she's at position i, closing to the left would close all tabs before i that are still open. Similarly for the right.\n\nI need to model the steps she takes to close these tabs in the least amount of time.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, let's consider what needs to be done. The initial state is that all tabs are open. She needs to close any tabs that are less than l or greater than r.\n\nSo, the steps involve:\n\n1. Moving the cursor to a position where she can close the necessary tabs.\n2. Closing those tabs.\n3. Possibly moving again to another position and closing more tabs.\n\nWait, but each action takes a second. So each movement and each close counts as a separate second.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nCase 1: All the tabs from l to r are already open, and nothing else. Then, no action is needed. So output is 0.\n\nCase 2: Some tabs are outside [l, r]. She needs to close them.\n\nThe strategy would involve moving to the correct positions to close the left and right parts.\n\nLet me think about the structure.\n\nShe might need to:\n\n- Move to the left edge (position l) to close the left tabs, but only if there are tabs to the left of l that need to be closed.\n\nSimilarly, she might need to move to the right edge (r) to close the right tabs.\n\nBut sometimes, she can close multiple tabs in one move. Like, if she's at position x, closing to the right will close all tabs after x, which could include a lot.\n\nSo the steps might be:\n\n1. Determine if there are tabs to the left of l (i.e., l > 1) that need to be closed. Similarly, determine if there are tabs to the right of r (i.e., r < n) that need to be closed.\n\nIf neither exists, then output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to calculate the steps required to close both sides.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nleft_close = (l > 1)\nright_close = (r < n)\n\nSo, for each side that needs to be closed, how many steps are needed?\n\nFor the left side:\n\nShe needs to reach a position where she can close the left tabs. The optimal position is l, because that way she can close all tabs to the left of l (which are exactly 1 to l-1). So, moving from pos to l, and then close left.\n\nThe steps for moving to l: the distance is |pos - l|, each step is one second. Then, closing is +1 second. So total for left is (distance) + 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. For example, if she can reach a position where more tabs can be closed in a single step.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because closing to the left when at position i will close everything to the left of i. So, to close all the left tabs, the best is to go to l and close.\n\nSame for the right: go to r and close.\n\nBut what if l is not in the initial state? No, l is given, so it's part of the target.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial state is that all tabs are open, including l and r. So, she can go to l, close left, which will remove all tabs before l. Similarly, she can go to r, close right, which removes all tabs after r.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor each side that needs to be closed, compute the steps required to move to the respective end and close.\n\nBut wait, perhaps she can optimize the order. For example, if she first closes the left, then she might not need to move far to close the right.\n\nSo, the total steps would be the sum of steps to close left and right, plus any movement between the two.\n\nWait, but the movement after closing left might be needed if she's moving towards the right end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps would be the maximum of the two distances, because she can close one side, then move",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the steps required to move the cursor and close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closing Tabs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r` that need to be closed. This can be checked by seeing if `l > 1` (tabs to the left) or `r < n` (tabs to the right).\n2. **Calculate Steps for Closing Left Tabs**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, compute the steps needed to move the cursor to `l` and then close the left tabs.\n3. **Calculate Steps for Closing Right Tabs**: Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of `r`, compute the steps needed to move the cursor to `r` and then close the right tabs.\n4. **Optimize Movement**: If both sides need closing, consider the optimal order to minimize movement. For example, moving to one end first and then the other might save some steps compared to moving back and forth.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft = False\nright = False\n\nif l > 1:\n    left = True\nif r < n:\n    right = True\n\ntime = 0\n\nif left:\n    # Move to l and close left\n    distance_left = abs(pos - l)\n    time += distance_left + 1  # movement + close\n\nif right:\n    # Move to r and close right\n    distance_right = abs(pos - r)\n    time += distance_right + 1  # movement + close\n\n# Now, if both left and right are true, we have to account for the movement between l and r if it's necessary\nif left and right:\n    # After closing left, she is at l, then she needs to move to r\n    # But wait, after closing left, the rightmost open tab is r, but if she already moved to l before, perhaps the path is different.\n    # Wait, no: after closing left, the right side is still from l to r. So when she moves from l to r, it's just the distance between l and r.\n    # Or, perhaps she can close right first, then move to l.\n    # We need to choose the minimal approach.\n    \n    # Calculate the minimal steps when both are needed.\n    # After moving to l and closing left, she needs to go to r and close right.\n    # The total movement is (distance from pos to l) + 1 (close) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (close).\n    # Alternatively, if she closes right first, it's (distance to r) + 1 + (distance from r to l) +1.\n    # The minimal is min( (dl + 1 + dr +1), (dr + 1 + dl +1) ), which is same as dl + dr + 2.\n    # But wait, maybe she can do better. For example, if she can move directly from l to r without having to go back.\n    # So, the minimal steps would be the maximum of (dl + dr) + 2, because she can move from pos to l, close left, then move to r and close right. But the total movement is dl + (r - l) steps.\n    # Wait, perhaps it's better to model the combined movement.\n\n    # Let me think again. When both left and right need to be closed:\n    # She needs to move to l, close left, then move to r, close right.\n    # The total movement is |pos - l| + (r - l) + |pos - r| ? No, because after closing left, the available tabs are from l to r, so moving from l to r is (r - l) steps.\n    # Alternatively, if she moves to r first, it's |pos - r| + (r - l) + |pos - l| ?\n\n    # Wait, perhaps the minimal movement is max(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) * 2 minus something? Not sure.\n\n    # Another approach: the minimal steps would be the sum of the individual steps, but considering that after closing one side, the other side's movement is from that point.\n\n    # Alternatively, the minimal steps when both are needed is (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + (distance from r to current pos) + 2.\n\n    # Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the steps as follows:\n    # She needs to close both sides. So she can either:\n    # 1. Close left first, then move to r and close right. The total steps would be (distance to l) + 1 (close) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (close).\n    # 2. Close right first, then move to l and close left. The total steps would be (distance to r) + 1 (close) + (distance from r to l) + 1 (close).\n\n    # So the minimal steps between these two options is the minimum of the two.\n\n    # Let's compute both options:\n    option1 = (abs(pos - l) + 1) + (r - l) + 1\n    option2 = (abs(pos - r) + 1) + (r - l) + 1\n\n    # Because after closing one side, the other side requires moving from the respective end to the other end, which is (r - l) steps.\n\n    # Wait, no. Because after closing left, the available tabs are l to r. So moving from l to r is (r - l) steps. Similarly for the other way.\n\n    # So option1 is (steps to l + 1) + (steps from l to r) + 1.\n    # Which is (abs(pos - l) + 1) + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - l) + r - l + 2.\n\n    # Similarly, option2 is (abs(pos - r) + 1) + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - r) + r - l + 2.\n\n    # So, the minimal steps when both are needed is the minimum of these two options.\n\n    # But wait, perhaps there's a more efficient way. For example, she could close one side, then move to the other end and close, but maybe the path is shorter.\n\n    # Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is (max(l, r) - min(l, r)) * 2 + ... Hmm, not sure.\n\n    # Another approach: think about the initial position and the positions needed to close.\n\n    # Let me try an example. Suppose pos is 3, l=2, r=4, n=6.\n\n    # She needs to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5,6). So:\n\n    # Option 1: Close left first.\n    # Move from 3 to 2 (1 step), close left (1 step). Now at 2.\n    # Then move from 2 to 4 (2 steps), close right (1 step). Total: 1+1+2+1=5 steps.\n\n    # Option 2: Close right first.\n    # Move from 3 to 4 (1 step), close right (1 step). Now at 4.\n    # Then move from 4 to 2 (2 steps), close left (1 step). Total: 1+1+2+1=5 steps.\n\n    # Both options take 5 steps.\n\n    # What if pos is 1?\n\n    # l=2, r=4. She needs to close left? No, because l>1 is true (l=2>1). So left is to be closed.\n\n    # She is at 1, needs to close left (nothing, because l=2>1, so tabs 1 are to the left of l=2). Wait, wait, no. l=2, so tabs less than 2 (only 1) need to be closed.\n\n    # So, she needs to move from 1 to 2, close left. That's 1 step movement, 1 step to close. Then, she can move to 4, close right. From 2 to 4 is 2 steps, plus 1 step to close. Total 1+1+2+1=5 steps.\n\n    # Another example: pos is 5, l=2, r=4.\n\n    # She needs to close right (since r=4 <5). So she can move from 5 to4, close right (1 step movement, 1 step close). But what about the left? Since l=2, she also needs to close tabs 1 and 2-1=1. So she needs to move to 2, close left.\n\n    # So, after closing right, she is at 4. Now she needs to move to 2, which is 2 steps, then close left (1 step). So total steps: 1 (move to4) +1 (close right) +2 (move to2) +1 (close left) =5 steps.\n\n    # So, in cases where both left and right need to be closed, the minimal steps are the sum of the steps for each side, plus the movement between the two ends.\n\n    # So, generalizing:\n\n    # If both left and right need to be closed, the total steps are:\n\n    # (steps to close left) + (steps to close right) + (movement between the two ends after the first close)\n\n    # But how?\n\n    # After closing left, the cursor is at l. To close right, she needs to move from l to r, which is (r-l) steps.

For each side that needs closing, we calculate the steps required to move to the respective end and close the tabs. If both sides need closing, we consider both possible orders (closing left first or right first) and choose the one with fewer steps. The total steps are the sum of the steps for each side plus any additional movement required between the two ends if both sides need to be closed.",
