The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So the i-th task can only be done after she's handled all earlier ones.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first test case, n=4, m=3, and the tasks are 3,2,3. The optimal path is 1 → 2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. That's 6 steps.\n\nWait, why is that the best? Let's see: She starts at 1. Then she needs to reach 3 for the first task, which is three steps away (1→2→3). But wait, no, because moving from 3 to 4 is two more steps. Oh, but the initial position is 1, so she can't go directly. So she has to go through 2, then 3, then 4, then back to 1, and then 2, then 3 again. Hmm, but why isn't there a shorter way?\n\nOh right, because each task must be done in order. So for task 1, she must be at 3 by the time she finishes task 1. Then, after that, she can do task 2 at 2, but that's after task 1. Wait, no—task 2 is the second task, so she has to be at 2 before she does task 2. So perhaps the approach is to process the tasks in order, making sure each step is covered.\n\nSo, the plan is to process each task in the order they are given. For each task, she might need to move from her current position to the required house. But wait, no—the order is fixed as per the tasks' indices. So the i-th task must be done after all j < i are done, and she must be at ai when she does the i-th task.\n\nWait, no: the note says that the i-th task must be completed after all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order is the order of the tasks as given. So for each task in the list, we need to ensure that she's at ai when she completes that task.\n\nSo for each task in the sequence, she has to go to ai. The question is, how to plan her movements such that the total time is minimized.\n\nHmm. So the key is to figure out, for each task, where she is coming from, and what's the minimal path to get to ai, considering that she may have to loop around the ring.\n\nWait, let's model this. Suppose we have a list of tasks a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. We process them in order. For each a_i, she must be at that position when she does the i-th task. So for each i, she has to arrive at a_i at some time, and then spend time doing the task, but the task itself doesn't take any time. So the movement is the main cost.\n\nBut how do the positions change? Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, she is at position 1 at time 0.\n\nFor each task i from 1 to m:\n\nShe must be at a_i at time t_i, and the total time up to t_i must be the sum of the movements from her previous position to a_i.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because between tasks, she might have to make loops or take different paths. So for each i, the time taken to move from the previous position (let's call it prev) to a_i is the minimal possible steps needed.\n\nBut how do we calculate that?\n\nThe ring is circular, so the distance between two points can be computed as the minimal steps. For example, from position x to y, the minimal steps are min( (y - x) mod n, (x - y) mod n ). Wait, but since the traffic is clockwise, moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered one would require going the other way around the ring.\n\nWait, the ring is arranged in a circle. So moving from house 1 to 2 is +1, 2 to 3 is +1, etc., but 4 to 1 is +1 because it's the next in the ring. So the distance from x to y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - x + y).\n\nYes. So for any two",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and must move clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task requires her to be at a specific house at a given point in time, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key challenge is to find the shortest path for Xenia to move from her current position to each required house in the order of her tasks. Since the houses are arranged in a ring, we can compute the minimal steps needed to move between any two houses using modular arithmetic.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each task, Xenia must move from her current position to the required house. The minimal steps between two houses on a ring can be computed as the shorter of the clockwise or counter-clockwise paths. This can be efficiently calculated using modulo operations.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Start from the initial position (house 1).\n   - For each task in the sequence, compute the minimal steps required to move from the current position to the required house.\n   - Accumulate these steps to get the total time taken.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (m up to 105).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    # Compute distance from current to a\n    if a >= current:\n        dist = a - current\n    else:\n        dist = n - current + a\n    total_time += dist\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 with `total_time` initialized to 0.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task, compute the minimal steps required to move from the current house to the required house. Update the total time and set the current position to the required house.\n- **Output**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed, which represents the minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always take the shortest path around the ring road, minimizing the total time taken to complete all tasks.",
