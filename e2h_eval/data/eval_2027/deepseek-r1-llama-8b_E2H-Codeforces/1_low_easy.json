    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How do we calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nHmm. For a rectangle of size a x b, the perimeter (which is the ring) would be 2*(a + b - 2). Because for a single row and column, the perimeter would be 4 (like a square), but wait no. Wait, for a 3x3 grid, the perimeter is 8 cells (each side has 3, but corners are counted once each, so 3*4 -4 = 8). So yes, the formula 2*(a + b - 2) gives the correct count.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current dimensions are (w -4*(i-1)) and (h -4*(i-1)), right? But wait, no. Wait, the initial ring is i=1: the outermost ring. Its dimensions are w x h. So the number of cells is 2*(w + h - 2).\n\nThen for i=2: the inner ring. Its dimensions are (w-4) x (h-4). So cells added are 2*((w-4)+(h-4)-2) = 2*(w + h - 10).\n\nBut wait, what if after subtracting 4*(i-1), the dimensions become less than or equal to 2? Because each ring must form a valid rectangle. So for example, if w is 3, then after one ring, it becomes 3-4 = -1, which isn't possible. So the maximum number of rings k is constrained such that for each i up to k, the width and height are at least 3. Or wait, maybe the constraints given in the input ensure that k is valid.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the input constraints say that k is <= floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So that ensures that for each ring, the dimensions are valid. So I don't have to worry about invalid k values.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute 2*( (w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 ), and sum them all.\n\nWait, let me see with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\nRing 1: w=3, h=3. Cells: 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1.\n\nOnly one ring: 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) =28. Correct.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2.\n\nRing 1: 2*(7+9-2)= 2*14=28.\n\nRing 2: w=7-4=3, h=9-4=5. So 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the plan is to loop from 1 to k, for each step compute the current a and b as w -4*(i-1) and h -4*(i-1), then calculate 2*(a +b -2) and sum.\n\nSo how to implement this in code.\n\nRead the input as three integers: w, h, k.\n\nCompute the sum s=0.\n\nFor i in 1..k:\n\n   a = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   b = h -4*(i-1)\n\n  ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of rings. Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one, and each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring forms a border around a smaller rectangle. The i-th ring is formed by reducing the dimensions of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side). The number of cells in each ring is calculated using the perimeter formula for a rectangle, which is \\(2 \\times (a + b - 2)\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the dimensions of the rectangle.\n2. **Summing Up Cells**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the number of cells in that ring and sum them up. This involves iterating from 1 to k, adjusting the dimensions for each subsequent ring, and applying the perimeter formula.\n3. **Constraints Handling**: The input constraints ensure that the number of rings k is valid, so we don't need to handle invalid cases.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    a = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    b = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    total += 2 * (a + b - 2)\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers w, h, and k.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the adjusted width and height.\n- **Calculate Perimeter**: Use the perimeter formula to find the number of cells in the current ring.\n- **Sum Cells**: Accumulate the total number of gilded cells across all rings.\n- **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and applying the perimeter formula, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases within the given constraints.",
