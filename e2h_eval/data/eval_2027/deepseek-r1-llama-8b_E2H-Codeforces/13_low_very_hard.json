For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are given as strings separated by spaces, and they can be in any order. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a major and minor triad. From the description:\n\n- A major triad has a specific order where the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 3 semitones apart. So, for example, C E G: C to E is 4, E to G is 3. So the total from C to G is 7 semitones.\n- A minor triad is the opposite: the first two are 3 semitones apart, and the next two are 4. Like, C# B F would be ordered as B C# F. B to C# is 3 semitones, then C# to F is 4.\n\nSo the approach is to take the three notes, generate all possible permutations of them, and check each permutation to see if it fits either the major or minor pattern.\n\nWait, but since the chord is unordered, we need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes. For each permutation, we can compute the distances between consecutive notes and see if it matches the major or minor condition.\n\nBut wait, how do we represent the notes numerically? Because the distance calculation depends on their order in the scale.\n\nHmm. Let's think about assigning each note a numerical value based on their position in the scale. That way, we can calculate the distances more easily.\n\nThe scale is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but wait: the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And after H comes C again, making it cyclic.\n\nWait, but in some notations, B and H are considered the same? Or is H an alternative name for B? Oh, the problem statement says that H is one of the notes. So the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is distinct from B. Hmm, that's a bit unusual, but I'll go with the problem's definition.\n\nSo the list is 12 notes. Let's assign each note a number from 0 to 11. Let's create a dictionary mapping each note to its index.\n\nWait, but let's make sure of the order. The problem says:\n\nNotes in order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, is that correct? So after F comes F#, then G, etc., up to H, which is followed by C again.\n\nSo the order is:\n\nC (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nYes.\n\nSo each note can be converted into a number between 0 and 11.\n\nOnce we have the numbers, for any triplet, say a, b, c, we can consider all possible orderings (permutations) of these three numbers, compute the distances between consecutive notes, and check if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nWait, but the distance is calculated as (y - x) mod 12, but only considering the positive direction. Because the distance from X to Y is the number of semitones when moving from X to Y, wrapping around as necessary.\n\nWait no, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper note. So, for example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones because moving up from E to C would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C — that's 8 semitones. But wait, no: Wait, the distance from C to E is 4 semitones, because C (0) to C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4): four steps. Similarly, E to C is 8 semitones: E (4) → F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11), C (0). So 8 steps.\n\nSo the distance between two notes X and Y is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (12 - X + Y). Or, mathematically, (Y - X) mod 12, but only taking the positive result.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are provided in any order, and we need to classify the chord based on their distances in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Convert each note into a numerical value based on its position in the musical scale. This allows us to easily calculate the distance between notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes as the number of semitones when moving from the lower note to the higher note, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if the sequence fits the pattern of either a major or minor triad:\n   - **Major Triad**: The first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 3 semitones apart.\n   - **Minor Triad**: The first two notes are 3 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 4 semitones apart.\n4. **Classification**: Based on the checks, classify the chord as major, minor, or strange if it doesn't fit either pattern.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nnotes = input().split()\n\n# Mapping of note names to their respective indices\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Function to calculate semitone distance between two notes\ndef get_distance(a, b):\n    # Ensure a is the lower note\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of the three notes\nfrom itertools import permutations\nall_perms = list(permutations(notes))\n\n# Check each permutation\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in all_perms:\n    a, b, c = perm\n    a_idx = note_indices[a]\n    b_idx = note_indices[b]\n    c_idx = note_indices[c]\n    \n    # Calculate distances\n    d_ab = get_distance(a_idx, b_idx)\n    d_bc = get_distance(b_idx, c_idx)\n    \n    # Check for major\n    if d_ab == 4 and d_bc == 3:\n        is_major = True\n        continue  # No need to check further once major is found\n    \n    # Check for minor\n    if d_ab == 3 and d_bc == 4:\n        is_minor = True\n        continue  # No need to check further once minor is found\n\n# Determine the result\nif is_major and is_minor:\n    print(\"strange\")  # According to problem statement, this case won't occur\nelif is_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Conversion**: Each note is converted into an index based on its position in the scale, allowing easy distance calculations.\n2. **Distance Function**: Computes the distance between two notes by considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is checked to see if it fits the major or minor triad pattern.\n4. **Classification**: After checking all permutations, the chord is classified based on whether it fits the major, minor, or neither pattern.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, providing the correct classification for any valid input.",
