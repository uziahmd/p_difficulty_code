Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But he can't find some, so we need to determine the minimal number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. The input gives us n, the number of found cards, and x, the maximum absolute value each card can have. Then there's a list of n integers which are the numbers on the found cards. We need to compute the minimum number of additional cards required so that the total sum is zero.\n\nWait, but wait: initially, Vanya had an infinite number of cards with each integer from -x to x. So when he loses some, the sum of the found ones plus the sum of the missing ones must be zero. Oh no, wait—no, the problem says Natasha hid all the cards, but Vanya found n of them. So the sum of the found cards is S. He needs the sum of all found plus the sum of the missing ones to be zero? Or does he need the sum of the found (including the new ones) to be zero?\n\nWait, re-reading the problem statement: \"the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero.\" Oh, so the found cards include the ones he just found now. So the sum of the found cards (including any new ones) must be zero. So the initial found cards' sum is S. So the sum of the new cards must be -S. Because S + (sum of new cards) = 0 → sum of new = -S.\n\nSo the task is: find the smallest number of cards whose sum is exactly -S, and each card has a value between -x and x (inclusive).\n\nBut wait, the new cards can be any of those, including duplicates. So how do we find the minimal number of cards needed?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the current found cards.\n2. The required sum is T = -S.\n3. Find the minimal k such that there exists k numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k where each |a_i| ≤ x, and their sum is T.\n4. Return this minimal k.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal k for T.\n\nHow can I find the minimal k?\n\nWell, the minimal k would be the smallest number of terms needed to sum to T, with each term at most x in absolute value.\n\nWait, this reminds me of the problem where you want to find the minimal number of coins to make a certain amount. But here, each 'coin' can be positive or negative, but the absolute value is bounded by x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's similar to the problem where you have to reach a target by adding numbers in a range [-x, x], but each step contributes a certain amount.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is as follows:\n\nThe minimal number of terms is determined by how far T is from zero, divided by x, but considering that each step can contribute up to x towards the target.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. Let's say T is positive. We can take as many x's as possible. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 3 steps: 2+2+1 (but 1 is allowed). Alternatively, 5/2 is 2.5, so ceiling is 3. But maybe sometimes you can do it in fewer steps if you have negative numbers.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the sum needs to be exactly T. So perhaps the minimal number of terms is the minimal k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Let's see:\n\nFor example, if T is 3 and x is 2.\n\nWe can use 2 + 1 (but 1 is allowed), so two terms.\n\nOr 3 can be achieved with one term of 3, but since x=2, that's not allowed. So we need two terms: 2 + 1.\n\nWait, but 1 is within x's limit (since x=2). So yes, two terms.\n\nAnother example: T is 4, x is 3.\n\nWe can get it with 2 terms: 3 +1, but 1 is allowed. Alternatively, 2 + 2. So either way, two terms.\n\nWhat if T is 6, x is 3: 2 terms (3+3).\n\nIf T is 7, x is 3: 3+3+1 = 7 (three terms). Or 3+2+2, which is also three.\n\nSo the minimal k is ceil( |T| / x ). Because each term can contribute up to x, but you can have smaller terms as well.\n\nWait, but what about cases where T is negative? It doesn't matter because the sign can be adjusted by using negative values. For example, T = -5, x=2: we can have -2-2-1 (but 1 is allowed), but that's three terms. Or -2-3, but 3 is larger than x=2. No, so we can't do that. So in this case, the minimal k is 3 (using -2, -2, -1).\n\nWait, but wait: in that case, |T|=5, x=2: 5/2 is 2.5, so ceil is 3, which matches.\n\nSo regardless of whether T is positive or negative, the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nBut wait, let's test another example.\n\nSuppose T is 4, x is 3.\n\n|T| is 4, x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333..., so ceil is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 5, x is 3. 5/3 is ~1.666, so ceil is 2. So can we get 5 with 2 terms? 3+2=5. Yes.\n\nWhat about T=0? Then the minimal k is 0, because no cards are needed.\n\nWait, but what if T is zero, but the initial sum S is zero? Then no new cards are needed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute the sum S of the found cards.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal k as the minimal number of terms needed to sum to T, each term is between -x and x.\n\nAs per the above analysis, k is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about another case: T is 3, x is 2.\n\nThen |T|=3, x=2. So 3/2 is 1.5, so ceiling is 2.\n\nCan we achieve 3 with 2 terms? Yes: 2 +1.\n\nWhat about T is 2: 1 term.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about T is 1: 1 term.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about T is 4, x is 2: 4/2=2, so two terms (2+2).\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: T is 5, x is 2.\n\n5/2=2.5, so ceil is 3.\n\nCan we do it in 3 terms? 2+2+1=5. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, 2+2+1.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Calculate the sum S of the given found cards.\n\n2. Compute T = -S.\n\n3. If T is zero, return 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the absolute value of T.\n\n5. The minimal k is the ceiling of (|T|) / x.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the second example in the problem statement:\n\nSample Input 2: 2 3, -2 -2.\n\nSum S is (-2) + (-2) = -4.\n\nSo T = 4.\n\nx is 3.\n\n|T| is 4, x=3.\n\n4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. So output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: first input.\n\nn=3, x=2.\n\nCards are -1,1,2.\n\nSum is (-1)+1+2=2.\n\nSo T is -2.\n\n|x| is 2.\n\nSo |T|=2, x=2.\n\n2/2=1 → k=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if T is 0?\n\nLike, sum is 0. Then T=0, so output 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x=1.\n\nThen T=-1. |T|=1. x=1.\n\nk=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x=3.\n\nT=-5. |T|=5, x=3.\n\n5/3 is ~1.666, ceil is 2. So 3+2=5, but wait, 3 is allowed, 2 is allowed. So yes, two terms.\n\nWait, but 5 can be written as 3+2, but 2 is less than x=3. So yes.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCalculate S.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is 0, output 0.\n\nElse, compute |T|, divide by x, take the ceiling. That's the minimal k.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nRead n and x from the first line.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute S as sum of the list.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is 0, print 0.\n\nElse, compute absolute_T = abs(T).\n\nCompute k = (absolute_T + x -1) // x  # which is equivalent to ceiling division.\n\nPrint k.\n\nWait, let me test this.\n\nFor example, T=3, x=2:\n\n3 + 2-1 =4 → 4//2=2 → correct.\n\nT=4, x=3: 4+3-1=6 → 6//3=2 → correct.\n\nT=5, x=3: 5+3-1=7 →7//3=2 (since 7/3 is 2.333, floor is 2). Wait, wait: no, 5+3-1 is 7. 7//3 is 2. But 5 divided by 3 is 1.666, so ceiling is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, another example: T=2, x=2: 2+2-1=3 →3//2=1 → correct.\n\nT=1, x=2: 1+2-1=2 →2//2=1 → correct.\n\nYes, so the formula (absolute_T + x -1) // x correctly computes the ceiling.\n\nSo in code:\n\nread n, x.\n\ns = sum of the list.\n\nt = -s\n\nif t ==0:\n\n    print 0\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    k = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nYes.\n\nSo let's see the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput: 3 2\n\nNumbers: -1,1,2 → sum is 2. So t is -2.\n\nabs(t)=2.\n\nk= (2+2-1)/2=3/2=1. So output 1.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=2, x=3.\n\nNumbers: -2, -2 → sum is -4. t=4.\n\nabs(t)=4.\n\nk=(4 +3-1)//3 =6//3=2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nTest case where sum is 5, x=3 → t=-5. abs_t=5.\n\n5+3-1=7 →7//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 1, x=1 → t=-1. abs_t=1 → (1+1-1)//1=1 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=5 → t=-5. abs_t=5. 5+5-1=9 →9//5=1. Correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_s = sum(cards)\n\nt = -sum_s\n\nif t ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    k = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait: what if the sum is zero but the user has already found some cards? Like, for example, the sum is zero. Then no additional cards are needed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nsum is 2.\n\nt is -2.\n\nabs_t is 2.\n\n(2+2-1)//2=3//2=1.\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nsum is -4.\n\nt is 4.\n\nabs_t is 4.\n\n(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=3.\n\nt is -5.\n\nabs_t is5.\n\n(5+3-1)=7 →7//3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",

Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum \\( S \\) of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The target sum \\( T \\) needed is \\( -S \\) because the sum of all found cards must be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Requirement**: If \\( T \\) is zero, no additional cards are needed, so the result is 0.\n4. **Compute Minimum Number of Cards**: If \\( T \\) is not zero, calculate the absolute value of \\( T \\). The minimum number of additional cards required is the ceiling of the division of this absolute value by \\( x \\). This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards \\( n \\) and the maximum absolute value \\( x \\) from the first line.
