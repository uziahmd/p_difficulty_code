    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a permutation of an array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the empty set and the full set), the sum of elements in the original array a and the sum in the permuted array b are different. Hmm, that sounds tricky but maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, the subsets we're considering are all possible non-empty and not the entire array. So for each possible size from 1 to n-1, every subset of that size must have a different sum when comparing a and b.\n\nI remember something about permutations and avoiding certain sums. Maybe if the permutation is such that the order makes the prefix sums unique in a way that all subsets have unique sums.\n\nOh right! There's a concept called a \"graceful permutation\" or something similar where the differences in prefix sums ensure uniqueness. Or maybe it's related to constructing a sequence where each element added changes the sum in a way that avoids overlaps.\n\nLet me think: For each position i, the difference between the prefix sums of a and b up to i should be unique. Because then, any subset sum in a would differ from the corresponding subset sum in b by that difference, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nSo what's the approach here? Let's model this mathematically.\n\nLet’s denote S_a[i] as the sum of the first i elements of array a, and S_b[i] as the sum of the first i elements of array b. Then, for each i, the difference D_i = S_b[i] - S_a[i]. \n\nNow, for any subset S of positions, the sum in a is S_a[∑_{k∈S} k], but wait, no—actually, the subset can be any combination of elements, not necessarily contiguous. Wait, no, the prefix sums are for the entire array, but the subset sums are any possible combinations of elements. So perhaps my initial thought isn't directly applicable.\n\nWait, no. The subset S is any set of indices, not necessarily consecutive. So the sum over S in a is the sum of a elements at those indices. Similarly for b. We need these two sums to be different for every non-empty S that's not the entire array.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. How can we arrange the permutation so that all these subset sums are unique across a and b?\n\nAnother approach: What if the permutation b is such that the multiset of subset sums for all non-empty subsets (except the full one) in a is entirely disjoint from those in b? That is, no subset in a has a sum equal to any subset in b, except possibly the full subset, which is excluded.\n\nBut how can we achieve that? It's a bit unclear.\n\nWait, let's consider small cases.\n\nFor example, when n=2:\n\na = [x, y], and we need to permute it into b = [y, x].\n\nCheck all non-empty subsets except the full set.\n\nThe subsets for a:\n- {x}: sum is x\n- {y}: sum is y\n\nSubsets for b:\n- {y}: sum is y\n- {x}: sum is x\n\nWait, so both a and b have the same subset sums. So for n=2, it's impossible? But the sample input has n=4 and output given. So maybe for some n, it's possible, others not.\n\nWait, the sample input is n=4 and the output is a permutation where all required subset sums differ.\n\nWait, how do we find such a permutation? Maybe the key is to arrange the elements in a specific order that ensures that for each step, the difference in prefix sums is unique.\n\nWait, here's another idea: If we arrange the elements in such a way that the prefix sums of b are all distinct and different from the prefix sums of a, then any subset sum in a would differ by the total difference accumulated up to that point.\n\nWait, let's think: Suppose we have two arrays a and b, with prefix sums S_a and S_b. For any i, let D_i = S_b[i] - S_a[i]. Then, for any subset of indices T, the sum in a is S_a[T], and in b is S_b[T]. The difference is D_T = sum_{i in T} D_i. Because the prefix sum up to T is S_b[T] = S_b[0] + sum_{i=1 to T} b_i, and S_a[T] is similarly built. So the difference D_T is the sum of D_i for each i in T.\n\nIf for all T ≠ empty and T ≠ full, D_T is unique, then the subset sums will differ.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that for any subset S, the sum in a and the sum in b are different. So S_a[S] != S_b[S] for all non-empty S not equal to the full set.\n\nWhich is equivalent to saying that D_S is non-zero for all such S.\n\nSo if we can arrange the permutation so that all non-empty, non-full subsets T have D_T ≠ 0, then the condition is satisfied.\n\nHmm, but how do we compute D_T? Because D_T is the sum of D_i for i in T. And D_0 = 0.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning D_i values such that the sum of any non-empty, non-full subset of D_i is non-zero.\n\nWait, but the D_i's are determined by the permutation. So D_i = S_b[i] - S_a[i]. Since S_b is a permutation of S_a, the sum of all D_i must be zero, because S_b[n] = S_a[n]. So the total sum of D_i is zero.\n\nNow, the question becomes: Can we assign D_1, D_2, ..., D_n such that:\n\n- All D_i are integers.\n- Sum of all D_i is zero.\n- For every non-empty subset T (not equal to the full set), the sum of D_i for i in T is not zero.\n\nAdditionally, since b is a permutation of a, the D_i's are constrained based on how we arrange the elements.\n\nWait, but how do we construct such D_i's? It's a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to go is to arrange the permutation such that the prefix sums are all unique and their differences are such that the subset sums don't collide.\n\nAnother angle: Think of the problem as trying to find a permutation where the differences in the prefix sums create a situation where all possible subset sums (except the full set) are unique and non-zero.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to arrange the permutation such that the prefix sums of b are all different and none of them equals the prefix sums of a except at zero and the end.\n\nBecause then, for any subset S, the sum in a is S_a[k], and the sum in b is S_b[k], and since S_b[k] != S_a[k] for any k from 1 to n-1, then the subset sums would also be different.\n\nWait, no. Because a subset could consist of non-consecutive elements. So even if the prefix sums are unique, a subset might have a sum that equals another subset's sum in the other array.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. So maybe the initial approach is not sufficient.\n\nWait, but perhaps if the prefix sums are arranged in a way that all the partial sums are unique and no subset sum in a can be equal to a subset sum in b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way to make sure that for any subset S, the sum in a and the sum in b differ is to have all the subset sums in a and b (for non-empty, non-full subsets) be unique across both arrays. But that's a lot to manage.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern or a standard solution to this kind of problem.\n\nWait, I recall a problem called the \"subset sum problem\" where you have to permute an array so that all subset sums are unique. The approach there was to sort the array in a certain way, like arranging the elements in increasing order or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is related to Gray codes or other permutation techniques that ensure certain properties.\n\nWait, another thought: To arrange the elements such that each new element added creates a prefix sum that is larger than any previous. This way, all prefix sums are unique, and thus, any subset sum is uniquely determined by the prefix sums.\n\nBut how does that help with the permutation?\n\nWait, let's say we arrange the elements in a certain order where the prefix sums are all distinct. Then, for any subset S, the sum in a is S_a[k], where k is the last index in S. But no, that's not correct because subsets can skip elements.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nn=4\na = [1000, 100, 10, 1]\n\nSample Output:\nb = [100, 1, 1000, 10]\n\nLet's compute the prefix sums for a and b.\n\nFor a:\na = [1000, 100, 10, 1]\nprefix sums:\n0, 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111\n\nFor b:\nb = [100, 1, 1000, 10]\nprefix sums:\n0, 100, 101, 1101, 1111\n\nNow, compute D_i = S_b[i] - S_a[i]:\nD_0 = 0\nD_1 = 100 - 1000 = -900\nD_2 = 101 - 1100 = -999\nD_3 = 1101 - 1110 = -9\nD_4 = 0 (since both are 1111)\n\nSo D_i's are [-900, -999, -9, 0].\n\nNow, for any subset T, the sum of D_i for i in T must be non-zero.\n\nWait, let's check a few subsets:\n\n- T = {1}: D_1 = -900 ≠ 0 → good.\n- T = {2}: D_2 = -999 ≠ 0 → good.\n- T = {3}: D_3 = -9 ≠ 0 → good.\n- T = {1,2}: D_1 + D_2 = -1809 ≠ 0.\n- T = {1,3}: D_1 + D_3 = -909 ≠ 0.\n- T = {2,3}: D_2 + D_3 = -1008 ≠ 0.\n- T = {1,2,3}: D_1+D_2+D_3 = -1808 ≠ 0.\n- Any subset including 4: Since D_4 is zero, adding it doesn't change the sum. But the subset cannot include all 4 elements, so it's allowed.\n\nWait, but what about T={4}? No, T can't be the full set.\n\nWait, but for any subset T, the sum of D_i's is non-zero. So this arrangement works because for all non-empty T (excluding the full set), the sum is non-zero.\n\nSo the key here is that the D_i's are chosen such that all subset sums of D_i's (excluding the empty and full) are non-zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a permutation such that the D_i's satisfy:\n\n- sum(D_i) = 0 (because S_b[n] = S_a[n])\n- All subset sums (non-empty, not full) of D_i's are non-zero.\n\nHow can we find such a permutation?\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to construct D_i's.\n\nEach D_i is S_b[i] - S_a[i]. Since b is a permutation of a, the sum of all D_i's must be zero.\n\nWe need to choose D_i's such that any subset sum (non-empty, not full) is non-zero.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a \"Sidon sequence\" or a set with distinct subset sums, but here it's more about avoiding certain sums.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to do this is to have all the D_i's be powers of two. Because then, any subset sum is unique, and hence non-zero (assuming all are positive or negative).\n\nBut wait, if the D_i's are powers of two, their sum would be unique, but the sum of any non-empty subset (excluding the full set) would still be unique and non-zero, but only if they are positive.\n\nAlternatively, using a set where each D_i is a distinct power of two, either positive or negative, could work.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the D_i's are -900, -999, -9, 0. Not exactly powers of two, but perhaps another pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the D_i's should be such that each D_i is unique and the sum of any subset is unique and non-zero.\n\nBut how can we find such D_i's?\n\nAnother approach: The problem is similar to constructing a system of equations where each subset sum must be unique.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to construct the permutation step by step, ensuring that each step adds a new element that doesn't create a conflict.\n\nSo, let's try to build the permutation one element at a time, keeping track of the current prefix sums and ensuring that adding a new element doesn't cause any subset sum conflicts.\n\nBut for n=22, this approach might be computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable with memoization and pruning.\n\nWait, but even for n=22, trying all permutations is impossible because 22! is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother idea: Sort the array in a particular way. For example, in the sample, a is sorted as 1, 10, 100, 1000. But the permutation starts with 100, then 1, then 1000, then 10. So it's not in sorted order, but perhaps arranged in a way that the differences in prefix sums are unique.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to arrange the permutation is to place the largest elements first, then smaller ones, but in a way that each new element added significantly changes the prefix sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by greedily choosing the next element that maximizes the difference in the prefix sum, ensuring that the subset sums don't collide.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of another approach.\n\nSuppose we arrange the elements in such a way that the prefix sums of b are all different and unique. Then, for any subset S, the sum in a is S_a[k] and in b is S_b[k], which are different for all k from 1 to n-1. So, the subset sums would differ because the prefix sums differ.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. Because if the prefix sums S_b[i] are all different from S_a[i] for i from 1 to n-1, then any subset sum in a is a sum up to some point, and the same subset in b would have a different sum.\n\nBut wait, no. Because a subset can consist of non-consecutive elements. So for example, a subset could be the first and third elements. The sum in a would be a1 + a3, and in b would be b1 + b3. But if S_b[3] - S_a[3] is not equal to S_b[1] - S_a[1], etc., it's not clear that all subsets will have different sums.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach won't cover all cases, but perhaps it's sufficient for the problem.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sums S_a for the original array a.\n2. Find a permutation of a such that the prefix sums S_b are all different and none of them (except the last) are equal to any S_a[i].\n3. Then, the subset sums will automatically differ because the prefix sums differ at each point.\n\nIs this correct? Let's test it with the sample.\n\nIn the sample, S_a is [0, 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111], and S_b is [0, 100, 101, 1101, 1111].\n\nLooking at the S_b[i] for i=1,2,3: 100, 101, 1101. None of these are equal to any S_a[i] for i=1,2,3. So S_b[i] != S_a[i] for i <4.\n\nThus, any subset S of a will have a sum S_a[k], and the same subset in b will have a sum S_b[k], which are different because S_b[k] != S_a[k] for k <4.\n\nWait, but what about subsets that skip elements? Like subset {1,3} in a: sum is a1 + a3 = 1000 +10=1010.\n\nIn b, the subset {1,3} is b1 + b3 =100 +1000=1100.\n\nSo 1010 vs 1100, which are different.\n\nAnother example: subset {2,3} in a is 100 +10=110; in b, it's 1 +1000=1001. Different.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach works because the prefix sums of b are different from a's prefix sums, so any subset sum in a is different from the same subset in b.\n\nSo, the key is to arrange the permutation such that for all i from 1 to n-1, S_b[i] != S_a[i].\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a permutation of a where the prefix sums of b do not coincide with any of the prefix sums of a, except at the end.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Generate all possible permutations of a.\n2. For each permutation, compute the prefix sums S_b.\n3. Check whether for all i from 1 to n-1, S_b[i] != S_a[i].\n4. If such a permutation exists, output it. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nBut wait, for n=22, generating all permutations is impossible because 22! is way too large. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\nHmm, but n is up to 22. That's a problem because 22! is about 1e22, which is way beyond computational feasibility.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach than brute-force.\n\nAlternative idea: Try to find a permutation by backtracking, selecting each element in a way that the current prefix sum doesn't match any of the a's prefix sums, except the last.\n\nBut even with backtracking, for n=22, it's 22 steps with each step having up to 21 choices, which is manageable only if we can prune branches early when it's clear that the current path can't lead to a valid permutation.\n\nSo, perhaps a backtracking approach with pruning can work.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps for the backtracking approach:\n\n- We'll keep track of the current permutation being built.\n- At each step, we select the next element to add to the permutation.\n- After adding each element, we compute the current prefix sum S_b and check against the existing S_a (from 1 to n-1). If any of the S_b[i] equals S_a[i], we backtrack.\n- Also, we need to avoid duplicate elements, but since the problem states that all elements are distinct, we can just pick each element once.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the array a has distinct elements, so each element can be used exactly once in the permutation.\n\nSo, the algorithm could proceed as follows:\n\n1. Precompute the prefix sums S_a for the original array a.\n2. Initialize a list to represent the current permutation.\n3. Use backtracking to try to build the permutation step by step.\n4. At each step i (from 1 to n), choose the next element from the remaining elements.\n5. Compute the current prefix sum S_b up to i.\n6. Check if S_b is equal to any S_a[j] for j from 1 to n-1.\n   - If yes, discard this choice and try the next element.\n7. Continue until a complete permutation is found.\n8. If no permutation satisfies the condition, return -1.\n\nThis approach can potentially work, but with n=22, the number of possibilities is still huge. So, we need to find ways to prune the search as much as possible.\n\nAnother optimization: Since we want to avoid S_b[i] == S_a[j] for any i <= j <=n, we can precompute all S_a and store them in a set. Then, during the backtracking, whenever we compute S_b after adding an element, we check if it's present in this set (excluding the last S_a which is the total sum). If it is, we discard this permutation.\n\nBut even this might not be efficient enough for n=22. So perhaps we can find a way to order the elements such that the prefix sums grow in a certain way.\n\nWait, another idea: Sort the elements in such a way that the prefix sums are all distinct and none of them (except the total sum) match any of the S_a.\n\nHow can we do that?\n\nPerhaps by arranging the elements in an order where each new element added leads to a prefix sum that hasn't been seen before and doesn't match any of the S_a.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother thought: The minimal way to avoid any S_b[i] == S_a[j] is to have all S_b[i] be different from all S_a[j] for j=1..n-1.\n\nSo, during the permutation building, we can track the S_b as we build it, and for each step, ensure that the new S_b doesn't match any of the existing S_a (including the ones from a's prefix sums).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute S_a as a list of all prefix sums, including the total sum.\n- For the permutation, at each step, add an element and compute the new prefix sum.\n- Check if this new prefix sum is present in the S_a list (excluding the last element, which is the total sum).\n   - If it is, this permutation is invalid; backtrack.\n- If it's not present, proceed.\n\nBut again, for n=22, this could be too slow unless optimized properly.\n\nWait, but for the backtracking approach, the worst-case scenario is O(n!) which is 2.1e22 for n=22, which is impossible.\n\nSo, we need a heuristic to reduce the search space.\n\nAlternative approach: Try to find a permutation that starts with a specific element that maximizes the difference in the prefix sum, thus reducing the chances of collision.\n\nWait, perhaps starting with the largest element. Because adding a large element would create a large jump in the prefix sum, making it less likely to collide with any of the a's prefix sums.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n1. Sort the array in descending order.\n2. Try to build the permutation by always choosing the next element that, when added, creates a new prefix sum that's not in S_a (excluding the last sum).\n\nBut this is just a heuristic and may not work for all cases.\n\nWait, let's see for the sample input.\n\nSample a is [1000, 100, 10, 1], which when sorted in descending order is [1000, 100, 10, 1].\n\nThen, the prefix sums are 0, 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111.\n\nIf we try to build b by starting with 1000, then 100, then 10, then 1.\n\nCompute prefix sums:\n\nStep 1: 1000 → sum is 1000, which is present in S_a (S_a[1]=1000). So this is invalid.\n\nSo, we cannot start with 1000.\n\nNext, try starting with 100.\n\nPrefix sum is 100 → not in S_a (which is 1000, 1100, etc.). So proceed.\n\nStep 2: Next element could be 1000.\n\nCurrent sum is 100 + 1000 = 1100, which is present in S_a[2] = 1100 → invalid.\n\nSo, choose another element.\n\nNext, try adding 10. Sum is 100 +10=110. Not in S_a.\n\nProceed.\n\nStep 3: Next element is 1000. Sum becomes 110 +1000=1110, which is S_a[3]=1110 → invalid.\n\nHmm, so perhaps starting with 100 is not working.\n\nWait, what if after 100, we choose 1 instead?\n\nSum is 100 +1=101. Not in S_a.\n\nProceed.\n\nStep 3: Add 1000 → sum 101+1000=1101. Not in S_a.\n\nProceed.\n\nStep 4: Add 10 → sum 1101+10=1111, which is S_a[4], but since we're at step 4, which is the full sum, it's allowed.\n\nSo the permutation would be [100,1,1000,10], which is the sample solution.\n\nSo, this approach worked for the sample.\n\nBut how can we generalize this?\n\nThe idea is to start with the second largest element, then add the smallest element, then the largest, then the next smallest, etc., in a way that each step's prefix sum doesn't match any of the a's prefix sums.\n\nBut this is just a heuristic and may not work for all cases.\n\nAnother approach is to generate a permutation where the prefix sums are all unique and different from the a's prefix sums.\n\nSo, to implement this, perhaps the best way is to perform a backtracking search, but with pruning:\n\n- At each step, choose the next element to add.\n- Compute the new prefix sum.\n- Check if this new prefix sum is in S_a (excluding the last element).\n   - If yes, prune this branch.\n- Continue until a full permutation is found.\n\nBut with n=22, this approach is too slow unless we can find a way to quickly check if the current prefix sum is in S_a.\n\nSo, to optimize, we can store S_a in a hash set, and for each new prefix sum, we can check in O(1) time if it's in the set.\n\nMoreover, during the backtracking process, we can memoize or cache the forbidden sums to avoid redundant checks.\n\nBut even with this, for n=22, it's still going to be too slow.\n\nAn alternative idea: Perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a permutation where the prefix sums of b are all unique and different from the prefix sums of a except the total.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute S_a for a.\n2. For each permutation of a, compute S_b and check if any S_b[i] (for i=1 to n-1) is equal to S_a[j] for some j.\n\nBut again, this is not feasible for n=22.\n\nWait, but n is up to 22, which is manageable with some optimizations. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nEach permutation is a possible arrangement of the array. For each permutation, we can compute the prefix sums and check for collisions.\n\nBut for n=22, even with pruning, it's impossible because 22! is way too big.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem can be approached differently.\n\nAnother observation: The problem requires that for all non-empty subsets S (not the full set), the sum of a's elements in S is different from the sum of b's elements in S.\n\nSo, the sum of any non-empty, non-full subset in a differs from the same subset in b.\n\nWhich implies that the sum of any subset in a and b must differ.\n\nBut this is a very strict condition. So, perhaps the only way this is possible is if the elements are arranged such that their differences in the prefix sums create a situation where all subset sums are unique.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using linear algebra. Each subset corresponds to a vector, and the D_i's form a system where each vector must be non-zero. But this is probably too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the concept of a \"linear basis\" where the differences in bits are unique, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: The problem can be considered as requiring that the D_i's form a set where all non-empty, non-full subset sums are unique and non-zero.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a permutation where the D_i's satisfy:\n\n- Sum(D_i) = 0\n- All subset sums (non-empty, not full) of D_i are non-zero.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a \"zero-sum\" set with unique subset sums.\n\nWait, perhaps if the D_i's are such that each D_i is a distinct power of two, then any subset sum is unique. Because each D_i is a different power, so each subset sum is a unique combination.\n\nBut for our problem, the sum of D_i's must be zero. So, if we have D_i's as powers of two, but their sum is zero, that's only possible if half are positive and half are negative, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the D_i's can be arranged such that each is a distinct power of two, but their sum is zero. But that's not possible unless we have pairs that cancel each other out, which would require that each D_i is paired with another D_j of the same magnitude but opposite sign. But then, the sum of any subset would be unique, but the overall sum would be zero.\n\nWait, for example, if we have D_1 = 2^0 = 1, D_2 = -1, then the sum is zero. The subset sums are:\n\n- T={1}: 1 → unique.\n- T={2}: -1 → unique.\n- T={1,2}: 0 → but this is the full set, which is allowed.\n\nSo, for n=2, this works, but earlier I thought it didn't, but in this case, the subset {1,2} is the full set, which is allowed. So, for n=2, this approach works.\n\nBut for larger n, this approach may not scale because the number of subsets increases exponentially.\n\nBut perhaps using a set of D_i's where each is a distinct power of two (and negatives) can help in ensuring that all subset sums are unique.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply this to the problem at hand.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to arrange the D_i's such that each D_i is a distinct power of two, and their sum is zero. Then, any subset sum will be unique, and thus, no two subsets will have the same sum.\n\nBut for n greater than 1, it's hard to balance the positives and negatives.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by generating all possible D_i's and checking whether they meet the subset sum condition.\n\nBut again, this is not straightforward.\n\nAnother angle: Since the problem requires that all non-empty, non-full subsets have different sums in a and b, perhaps the simplest way is to arrange the permutation such that the prefix sums of b are all unique and different from those of a.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute S_a for a.\n2. Try to find a permutation of a where the prefix sums S_b are all unique and none of them (except the last) are present in S_a.\n3. If such a permutation exists, output it. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find such a permutation efficiently.\n\nGiven that n is up to 22, and S_a can have up to 22 prefix sums, perhaps we can represent S_a as a set and during the permutation building, compute S_b step by step, checking at each step whether the new sum is in S_a (excluding the last sum).\n\nBut with n=22, even this approach might be too slow unless optimized.\n\nSo, perhaps the way forward is to implement a backtracking approach with pruning, where at each step, we choose the next element and compute the new prefix sum, checking against the forbidden set.\n\nTo optimize, we can:\n\n- Order the candidates for the next element in a way that tries the most promising candidates first, such as those that lead to a new sum quickly, reducing the chance of collisions.\n\n- Cache the current state, including which elements have been used and the current prefix sum, to avoid revisiting the same state.\n\nBut implementing this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use memoization and pruning to limit the search space.\n\nWait, another idea: The problem can be transformed into a graph problem where each node represents a partial permutation and the current prefix sum, and edges represent adding a new element. We can explore this graph, pruning nodes where the new prefix sum is in S_a (excluding the last sum).\n\nBut again, for n=22, this is not feasible unless we can find a way to represent the state efficiently and prune many paths early.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the problem can be solved by sorting the array in a specific way, perhaps in a way that the prefix sums are all distinct and different from S_a.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works:\n\nSort the array in such a way that each new element added causes the prefix sum to increase in a way that it doesn't coincide with any of the a's prefix sums.\n\nFor example, arrange the elements in increasing order. Then, the prefix sums are strictly increasing. But if a's prefix sums are also strictly increasing, then some may coincide, causing collisions.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the elements in a specific order where the prefix sums are all unique and not present in S_a (except the last sum).\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: The sum of all elements in a is fixed. So, for the permutation, the total sum of b is the same as a. Thus, the last prefix sum for both is the same.\n\nThus, for the permutation to be valid, all intermediate prefix sums in b must not match any of the a's prefix sums.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation of a where the prefix sums (excluding the last) are all unique and not present in S_a.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute S_a for a.\n2. Find a permutation of a where the prefix sums S_b (excluding the last) are all unique and not present in S_a.\n\nNow, how to find such a permutation.\n\nOne approach is to perform a depth-first search, trying each possible permutation, but for n=22, this is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a heuristic or a way to construct the permutation.\n\nAn alternative idea: Start with the second largest element, then alternate between the largest remaining and smallest remaining elements.\n\nFor example, in the sample, the elements are 1000, 100,10,1.\n\nWe start with 100 (the second largest), then add 1 (smallest), then 1000, then 10.\n\nThis gives the prefix sums 100, 101, 1101, 1111.\n\nNone of these are in S_a, which were 0,1000,1100,1110,1111.\n\nThus, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, perhaps a greedy approach where we alternate between adding the largest remaining and smallest remaining elements can work.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nAnother sample: Let's take n=3.\n\na = [3,2,1]\n\nS_a is 0,3,5,6.\n\nWe need to find a permutation where the prefix sums are not in S_a (except the last).\n\nPossible permutation: [2,3,1]\n\nCompute S_b: 0,2,5,6.\n\nCheck S_b[1]=2 → not in S_a (3,5). Good.\n\nS_b[2]=5 → which is in S_a[2]=5. Bad.\n\nSo this permutation is invalid.\n\nAnother permutation: [2,1,3]\n\nS_b: 0,2,3,6.\n\nCheck S_b[1]=2 → good.\n\nS_b[2]=3 → which is in S_a[1]=3. Bad.\n\nAnother permutation: [1,3,2]\n\nS_b:0,1,4,6.\n\nS_b[1]=1 → good.\n\nS_b[2]=4 → not in S_a. Good.\n\nThus, this permutation is valid.\n\nSo, the approach of starting with the second largest, then adding the smallest, then the largest, then the next smallest, etc., may not always work, but perhaps it can be adjusted.\n\nAnother example: n=4, a = [4,3,2,1].\n\nS_a: 0,4,7,9,10.\n\nWe need a permutation where the prefix sums are not in S_a (except the last).\n\nTrying permutation [3,4,2,1]:\n\nS_b:0,3,7,9,10.\n\nCheck S_b[1]=3 → not in S_a (4,7,9). Good.\n\nS_b[2]=7 → in S_a[2]=7. Bad.\n\nThus, invalid.\n\nAnother permutation: [3,1,4,2].\n\nS_b:0,3,4,8,10.\n\nS_b[1]=3 → good.\n\nS_b[2]=4 → not in S_a. Good.\n\nS_b[3]=8 → not in S_a. Good.\n\nThus, this permutation is valid.\n\nSo, the approach of starting with the second largest, then the smallest, then largest, then next smallest, etc., seems to sometimes work.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to construct the permutation is to arrange the elements in an order where the prefix sums are all unique and not present in S_a.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute S_a.\n2. Create a set of forbidden sums, which are the S_a[1..n-1].\n3. Try to build the permutation step by step, choosing elements that do not cause the current prefix sum to be in the forbidden set.\n\nImplementing this as a backtracking solution with pruning seems feasible.\n\nBut for n=22, this approach may not be efficient enough.\n\nThus, perhaps we can find a way to represent the current prefix sum and track the used elements in a way that allows us to quickly determine if a new element can be added without causing a collision.\n\nAnother optimization is to represent the forbidden sums as a hash set for O(1) lookups.\n\nAdditionally, we can order the candidates for the next element in a way that tries the most 'promising' elements first, such as those that would lead to a sum that is less likely to collide.\n\nFor example, in the sample, after choosing 100, adding 1 led to a sum of 101, which is not in S_a. Then adding 1000 leads to",
