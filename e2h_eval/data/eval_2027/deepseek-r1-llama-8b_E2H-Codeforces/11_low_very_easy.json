A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends wanting to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources, and I need to calculate the maximum number each friend can make based on the available resources.\n\nLet me break down the input and what each variable represents.\n\nWe have n friends. They bought k bottles of drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l ml.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nAnd they have p grams of salt.\n\nEach toast requires per friend:\n- nl milliliters of drink.\n- One slice of lime.\n- np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each toast needs for all friends: each friend makes one toast. So for each toast, all n friends take their share. So per toast, the total resources needed are:\n- n * nl milliliters (because each friend takes nl).\n- n slices (each friend takes one).\n- n * np grams of salt (each takes np).\n\nSo to find out how many toasts they can make in total, we need to compute how much each resource allows, then take the minimum of those divided by the per toast required.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the toasts are per friend, but the resources are shared. So perhaps I should think in terms of per toast, the group consumes certain amounts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is:\n\nCompute the total drink available: k * l. The amount per toast is n * nl (since each of n friends drinks nl). So the maximum possible toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly, total lime slices: c * d. Each toast requires n slices (since each friend has one), so max toasts from lime is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So max toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the overall maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values.\n\nAh right, that's the key. So the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the total drink: total_drink = k * l.\n2. Calculate the maximum possible toasts based on drink: drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl).\n3. Calculate the total lime slices: total_lime = c * d.\n4. Maximum toasts based on lime: lime_toasts = total_lime // n.\n5. Calculate maximum toasts based on salt: salt_toasts = p // (n * np).\n6. The actual maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values: min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts).\n\nWait, let's test this logic against the example provided.\n\nFirst example input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nCalculations:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3*3=9ml. 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts.\n\ntotal_lime =10*8=80. n=3, so 80/3=26.666, which is 26. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, each toast requires n slices, right? Because each friend uses one. So for each toast, you need 3 slices. So 80 /3 is 26 with remainder 2, so 26 toasts.\n\nsalt: p=100. np=1. So per toast, 3*1=3g. 100 /3 is 33.333, so 33 toasts.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother example from input:\n\nSecond input: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink 1000ml.\n\nnl=4 → per toast, 5*4=20ml. 1000 /20=50.\n\nLime: c=1, d=19 → 19 slices. n=5, so 19 /5 = 3 (since 3*5=15 <=19). So 3 toasts.\n\nSalt: p=90, np=3. Per toast, 5*3=15g. 90 /15=6.\n\nSo the min is 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink 1e6 ml.\n\nnl=50 → per toast, 10*50=500ml. 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\nLime",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each friend needs a certain amount of drink, a lime slice, and salt for each toast.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of each resource available.\n3. **Determine Resource Limits**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total available amount and the consumption per toast.\n4. **Find the Minimum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is determined by taking the minimum value from the possible toasts calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoasts_lime = total_lime // n\n\ntoasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total milliliters of drink available is computed by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle.\n3. **Drink Toasts Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts that can be made based on the drink is determined by dividing the total drink by the amount needed per toast (per friend).\n4. **Lime Toasts Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is computed, and then divided by the number of friends to find the maximum toasts possible from the lime slices.\n5. **Salt Toasts Calculation**: The total grams of salt available are divided by the amount needed per toast (per friend) to determine the maximum toasts possible from the salt.\n6. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value from the three calculated toast values (drink, lime, salt) is taken as the result, ensuring that no resource is overused.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum number of toasts each friend can make while respecting all resource constraints.",
