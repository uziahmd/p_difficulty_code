    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How?\n\nFor each ring, the perimeter is calculated. But since the plate is a grid, the number of cells in a ring is the perimeter minus the corners, but wait, no. Wait, for a rectangle of a certain width and height, the perimeter in terms of cells is (2*(width + height) - 4). Because each side has 'length' cells, but the four corners are counted twice when adding the four sides. So subtracting 4 gives the correct count.\n\nWait, let's take an example. If the rectangle is 3x3, then the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 = 12, but since the corners are counted twice, we subtract 4, giving 8. Which matches the first sample input where 3x3 with k=1 gives 8.\n\nAnother example: 7x9. Let's compute the perimeter:\n\n(7-0)*2 + (9-0)*2 -4 = 14 + 18 -4 = 28. That's the first ring's contribution. Then the second ring would have (7-4)=3 and (9-4)=5. Perimeter is (3*2 +5*2 -4) =6+10-4=12. So total is 28+12=40, which matches the third sample.\n\nSo the approach is to calculate for each ring from 1 to k, the current width and height, compute the perimeter as 2*(w_i + h_i) -4, and sum all these perimeters.\n\nSo, how do I compute this in code?\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read the input values w, h, k.\n2. For each ring i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute the current width: w_current = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute the current height: h_current = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. If either w_current <=0 or h_current <=0, then the ring cannot be formed. But according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that it's possible. So perhaps I don't need to handle this case.\n3. Sum the perimeters for each ring.\n\nWait, but for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(w_current + h_current) -4. So for each i, calculate that and add to the total.\n\nSo the plan is straightforward. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about the initial values? For i=1, the current width is w, current height is h.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3 1\nCompute for i=1:\nw=3, h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4=12-4=8. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 9 1\ni=1: 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input3:\n7 9 2\ni=1: 28, i=2: 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12. Total 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nRing1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\nRing2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So 1x1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1) -",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the bordering cells of a smaller rectangle inside the previous one, reducing both the width and height by 4 cells for each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle. The first ring uses the full dimensions of the plate, while each subsequent ring reduces the width and height by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is determined by the perimeter of the current rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is calculated as `2 * (w + h) - 4`, which accounts for the corners being counted twice.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the perimeter and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height by subtracting 4 cells for each previous ring.\n- **Compute Perimeter**: For each ring, calculate the perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n- **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n- **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring accurate results within the problem constraints.",
