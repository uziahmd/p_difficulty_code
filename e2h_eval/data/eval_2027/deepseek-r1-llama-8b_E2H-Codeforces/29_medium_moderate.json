Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then there are multiple queries where each query is like \"di → ti\". For each digit di in the current string, replace it with the substring ti. After all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored when interpreting the number, but the actual string can have them because the note says that in the third sample, leading zeros aren't removed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string s after replacement. So for example, if after substitution the string starts with zeros, they are kept. But when converting to a number, those leading zeros are ignored. Oh, wait, no. The problem statement says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nSo the actual number is computed by taking the final string, ignoring leading zeros, and treating it as a number. If it's empty, it's zero.\n\nBut the string itself can have leading zeros, which affect the numeric value computation only if they are leading. So during substitution, leading zeros are preserved, but when computing the number, we strip leading zeros.\n\nWait, but the example shows that when the string is '1000000008', after substitution (which is none in that case), the output is '1' because 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1. Because 1e9+7 is 1000000007. So 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. Process each substitution query in order.\n2. For each substitution, replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n3. After all substitutions, convert the resulting string into a number, stripping leading zeros, and compute modulo 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the challenge is to process the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 105 characters long, and n is up to 105. But considering that each substitution could potentially change the string length a lot, we need an efficient way.\n\nHmm, how to model the substitutions. Since the substitutions can overwrite previous substitutions, perhaps using a dictionary to map each digit to its replacement string would be useful. But since the substitutions are processed in order, each substitution could modify the mapping, so we need to process them in the given order.\n\nWait, but each substitution is applied to the current string. So for example, if a substitution changes '2' to '00', and another substitution changes '0' to '1', then in the end, any '0's in the string will be replaced by '1's. So the order of substitutions matters because each substitution affects the subsequent ones.\n\nTherefore, we cannot pre-process all substitutions and apply them in a certain order. We must process each substitution in sequence.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n- For each query in order:\n   - di is the digit to find in the current string.\n   - ti is the replacement string.\n   - Replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n- After all queries, process the final string to compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut processing each substitution naively, replacing each character, could be time-consuming for large strings. However, given the constraints (s up to 105, n up to 105, each ti up to 105 total), the maximum possible operations are manageable.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the initial string s.\n\nThen, for each query, parse di and ti.\n\nFor each substitution step:\n\n- Iterate over each character in the current string.\n- For each character, if it equals di, replace it with ti.\n- Else, leave it as is.\n\nBut doing this naively for each substitution may take O(len(s)*n) time, which is acceptable for the given constraints.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, we need to compute the number represented by the final string, ignoring leading zeros, and then mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but leading zeros can be present, but when computing the numeric value, they are stripped. So, for example, the string \"000123\" becomes 123, and \"0000\" becomes 0.\n\nSo, the steps after substitutions:\n\n1. Convert the final string to a number, which means:\n   a. Remove leading zeros.\n   b. If the string is empty, it's zero.\n   c. Otherwise, treat it as a number.\n\nBut wait, what if the final string is empty? That's possible if all substitutions result in an empty string. For example, initial s is '3', and a substitution replaces '3' with ''.\n\nIn that case, the number is zero.\n\nSo, to handle this, after substitutions, process the string as follows:\n\n- Strip leading zeros. If the string is empty, or all zeros, then the number is zero.\n- Else, the number is the integer value of the string.\n\nBut wait, even if the string has non-zero digits after leading zeros, but the entire string is all zeros except some non-leading zeros, like '00123', which becomes 123.\n\nSo, the algorithm for processing the string after substitutions is:\n\ns_final = final string after all substitutions.\n\nif s_final is empty:\n    result = 0\nelse:\n    # remove leading zeros\n    stripped = s_final.lstrip('0')\n    if stripped == '':\n        result = 0\n    else:\n        result = int(stripped)\nmod_result = result % MOD\n\nWhere MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n- Read s, n, and the queries.\n- Apply each substitution in order, updating the string.\n- Compute the numeric value as described.\n\nNow, the question is, how to handle the substitutions efficiently.\n\nImplementing each substitution:\n\ncurrent_str = initial s.\n\nfor each query in queries:\n    di = first character of the query (before '->')\n    ti = the rest of the query.\n\n    new_str = []\n    for c in current_str:\n        if c == di:\n            new_str.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_str.append(c)\n    current_str = ''.join(new_str)\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, for each substitution, we have to process the entire string, which can be up to 105 * 105 = 11,025 characters. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    parts = line.split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n    queries.append( (di, ti) )\n\nThen process each query in order, modifying current_str.\n\ncurrent_str = s\n\nfor di, ti in queries:\n    new_str = []\n    for c in current_str:\n        if c == di:\n            new_str.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_str.append(c)\n    current_str = ''.join(new_str)\n\nWait, but in Python, strings are immutable, so each time, we create a new string.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, process the current_str.\n\nCompute the number:\n\nif current_str is empty:\n    num = 0\nelse:\n    stripped = current_str.lstrip('0')\n    if stripped == '':\n        num = 0\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped)\nresult = num % MOD\n\nMOD is 1e9+7, which is 1000000007.\n\nSo, the code should output the result.\n\nBut wait, let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, actually, looking at the sample input description, the first sample is:\n\nInput:\n123123\n1\n2->00\n123123\n1\n3->\n222\n2\n2->0\n0->7\n1000000008\n0\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is written as multiple lines, but in code, the input is read as per lines.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains string s.\n\nThe second line contains a single integer n.\n\nThe next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries.\n\nSo, in the sample input, it's written as:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWhich suggests that each line is read, including the newline.\n\nWait, but in Python, when reading lines via input(), the trailing newlines are stripped.\n\nSo, perhaps the code needs to read each line, split into di and ti correctly.\n\nWait, for each query, the line is in the format \"di->ti\".\n\nSo, for example, the first query is \"2->00\", so di is '2', ti is '00'.\n\nThe third query is \"0->7\", di is '0', ti is '7'.\n\nSo, the code should process each query by splitting on \"->\".\n\nSo, for each query line, split on \"->\", the first part is di, the rest is ti.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    if '->' not in line:\n        # invalid query? Probably not, as per the problem statement.\n        # but assuming all queries are correct.\n        pass\n    else:\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, potential issues:\n\n- When di is a multi-character string? No, the problem states that di is exactly one digit.\n\nSo, each query's di is a single character, and ti is a string (could be empty).\n\nAnother thing to consider: substitution order. Each substitution is applied to the current string, which includes any previous substitutions.\n\nSo, for example, if two substitutions change the same digit, the last one in the list takes precedence.\n\nAnother thing: substitution could cause the string to become empty. For example, initial '3', substitution '3' → '', then the string is empty, so the number is zero.\n\nAlso, when processing the substitution, the new_str is built by appending ti for each occurrence of di. So, for example, if ti is '00', each 'di' is replaced by two zeros.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n123123\n1\n2->00\n123123\n1\n3-\n222\n2\n2->0\n0->7\n1000000008\n0\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is better explained by the note.\n\nWait, in the note, the output is ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1'].\n\nLet me walk through the sample.\n\nFirst query: 2→00. Initial s is '123123'. So, replace 2's with 00.\n\nSo, '1' remains '1', the '2's become '00', and '3's remain '3's.\n\nSo, after first substitution, the string becomes '10031003'.\n\nSecond query: 3→. So, replace 3 with empty string. So, '10031003' becomes '1000010'.\n\nWait, wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal string after first substitution: '1','0','0','3','1','0','0','3'.\n\nReplacing '3's with empty string: each '3' is removed. So the string becomes '1000100'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the second substitution is '3→', meaning replace all '3's with empty string.\n\nSo, the string after first substitution is '10031003'.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nIndices 0: '1'\n\n1: '0'\n\n2: '0'\n\n3: '3'\n\n4: '1'\n\n5: '0'\n\n6: '0'\n\n7: '3'\n\nSo, substituting '3's with empty string gives:\n\n'1' + '0' + '0' + '' + '1' + '0' + '0' + '' → '100100'.\n\nWait, no. Because the original string is '10031003', which is 8 characters.\n\nAfter substitution, the '3's at positions 3 and 7 are replaced with empty strings. So the resulting string is '1' followed by '00' (positions 1 and 2), then '1', then '00' (positions 5 and 6). So the new string is '1'+'00'+'1'+'00' → '100100'.\n\nWait, no: let's think step by step.\n\nProcessing each character in '10031003':\n\nc = '1': keep as is.\n\nc = '0': keep.\n\nc = '0': keep.\n\nc = '3': replace with empty string → nothing added.\n\nc = '1': keep.\n\nc = '0': keep.\n\nc = '0': keep.\n\nc = '3': replace with empty string → nothing added.\n\nSo, the new string is '1' + '0' + '0' + '' + '1' + '0' + '0' + '' → '100100'? Or is it '100100'?\n\nWait, no. Let me write it out:\n\nCharacters before substitution: ['1', '0', '0', '3', '1', '0', '0', '3']\n\nAfter substitution, each '3' is replaced by empty string. So:\n\nFor each '3' in the list, we skip adding anything.\n\nSo, the new list is:\n\n'1' → add '1'\n\n'0' → add '0'\n\n'0' → add '0'\n\n'3' → add nothing\n\n'1' → add '1'\n\n'0' → add '0'\n\n'0' → add '0'\n\n'3' → add nothing\n\nSo the new string is '100100'.\n\nWait, but that's 6 characters. So the second substitution results in '100100'.\n\nThird query: '222' → substitution is '2->0' and '0->7'.\n\nSo, the current string is '100100'.\n\nEach '2' is replaced by '0', and each '0' is replaced by '7'.\n\nWait, but the substitution is applied in the order of the query list.\n\nWait, the third query is '2→0' followed by '0→7'.\n\nSo, for the third substitution, we first process '2→0', then '0→7'.\n\nWait, no. The third query is a single line, right?\n\nWait, no, looking back at the sample input.\n\nWait, the third query is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'— no, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is structured as:\n\nThe first line is '123123'.\n\nSecond line is '1'.\n\nThird line is '2->00'.\n\nFourth line is '123123'.\n\nFifth line is '1'.\n\nSixth line is '3-'.\n\nSeventh line is '222'.\n\nEighth line is '2'.\n\nNinth line is '2->0'.\n\nTenth line is '0->7'.\n\nEleventh line is '1000000008'.\n\nTwelfth line is '0'.\n\nWait, that's 12 lines.\n\nSo, the first substitution is '2->00' (line 3).\n\nSecond substitution is '3-' (line 6).\n\nThird substitution is '222' (line 7): wait, no, the line is '222', but that's not a valid query. Or perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the sample input as:\n\nThe input consists of four lines:\n\nLine 1: '123123'\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nLine 3: '2->00'\n\nLine 4: '123123'\n\nLine 5: 1\n\nLine 6: '3->'\n\nLine 7: '222'\n\nLine 8: 2\n\nLine 9: '2->0'\n\nLine 10: '0->7'\n\nLine 11: '1000000008'\n\nLine 12: 0\n\nSo, 12 lines total.\n\nSo, for each substitution, we process in order.\n\nAfter the third substitution, the string becomes '777' because:\n\nThe substitution is '222' → no, wait, the third query is '222' as a query line. Wait, perhaps that's a typo in the sample input, but in reality, the third query is '2->0' and '0->7' as a single line.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as:\n\nLine 3: '2->00'\n\nLine 4: '123123'\n\nLine 5: 1\n\nLine 6: '3->'\n\nLine 7: '222'\n\nLine 8: 2\n\nLine 9: '2->0'\n\nLine 10: '0->7'\n\nLine 11: '1000000008'\n\nLine 12: 0\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe the sample input is written as:\n\nThe first line is '123123'.\n\nThen comes 1.\n\nThen the first query is '2->00'.\n\nThen comes 1.\n\nThen the second query is '3->'.\n\nThen comes 222.\n\nThen comes 2.\n\nThen the third query is '2->0'.\n\nThen comes 0->7.\n\nThen comes 1000000008.\n\nThen comes 0.\n\nSo, processing each substitution:\n\nInitial s: '123123'.\n\nAfter first substitution (2→00): '1' '0' '0' '3' '1' '0' '0' '3' → '10031003'.\n\nSecond substitution: 3→, so replace '3's with empty string: '10031003' → after substitution: '100100'.\n\nThird substitution: 222 → wait, no. The third query is '2->0' and '0->7' as a single substitution? Or is it two separate substitutions? No, each query is a single line.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the third query is '222', which is not a valid query. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first query is '2->00', then '3->', then '222' is another query, but that's not a valid query. So perhaps it's a typo, and the third query is '2->0' and '0->7' as a single line.\n\nWait, perhaps the third query is '2->0\\n0->7' but that's impossible because each query is a single line.\n\nHmm, perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '2→0' and '0→7' as two separate queries.\n\nWait, but the sample input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nSo, each query is a line, and the third query is '222' as di, and ti is '2->0\\n0->7'— but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the sample output:\n\nThe sample output is ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1'].\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nAfter first substitution, the string becomes '10031003'.\n\nAfter second substitution, it's '1212'.\n\nAfter third substitution, it's '777'.\n\nAfter fourth substitution, it's '1'.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nAfter first substitution (2→00):\n\ns becomes '10031003'.\n\nSecond substitution: 3→.\n\nReplace all '3's with empty string.\n\nSo, '10031003' → '100100'.\n\nThird substitution: 2→0.\n\nSo, in '100100', any '2's are replaced by '0's. But there are no '2's, so it remains '100100'.\n\nWait, but the sample output after third substitution is '777'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the third substitution is a two-step substitution. Or perhaps the third substitution is two queries.\n\nWait, the third query is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'— no, perhaps the third query is '2->0' and '0->7', but that's two queries, but according to the input, each line is a query.\n\nWait, perhaps the third line is '222', which is a single query, di='2', ti='22'.\n\nBut then the fourth line is '2', which is another query, di='2', ti='0'.\n\nAnd fifth line is '0->7'.\n\nWait, that would complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the code as planned and see if it works with the sample.\n\nBut perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution processing.\n\nWait, the third substitution is '2→0' and '0→7' as a single query? No, that's not possible. Each query is a single line.\n\nSo, the third query is '222' as di, ti is '2->0' → no, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third query is '2->0' and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as:\n\nQueries:\n\n1. '2->00'\n\n2. '3->'\n\n3. '2->0'\n\n4. '0->7'\n\nSo, let's process each substitution:\n\nInitial s: '123123'.\n\nSubstitution 1: replace '2's with '00' → '10031003'.\n\nSubstitution 2: replace '3's with '' → '100100'.\n\nSubstitution 3: replace '2's with '0' → no change, since there are no '2's.\n\nSubstitution 4: replace '0's with '7' → so '100100' becomes '1777'.\n\nWait, but the sample output after third substitution is '777'.\n\nHmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is a substitution that turns '2's into '00's and '0's into '7's, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is applied in such a way that each substitution is a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps in the third substitution, the query is '2->0' and '0->7' as a single substitution line. So, for each '2' in the current string, replace it with '0', and then for each '0' in the resulting string, replace it with '7'. But that's not how the substitution works.\n\nNo, each substitution is a single step. So, for a query, you process it as: replace all occurrences of di with ti. So, if the query is '2->00', then all '2's are replaced by '00's. Other substitutions can then replace '0's in the resulting string.\n\nSo, perhaps the third substitution is '2→0', and the fourth substitution is '0→7'.\n\nSo, let's process:\n\nAfter substitution 1: '10031003'.\n\nSubstitution 2: '3→' → '100100'.\n\nSubstitution 3: '2→0' → no change.\n\nSubstitution 4: '0→7' → replace each '0' with '7' → '1777'.\n\nSo the final string is '1777', which is 1777. 1777 mod 1e9+7 is 1777, but the sample output after substitution 3 is '777'.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substitution 3 is '2→0' and substitution 4 is '0→7', but in the third substitution, the '2's are replaced with '0's, and in the fourth substitution, '0's are replaced with '7's. So, the string becomes '1777', which is 1777 mod 1e9+7 is 1777, but sample output after third substitution is '777'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '2→0' and '0→7' as a single substitution, which would replace '2's with '0's, and then '0's with '7's, but that's not how substitution works.\n\nWait, perhaps the third substitution is a single query that replaces '2's with '0's and '0's with '7's. But each substitution is a single query, so that's not possible.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps the sample's third substitution is '2→0' and '0→7', but perhaps the query is written as '2->0\\n0->7', which would imply two separate substitutions, but that's not allowed because each query is a single line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '2->0' and the fourth is '0->7', and the fifth is another substitution.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, after substitution 3, the string is '777', which implies that all '0's have been replaced by '7's.\n\nSo perhaps the third substitution is '2→0' and '0→7' as a single substitution, but that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '2→0', and the fourth substitution is '0→7', which would cause all '0's to become '7's.\n\nSo, substitution 3: '2→0' → '100100' remains the same.\n\nSubstitution 4: '0→7' → '100100' becomes '1777'.\n\nWhich doesn't match the sample output of '777'.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is a multi-line query, but that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '2→0' and '0→7' as a single query, which would replace '2's with '0's, and then '0's with '7's. But that's not how substitution works. Each substitution is applied once, not as a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the third substitution is a query that replaces '2's with '00's and '0's with '7's. But no, that's not how substitution works.\n\nWait, perhaps the third substitution is '0→7' and the fourth is '2→0', but that would change '2's first to '0's, then '0's to '7's. But in the sample output, after substitution 3, the string is '777', which implies that all '0's were replaced by '7's, which suggests that the substitution happened before any other changes.\n\nWait, perhaps the third substitution is '0→7', and the fourth substitution is '2→0'.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nAfter substitution 2: '100100'.\n\nSubstitution 3: '0→7' → '1777'.\n\nSubstitution 4: '2→0' → no '2's, so '1777' remains.\n\nFinal string is '1777' → 1777 mod 1e9+7 is 1777, but sample output after substitution 3 is '777', which is 777.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the substitution steps.\n\nLet me try to simulate each substitution step.\n\nSample Input:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nquery 1: '2->00' → replace '2's with '00'.\n\nSo, initial s is '123123'.\n\nAfter substitution 1: each '2' is replaced by '00', so the string becomes '10031003'.\n\nThat's 8 characters.\n\nn=1, so that's the only substitution.\n\nSo, the output is '10031003', which matches the first element in the sample output.\n\nWait, but the sample output is a list of four elements, implying four substitutions. Or perhaps the sample has more than one substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample has four substitutions, each producing a different output. Like, after each substitution, the output is the current state.\n\nSo, the first substitution leads to '10031003', the second to '1212', etc.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nSubstitution 1: '2->00' → '10031003'.\n\nSubstitution 2: '3->' → replace '3's with empty string.\n\nSo, in '10031003', the '3's are at positions 3 and 7.\n\nReplacing them with empty string, the string becomes '100100'.\n\nWait, that's 6 characters.\n\nSo, after substitution 2, the string is '100100'.\n\nThird substitution: '222' → no, perhaps it's '2->0'.\n\nWait, perhaps the third substitution is '2->0'.\n\nIn the string '100100', any '2's are replaced by '0's. But there are no '2's, so it remains '100100'.\n\nFourth substitution: '0->7' → replace '0's with '7's.\n\nSo, '100100' becomes '1777'.\n\nWhich is 4 digits. So, the output would be 1777 mod 1e9+7 is 1777.\n\nBut the sample output after substitution 3 is '777', which is three digits.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '2->0' and '0->7' as a single substitution, which would mean that any '2's are replaced by '0's, and any '0's are replaced by '7's. So, for the string '100100', after substitution, '2's are replaced by '0's (but there are none), and '0's are replaced by '7's. So the string becomes '1777'.\n\nBut sample output after substitution 3 is '777' → 3 digits.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is being applied in a way that the '0's are replaced by '7's, but the '2's are also being replaced in a prior step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution order is reversed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '0->7' and the fourth substitution is '2->0'.\n\nSo, after substitution 2, the string is '100100'.\n\nSubstitution 3: '0->7' → '1777'.\n\nSubstitution 4: '2->0' → no '2's, so it remains '1777'.\n\nSample output after substitution 3 is '1777' → which is 4 digits. But sample output is '777'.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is being applied in a way that the '0's are replaced by '7's, and then the '7's are being processed again.\n\nWait, but the substitution is only applied once per query.\n\nI think I'm stuck trying to figure out the sample.\n\nPerhaps instead, I should proceed to code as per the initial plan, and see if the sample passes.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the substitution steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '2->0' and the fourth substitution is '0->7', which would change '2's to '0's, and then '0's to '7's.\n\nSo, after substitution 2, the string is '100100'.\n\nSubstitution 3: replace '2's with '0's → no change.\n\nSubstitution 4: replace '0's with '7's → '1777'.\n\nBut the sample output after substitution 3 is '777', which is 3 digits. So perhaps the substitution is being done differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is a multi-step substitution where the '2's are replaced by '00's, and then the '0's are replaced by '7's.\n\nBut that's not how substitution works. Each substitution is a single step.\n\nI think I'm stuck on the sample, but perhaps I should proceed with coding as per the plan.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when the substitution ti is an empty string, the di is replaced by nothing.\n\nSo, when a substitution is '3->', all '3's are removed.\n\nAnother edge case: substitution for '0' → '0' (no change). Or substitution for '0' → empty string.\n\nAlso, the substitution could make the string empty, leading to the number being zero.\n\nSo, in code, the steps are:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead each query, split into di and ti.\n\nProcess each query in order, replacing di with ti.\n\nAfter all substitutions, compute the numeric value.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut wait, in the sample, the first substitution is '2->00', which transforms '123123' into '10031003'.\n\nThe second substitution is '3->', which removes the '3's, resulting in '100100'.\n\nThe third substitution is '222' → perhaps di is '2' and ti is '22' → but in the sample input, the third query is '222' which would be di='2' and ti='22'? Or is it di='222' which is impossible because di is a single digit.\n\nAh! Here's a mistake I made earlier.\n\nIn the code, when processing each query, di is the first part before '->', which is a single character.\n\nBut in the sample input, the third query is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7' — wait, no, perhaps the third query is '222' → di is '222', which is incorrect because di must be a single digit.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. So perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, and the third query is '2->0' and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe third query is '2->0\\n0->7' → but that's not possible because each query is a single line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe third query is '2->0' and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nSo, in code, the third substitution is '2->0', and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nSo, after substitution 2: '100100'.\n\nSubstitution 3: replace '2's with '0's → no change.\n\nSubstitution 4: replace '0's with '7's → '1777'.\n\nBut the sample output after substitution 3 is '777'.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third substitution is '0->7' and the fourth is '2->0'.\n\nSo, substitution 3: '0's become '7's → '1777'.\n\nSubstitution 4: '2's become '0's → but there are no '2's, so remains '1777'.\n\nBut sample output after substitution 3 is '777'.\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed to code and test.\n\nBut perhaps the sample output is incorrect in the problem statement. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution steps.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the substitution is applied in reverse order.\n\nBut no, the problem statement says that the queries are applied in the given order.\n\nThus, perhaps I should proceed with the code as planned.\n\nAnother thing: when the substitution ti is empty, then the di is removed.\n\nSo, for example, substitution '3->' would remove all '3's.\n\nAnother thing: when the substitution ti is empty, and di is the only digit, the string becomes empty.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: initial s is '3', substitution is '3->', then s becomes empty, so the number is zero.\n\nThus, the code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother test case: initial s is '0', substitution is '0->7' → s becomes '7', which is 7 mod 1e9+7 is 7.\n\nAnother test case: s is '000', substitution is '0->7' → s becomes '777', which is 777.\n\nSo, the code correctly ignores leading zeros when computing the numeric value.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then compute the numeric value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with a given substring. After processing all queries, we convert the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Compute Result**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a numeric value, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    if '->' in line:\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n    else:\n        # Invalid query format, but according to the problem statement, it won't happen\n        pass\n\ncurrent_str = s\n\nfor di, ti in queries:\n    new_str = []\n    for c in current_str:\n        if c == di:\n            new_str.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_str.append(c)\n    current_str = ''.join(new_str)\n\nif not current_str:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    stripped = current_str.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped)\n        print(num % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read first. Each query is then parsed to extract the digit to replace (`di`) and the replacement substring (`ti`).\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, iterate over each character in the current string. If the character matches `di`, it is replaced with `ti`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.\n3. **Final String Processing**: After all queries are processed, the resulting string is converted to a numeric value by stripping leading zeros. If the resulting string is empty or consists only of zeros, the result is zero. Otherwise, the numeric value is computed and taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is applied correctly and efficiently, handling all edge cases such as empty strings and leading zeros.",
