Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x and they don't overlap. Also, the total cost should be as minimal as possible. If it's impossible, we return -1.\n\nHmm, let's break down the requirements.\n\nEach voucher has a start day (li), end day (ri), and cost (costi). The duration of each voucher is ri - li + 1. So for two vouchers i and j, the sum of their durations must be exactly x. Also, they can't overlap. So either voucher i ends before voucher j starts or vice versa.\n\nOur goal is to find the pair (i,j) where i≠j, their durations add up to x, they don't overlap, and their total cost is minimized.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 2e5, which is quite large. So an O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. We need something smarter.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. For each voucher, calculate its duration. Then, for each voucher, we need to find another voucher whose duration is x minus the current one's duration. So for each voucher with duration d, we look for vouchers with duration x - d.\n\nBut wait, since x can be up to 2e5*2 (since each voucher's duration can be up to 2e5), but perhaps more accurately, x can be up to 4e5? Not sure, but in any case, for each voucher, we need to find other vouchers that fit certain criteria.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute all vouchers and their durations.\n- Group them by duration. For each duration d, have a list of vouchers with that duration.\n- Then, for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with duration x-d, and that these two don't overlap.\n\nBut even this approach might not be efficient because for each voucher, we may have to process many others.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can pre-sort the vouchers based on their end times. That way, for a given voucher, we can quickly find all other vouchers that end before it starts, or start after it ends.\n\nLet me think about the structure.\n\nEach voucher can be considered in two cases:\n\nCase 1: It is the first voucher in the pair. So we look for a second voucher that starts after it ends. The second voucher's duration must be x - d.\n\nCase 2: It is the second voucher in the pair. So we look for a first voucher that ends before it starts. Again, the first voucher's duration is x - d.\n\nSo for each voucher, I can compute d = duration, then target_d = x - d. Then, for each voucher, I can look in the target_d group for vouchers that don't overlap.\n\nBut even that could be O(n) per voucher, leading to O(n^2), which is too slow.\n\nHmm, so what's the alternative?\n\nMaybe we can pre-sort each group by end time or start time.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each voucher, compute duration d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\n2. Create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers (li, ri, costi) with that duration. Also, perhaps sort these lists in a certain way for efficient querying.\n\n3. For each voucher i, compute target_d = x - d_i. Check if target_d exists in the dictionary.\n\n   a. If target_d does not exist, skip.\n\n   b. Else, for all vouchers j in the target_d group, check if i and j do not overlap.\n\n   c. Among all such valid pairs (i,j), keep track of the minimum cost.\n\nBut again, checking all j for each i is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nSo we need a way to quickly find for each voucher i, the best possible j in the target_d group that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nHow can we do that?\n\nLet's think about the non-overlapping condition. For a voucher j to be non-overlapping with i, either:\n\nj's end < i's start OR i's end < j's start.\n\nSo for each voucher i, in the target_d group, we can consider two scenarios:\n\na. j ends before i starts. So j's end <= i's li - 1.\n\nb. i ends before j starts. So i's ri < j's li.\n\nSo for each voucher i, we can look into the target_d group and find all j's where either j ends before i starts, or i ends before j starts. Then, among those j's, pick the one with the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to find j's that satisfy these conditions quickly.\n\nAn idea: for each target_d, we can pre-process the vouchers in the group by their end times and start times.\n\nFor example, for each target_d group, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time. This will allow us to quickly find all j's where j ends before a certain point (i's li).\n\n- Or, sorted by start time. This will allow us to quickly find j's that start after i's end.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to have the target_d group's vouchers sorted by their end times and also by their start times.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, for each i, when looking for j's in target_d:\n\n- For scenario a: j's end <= i's li - 1. So among the j's in target_d, find those whose ri <= (li -1). We can binary search the target_d group's sorted end times to find all such j's.\n\nSimilarly, for scenario b: j's li > i's ri. So among the j's in target_d, find those whose li > i's ri. We can binary search the target_d group's sorted start times to find all such j's.\n\nBut how do we handle both cases?\n\nWait, perhaps for each target_d group, we can have the vouchers sorted by their end times and their start times.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\n- Compute target_d = x - d_i.\n\n- Check if target_d is in the dictionary.\n\n   - If not, continue.\n\n- For scenario a: find all j's in target_d where j's end <= i's li - 1. These j's can be found by searching the end-sorted list of target_d for the maximum ri <= (li_i -1). All j's up to that index are valid for scenario a.\n\n- For scenario b: find all j's in target_d where j's li > i's ri. These can be found by searching the start-sorted list of target_d for the first li > ri_i. All j's from that index onwards are valid for scenario b.\n\nOnce we have these subsets, we can find the minimal cost in each subset, if any.\n\nThe minimal cost for scenario a would be the minimal cost in the subset of j's where j ends before i starts.\n\nSimilarly for scenario b.\n\nWe can then take the minimum between the two scenarios and add it to i's cost, updating the global minimum.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute all vouchers' durations and group them by duration.\n\n2. For each group (d), sort the vouchers in two ways:\n\n   a. Sort by ri (end time) in ascending order.\n\n   b. Sort by li (start time) in ascending order.\n\n3. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute d_i = ri_i - li_i +1.\n\n   b. Compute target_d = x - d_i.\n\n   c. If target_d is not present in the groups, continue.\n\n   d. Else, for scenario a:\n\n      i. Use binary search on the end-sorted list of target_d to find the largest ri_j <= li_i -1.\n\n      ii. Among these j's, if any, find the one with minimal cost.\n\n   e. For scenario b:\n\n      i. Use binary search on the start-sorted list of target_d to find the first li_j > ri_i.\n\n      ii. Among these j's, if any, find the one with minimal cost.\n\n   f. If either scenario a or b has a valid j, compute the total cost (i's cost + j's cost) and update the global minimum.\n\n4. After processing all vouchers, output the global minimum if found; else, output -1.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nImplementing the grouping:\n\nWe can create a dictionary, say duration_groups, where each key is d, and the value is a tuple of two lists: one sorted by ri, and one sorted by li.\n\nSo for each voucher, we compute d, and add it to the corresponding group.\n\nWhen adding to the group, we can maintain the sorted lists as we go, or perhaps build them once after all data is collected.\n\nWait, no, because for each group, we can collect all vouchers, then sort them by ri and li separately.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each group d:\n\ngroup = list of vouchers with duration d.\n\ngroup.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # sorted by end time ri.\n\ngroup.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # sorted by start time li.\n\nWait, but in Python, sorting is in place, so we need to make copies.\n\nAlternatively, for each group, we can have two separate sorted lists: sorted_end and sorted_start.\n\nSo for group in duration_groups.values():\n\nsorted_end = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nsorted_start = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nAnd store these in the group's value.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to have for each group a tuple (sorted_end, sorted_start), where sorted_end is sorted by ri, and sorted_start is sorted by li.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nfor each voucher in vouchers:\n\n   li, ri, cost = ... \n\n   d = ri - li +1\n\n   if d not in duration_groups:\n\n       duration_groups[d] = []\n\n   duration_groups[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each d in duration_groups:\n\n   sorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n   sorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n   duration_groups[d] = (sorted_end, sorted_start)\n\nWait, but the vouchers in each group are tuples, right? So when we sort, we have to create new lists.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's step 1 done.\n\nThen, for each voucher i, we do the following:\n\nCompute target_d = x - d_i.\n\nIf target_d is not in duration_groups, continue.\n\nElse, get the two sorted lists for target_d: sorted_end and sorted_start.\n\nFor scenario a: find all j in sorted_end where j.ri <= i.li -1.\n\nWe can use bisect_right to find the insertion point for (i.li -1) in the j.ri list. All j's up to that index are candidates.\n\nAmong these j's, we need the one with minimal cost. So, if the list is non-empty, we can iterate through the first part and find the minimal cost.\n\nBut iterating through the first part could take O(k) time, where k is the number of j's in that part. That's not efficient if k is large.\n\nWait, so we need a way to quickly find the j with minimal cost in a subset of the sorted_end.\n\nHmm, perhaps pre-processing for each group, for each possible position in the sorted_end, we can precompute the prefix minima of costs.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start, precompute the suffix minima of costs.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each group, for each sorted_end list, we can compute a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost among the first i+1 elements (0-based index).\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start list, compute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost from index i to the end.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nFor each group d:\n\n   sorted_end = sorted by ri.\n\n   sorted_start = sorted by li.\n\n   compute prefix_min_end: for each index i, the minimal cost from 0 to i.\n\n   compute suffix_min_start: for each index i, the minimal cost from i to end.\n\nSo for example:\n\nprefix_min_end[0] = sorted_end[0].cost\n\nprefix_min_end[i] = min(prefix_min_end[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, suffix_min_start[-1] = sorted_end[-1].cost\n\nsuffix_min_start[i] = min(suffix_min_start[i+1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\nWait, no, for suffix_min_start, it's for the sorted_start list.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, we have two arrays:\n\n- end_prefix_min: for the sorted_end list, each element is the minimal cost up to that index.\n\n- start_suffix_min: for the sorted_start list, each element is the minimal cost from that index onward.\n\nThis way, when we find the range of indices to consider for scenario a or b, we can quickly get the minimal cost in that range.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nFor each group d:\n\n   sorted_end = sorted by ri.\n\n   end_prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_end)\n\n   end_prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n\n   for i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n\n       end_prefix_min[i] = min(end_prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n\n   Similarly for sorted_start:\n\n   sorted_start = sorted by li.\n\n   start_suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n\n   start_suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\n   for i in len(sorted_start)-2 downto 0:\n\n       start_suffix_min[i] = min(start_suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i][2])\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the sorted_end list, the prefix min is straightforward. For each position, it's the min of all costs up to that point.\n\nFor the sorted_start list, the suffix min is the min of all costs from that position to the end.\n\nSo, for the suffix_min_start:\n\nstart from the end, and for each position i, it's the min between sorted_start[i].cost and the next position's suffix_min.\n\nSo:\n\nstart_suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n\nlast = len(sorted_start) -1\n\nstart_suffix_min[last] = sorted_start[last][2]\n\nfor i in range(last-1, -1, -1):\n\n    start_suffix_min[i] = min(sorted_start[i][2], start_suffix_min[i+1])\n\nSo now, for any scenario a, where j's ri <= i_li -1:\n\nWe can find the rightmost index in sorted_end where j.ri <= i_li -1.\n\nLet's say the index is pos. All j's from 0 to pos are candidates.\n\nThe minimal cost in this subset is end_prefix_min[pos], provided pos >=0.\n\nSimilarly, for scenario b, j's li > i_ri.\n\nIn sorted_start, we find the first index where j.li > i_ri.\n\nAll j's from that index onwards are candidates.\n\nThe minimal cost in this subset is start_suffix_min[index], provided index < len(sorted_start).\n\nSo, for each i:\n\nCompute target_d = x - d_i.\n\nIf target_d not in duration_groups: continue.\n\nElse:\n\n   Get the sorted_end and start_suffix_min for target_d.\n\n   Find pos_a using bisect_right on the ri's of sorted_end for (i_li -1).\n\n   If pos_a >=0:\n\n       min_cost_a = end_prefix_min[pos_a]\n\n       total = i.cost + min_cost_a\n\n       compare with global min.\n\n   Get the sorted_start and start_suffix_min for target_d.\n\n   Find pos_b using bisect_left on the li's of sorted_start for (i_ri +1).\n\n   Because j's li must be > i_ri.\n\n   So the first j with li > i_ri is at pos_b.\n\n   If pos_b < len(sorted_start):\n\n       min_cost_b = start_suffix_min[pos_b]\n\n       total = i.cost + min_cost_b\n\n       compare with global min.\n\nSo the steps are clear.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the bisect operations.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module has functions like bisect_right and bisect_left.\n\nFor the sorted_end list, each j has (li, ri, cost). So to find the largest j where ri <= val, we can extract the ri's into a separate list and perform a bisect.\n\nAlternatively, for each sorted_end, we can create a list of ri's and li's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a list of just the ri values for the sorted_end list, and a list of li values for the sorted_start list.\n\nBecause for bisect, we need a single key to compare.\n\nSo for each group, during preprocessing:\n\nFor the sorted_end list, create a list called ri_list.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start list, create a list called li_list.\n\nSo for group d:\n\nsorted_end = sorted by ri.\n\nri_list = [j[1] for j in sorted_end]\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_start:\n\nli_list = [j[0] for j in sorted_start]\n\nWait, no. For scenario a, we're looking for j's where j.ri <= (i_li -1). So the ri_list for sorted_end is needed.\n\nFor scenario b, we're looking for j's where j.li > i_ri. So the li_list for sorted_start is needed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each group, in addition to sorted_end and start_suffix_min, we can precompute the ri_list and li_list.\n\nSo for group d:\n\nsorted_end = sorted by ri.\n\nri_list = [j[1] for j in sorted_end]\n\nstart_suffix_min = compute as above.\n\nsorted_start = sorted by li.\n\nli_list = [j[0] for j in sorted_start]\n\nSimilarly, the start_suffix_min is as computed.\n\nSo during the main loop:\n\nFor each voucher i (li_i, ri_i, cost_i):\n\n   d_i = ri_i - li_i +1\n\n   target_d = x - d_i\n\n   if target_d not in duration_groups: continue\n\n   group = duration_groups[target_d]\n\n   # Scenario a: j's end <= i_li -1\n\n   # get the sorted_end and ri_list, and end_prefix_min\n\n   a_valid = False\n\n   # Extract the ri_list and prefix_min_end\n\n   # Since group contains the info for target_d\n\n   # Wait, no. group is a tuple (sorted_end, sorted_start), along with their ri_list and start_suffix_min.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I should reorganize the data structure.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nEach group d is stored as a dictionary entry with keys 'sorted_end', 'ri_list', 'start_suffix_min', 'sorted_start', 'li_list'.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nfor d in duration_groups:\n\n   group = duration_groups[d]\n\n   sorted_end = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n   ri_list = [x[1] for x in sorted_end]\n\n   end_prefix_min = compute as before.\n\n   sorted_start = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n   li_list = [x[0] for x in sorted_start]\n\n   suffix_min_start = compute as before.\n\n   duration_groups[d] = {\n\n       'sorted_end': sorted_end,\n\n       'ri_list': ri_list,\n\n       'end_prefix_min': end_prefix_min,\n\n       'sorted_start': sorted_start,\n\n       'li_list': li_list,\n\n       'start_suffix_min': suffix_min_start,\n\n   }\n\nWait, but that's a lot of data. Maybe for each group, instead of storing all, perhaps during the main loop, for each group, we can extract the required information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to precompute all the necessary structures.\n\nSo, during the main loop, for each i:\n\nCompute target_d.\n\nIf target_d not in duration_groups: continue.\n\nElse:\n\n   group = duration_groups[target_d]\n\n   # For scenario a:\n\n   # j's ri <= i_li -1.\n\n   # group has 'ri_list' and 'end_prefix_min'\n\n   ri_val = i_li -1\n\n   pos = bisect.bisect_right(group['ri_list'], ri_val)\n\n   if pos > 0:\n\n       min_cost_a = group['end_prefix_min'][pos-1]\n\n       total_a = i.cost + min_cost_a\n\n       if total_a < global_min:\n\n           global_min = total_a\n\n   # For scenario b:\n\n   # j's li > i_ri.\n\n   # group has 'li_list' and 'start_suffix_min'\n\n   li_val = i_ri +1\n\n   pos = bisect.bisect_left(group['li_list'], li_val)\n\n   if pos < len(group['li_list']):\n\n       min_cost_b = group['start_suffix_min'][pos]\n\n       total_b = i.cost + min_cost_b\n\n       if total_b < global_min:\n\n           global_min = total_b\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nWhat if x is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2, so no.\n\nWhat if target_d is zero? Since x can be up to 4e5, and d_i can be up to 2e5, x-d_i could be zero only if d_i is equal to x. But in that case, target_d is zero, which is invalid because voucher durations are at least 1 (since li <= ri implies ri - li +1 >= 1). So in that case, target_d is zero, which isn't present in the groups, so it's skipped.\n\nAnother case: when x is smaller than the minimal possible sum of two durations. Like, if x=3 and each voucher has duration 2. Then, two vouchers would sum to 4, which is more than 3.\n\nSo the code correctly skips such cases.\n\nAnother edge case: when two vouchers are the same voucher, but the problem says i != j. So we must ensure that i and j are different vouchers.\n\nWait, but in the group, the vouchers are from the same duration. So when target_d is equal to d_i, we might have multiple vouchers in the same group. But in the code, when we process i, j can be any voucher in the group except i itself.\n\nBut in our approach, since the group includes all vouchers, including i itself, but in scenario a and b, when target_d is d_i, and when i's own voucher is in the group, it's possible that j is i.\n\nBut since the problem requires i != j, we need to avoid considering i itself.\n\nSo how can we handle that?\n\nAh, this is a crucial point.\n\nSo in the main loop, for each voucher i, when target_d is d_i (x - d_i = d_i), the group contains all j's with duration d_i. But j can be i itself. So when j is i, we have to skip it.\n\nSo, how to handle that.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, because in the group, the j's include i, but we can't select j=i.\n\nSo, when target_d is equal to d_i, when looking for j's, we need to exclude i itself.\n\nBut how? Because i is part of the group, and in the sorted_end and sorted_start lists.\n\nSo, during the main loop, when target_d is equal to d_i, the group contains all j's including i.\n\nThus, when processing i, in the group, when looking for j's, we need to exclude j=i.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps during the main loop, for each i, when target_d is d_i, we have to subtract the possibility of j being i.\n\nBut how to detect that.\n\nWait, perhaps for each voucher i, when target_d is d_i, we can compute the minimal cost excluding j=i.\n\nBut that would require additional handling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code as written would include j=i, leading to a wrong solution.\n\nBecause when i is in the group, and in scenario a or b, j could be i.\n\nBut since i and j must be different, the code as is would count i and i as a valid pair, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, how to handle this.\n\nLet's think: in the main loop, for each i, when target_d is d_i, the code considers all j's in the group, including i.\n\nThus, when the group contains j=i, it's included in the calculation.\n\nSo, when target_d == d_i, the code will consider i as a possible j, which is invalid.\n\nSo, we need to adjust the code to not consider j=i.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the only way is to check whether j is i. But that would complicate the code.\n\nWait, but in the group, j is a tuple (li, ri, costi). So for i's own voucher, it's (li_i, ri_i, cost_i).\n\nSo, during the scenario a and b checks, when j is i, it would have the same li and ri as i.\n\nThus, perhaps during the binary search, if the j's are i, we can filter them out.\n\nBut that's difficult, because the binary search returns a position, and the j's in that position could include i.\n\nAlternative approach: in the group, for each scenario, after finding the minimal cost in the subset, we can check whether the minimal j is i. If it is, then we have to find the next minimal.\n\nBut that could be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each group, we can note the minimal cost voucher and its index, but that seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the main loop, for each i, when target_d is d_i, we can compute the minimal cost in the group, and then subtract the cost of i if it's the minimal.\n\nBut that's also complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem arises only when the minimal cost in scenario a or b is i's own voucher.\n\nSo, perhaps during the scenario a or b processing, if the minimal cost is i's own cost, then we need to find the next minimal in that subset.\n\nBut that's not feasible, as the minimal could be anywhere in the subset.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to realize that when target_d is d_i, and in the group, the j's include i, then the code's current approach would include j=i, which is invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps during the main loop, when target_d == d_i, we need to subtract the case where j is i.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps in the main loop, when target_d == d_i, and the group has j's that include i, then for scenario a, the code would include j=i, leading to a pair (i,i), which is invalid.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle this.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nWhen target_d == d_i, in both scenario a and b, j can be i.\n\nThus, for each i, when target_d is d_i, we need to find j's that are in the group but not i.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nDuring the main loop:\n\nif target_d == d_i:\n\n   when checking scenario a or b, ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to modify the group for target_d, when target_d == d_i, to exclude i itself.\n\nBut that's not feasible because the group is built for all vouchers.\n\nWait, but during the main loop, for each i, when target_d is d_i, we can compute the minimal cost in the group, and then check if the minimal cost is i's cost.\n\nIf yes, then we need to find the next minimal in that subset.\n\nBut that could be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each group, we can precompute the minimal cost voucher and the second minimal, etc., but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each i, when target_d is d_i, and the group has j=i, then the code can proceed normally, but in the case where j is i, the cost would be 2 * i's cost, which is invalid, as the pair (i,i) is not allowed.\n\nThus, in the code, for each i, when target_d is d_i, and the minimal cost in scenario a is i's own cost, then we need to find the next minimal.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps it's easier to just subtract the possibility of j being i.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal cost in scenario a could be i's own cost, but we can't choose j=i.\n\nThus, for scenario a, when target_d == d_i, we need to find the minimal cost j in the group, but j is not i.\n\nSimilarly for scenario b.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach is to, for each group, when target_d is d_i, and j can be i, to exclude j=i.\n\nSo, for scenario a:\n\nif target_d == d_i:\n\n   in the group, find all j's where j.ri <= i_li -1, but j is not i.\n\nBut how to find that quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each group, we can have two separate lists: one without i, but that's not feasible because i varies per iteration.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way is to modify the code as follows:\n\nWhen target_d == d_i, and in scenario a or b, after finding the minimal cost, check whether that j is i.\n\nIf it is, then find the next minimal j in that subset.\n\nBut that could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can modify the way we query the group.\n\nWait, perhaps in the group, for scenario a, when target_d == d_i, the code can exclude j=i.\n\nSo, in the group, during scenario a, when target_d == d_i, the code can find the earliest j where j is not i and j.ri <= i_li -1.\n\nBut that's not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can, for scenario a and b, when target_d == d_i, perform an additional check whether j is i.\n\nBut that's difficult because the code is already using binary search and prefix/suffix minima.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is not that common, but to cover all cases, perhaps during the main loop, when target_d == d_i, the code can ignore j=i.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can, for each scenario a and b, when target_d == d_i, and the minimal cost is i's cost, then we need to find the next minimal in that subset.\n\nBut that's not straightforward.\n\nAn alternative idea: when target_d is d_i, the group contains all j's with duration d_i, including i.\n\nSo, during scenario a, when i_li -1 >= i_ri (which is always true since i_li <= i_ri), then j=i is a candidate.\n\nBut we have to exclude it.\n\nSo, during the scenario a processing, when target_d == d_i, after finding the minimal cost in the subset, if that j is i, we have to find the next minimal j.\n\nBut that's computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, we can precompute the minimal cost without considering a particular voucher.\n\nBut that's not feasible, as the voucher is varying.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to accept that in some cases, the code might consider j=i, which is invalid, and thus, the overall minimal cost could be overcounted.\n\nWait, but in reality, the pair (i,i) would have a cost of 2 * cost_i, which is likely higher than other possible pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps it's negligible, but the problem requires that i and j are different vouchers.\n\nThus, the code as written would give an incorrect answer in some cases.\n\nThus, we need to adjust the code to handle this.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nWhen target_d == d_i, for scenario a and b, the code should not include j=i.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nOne way is to, for each i, when target_d == d_i, after finding the minimal cost in scenario a, check whether that j is i.\n\nIf yes, then find the next minimal j in that subset, and so on.\n\nBut that could be time-consuming.\n\nBut given that the code is O(n log n), perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the scenario a, when target_d == d_i, the code can find the minimal cost j where j.ri <= i_li -1 and j is not i.\n\nSimilarly for scenario b.\n\nBut how.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative idea: for each i, when target_d == d_i, we can compute the minimal cost in scenario a as the minimal cost in the group's scenario a subset, but j is not i.\n\nSimilarly for scenario b.\n\nBut that requires for each i to process the group twice, once with j=i and once without.\n\nBut that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the scenario a processing, when target_d == d_i, the code can find the minimal cost j in the subset, but j is not i.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWait, perhaps during the scenario a processing, the code can find the minimal cost in the subset, but if the minimal j is i, then the code can find the next minimal j.\n\nBut that's not efficient, as for each i, it could require scanning the entire subset.\n\nBut perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\nIn the main loop, for each i:\n\n   compute target_d.\n\n   if target_d not in groups: continue.\n\n   group = duration_groups[target_d]\n\n   scenario a:\n\n      if target_d == d_i:\n\n          # find all j's in group where j.ri <= i_li -1, j != i.\n\n          # find the minimal cost j.\n\n          # how?\n\n          # perhaps, in the group's end_prefix_min, find the minimal j in the subset, but j !=i.\n\n          # but how.\n\n          # One approach: find all j's in the subset, then find the minimal cost j where j is not i.\n\n          # but that's O(k), which is not feasible.\n\n          # Another approach: during the binary search, exclude j=i.\n\n          # So, in the scenario a:\n\n          # first, find the pos where j.ri <= i_li -1.\n\n          # then, among the j's up to pos, find the one with minimal cost, but j != i.\n\n          # How to do that quickly.\n\n          # Perhaps, precompute for each group, for each possible position, the minimal cost j where j != i.\n\n          # But that's not feasible.\n\n          # Alternatively, perhaps for the group, have a list of all j's, and for each j, know their index in the group.\n\n          # But this seems complicated.\n\n          # So perhaps, for the group, when target_d == d_i, the code can find the minimal cost j in the subset, but j is not i.\n\n          # How?\n\n          # Perhaps, iterate through the j's up to pos, and find the minimal cost j where j is not i.\n\n          # But for n=2e5, this could be O(n), which is not feasible.\n\n          # Thus, perhaps the only way is to assume that j=i is not the minimal cost, and proceed.\n\n          # Which could lead to incorrect results.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of trying to handle the case where j=i, perhaps it's better to modify the group's data structure to exclude j=i when target_d == d_i.\n\nBut that's not feasible because the group is shared across all i's.\n\nWait, perhaps during the main loop, when target_d == d_i, the code can create a temporary group that excludes j=i, and then proceed as before.\n\nBut that's not efficient.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for i and j to be the same voucher, but the problem requires i and j to be different, but the code as is is allowing j=i, but the problem says i≠j. So, the code needs to choose i≠j.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to handle it is to process all possible j's except i.\n\nBut in practice, the sample input shows that for the first case, the two vouchers are selected as the first and third voucher.\n\nWait, in the first sample, the first voucher is i=1, and the third voucher is chosen.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle it.\n\nWait, in the first sample input:\n\nn=4, x=5.\n\nVoucher 1: 1-3, cost 4.\n\nvoucher 1: 1-2, cost 5.\n\nvoucher 1: 1 2 4.\n\nWait, sorry, perhaps the problem is better to proceed.\n\nBut the code must correctly handle this.\n\nThus, perhaps the code as described earlier will work, but we need to find a way to handle the case where two vouchers can be overlapping.\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is a bit confusing. Let me see.\n\nIn the sample input, the first voucher is 1-2, cost 5, and the third voucher is 5-6, cost 1. So, the total duration is 3-1+1 (voucher 1) plus 6-5+1 (voucher 3). So the sum is 3 days + 1 day (voucher 3) which is 3+1=3+1=3. So 3+1=4, and 1+1=2 days.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, voucher 1: li=1, ri=3, cost is 4. Duration is 3-1+1=3 days.\n\nVoucher 1: 1-3, cost 4.\n\nVoucher 1 is 1-3, cost 4.\n\nVoucher 3 is 5-6, cost 1.\n\nSo, the sum of durations is 3+2=5.\n\nThey don't overlap, as 3 <5.\n\nSo, the minimal cost is 4+1=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nBut, in this case, when i is voucher 1, target_d is 5-3=2.\n\nSo, in the group of duration 2, voucher 3 is in that group.\n\nSo, the code finds that.\n\nThus, the code would correctly find this pair.\n\nSo, the code as written works.\n\nBut, what about cases where i and j are the same voucher?\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration equals exactly `x` days and whose total cost is minimized.

Each group will store the vouchers sorted by their end time and start time separately.\n3. **Prefix and Suffix Minima**: For each group, precompute prefix minima for the end-sorted list and suffix minima for the start-sorted list to quickly find the minimum cost in any subset of vouchers.\n4. **Binary Search for Non-overlapping Vouchers**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with a duration that complements the current voucher's duration to sum up to `x`.
