The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about the game Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds. In each round, both choose their moves based on their respective sequences A and B. The loser gets a red spot, except when it's a draw, then nothing happens.\n\nMy task is to compute how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm. So for each round, I need to determine who loses, and add a spot to that person.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, I need to simulate each of the n rounds. For each round i (from 0 to n-1), I get the move for Nikephoros as A[i % m], since his sequence is cyclic. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nThen, determine the outcome:\n\n- If they are the same, no one gets a spot.\n- Else, the winner is determined by the standard rules: Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nWait, but wait: the winner is the one who beats the other. So in each round, if A's move beats B's, then B loses a point. Else if B's move beats A's, then A loses a point.\n\nSo for each round, I check if A_move beats B_move. If yes, B gets a spot. Else, A gets a spot. If equal, no change.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nInitialize two counters, a = 0, b = 0.\n\nFor each round from 0 to n-1:\n\n- Get a_char = A[round % m_len]\n- Get b_char = B[round % k_len]\n\nWhere m_len is len(A), k_len is len(B).\n\nCompare a_char and b_char.\n\nIf a_char beats b_char: then a increases by 1.\n\nElse if b_char beats a_char: b increases by 1.\n\nElse: no change.\n\nAfter processing all rounds, output a and b.\n\nWait, no: Wait, the first player is the one whose move is in A, right? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the problem says that in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch. So, if in a round, the winner is Nikephoros, then Polycarpus gets a spot. Because the winner is the one giving the pinch.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the loser gets pinched\". So the loser is the one who ends up with the red spot.\n\nSo, in each round, if A wins, then B (Polycarpus) gets a spot. If B wins, then A (Nikephoros) gets a spot.\n\nYes, because the winner is the one who causes the loss.\n\nSo, the logic is:\n\nfor each round:\n\nget a_move = A[round % m_len]\n\nget b_move = B[round % k_len]\n\nif a_move == b_move: no spots.\n\nelse:\n\ncheck if a_move beats b_move. If yes, then B (Polycarpus) gets a spot.\n\nif not, then A (Nikephoros) gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each round, we need to do this.\n\nNow, how to implement the 'beats' condition.\n\nWe can represent each move as R, S, P.\n\nWe can create a helper function or a dictionary that says what beats what.\n\nLike:\n\nbeats = {\n\n    'R': 'S',\n\n    'S': 'P',\n\n    'P': 'R'\n\n}\n\nBecause:\n\nRock (R) beats scissors (S)\n\nScissors (S) beat paper (P)\n\nPaper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\nSo, for a given a_move and b_move:\n\nif a_move == b_move: no action.\n\nelse:\n\nif beats[a_move] == b_move: then a_move beats b_move, so B loses, so add 1 to a.\n\nelse: B's move beats A's, so A loses, add 1 to b.\n\nWait, wait: Wait, no. If a_move is 'R', and b_move is 'S', then a_move beats b_move. So B gets a spot.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif a_move == b_move:\n\n    pass\n\nelse:\n\n    if beats[a_move] == b_move:\n\n        # a_move wins, so B gets a spot.\n\n        b +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        # b_move wins, so A gets a spot.\n\n        a +=1\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo now, the steps are clear.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nRead A and B strings.\n\nBut wait, looking at the example input:\n\nIn the sample input, it's given as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, but in Python, when you read lines from stdin, perhaps using input().strip(), but in this case, the input may contain multiple lines, each line being a string.\n\nWait, let me see: the first line is n, which is 7 in the sample.\n\nThe second line is A, which is 'RPS'.\n\nThe third line is B, which is 'RSPP'.\n\nSo, in code, I can read n as integer, then A as the second line stripped, and B as the third line stripped.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nThen, for each round in 0 to n-1:\n\nCompute a_move = A[round % len(A)]\n\nb_move = B[round % len(B)]\n\nThen perform the comparison.\n\nSo, let's test the sample.\n\nSample input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is 'RPS' (length 3), B is 'RSPP' (length 4).\n\nLet's see the 7 rounds.\n\nRound 0:\n\na_move = A[0] = 'R'\n\nb_move = B[0] = 'R' → same → no spots.\n\nRound 1:\n\na_move = A[1] = 'P'\n\nb_move = B[1] = 'S'\n\nCheck if 'P' beats 'S'? No, because 'S' beats 'P'. So B's move is S, which beats P. So B's move wins. So A (Nikephoros) gets a spot.\n\nSo a = 1.\n\nWait, but wait: if a_move is P, and b_move is S.\n\nDoes P beat S? No, because S beats P. So the winner is B, so A (Nikephoros) gets a spot.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier logic: if a_move is P, then beats[a_move] is R. So for a_move P, it beats R. So in this case, P vs S: a_move is P, b_move is S. Since P doesn't beat S (because S is not R), then the else clause applies: b_move's move beats a_move. So A gets a spot.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nWait, but in the sample note, the first round is R vs R: draw.\n\nSecond round is P vs S: P loses. So B (Polycarpus) wins, so A (Nikephoros) gets a spot.\n\nWait, no: in the sample note, the second round is P vs S: P is beaten by S. So the loser is Polycarpus, so he gets a spot? Or is it the other way around.\n\nWait, the note says: \"P - S. Nikephoros loses.\" So in that round, Polycarpus's move is S, and he beats P. So Polycarpus is the winner, and Nikephoros is the loser. So Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo in the sample, the first seven rounds:\n\n1. R vs R: draw.\n\n2. P vs S: P is beaten, so Nikephoros loses → a +=1.\n\n3. S vs P: S beats P → Polycarpus loses → b +=1.\n\n4. R vs P: R beats P → Polycarpus loses → b +=1.\n\n5. P vs R: P beats R → Nikephoros loses → a +=1.\n\n6. S vs S: draw.\n\n7. R vs P: R beats P → Polycarpus loses → b +=1.\n\nSo total a=3, b=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code correctly models this.\n\nSo now, in code:\n\nImplement the beats mapping.\n\nLoop over each round from 0 to n-1.\n\nCompute a_move and b_move.\n\nCheck if they are same → skip.\n\nElse, check if a_move's beaten move is b_move.\n\nIf yes: b +=1.\n\nElse: a +=1.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if n is 0? But the problem states n >=1, so no.\n\nWhat if A and B are empty? No, because m and k are at least 1.\n\nWhat about when the sequences are longer than needed?\n\nNo problem, modulo ensures it cycles.\n\nAnother test case: n=1.\n\nA is 'R', B is 'S'.\n\nRound 0: R vs S. R beats S → B (Polycarpus) gets a spot. So a is 0, b is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2.\n\nA is 'RR', B is 'SS'.\n\nRound 0: R vs S → R beats S → b +=1.\n\nRound 1: R vs S → same, so b +=1.\n\nTotal a=0, b=2.\n\nSo code should handle these.\n\nNow, implementing in Python.\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nCompute len_A = len(A), len_B = len(B).\n\nInitialize a = 0, b =0.\n\nCreate the beats dictionary.\n\nLoop for each round in range(n):\n\ni = round number.\n\na_move = A[i % len_A]\n\nb_move = B[i % len_B]\n\nif a_move == b_move: continue.\n\nelse:\n\nif beats[a_move] == b_move:\n\n    b +=1\n\nelse:\n\n    a +=1\n\nAt the end, print a and b.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting with sample:\n\nn=7.\n\nA is 'RPS' (len 3).\n\nB is 'RSPP' (len4).\n\nFor each round from 0 to 6.\n\nAs per the sample, the code will count a=3, b=2.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='S' → a=0, b=1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, A='RR', B='SS' → a=0, b=2.\n\nLooks good.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the inputs.\n\nImplement the beats.\n\nLoop.\n\nPrint.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\na = 0\nb = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % len(A)]\n    b_move = B[i % len(B)]\n    \n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue\n    if beats[a_move] == b_move:\n        b +=1\n    else:\n        a +=1\n\nprint(a, b)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n\nWait, what about when the length of A or B is zero? But according to the problem statement, m and k are at least 1, so no problem.\n\nAnother thing: when the modulo is taken, but len(A) could be zero, but the problem says m and k are >=1, so no issue.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to simulate a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, over `n` rounds. Each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves, and the loser of each round gets a red spot on their body. Our task is to determine the total number of red spots each player ends up with.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game is played in `n` rounds where each player uses their respective sequences cyclically. The winner of each round is determined by the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. If the same move is chosen by both players, it results in a draw with no red spots.\n2. **Cyclic Move Handling**: Each player's moves are cyclic, meaning they repeat indefinitely. We use modulo operations to handle the cyclic nature of the sequences.\n3. **Determine Winners**: For each round, determine if one player's move beats the other. Use a dictionary to map each move to the move it defeats.\n4. **Count Red Spots**: Track the number of red spots for each player based on who loses each round.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\na = 0\nb = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % len(A)]\n    b_move = B[i % len(B)]\n    \n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue\n    if beats[a_move] == b_move:\n        b += 1\n    else:\n        a += 1\n\nprint(a, b)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B` from the input.\n2. **Cyclic Moves**: Use modulo operations to cycle through the sequences `A` and `B`.\n3. **Determine Losers**: For each round, check if the moves result in a win for one player. Update the red spot count for the losing player.\n4. **Output Results**: After processing all rounds, print the total number of red spots for each player.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the cyclic nature of the moves and correctly tracks the outcome of each round to determine the red spots accurately.",
