Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?').

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And also, output these pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem better.\n\nSo, each left boot has a color (a lowercase letter or '?'), same for right boots. Two colors are compatible if they're the same or one is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the description: an indefinite color (i.e., '?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color. So, when either is '?', they are compatible. Otherwise, their colors must be exactly the same.\n\nSo, for example:\n- 'f' and 'f' are compatible.\n- '?' and 'z' are compatible.\n- 'a' and '?' are compatible.\n- '?' and '?' are compatible.\n\nBut 'f' and 'g' are not, and 'a' and 'z' aren't.\n\nSo, the task is to pair each left boot with a right boot, without reusing any, such that the number of compatible pairs is maximized.\n\nI need to compute the maximum possible k, and then list all such pairs.\n\nThe output requires the count and then each pair in some order. It's important that the left indices are unique and the right indices are unique across the pairs.\n\nNow, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. n can be up to 150,000. So, O(n^2) approaches are definitely out of the question. We need something efficient, probably O(n log n) time.\n\nWhat's the strategy here? It seems like we need to match left and right boots in a way that as many as possible pairs are compatible.\n\nLet's consider each possible left boot and see which right boots it can pair with. But doing this naively is too slow.\n\nAnother idea: For each character c, count the number of left boots of c and the number of right boots of c. Then, the minimum of those two counts can contribute to the maximum possible pairs.\n\nBut wait, because '?' can match anything, including other '?'s. So, perhaps we should handle '?' separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem, but again, with n up to 1.5e5, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp would be manageable, but the implementation might be tricky.\n\nWait, but considering that each left can connect to multiple rights, but with the constraints on the colors, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me think differently. Since each pair can only be between a left and a right, perhaps we can process the left and right arrays, and for each possible color (including '?'), track how many lefts and rights have that color, then compute the maximum possible.\n\nBut the '?' case complicates things because it can match any color.\n\nAn alternative approach:\n\nWe can categorize the left and right boots into different groups based on their color, including a group for '?'.\n\nFor each group, we can compute how many lefts and rights belong to it. The sum of min(left_count, right_count) over all groups gives an upper bound on the maximum pairs, but since some lefts and rights can't be matched by others, perhaps the actual maximum is less than this.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Because, for example, a left '?' can match any right, but a right '?' can also match any left, including those that have fixed colors.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is structured, each left can only be paired with a right once. So, perhaps the maximum possible is determined by the sum of the minimums of the counts for each color, plus the handling of the '?'s.\n\nWait, no. Because the '?'s can take any role.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\nLet’s consider that each left boot can be of a certain color, and each right boot can be of a certain color.\n\nWe can create a frequency table for left and right.\n\nFor each color c, let left_count[c] = number of lefts with color c.\n\nSimilarly, right_count[c] = number of rights with color c.\n\nThen, the number of pairs contributed by color c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nAdditionally, for the '?', the lefts can pair with any rights, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but this might not capture the full picture. Because, for example, a left that is 'a' can pair with a right that is 'a', contributing to both the 'a' counts and the non-'?' counts.\n\nBut perhaps the way to proceed is as follows:\n\nCompute the number of pairs where both are specific colors (c), which is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nThen, compute the number of pairs where one is '?': for each left that is '?', it can pair with any right (including '?'). Similarly, for each right that is '?', it can pair with any left (including '?').\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid double-counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Compute for each color c, the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c]. Sum these up. Let this be total_pairs.\n\n2. Now, for the remaining lefts and rights, which are not yet paired, the '? can be used to pair any remaining lefts with any remaining rights.\n\nSo, after step 1, the remaining lefts and rights may have some that are '?'. Or perhaps, some specific colors remain.\n\nWait, no. After step 1, the left_count[c] and right_count[c] are reduced by min(left_count[c], right_count[c]), so the remaining could be zero, positive, etc.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Because, for example, left_count['a'] is 3, right_count['a'] is 5. So, min is 3, so 3 pairs are made. The remaining right_count['a'] is 2.\n\nSo, now, for the remaining lefts and rights, the '? can be used to pair any.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n- First, pair as many specific color pairs as possible.\n\n- Then, use the remaining lefts and rights (which can be of any color, but possibly including '?') to make as many '?' pairs as possible.\n\nBut wait, the remaining lefts and rights could include '?', which can pair together.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding '?'), compute the number of pairs as min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Sum these into total_pairs.\n\n2. Subtract these from left_count and right_count.\n\n3. Now, for the remaining lefts and rights, regardless of their color, any left can pair with any right if either is '?'. So, the number of such pairs is the minimum of the total remaining lefts and the total remaining rights.\n\n4. Add this to the total_pairs.\n\nBut wait, no. Because, for example, suppose we have lefts of color 'a' and rights of color 'b', but neither is '?'. They can't pair. So, this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, that's a problem.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the initial approach isn't sufficient.\n\nAlternative approach: think about it as a bipartite graph, where edges exist between lefts and rights that are compatible.\n\nEach left can be connected to several rights, but we need to find a maximum matching.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, the standard Hopcroft-Karp algorithm may not be feasible due to memory constraints, but perhaps it's manageable if implemented correctly.\n\nBut implementing Hopcroft-Karp in Python for such a large n might be challenging, especially considering that each node has potentially n edges. That's 1.5e5 nodes each with 1.5e5 edges—way too much.\n\nSo, perhaps Hopcroft-Karp isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternative idea: model the problem as a flow network with capacities and find the maximum matching using a more efficient method.\n\nBut even that might be difficult given the size.\n\nWait, but perhaps the structure of the problem allows for a greedy approach.\n\nWhat's the key here? Each pair is between a left and a right, and they must be compatible. So, for each left, we can choose any right that is compatible, but ensuring that no right is chosen more than once.\n\nHmm, but finding an optimal matching in such a way is tricky.\n\nWait, another observation: for the specific colors, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for all c. Additionally, the '?' can be used to pair any remaining lefts and rights.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not accurate because some specific color lefts can't be paired with specific color rights, but can be paired with '?' rights.\n\nSo, maybe the correct approach is:\n\nCompute for each color c:\n\npairs_c = min(left_count[c], right_count[c])\n\nsum all pairs_c to get the base.\n\nThen, the remaining lefts and rights can be considered as:\n\n- All lefts not yet paired (including those that are '?')\n\n- All rights not yet paired (including those that are '?')\n\nThe number of additional pairs is the minimum of the total remaining lefts and total remaining rights.\n\nBecause, any left can pair with any right, as long as either is '?'. But wait, no—because a left could be 'a' and a right could be 'b', neither is '?', so they cannot pair.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, the initial approach of adding the minimum of the remaining counts is incorrect because some of the remaining lefts and rights can't pair.\n\nSo, that approach overcounts.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, what's the correct way?\n\nPerhaps, we can model it as:\n\nThe maximum possible is the sum of the min of left_count[c] and right_count[c] for each c, plus the number of '?' lefts multiplied by the number of '?' rights, but that's also incorrect because a left '?' can pair with a right that's not '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because a left '?' can pair with any right, regardless of its color. Similarly, a right '?' can pair with any left.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum is:\n\nmax_pairs = sum( min(lc, rc) for c in all colors ) + (remaining_lefts - lcq) * (remaining_rights - rcq), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nCompute for each color c (excluding '?'), the number of pairs as min(lc, rc). Then, subtract these from lc and rc.\n\nAfter that, the remaining lc and rc include the '?', which can pair with each other and with others.\n\nWait, but the remaining lc includes all colors except for those that were paired via specific matches. The same for rc.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding '?'), compute the number of pairs as min(lc, rc), and add to total.\n\n2. Subtract these from lc and rc.\n\n3. Now, the remaining lefts can be of any color (including '?'), and the same for rights.\n\n4. For the remaining lefts and rights, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the total remaining lefts and the total remaining rights, but only if either the left or right is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because a left could be 'a' and a right could be 'b'; they can't pair, even though neither is '?'.\n\nSo, that's a problem.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the only way to accurately compute the maximum is to process the problem in a way that considers all possible compatible pairs, not just the ones that are same colors or '?'.\n\nBut with n being up to 1.5e5, a standard approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where each left is connected to all compatible rights. Then, the maximum matching in this graph is the answer.\n\nBut with 1.5e5 nodes, Hopcroft-Karp is O(E*sqrt(V)), which might be acceptable if E is manageable.\n\nBut each left can connect to a lot of rights, leading to a high E, which may not be feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the number of possible connections can be optimized.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure of the bipartite graph.\n\nEach left i can be connected to right j if l[i] is compatible with r[j].\n\nWhich happens if l[i] == r[j], or l[i] is '?', or r[j] is '?'.\n\nSo, for each left i, the compatible rights are:\n\n- All rights j where r[j] == l[i]\n\n- All rights j where r[j] == '?'\n\n- Plus, any right j where l[i] is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because if l[i] is '?', it can pair with any right j, regardless of r[j]'s value.\n\nSimilarly, if r[j] is '?', it can pair with any left i, regardless of l[i]'s value.\n\nSo, for a given left i:\n\n- If l[i] is 'a', then it can pair with all rights j where r[j] is 'a' or '?'.\n\n- If l[i] is '?', it can pair with all rights j.\n\nSimilarly, for a right j, it can be paired with any left i if r[j] is '?', or if l[i] is equal to r[j], or if l[i] is '?'.\n\nWait, but in the bipartite graph, each edge is from left to right, so for a left i, the edges are to all compatible j.\n\nSo, the edges for left i are:\n\n- All j where r[j] is equal to l[i] or '?'.\n\nSo, for each left i, the compatible rights are the set of j where r[j] is either l[i] or '?'. \n\nThus, the edges can be represented as:\n\nFor each left i:\n\nedges_i = { j | r[j] == l[i] or r[j] == '?' }\n\nSo, for each left i, we can compute the set of j's it can connect to.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, this could result in O(n^2) edges, which is impossible to handle.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of modeling the problem as a bipartite graph, perhaps we can find a way to compute the maximum matching without explicitly constructing the graph.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the problem.\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph where edges represent compatible pairs.\n\nThis is exactly the maximum bipartite matching problem.\n\nBut since the graph is bipartitioned into left and right sets, each of size n, and the edges follow the compatibility rules, perhaps we can find a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut again, with n being 1.5e5, standard algorithms are impractical.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWhat if we precompute for each color c, the number of lefts and rights of color c. Then, the number of pairs that can be formed between lefts and rights of color c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). We can sum this for all c.\n\nThen, after that, we have the remaining lefts and rights, which can be of any color (including '?'). These remaining can form pairs if either is '?'. So, the maximum possible is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for all c, plus the minimum of the remaining lefts and rights.\n\nWait, but this isn't correct because some of the remaining lefts and rights may not be compatible.\n\nWait, for example, if a left is 'a' and a right is 'b', neither is '?', then even though they are in the remaining pool, they can't form a pair.\n\nSo, the previous approach overcounts.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for all c, plus the number of pairs formed by the remaining lefts and rights that are compatible.\n\nBut computing that is not straightforward.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me consider that the maximum possible pairs is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for all c, plus the number of pairs formed between the remaining lefts and rights where at least one is '?'.\n\nWait, no, because a pair can consist of a left that is specific and a right that is '?', or vice versa, which is allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each color c, compute the number of pairs as min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Sum these.\n\n2. For the remaining lefts and rights:\n\n   a. Compute how many lefts are '?', and how many rights are '?'.\n\n   b. The number of additional pairs is the minimum of the total remaining lefts and total remaining rights.\n\n   Because, any left can pair with any right if at least one is '?'. Or is this not the case?\n\nWait, no. Because a left of 'a' can pair with a right of 'b' only if either is '?'. So, the additional pairs are not simply the minimum of the remaining counts.\n\nHmm. So, this complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to first pair as many specific pairs as possible, then for the remaining, count the number of pairs where either the left or right is '?', and pair them greedily.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe, after pairing the specific colors, the remaining lefts and rights can be processed as follows:\n\n- Collect all lefts that are '?', call this Lq.\n\n- Collect all rights that are '?', call this Rq.\n\n- Then, for each left in Lq, it can pair with any right (including those that are '?'). Similarly, for rights in Rq, they can pair with any left.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum of:\n\n- For each color c, min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nPlus:\n\n- The minimum of the number of lefts that are '?' plus the number of rights that are '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because that's not correct. Because a left '?' can pair with a right that's not '?', and vice versa.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs = sum( min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for all c )\n\n+ min( total_remaining_lefts, total_remaining_rights )\n\nwhere total_remaining_lefts is (n - sum_c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))) \n\nand total_remaining_rights is similarly (n - sum_c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) )\n\nBut this is incorrect because not all remaining lefts and rights can form pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) captures all possible specific pairs, and the remaining can only be paired if one of them is '?'. So, the maximum additional pairs is the minimum of the number of '?' in lefts plus the number of '?' in rights, and the remaining lefts and rights.\n\nNo, that's not correct either.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible additional pairs is the minimum between the total remaining lefts and rights, but considering that any left can pair with any right as long as either is '?'.\n\nWait, but how to model that.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSuppose that after pairing all possible specific pairs, we have some lefts and rights left. Among these, some can be paired because one is '?'. So, the maximum additional pairs is the minimum of the number of lefts that are either '?' or can be paired with some right that is '?', and similar for rights.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nPerhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for each c, plus the number of pairs where one is '?' and the other is any color, but this is tricky because the same left and right can't be used in both specific and ? pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) represents all specific pairs, and the remaining lefts and rights can form as many pairs as possible, but only if one is '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum number of such additional pairs is the minimum of the total remaining lefts and the total remaining rights, but only considering the cases where at least one is '?'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) plus the minimum between the number of lefts that are not in any specific pair and the number of rights that are not in any specific pair.\n\nWait, but that would be incorrect because a left could be part of a specific pair and also be a '?', which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach the problem differently.\n\nLet me think about the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are compatible. Then, the maximum matching is the required answer.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, how can I compute this quickly?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the graph is bipartite and can be represented in a way that allows for efficient computation.\n\nWait, but I'm stuck on how to model this.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince each left can connect to all rights that are compatible with it, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges are added based on the color compatibility.\n\nBut again, with n up to 1.5e5, it's not feasible to build such a graph.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting the number of pairs where left color is '?', right color is '?', and then adding the rest.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the problem can be broken down into four cases:\n\nCase 1: Both left and right are specific colors and same.\n\nCase 2: Left is specific, right is '?'.\n\nCase 3: Right is specific, left is '?'.\n\nCase 4: Both are '?'.\n\nBut even so, it's unclear how to count these without overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible pairs is:\n\nsum_over_c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) \n\nplus the number of lefts that are '?' plus the number of rights that are '?' minus the number of pairs where both are '?', because those can be used in case 4.\n\nWait, no, because the '?' can be used in any combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nsum_over_c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) \n\nplus the minimum between the number of '?' in lefts plus the number of '?' in rights.\n\nBut this is also incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is:\n\nsum_over_c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) \n\nplus the minimum of (number of lefts that are '?', number of rights that are '?') \n\nplus the number of lefts that are '?', times the number of rights that are not '?', but that's not correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck.\n\nLet me look for an example.\n\nConsider the sample input:\n\nLeft: codeforces\n\nRight: dodivthree\n\nWait, but perhaps looking at the sample will help.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=10\n\nl: codeforces\n\nr: abaca?b\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum pairs can be found by:\n\nPairing specific colors, then handling the '?'.\n\nBut it's unclear.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nPerhaps the maximum possible pairs is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for all c, plus the number of pairs where one is '?' and the other is any color, but without double-counting.\n\nWait, but how to calculate that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAfter pairing all specific color pairs, the remaining lefts and rights can form pairs if at least one is '?'.\n\nSo, the number of such pairs is the minimum of the total remaining lefts and the total remaining rights, but only considering those that can be paired with '?'.\n\nWait, but this is not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps after pairing all specific color pairs, the remaining lefts and rights can be paired as follows:\n\nThe number of '?' in lefts is Lq.\n\nThe number of '?' in rights is Rq.\n\nThe number of pairs where both are '?' is min(Lq, Rq).\n\nThe remaining can be:\n\nleft_non_q = L_total - Lq.\n\nright_non_q = R_total - Rq.\n\nThese can be paired with any '?' on the other side.\n\nSo, the additional pairs are:\n\nmin(Lq, Rq) + min(Lq, right_non_q) + min(right_non_q, Lq).\n\nWait, no, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the additional pairs can be:\n\nThe number of '?' in lefts multiplied by the number of non-? rights plus the number of '?' rights multiplied by the number of non-? lefts, but that's not correct because it's possible that some non-? can pair with non-? if they are the same.\n\nBut wait, no. Because in the specific pairing phase, we've already taken all possible pairs between specific colors.\n\nSo, the remaining non-? lefts and rights cannot form any specific pairs, so they can only form pairs if one is '?'.\n\nSo, the additional pairs are:\n\nmin(Lq, Rq) + min(Lq, R_non_q) + min(Rq, L_non_q).\n\nWait, no, because Lq can pair with Rq, which is min(Lq, Rq). Then, Lq can pair with R_non_q, but each R_non_q can only be paired once.\n\nSimilarly, Rq can pair with L_non_q, but each L_non_q can only be paired once.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is:\n\nadditional_pairs = min(Lq, Rq) + min(Lq, R_non_q) + min(Rq, L_non_q).\n\nBut that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's:\n\nadditional_pairs = min(Lq + Rq, L_total + R_total - sum(min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))) )\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the specific pairs, the remaining lefts and rights can form as many pairs as the minimum of the remaining lefts and the remaining rights, but only considering whether at least one is '?'.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think I'm stuck on finding a mathematical approach.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the problem as a bipartite graph and model it accordingly.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll need to find a way to implement this.\n\nWait, but given the problem statement, the solution likely involves using the fact that the bipartite graph can be divided into certain groups, allowing for an efficient maximum matching.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can model the problem as a bipartite graph where each left can connect to all rights that are compatible. Then, the maximum matching in this graph is the answer.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, building this graph is impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the graph can be represented in a compressed way. For example, for each left, we can track the set of compatible rights, but this is still O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into the following:\n\nEach left can be connected to all rights that are either '?' or have the same color as the left.\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\nWait, but for each left, the compatible rights are:\n\n- All rights with color equal to the left's color.\n\n- All rights with color '?'.\n\nSo, for each left i:\n\ncompatible_rights_i = { j | r[j] == l[i] or r[j] == '?' }\n\nSo, the size of compatible_rights_i is (count of r[j] == l[i]) + (count of r[j] == '?').\n\nBut how can we model this in a way that allows for efficient computation of maximum matching.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe bipartite graph can be considered as having two parts: left and right. Each left node has edges to all compatible right nodes.\n\nThe maximum matching in this graph is the maximum number of pairs we can form.\n\nBut again, with n up to 1.5e5, standard algorithms are not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find that the maximum matching can be computed using a certain formula based on the counts of each color and the '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum matching is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for each c, plus the number of '?' in left multiplied by the number of '?' in right, but that's not correct because that would count some pairs twice.\n\nWait, no. Because if a left is '?' and a right is '?', they can form a pair, but also, if a left is 'a' and a right is '?', they can form a pair.\n\nSo, the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for each c gives all specific pairs.\n\nThen, the remaining lefts and rights can be paired if either is '?', but how?\n\nThe remaining lefts are those not paired in the specific step.\n\nSo, the remaining lefts are:\n\nL_rem = sum over lefts not in any specific pair.\n\nSimilarly, R_rem = sum over rights not in any specific pair.\n\nIn the remaining, any left can pair with any right if either is '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum additional pairs is the minimum of L_rem and R_rem.\n\nBut this is only correct if all remaining lefts and rights can be paired, which is not the case.\n\nBecause, for example, a left is 'a' and a right is 'b', neither is '?', so they cannot pair.\n\nSo, the initial approach is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of pairs can't be computed just by summing the specific pairs and adding the minimum of the remaining.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet’s precompute for each color c:\n\n- The number of lefts of color c: left_count[c]\n\n- The number of rights of color c: right_count[c]\n\nCompute the number of specific pairs as sum(min(left_count[c], right_count[c])).\n\nThen, the number of pairs where left is '?' and right is any color is left_question * (total_right - sum(right_count[c] for c in all colors)).\n\nSimilarly, the number of pairs where right is '?' and left is any color is right_question * (total_left - sum(left_count[c] for c in all colors)).\n\nBut wait, this will count some pairs twice. For example, a pair where both are '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the total is:\n\nspecific_pairs + (left_question * right_question) + (left_question * (total_right - right_question - sum_right_non_question)) + (right_question * (total_left - left_question - sum_left_non_question)).\n\nWait, no, that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible is:\n\nspecific_pairs + (left_question * right_question) + min(left_question, total_right - right_question) + min(right_question, total_left - left_question).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs = specific_pairs + min( (left_question + right_question) , (total_left + total_right) - (sum of specific pairs) )\n\nWait, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nspecific_pairs + min( (left_question * (total_right - right_question) ) + (right_question * (total_left - left_question)), (left_question + right_question) )\n\nBut again, unsure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can model the problem as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching using a greedy approach, but it's unclear how to do that.\n\nBut perhaps the bipartite graph can be divided into four components:\n\n1. Edges between lefts and rights of the same color.\n\n2. Edges between lefts of color c and rights of color c.\n\n3. Edges between lefts of any color and rights of '?'.\n\n4. Edges between rights of any color and lefts of '?'.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nPerhaps the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nsum_{c} min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) \n\n+ min(left_question, right_question) \n\n+ min(left_question, total_right - right_question) \n\n+ min(right_question, total_left - left_question).\n\nBut this seems to be adding multiple terms, which might not be correct.\n\nWait, but let's think:\n\n- The first term is the specific pairs.\n\n- The second term is the pairs where both are '?'.\n\n- The third term is pairs where left is '?' and right is not '?'.\n\n- The fourth term is pairs where right is '?' and left is not '?'.\n\nBut wait, this counts some pairs multiple times.\n\nFor example, a pair where left is '?' and right is 'a' is counted in the third term. A pair where right is '?' and left is 'a' is counted in the fourth term.\n\nBut also, a pair where both are '?' is counted in the second term.\n\nSo, the total is specific_pairs + (left_question * right_question) + (left_question * (total_right - right_question)) + (right_question * (total_left - left_question)).\n\nBut this can't be right, because it's possible that some of these are overlapping.\n\nWait, no. Because in the specific_pairs, all possible specific pairs are already counted, so the remaining lefts and rights can only be used in the other pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs = specific_pairs + left_question * right_question + max(0, (left_question * (total_right - right_question)) - (right_question * (total_left - left_question))) )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is:\n\nmax_pairs = specific_pairs + min(left_question, right_question) + (left_question + right_question) - min(left_question, right_question).\n\nWhich simplifies to specific_pairs + (left_question + right_question).\n\nBut this would imply that all '?' can be paired, which is not true.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that after pairing the specific pairs, the remaining lefts and rights can be paired as follows:\n\nThe remaining lefts can be either '?' or some specific color. Similarly for the rights.\n\nSo, for the remaining lefts:\n\n- Let Lq be the number of '?'.\n\n- Let L_other be the number of non-?.\n\nSimilarly for rights:\n\n- Rq is the number of '?'.\n\n- R_other is the number of non-?.\n\nNow, the number of pairs is:\n\nmin(Lq, Rq) + min(Lq, R_other) + min(Rq, L_other).\n\nWait, no. Because:\n\n- min(Lq, Rq) is the number of pairs where both are '?'.\n\n- min(Lq, R_other) is the number of pairs where left is '?' and right is non-?.\n\n- min(Rq, L_other) is the number of pairs where right is '?' and left is non-?.\n\nBut wait, a left of non-? can't pair with a right of non-? unless they are same color, which is already accounted for in the specific_pairs.\n\nSo, the remaining lefts and rights can't form any more specific pairs, because we've already taken all possible specific pairs.\n\nThus, the additional pairs can only be formed between lefts and rights where at least one is '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum additional pairs is the minimum between:\n\n- The total remaining lefts and rights.\n\nBut again, this is incorrect because some lefts and rights may not be compatible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum additional pairs is the minimum of (Lq + Rq, L_rem + R_rem), where L_rem is the number of non-? lefts not in any specific pair, and R_rem is the number of non-? rights not in any specific pair.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I'm stuck and need to find a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Maybe the maximum number of pairs is the sum of the minimums for each color plus the number of '?' in lefts multiplied by the number of '?' in rights, minus the number of pairs where both are '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) plus the number of pairs where at least one is '?'.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nPerhaps the problem can be viewed as follows:\n\nEach left can be of type 'specific' or '?'. Same for right.\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is:\n\nsum over c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))\n\nplus the number of pairs where left is '?', right is any.\n\nplus the number of pairs where right is '?', left is any.\n\nminus the number of pairs where both are '?', because they've been counted twice.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nspecific_pairs = sum(min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))\n\nnon_specific_pairs = (left_question * right_total) + (right_question * left_total) - (left_question * right_question)\n\nBecause:\n\n- left_question can pair with any right, including '?', but the right_question is part of right_total.\n\n- Similarly, right_question can pair with any left.\n\nBut this counts the pairs where both are '?' twice.\n\nSo, subtracting left_question * right_question gives the correct count.\n\nSo, total_pairs = specific_pairs + (left_question * right_total) + (right_question * left_total) - (left_question * right_question)\n\nBut wait, this may not be correct because some of the left_question or right_question may have already been paired in the specific_pairs.\n\nAh, right! Because in specific_pairs, some '?' may have been paired with specific colors.\n\nSo, the approach needs to account for that.\n\nHmm. So, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nAfter specific_pairs, the remaining lefts and rights can form non-specific pairs.\n\nSo, the number of non-specific pairs is:\n\nmin( (left_remaining + right_remaining), ... )\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to try to find a way to compute the maximum matching without explicitly building the graph.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for each color c, plus the number of '?' in left multiplied by the number of '?' in right, but that can't be right.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum is:\n\nsum( min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for c in all colors )\n\nplus the number of pairs where left is '?' and right is not '?', plus the number of pairs where right is '?' and left is not '?', plus the number of pairs where both are '?'.\n\nBut again, this is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I need to give up and look for hints or patterns.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph and the maximum matching can be found by considering the counts of each color and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot has a color, which can be a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Two boots are compatible if they have the same color or if one of them is a question mark.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Count Specific Pairs**: For each specific color, count the minimum number of left and right boots that have that color. This gives the number of specific pairs that can be formed.\n\n2. **Handle Question Mark Pairs**: After counting specific pairs, consider the remaining left and right boots that are question marks. These can pair with any other boot (left or right) regardless of their color.\n\n3. **Calculate Additional Pairs**: The additional pairs consist of:\n   - Pairs where both are question marks.\n   - Pairs where a left boot is a question mark and the right boot is any remaining boot.\n   - Pairs where a right boot is a question mark and the left boot is any remaining boot.\n\n4. **Output the Results**: Sum the specific pairs and the additional pairs to get the total number of compatible pairs.
