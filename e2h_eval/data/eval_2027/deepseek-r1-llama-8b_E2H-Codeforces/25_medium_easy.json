При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining if a given string t could have resulted from an error in message transmission. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent one after another, and their concatenation causes a part of the first to overlap with the second due to a single character overlap. The length of this overlap must be a positive integer less than the length of the original message.\n\nFor example, if two messages 'abrakadabra' are sent, the result could be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' or 'abrakadabrakadabra', depending on where the overlap happened.\n\nOur task is to check for each input string t whether it could have been formed by such an error. If it's possible, we need to output \"YES\" followed by a possible original message s. Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key observation is that the string t must have a point where a suffix of the first part matches a prefix of the second part. But since the two messages were identical, after sending, the result is the concatenation with some overlapping.\n\nWait, actually, when two same messages are sent, the first is s, the second is s again. So when they are concatenated, it's s + s, but with an overlap of k characters, where k is at least 1 and less than len(s). So the resulting string would be s[0:k] + s[k:] + s[0:k] ?\n\nNo, wait, no. Wait, the way the error works is that during transmission, the two messages are sent one after another, but due to an error, they merge. So suppose we have message A and then message B. Both are the same as s. But during transmission, their end parts overlap, so the result is s concatenated with s, but with a possible overlap. So the resulting string t would be a combination where the end of the first s overlaps the start of the second s.\n\nSo, the length of the overlap can vary. For instance, if s is 'abcd', sending two 'abcd's could result in 'abcdabcd' (no overlap) or 'abxcd' (if the first 'abcd' ends with 'ab' and the next starts with 'cd'— but wait, no, that's not possible because the entire second message is the same as the first. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-read the description.\n\nThe problem says: \"two one and the same messages are sent, but due to an error, they are merged into one message.\" So the two messages are both s, and during transmission, they are somehow merged. The result is that the beginning of the second message is merged with the end of the first. So the merged string will consist of the first message s, and then a part of the second message s, where the overlapping part is a suffix of the first and a prefix of the second.\n\nBut since both messages are the same, the second message is also s. So the merged string would have a point where a suffix of the first s is followed by a prefix of the second s.\n\nSo, for example, if s is 'abc', then sending two 'abc's and merging them could result in:\n\n- 'abcabc' (no overlap)\n- 'abcc' (overlap of 1 character: the last 'c' of the first and the first 'a' of the second don't match, so maybe that's not correct. Wait, the problem says that the overlap can only happen if the same symbols are present. So the length of the overlap is the maximum possible where the suffix of the first s matches the prefix of the second s.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the length of the overlap must be a positive integer, less than the length of the text of the message.\"\n\nSo for the example where s is 'abc', the possible overlaps are k=1 or k=2, but since len(s)=3, k can be up to 2.\n\nSo, for k=1: the first s is 'abc', the second is 'abc'. After merging, the string would be 'ab' + 'c' + 'abc'? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the way the overlap works is that the first s has a suffix of length k, which is equal to a prefix of the second s. So the merged string is s[0 : len(s) -k] + s[k:]. Because the second s's prefix of k characters is merged into the first s's end.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as the merged string being s + s, but with the first s's last k characters and the second s's first k characters overlapping. So the total length is len(s) + len(s) -k = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nWait, no. Because when the two messages are merged, the second message's beginning overlaps with the first's end. So the merged string is the first message's entire string plus the second message's string, but with the first k characters of the second message merging into the first's end.\n\nSo, for example, if s is 'abcd' and k=2, then the merged string would be 'abcd' + 'cd' → 'abcdd'?\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, if the second message's first two characters ('ab') are merged into the first message's end. So the first message is 'abcd', the second is 'abcd'. So the merged string would be 'abcd' + 'cd' → 'abcdd'? That doesn't seem to fit the examples given.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the examples:\n\nIn the first sample input, 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' is a result. How does that form?\n\nWait, perhaps the merged string is the first message plus the second message, with the second's prefix overlapping the first's suffix.\n\nSo, for example, the first message is 'abrakadabra', the second is 'abrakadabra'. Suppose the overlap is 4 letters. So the first message's last 4 letters are 'dabra', and the second message's first 4 letters are 'abra'. Wait, but 'dabra' and 'abra' don't match. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the merged string is the first message plus the second message, but the second message's first k letters are merged into the first's last k letters. So the merged string is the first message's string followed by the second message's string, but without the first k letters of the second message.\n\nSo the merged string would be s + s[k:].\n\nWait, for example, if s is 'abcd' and k=2, the merged string would be 'abcd' + 'cd' → 'abcdd'.\n\nBut in the example given in the problem, when s is 'acacacaca', the merged string could be 'acacaca' as well. Wait, no, the note says that in the second example, the output is 'acaca' as a possible s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to find all possible k (from 1 to len(s)-1) and see if the string t can be written as s + s[k:], where the first len(s) -k characters of the second s are merged into the first s.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the merged string t is s + s', where s' is s starting from position k. So t must be equal to s concatenated with a suffix of s, starting from position k.\n\nBut how do we find s? Because t could be any possible s + s[k:]. So for t, we can try all possible splits into s and s', where s' is a suffix of s. Then, for each possible split, check if s' is a suffix of s, and then the combined string would be s concatenated with s' (without the overlapping part).\n\nWait, maybe the approach is: for the given t, we can look for all possible k (from 1 to len(t) -1), such that the first part of t (of length len(t)-k) is s, and the last k characters are the beginning of s.\n\nBecause when the two messages are merged, the resulting string is s concatenated with the second s, but with the first k characters of the second s overlapping with the last k of the first s. So t would be s + (s[k:]).\n\nWait, no. Because the second message is s, and the first message is s. When they are merged, the result is s concatenated with the second message's string, but the second message's string is s, but its first k characters are merged into the first s's last k.\n\nSo t = s + s[k:].\n\nBut wait, in the first example, 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' is the result. So perhaps s is 'abrakadabra', and k is 5.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. So s is 11 letters, k is 5.\n\nThen t would be s + s[5:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'drabra' → 'abrakadabrabrabra'? Hmm, but the sample input shows 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWhen two messages s are sent, and they are merged, the resulting string t is formed by taking the first message s, and then the second message s, but with the overlapping of k characters. So the resulting string is s concatenated with s, but the first k characters of the second s are replaced by the last k characters of the first s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as t being equal to s + s, but with the first k characters of the second s being merged into the first s's last k. So the total length of t would be len(s)*2 - k.\n\nSo for example, if s is 'abc', k=1: t would be 'ab' + 'c' + 'bc' → 'abcb c'? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps t is s followed by s, but the first k characters of the second s are overlapped with the last k of the first s.\n\nSo t would be the first s, then the second s, but the second s's first k characters are the same as the first s's last k.\n\nSo t would be s followed by s[k:].\n\nAh, yes, that makes sense. So the overall string t is s followed by s[k:], where k is the overlap length.\n\nSo, for example, if s is 'ab', k=1, then t is 'ab' + 'b' → 'abb'.\n\nSo our approach is to find if t can be written as s + s[k:], where k is between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\nBut s is a string such that t is exactly s followed by a substring of s starting at position k.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each possible split of t into two parts: the first part is s, and the second part is a suffix of s, starting at position k.\n\nWe need to find if there exists such a split.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. For the given t, iterate over all possible k values from 1 to len(t)-1.\n\n2. For each k, check if the first part (t[: len(t)-k]) is a prefix of t, and the second part (t[len(t)-k:]) is a suffix of the prefix.\n\nWait, no. Because the second part should be a suffix of s, which is the prefix of t. So for each possible k, check:\n\n- Let s_candidate = t[: len(t) -k]\n\n- Check if the second part (t[-k:]) equals the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nIf this condition is true, then s_candidate is a possible s, and t is the result of s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nWe can try different k values. Let's say k=5.\n\nThen s_candidate is t[: len(t)-5], which is 'abrakadabra' (since len(t) is 21, 21-5=16, but wait, that may not be the case).\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute len(t) correctly.\n\nWait, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which has length 21.\n\nSo for k=5, len(t) -k = 16. So s_candidate is t[:16], which is 'abrakadabrabr'. Then the second part is t[16:] → 'akadabra'. Now, check if the second part equals the first 5 characters of s_candidate.\n\nWait, s_candidate is 'abrakadabrabr' → first 5 characters are 'abrab'.\n\nThe second part is 'akadabra' → first 5 characters are 'akada' → which doesn't match 'abrab'. So that's not a valid split.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm not choosing the right k. Let's try k=11. Because s_candidate would be t[:10], which is 'abrakadabr'. Then the second part is t[10:] → 'akadabra'. Check if the first 11 characters of s_candidate match the second part. Wait, s_candidate is only 10 characters long, so this is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k=4. So s_candidate is t[:17], which is 'abrakadabrak' (17 letters). Second part is t[17:] → 'adabra'. The first 4 letters of s_candidate are 'abrab'. Does 'adabra' start with 'abrab'? No.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'\n\nOutput is 'YES' with s='abrakadabra'.\n\nSo s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). Then, the merged string t would be s + s[k:], where k is the overlap.\n\nIn this case, the t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is longer than 22 letters (since 11*2=22). So the overlap k must be 1, because 11+11-1=21. So t is 21 letters.\n\nSo t would be s followed by s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'rakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'? Wait, but that's 21 letters. Yes.\n\nSo the second part is s[1:], which is 'rakadabra'.\n\nSo when k=1, the second part is s[1:].\n\nThus, in this case, the split is t[:-1] is s, and t[-1:] is s[1:].\n\nWait, no. Because t is s + s[1:], which is 'abrakadabra' + 'rakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'? Wait, that's 11+10=21 letters. Yes.\n\nSo, for each possible k, we can split t into s_candidate and the rest.\n\nWait, but how to find s_candidate.\n\nAnother approach: For the given t, we can try all possible k (from 1 to len(t)-1), and for each k, check if the first part (t[: len(t)-k]) is s, and the last k characters of t are equal to the first k characters of s.\n\nSo for each k in 1..len(t)-1:\n\n   s_candidate = t[: len(t)-k]\n\n   if len(s_candidate) <k: continue\n\n   if t[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n       then, s_candidate is a possible s, and t is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\n       So, return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nLoop through all possible k from 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   s_candidate = t[0 : len(t) -k]\n\n   if len(s_candidate) >=k:\n\n      if t ends with s_candidate[:k], then YES.\n\nOnce such a k is found, output YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf no such k is found, output NO.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo, for each k, check if the last k characters of t match the first k of s_candidate.\n\nIf yes, then t is formed by s_candidate followed by s_candidate[k:].\n\nNow, what is the possible range of k?\n\nk can be from 1 to len(t) -1.\n\nBecause len(t) = len(s_candidate) + k.\n\nSo, len(s_candidate) must be >=k.\n\nSo, len(t) -k >=k → len(t) >=2k → k <= len(t)/2.\n\nBut since k can be up to len(t)-1, but for len(t)-k >=k → k <= len(t)/2.\n\nSo, we can loop k from 1 to min(len(t)//2, len(t)-1).\n\nWait, no. Because len(t) -k must be >=k, so k can be up to len(t)//2.\n\nSo, for example, if len(t) is 21, max k is 10.\n\nBecause 10 <= 21/2=10.5.\n\nSo, for k in 1 to 10.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 21)\n\nFor k=1:\n\ns_candidate is t[:20], which is 'abrakadabrabra'.\n\nCheck if last 1 character of t is equal to first 1 of s_candidate.\n\nt[-1:] is 'a'.\n\ns_candidate[0:1] is 'a' → matches. So yes.\n\nSo s_candidate is 'abrakadabrabra', and t is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:].\n\nSo the output would be YES and 'abrakadabrabra'.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the s is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the output is 'YES\\nabrakadabra'. So s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). So t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters.\n\nSo len(t) is 21, len(s) is 11.\n\nSo len(t) = len(s)*2 -1 → 11*2 -1=21.\n\nSo, t is s concatenated with s[1:].\n\nSo, for k=1, t is s + s[1:].\n\nSo, according to the approach, for k=1, s_candidate would be t[:20], which is 'abrakadabrabra' (20 letters). Then, the last 1 character of t is 'a' and s_candidate's first 1 is 'a', which matches.\n\nBut the actual s is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 letters. So why does the approach find a longer s?\n\nBecause the problem allows any possible s that satisfies the condition, not necessarily the minimal one.\n\nSo, for the first sample, the approach would find multiple possible k's, leading to different s_candidates.\n\nBut in the sample output, the correct s is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is correct, and the code will find that when k=1, the s_candidate is longer than the actual s.\n\nWait, no. Because for k=1, s_candidate is t[:20], which is 20 letters. Then, the last 1 letter of t is 'a', which is the same as the first letter of s_candidate.\n\nBut then, the t is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:].\n\nBut the actual s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), and the t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (21 letters), which is s + s[1:].\n\nSo, how does this fit into the approach?\n\nBecause for k=1, the code would consider s_candidate as 'abrakadabrabra' (20 letters), and then the second part is s_candidate[1:] → 'brakadabrabra'.\n\nSo the t would be 'abrakadabrabra' + 'brakadabrabra' → which is 20+19=39 letters, which is not the case.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to consider that the correct s is a substring of the s_candidate.\n\nNo, that's not correct because s is the original message before the error.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is missing something.\n\nWait, the approach is: for each possible k, check if the last k letters of t are equal to the first k letters of the first part (s_candidate = t[: len(t)-k]). Then, s_candidate is a possible s.\n\nSo, for the sample input, when k=1, s_candidate is t[:20], which is 'abrakadabrabra'. The last 1 letter of t is 'a', which matches the first letter of s_candidate. So, according to the approach, s_candidate is a possible s, and the code would output it.\n\nBut the sample expects 'abrakadabra' as the s, which is shorter.\n\nSo why is that? Because the approach finds a longer s, but the problem allows any possible s.\n\nWait, but the problem says that s is the original message before the error. So, when two messages s are sent, they are merged into t.\n\nSo, the approach is correct because it finds a possible s and k that satisfy t = s + s[k:].\n\nIn this case, the s_candidate found by the approach is 'abrakadabrabra' (20 letters), and when k=1, t is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:].\n\nBut in the sample, the s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), and t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (21 letters) → which is s + s[1:].\n\nSo, for k=1, the s_candidate is 'abrakadabrabra' (20 letters). Then s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabrabra', which is 19 letters. So the total length is 20+19=39, which is longer than 21.\n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the merged string is formed.\n\nLet me think again: when two messages s are sent, and they are merged, the resulting string t is s concatenated with s, but the first k characters of the second s are merged into the first s's last k.\n\nSo, t is s + s[k:].\n\nWait, no. Because the second message is s, but the first k characters of s are merged into the first s. So the merged string is s's entire string plus s's string from position k onwards.\n\nSo, the length of t is len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSo, for the sample input, t is 21 letters. So 2*len(s) -k =21.\n\nWe need to find s and k such that 2*len(s) -k =21.\n\nIn the sample, s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), and k=1 → 2*11 -1=21 → correct.\n\nSo, for each possible k, the possible s would have length (t_length +k)/2.\n\nBecause 2*len(s) = t_length +k → len(s) = (t_length +k)/2.\n\nBut len(s) must be an integer, so t_length +k must be even.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample:\n\nt_length is 21.\n\nFor k=1: len(s) = (21 +1)/2 = 11 → which is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach should first determine possible k values, where (t_length +k) is even, and len(s) = (t_length +k)/2.\n\nBut this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because it doesn't take into account that len(s) must be (t_length +k)/2, which implies that for a given t, certain k's are not possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor each possible k (1<=k<= len(t)-1):\n\n   Compute len(s) = (len(t) +k)/2.\n\n   If len(s) is not an integer, skip.\n\n   Else, check if s_candidate = t[: len(s)].\n\n   Then, check if the last k characters of s_candidate equal the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n   Also, ensure that k is <= len(s) -1.\n\nSo, for each k, we can compute len(s) as (len(t)+k)/2. If this is not an integer, skip.\n\nThen, s_candidate is t's first len(s) characters.\n\nThen, check if the last k characters of s_candidate are equal to the first k.\n\nIf yes, then s_candidate is a possible s.\n\nSo, for the sample input:\n\nlen(t) is 21.\n\nPossible k's:\n\nk=1 → len(s) = (21+1)/2=11 → integer.\n\ns_candidate is t[:11] → 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck if last 1 character of s_candidate is 'a' → yes.\n\nAnd s_candidate's first 1 is 'a' → yes.\n\nSo, this k=1, s_candidate is valid.\n\nSimilarly, other k's can be checked.\n\nSo, the approach should be modified to compute len(s) as (t_length +k)/2, and check if it's an integer. Then, extract s_candidate as the first len(s) characters, and check if the last k characters of s_candidate match the first k.\n\nThis makes more sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each k from 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   if (len(t) +k) is odd → skip.\n\n   len_s = (len(t) +k) // 2.\n\n   if len_s *2 != len(t) +k → skip (but since we have (len(t)+k) is even, this won't happen).\n\n   s_candidate = t[: len_s]\n\n   if len(s_candidate) != len_s → skip.\n\n   if len(s_candidate) <k → skip.\n\n   if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] → then YES, s_candidate is a possible s.\n\nSo, for each k, we compute len_s, and check if s_candidate's last k matches the first k.\n\nIf any such k exists, output YES and s_candidate.\n\nElse, output NO.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nTesting this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nt = 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len=21.\n\nCheck for k=1:\n\nlen_s = (21+1)/2=11.\n\ns_candidate = t[:11] → 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck if last 1 char of s_candidate is 'a' → yes.\n\ns_candidate[:1] is 'a' → yes.\n\nSo, this is a valid case.\n\nThus, output YES and 'abrakadabra'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample from the problem:\n\nSecond sample input: 'acacacaca' → len=9.\n\nPossible k's:\n\nk=3 → (9+3)=12 → len_s=6.\n\ns_candidate = t[:6] → 'acacaca'.\n\nCheck if last 3 chars are 'aca' and first 3 are 'aca' → yes.\n\nSo, this is valid.\n\nThus, output YES and 'acacaca'.\n\nThird sample input: 'abcabc' → len=6.\n\nCheck for possible k's.\n\nk=2 → (6+2)/2=4 → len_s=4.\n\ns_candidate = 'abcd'.\n\nCheck if last 2 chars 'cd' == first 2 'ab' → no.\n\nk=3 → (6+3)/2=4.5 → not integer.\n\nk=4 → (6+4)/2=5 → len_s=5.\n\ns_candidate is 'abcab'.\n\nCheck last 4 chars 'cab' → no, because len is 5, last 4 is 'abca' vs first 4 'abca'? Wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'abcab' → last 4 chars are 'babc'?\n\nWait, 'abcab' → indexes 0-4.\n\nlast 4 chars are [1,2,3,4] → 'bcab'.\n\nfirst 4 chars are [0,1,2,3] → 'abca'.\n\nNo match.\n\nOther k's may not yield valid.\n\nThus, output is NO.\n\nFourth sample input: 'abababab' → len=8.\n\nCheck for k=4:\n\n(8+4)/2=6 → len_s=6.\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab'.\n\nlast 4 chars: 'abab'.\n\nfirst 4 chars: 'abab' → match.\n\nThus, output YES and 'ababab'.\n\nFifth sample input: 'tatbt' → len=5.\n\nCheck for k=3 → (5+3)/2=4 → len_s=4.\n\ns_candidate is 'tatt'.\n\nCheck last 3 chars: 'att' vs first 3 'tat' → no.\n\nk=1: (5+1)/2=3 → len_s=3.\n\ns_candidate is 'tat'.\n\nCheck last 1 char 't' vs first 1 't' → yes.\n\nBut len(s_candidate) is 3, which is >=k=1.\n\nSo, s_candidate is 'tat'.\n\nThus, t is 'tatbt' which would be s_candidate + s_candidate[1:].\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'at', so 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat' which is 5 letters, but the given t is 'tatbt' → 5 letters. So, this doesn't match.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no: the t is 'tatbt' → len=5.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nlen_s= (5+1)/2=3.\n\ns_candidate is 'tat'.\n\nt is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat', which is 5 letters.\n\nBut the given t is 'tatbt', which is different.\n\nSo, this suggests that the approach is not sufficient.\n\nWait, because 'tat' + 'at' is 'tatat' which doesn't match 'tatbt'.\n\nThus, the approach would incorrectly accept this as a valid case.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output is 'NO' for this case.\n\nSo, what's wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating len_s.\n\nWait, for k=1, len_s=(5+1)/2=3.\n\ns_candidate is 'tat'.\n\nt is 'tatbt' → which is 'tatbt'.\n\nNow, according to the approach, t should be s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'tat' + 'at' = 'tatat' → which is 5 letters, but it's different from 'tatbt'.\n\nSo, the approach would think that it's a valid case, but it's not.\n\nThus, the approach is incorrect.\n\nWhat's wrong with the logic?\n\nAh! Because the approach assumes that t is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], but in reality, t is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:], but the s_candidate may be such that the last k of s_candidate is equal to the first k of s_candidate.\n\nBut in the fifth sample, for k=1, s_candidate is 'tat', which ends with 't' and starts with 't' → so the approach considers it a valid case.\n\nBut the actual t is 'tatbt', which is not equal to 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat'.\n\nSo, this indicates that the approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach needs to check not only that the last k of s_candidate equals the first k of s_candidate, but also that the entire t is s_candidate followed by s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut in the fifth sample, for k=1, s_candidate is 'tat', s_candidate[k:] is 'at', so the t would be 'tatat', but the given t is 'tatbt'.\n\nThus, this approach would wrongly consider it as a valid case, but the correct answer is 'NO'.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWhat's the issue here?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is correct, but in this particular case, the t is not formed by s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nWait, let's see: 'tatbt' → can it be written as s + s[k:] for any s and k.\n\nWait, 'tatbt' is 5 letters. So len(s) must be (5 +k)/2, which must be integer.\n\nPossible k's:\n\nk=1: len(s)=3.\n\nSo s_candidate is 'tat', s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] is 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat' → which is not 'tatbt'.\n\nk=3: (5+3)/2=4 → len(s)=4.\n\ns_candidate is 'tatb'.\n\nCheck if s_candidate ends with 't' (k=3, last 3 letters 'atb').\n\nWait, no: last 3 letters of 'tatb' are 'atb' and first 3 letters are 'tat' → not equal.\n\nk=2: (5+2)/2=3.5 → not integer.\n\nk=4: (5+4)/2=4.5 → not integer.\n\nThus, for k=1, the approach incorrectly considers s_candidate as a possible s, but the resulting t is 'tatat', which doesn't match.\n\nThus, the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach needs to be modified.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, t is formed by s concatenated with s[k:], where s is the original message, and k is the overlap.\n\nThus, for the fifth sample, 'tatbt' cannot be formed by any s and k, hence the output is 'NO'.\n\nBut according to the approach, it would find s_candidate 'tat' and k=1, leading to t='tatat', which is a different string than 'tatbt'.\n\nThus, the approach is wrong.\n\nWhat's the issue?\n\nAh, I see. The approach is considering t as s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], but in reality, the correct t must be equal to s + s[k:], where s is the original message.\n\nThus, for the fifth sample, the approach is checking for a possible s_candidate, but the t is not equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nThus, the approach is incorrect because it's not verifying that the entire t is equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], but only that the last k letters match.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each possible k:\n\n   len_s = (len(t) +k)/2.\n\n   if not integer → skip.\n\n   s_candidate = t[: len_s].\n\n   if s_candidate's last k letters == s_candidate's first k letters → and len(t) == len(s_candidate) + (len(s_candidate) -k) → which is 2*len(s_candidate) -k.\n\n   And, s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] must equal t.\n\nOnly then, it's a valid case.\n\nBut wait, len(t) = 2*len_s -k → which is 2*(len(t)+k)/2 -k → len(t) +k -k = len(t) → yes.\n\nSo, for the fifth sample:\n\ns_candidate is 'tat' (len=3), k=1.\n\ns_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'tat' + 'at' = 'tatat' → which is 5 letters, but the given t is 'tatbt'.\n\nThus, the approach would incorrectly consider it a valid case.\n\nSo, the approach must also check that the entire t is equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause t is the entire string, and s_candidate is the first len_s letters, then s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] must be equal to t.\n\nThus, the approach should:\n\nFor each k in 1.. len(t)-1:\n\n   if (len(t)+k) is even → compute len_s.\n\n   s_candidate = t[: len_s].\n\n   if s_candidate's last k letters == s_candidate's first k letters:\n\n       then, check if t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\n       if yes → return YES and s_candidate.\n\nThus, adding this step would fix the problem.\n\nSo, in the fifth sample:\n\nFor k=1, len_s=3, s_candidate='tat'.\n\ns_candidate + s_candidate[1:] is 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat' → which is not equal to 'tatbt'.\n\nThus, this case is skipped.\n\nThus, the approach now correctly handles the fifth sample.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each k in 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   if (len(t) +k) is odd → skip.\n\n   len_s = (len(t) +k) // 2.\n\n   s_candidate = t[: len_s].\n\n   if s_candidate's last k letters == s_candidate's first k letters:\n\n       if t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]:\n\n           return YES and s_candidate.\n\nThus, this should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the fifth sample.\n\nSample 5: t='tatbt' → len=5.\n\nk can be 1 and 3.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nlen_s=(5+1)/2=3.\n\ns_candidate = 'tat'.\n\nCheck last 1 char of s_candidate is 't' → matches first 1.\n\nCheck if t == 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat' → which is not 'tatbt' → no.\n\nThus, proceed.\n\nk=3:\n\nlen_s=(5+3)/2=4.\n\ns_candidate = t[:4] → 'tatb'.\n\nCheck last 3 chars of s_candidate: 'atb' → compare to first 3: 'tat' → no.\n\nThus, no valid k.\n\nThus, output is 'NO' → correct.\n\nAnother test case: the fourth sample.\n\nt='abababab' → len=8.\n\nFor k=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have resulted from an error in message transmission. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent one after another, and their concatenation causes a part of the first to overlap with the second due to a single character overlap. The length of this overlap must be a positive integer less than the length of the original message.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Possible Overlaps**: For each possible overlap length `k` from 1 to `len(t) - 1`, check if `t` can be split into two parts such that the first part is the original message `s` and the second part is a suffix of `s` starting from position `k`.\n\n2. **Check Validity of Split**: For each `k`, compute the potential length of the original message `s` as `(len(t) + k) // 2`. Extract the candidate message `s_candidate` as the first `len(s)` characters of `t`.\n\n3. **Overlap Check**: Verify if the last `k` characters of `s_candidate` match the first `k` characters of `s_candidate`.\n\n4. **Full String Match**: Ensure that the entire string `t` matches the concatenation of `s_candidate` and `s_candidate[k:]`.\n\nIf all conditions are met for any `k`, then `t` is the result of an error, and we output the valid `s_candidate`. If no valid `k` is found, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\nif n < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nfound = False\nfor k in range(1, n):\n    if (n + k) % 2 != 0:\n        continue\n    len_s = (n + k) // 2\n    if len_s * 2 != n + k:\n        continue\n    s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n    if len(s_candidate) < k:\n        continue\n    if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n        if t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n\nif not found:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Iterate Over Possible Overlaps**: The loop iterates over all possible values of `k` to determine potential overlaps.\n- **Check for Valid Message Length**: For each `k`, the length of the original message `s` is calculated. If this length is not valid, the current `k` is skipped.\n- **Extract Candidate Message**: The candidate message `s_candidate` is extracted based on the computed length of `s`.\n- **Overlap Verification**: The code checks if the end of `s_candidate` overlaps correctly with the start of `s_candidate`.\n- **Full String Validation**: Finally, it ensures that the entire string `t` matches the expected concatenation of `s_candidate` and its suffix.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine if `t` is a result of an error in message transmission, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases.",
