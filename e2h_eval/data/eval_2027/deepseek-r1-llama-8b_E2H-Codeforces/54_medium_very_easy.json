Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any will do.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the possible angles are that can be formed by selecting three vertices in a regular polygon. Since the polygon is regular, all sides and angles are equal, which might help in calculating the possible angles.\n\nWait, the angle in question is formed by two points on the sides of a vertex. So for each vertex v2, I can look at the possible pairs of points (v1, v3) such that they lie on the sides connected to v2. But wait, actually, v1 and v3 are on the two sides extending from v2. So for a given v2, the angle is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 on those sides.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So, for example, in a triangle (n=3), each central angle is 120 degrees.\n\nNow, when considering a vertex v2, the adjacent vertices are the next and previous ones. So for each v2, the possible angles are based on how many steps away v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nWait, no. Because the angle formed depends on the arc lengths from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 along the circumference. Or maybe it's better to model this using the central angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon. For example, if v2 is fixed, then choosing v1 k steps before and v3 m steps after, or vice versa, would form certain angles.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the angle in terms of the arcs that v1 and v3 make with v2. Let's say that for a given v2, the two other points v1 and v3 lie on the two sides coming out of v2. So, v1 is on one side, and v3 is on the other. The angle at v2 is then determined by the positions of v1 and v3.\n\nBut in a regular polygon, the internal angle is known. For a regular n-gon, the internal angle is (n-2)*180 /n degrees. So for each vertex, the internal angle is fixed. But that's the angle of the polygon itself; we're looking for an angle formed by three vertices, not the polygon's internal angle.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that v1 and v3 are on the sides of v2. So the angle is the angle between the two lines connecting v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So the angle is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nSo let's model this. Suppose we fix v2 as some vertex. Then, the two other vertices must be on the two sides of v2. So for each possible pair of vertices v1 and v3 that lie on different sides of v2, we can compute the angle at v2.\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, each vertex has exactly two adjacent vertices. So for each v2, the possible v1 and v3 can be any of the other vertices, but arranged such that v1 is on one side and v3 on the other.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the polygon. For example, if from v2, moving clockwise, v1 is k steps ahead, and v3 is m steps behind, then the angle can be calculated based on the arcs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is determined by the step difference between v1 and v3 around the polygon.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to think in terms of the central angles. Let me denote the center of the polygon as O. For any two points on the circle, the angle between their position vectors (as viewed from O) is the central angle between them.\n\nFor three points v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but only if v2 is not on the same line as the bisector of the arc. Hmm, maybe that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in a circle, the inscribed angle subtended by an arc is half the measure of the central angle for that arc. So for the angle at v2, the measure is half of the central angle between v1 and v3, provided that v2 is on the circumference.\n\nWait, but in this case, v1 and v3 are on the polygon's perimeter, but so is v2. So the angle at v2 is the inscribed angle between the points v1 and v3, which would be half the measure of the arc between them.\n\nWait, but that's only if the arc does not pass through v2. Because if v2 is on the opposite side of the arc, the angle would be half the central angle. Otherwise, it's half the supplementary angle.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the key is that for a fixed v2, the angle at v2 can be determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon, but adjusted based on their positions relative to v2.\n\nLet me try to find a way to model the possible angles for a given v2.\n\nSuppose we have a regular polygon with n vertices. For a fixed vertex v2, the adjacent vertices are v2-1 and v2+1 (assuming 1-based numbering). Then, the other vertices are either on the left or right side of v2.\n\nSo for v2, the possible v1 and v3 can be any pair where v1 is on one side (like, the clockwise side) and v3 is on the other side.\n\nWait, no. Because v1 and v3 could be any two vertices not equal to v2, but arranged such that one is on one side and the other on the opposite side.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle can be calculated as follows: for a given v2, the positions of v1 and v3 determine the angle. Let's say that from v2, moving clockwise, the next vertex is v2+1, and the previous is v2-1.\n\nThen, the number of steps between v2 and v1 is k, and between v2 and v3 is m. Depending on whether k and m are on the same side or not, the angle varies.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle can be determined by the sum of the steps between v1 and v3 in such a way that the total steps between them is s = |k - m|? Or perhaps it's more about the minimal arc between v1 and v3, which would affect the inscribed angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a fixed v2, the angle at v2 can vary depending on how far apart v1 and v3 are. So for each possible pair (v1, v3) where v1 is on one side of v2 and v3 is on the other, the angle can be computed.\n\nSo the approach might be:\n\n1. For each possible v2 (from 1 to n):\n   a. Iterate over all possible pairs (v1, v3) where v1 and v3 are on different sides of v2.\n   b. For each pair, calculate the angle at v2.\n   c. Keep track of the closest angle to 'a' and the corresponding triplet (v1, v2, v3).\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, so for each v2, the number of possible v1 and v3 is O(n^2), which for n=105 is manageable since 105^3 is about a million, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way to find the best possible angles without checking every possible pair.\n\nWait, another thought: for a fixed v2, the angle at v2 is maximized when v1 is the adjacent vertex on one side and v3 is the adjacent on the other. Because the further apart v1 and v3 are, the larger the angle.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a regular polygon, the maximum possible angle at v2 would be the internal angle of the polygon. For example, in a square, the internal angle is 90 degrees. So the maximum angle we can get at any v2 is that internal angle.\n\nSo the possible angles at v2 range from some minimum to the internal angle.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the possible angles can be found by varying the number of steps between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle can be computed as follows: For a given v2, the positions of v1 and v3 can be described by the number of steps from v2 to v1 and v3. Let's say that from v2, moving clockwise, the first vertex is v2+1, and the last is v2-1 (with wrapping around as needed for 1-based indexing).\n\nSo for v1, it can be any vertex on one side of v2, and v3 any on the other.\n\nWait, but in terms of steps, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is 180 - (steps_between_v1_and_v3 * (360/n)) * 0.5.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the central angle between v1 and v3. The inscribed angle at v2 would be half of that, but only if v2 is on the opposite side of the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but if that arc is more than 180 degrees, the angle is half of (360 minus that arc).\n\nWait, no. Because the inscribed angle is always half the measure of the arc it subtends. So if the arc between v1 and v3 is θ, then the angle at v2 is θ/2, but only if v2 lies on the minor arc between v1 and v3. Otherwise, the angle is (360-θ)/2.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nIn a circle, the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. So if points A and B are on the circle, and point P is another point on the circle, the angle APB is equal to half the measure of the arc AB that doesn't contain P.\n\nWait, no. It's the angle subtended by the arc AB at point P. So if P is on the opposite side of the circle from the arc AB, then the angle is half the measure of arc AB. If P is on the same side, then the angle is half the measure of the major arc AB.\n\nWait, no, I think it's the opposite. The inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc, regardless of which side P is on.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of an example. Suppose I have a circle with points A, B, C, D in order. The central angle between A and C is 120 degrees. If I take point B, the inscribed angle for triangle ABC would be 60 degrees, which is half of 120. Similarly, if point D is considered, the angle for triangle ACD would also be 60 degrees.\n\nWait, but in this case, both B and D are on opposite sides of the arc AC. So the inscribed angle remains the same.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the inscribed angle depends only on the arc between A and C, not on where P is located. So for any point P on the circumference, the inscribed angle APB is half the measure of the arc AB that doesn't contain P.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if P is on the same side as the arc AB, then the angle APB is half of the major arc. Because the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc that it intercepts. So if the arc AB is small, and P is on the opposite side, then the angle is half of that small arc. But if P is on the same side, the angle is half of the major arc (which is 360 - small arc).\n\nSo, for our problem, when we have points v1 and v3, and v2 is fixed, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nWait, but in the regular polygon, all points are on the circumference of a circle. So yes, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the arc between any two vertices is a multiple of (360/n) degrees.\n\nSo, to find the angle at v2 for a given v1 and v3, we can compute the number of edges between v1 and v3, which is d steps. The arc between them is d*(360/n) degrees. But if v2 is on the same side of that arc, then the angle is (d*(360/n))/2. Otherwise, it's ( (n - d) * (360/n )) / 2.\n\nWait, no. Because the arc between v1 and v3 is the minimal path. So the minimal arc is min(d, n-d) steps, each step being 360/n degrees. So the minimal arc length is s = min(d, n-d) * (360/n) degrees.\n\nWait, but when considering the angle at v2, the arc that is not containing v2 is the one that determines the angle. So, for example, if v1 and v3 are such that the arc between them is s, and v2 is on the opposite side of that arc, then the angle at v2 is s/2.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose n=4, a square. The points are 1,2,3,4 in order. Let's take v2=2.\n\nCase 1: v1=4, v3=1. The arc between 4 and 1 is 180 degrees (since they are diametrically opposite in a square). So the angle at v2=2 is 90 degrees, which is half of 180.\n\nCase 2: v1=1, v3=3. The arc between 1 and 3 is 90 degrees. So the angle at v2=2 is 45 degrees, which is half of 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct because in a square, the angle formed by points 2,1,3 is 45 degrees.\n\nSo, the angle is indeed half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does NOT contain v2.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each possible triplet (v1, v2, v3):\n\n- Compute the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n- The angle is half of that arc.\n\nWe need to find the triplet where this angle is as close as possible to 'a'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each vertex v2 in 1..n:\n   a. For all possible pairs (v1, v3) where v1 != v2, v3 != v2, and v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2.\n      i. Compute the arc length between v1 and v3 that does not include v2.\n      ii. Calculate the angle as half of that arc length.\n      iii. Check if this angle is closer to 'a' than the current best.\n\nBut wait, considering all possible v1 and v3 for each v2 might be computationally expensive. However, n is up to 105, so for each v2, there are (n-1)*(n-1) possible pairs, but since v1 and v3 can't be the same as v2, it's (n-1)^2 per v2. So for n=105, each v2 has 104*104=10816 possibilities, and with 105 v2's, that's about 1e6 operations. Which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize by considering that for each v2, the minimal distance between v1 and v3 is determined by the number of steps between them. So for each possible step count between v1 and v3 (from 1 to (n-1)/2), we can compute the angle and see if it's a candidate.\n\nWait, but the step count is the minimal path between v1 and v3. So for each v2, the step count between v1 and v3 can vary, and the angle is determined by that step count.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For a given v2, the angle is determined by the step count between v1 and v3. The minimal arc between v1 and v3 is s steps, so the angle is s * (180 /n) degrees.\n\nWait, no. Because the arc between v1 and v3 is s*(360/n) degrees, so the angle is half of that, which is s*(180/n) degrees.\n\nWait, no. Because the angle is half the arc that does not contain v2. So, if the minimal arc between v1 and v3 is s steps, and v2 is on the opposite side, then the angle is (s * (360/n)) / 2 = s * (180/n) degrees.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because the minimal arc is s steps, but the actual arc used in the angle calculation is the one that does not include v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is (arc_length / 2), where arc_length is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nSo, to find the arc_length, we can compute the minimal arc between v1 and v3, which is min(s, n-s) steps, where s is the absolute difference in their positions relative to v2.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's consider a specific example.\n\nTake n=5 (pentagon). The points are 1,2,3,4,5 arranged clockwise.\n\nSuppose v2 is 3. Let's pick v1=1 and v3=5.\n\nThe minimal arc between 1 and 5 is 2 steps (1->2->3->4->5, but wait, 1 and 5 are two steps apart in the pentagon). So the arc_length is 2*(360/5) = 144 degrees. The angle at v2=3 would be 72 degrees (half of 144). \n\nBut wait, v2 is 3, and the arc between 1 and 5 that does not contain 3 is the one that goes from 1 to 5 via 2. So the arc is 144 degrees. So yes, the angle is 72 degrees.\n\nAnother example: v2=3, v1=2, v3=4. The minimal arc between 2 and 4 is 2 steps (2->3->4). So the arc that does not contain v2 is 2 steps, which is 144 degrees. So the angle is 72 degrees.\n\nWait, but the minimal arc between 2 and 4 is 2 steps, but the other arc is 3 steps (4->5->1->2). So the minimal arc is 2 steps, so the angle is 144/2=72 degrees.\n\nSo, for a given v2, the angle is determined by the minimal arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. But since the polygon is regular, the minimal arc is just the minimal number of steps between v1 and v3, which is min(k, n-k), where k is the step difference between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, but perhaps the step difference is computed as (v3 - v1) mod n. But that's not quite right because direction matters.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair (v1, v3), the step difference is (v3 - v1) mod n. But since the polygon is circular, the minimal step difference is the minimal of the clockwise and counter-clockwise paths.\n\nSo, for a given v2, the angle can be determined by the step difference between v1 and v3, but considering whether v2 is on the same side as the minimal arc or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is determined by the step difference between v1 and v3 as measured along the arc that does not include v2.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor each v2 in 1..n:\n   For each possible step count d from 1 to floor((n-1)/2):\n       For each possible pair (v1, v3) such that the minimal step difference between v1 and v3 is d:\n           if v2 is on the opposite side of the minimal arc between v1 and v3:\n               angle = d * (360/(2n)) = d * (180/n) degrees\n           else:\n               angle = (n -d) * (180/n) degrees\n           compare this angle to 'a', and keep track of the closest one.\n\nWait, but for a given d, the angle could be either d*(180/n) or (n-d)*(180/n), depending on whether v2 is on the same side as the minimal arc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think about how to compute the angle for a given v2, v1, v3.\n\nCompute the minimal step difference between v1 and v3, which is d steps.\n\nIf the minimal arc is d steps, then the angle at v2 is (d * 360/n)/2 degrees, provided that v2 is not on that arc.\n\nWait, no. Because if v2 is on the same side as the minimal arc, then the angle would be half of the major arc, which is (n -d) steps, leading to angle (n-d)*180/n degrees.\n\nSo, the angle is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nThus, for a given v1 and v3, the angle is (s * 360/n ) / 2, where s is the measure of the arc that does not contain v2.\n\nBut s can be either the minimal arc (d steps) or the maximal arc (n-d steps), depending on where v2 is.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is (min_steps * 360/n ) / 2.\n\nNo, because if v2 is on the same side as the minimal arc, then the angle would be based on the maximal arc.\n\nSo, for a given v2, and a pair (v1, v3), the angle is:\n\narc_length = minimal_arc(v1, v3) if v2 is not on the minimal arc else maximal_arc(v1, v3)\nangle = arc_length / 2\n\nWait, no. Because the minimal arc is the shorter path between v1 and v3, which is s steps. The maximal arc is n-s steps. The angle is half the measure of the arc that does not contain v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that is not containing v2.\n\nSo, for example, if the minimal arc between v1 and v3 is s steps, then the maximal arc is n-s steps.\n\nIf v2 is on the minimal arc, then the angle is (maximal_arc) / 2 = (n-s)*180/n degrees.\n\nIf v2 is not on the minimal arc, then the angle is (s * 180/n) degrees.\n\nWait, but how do I determine whether v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3?\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal arc is the one that's less than or equal to n/2 steps. So for v2 to be on that minimal arc, it must lie between v1 and v3 in the minimal path.\n\nSo, for a given v2, and a pair (v1, v3) with minimal step difference s, v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3 if and only if v2 is in the interval [v1, v3] when moving along the minimal path.\n\nWait, but in a circular arrangement, the minimal path is the one that's shorter. So for a given v1 and v3, the minimal path is the one with s steps, and the maximal path is n-s steps.\n\nSo, for a given v2, whether it's on the minimal arc between v1 and v3 depends on whether it's between them in the minimal path.\n\nWait, perhaps to determine if v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3, we can check if the clockwise distance from v1 to v2 is less than or equal to s/2, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each v1 and v3, the minimal arc is s steps, and the maximal arc is n-s steps. The angle at v2 is (arc) / 2, where arc is the measure of the arc that does not contain v2.\n\nSo, for each pair (v1, v3), the angle is:\n\nif v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3:\n    angle = (n - s) * 180 / n\nelse:\n    angle = s * 180 / n\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if v2 is on the minimal arc, then the arc not containing v2 is the maximal arc, which is (n-s) steps. So angle is (n-s)*180/n. Else, it's s*180/n.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nLoop over each possible v2 (from 1 to n):\n    Loop over all possible d from 1 to (n-1)/2:\n        For each possible pair (v1, v3) that are d steps apart in the minimal path:\n            Check if v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3.\n            If yes: angle = (n - d)*180/n\n            Else: angle = d*180/n\n            Compare this angle to 'a' and track the closest one.\n\nBut even this may require checking all possible pairs for each v2, which for n=105 is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For a given v2, the possible angles are determined by the possible step differences d between v1 and v3.\n\nFor each d from 1 to (n-1)//2, the angle can be either d*(180/n) or (n-d)*(180/n), depending on whether v2 is on the minimal arc or not.\n\nWait, but for each v2, how can I find for which d the angle is closest to 'a'?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible v2, I can generate all possible d and compute the angle, and see which is closest to 'a'.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the minimal possible angle is 180/(n) degrees, and the maximal is the internal angle of the polygon, which is (n-2)*180 /n degrees.\n\nSo, for each v2, the possible angles form a set of values, each determined by d steps between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, but perhaps for a given v2, the possible angles are d*(180/n) and (n-d)*(180/n), for d from 1 to (n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for each v2, and for each d, the angle can be either d*(180/n) or (n-d)*(180/n), depending on whether v2 is on the minimal arc.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because for a given d, there are multiple pairs (v1, v3) that have a minimal step difference of d. For each such pair, the angle can be either of the two possibilities, depending on whether v2 is on the minimal arc.\n\nSo, perhaps for each v2, the angle can vary between certain values, and for each possible d, the angle is either d*(180/n) or (n-d)*(180/n).\n\nHmm. So the approach is:\n\nFor each v2 from 1 to n:\n   For each d from 1 to (n-1)//2:\n       The minimal arc between v1 and v3 is d steps.\n       Now, for any pair (v1, v3) with d steps apart, the angle at v2 is either d*(180/n) or (n-d)*(180/n), depending on whether v2 is on the minimal arc.\n       So, for each d, compute both possible angles and see if they are candidates for being close to 'a'.\n\nWait, but how to determine if v2 is on the minimal arc for a given d.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given v2, and a given d, the condition that v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3 can be expressed as follows:\n\nThe minimal arc between v1 and v3 is d steps. So, the distance between v1 and v3 is d steps in the minimal path.\n\nSo, for v2 to be on the minimal arc between v1 and v3, the distance between v1 and v2 plus the distance between v2 and v3 must be less than or equal to d steps.\n\nWait, no. Because in the minimal path, the total distance is d steps. So if v2 is on the minimal path between v1 and v3, then the sum of the steps from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3 is equal to d steps.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, in a square (n=4), v1=1, v3=3, d=2 steps. v2=2 is on the minimal path, so the sum of steps from 1 to 2 (1 step) and 2 to 3 (1 step) is 2 steps, which equals d.\n\nAnother example: n=5, v1=1, v3=3, d=2 steps. The minimal path is 1->2->3. So v2=2 is on the minimal path. Sum is 2 steps.\n\nSo, the condition is: (v2 is on the minimal path between v1 and v3) if and only if the sum of the steps from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3 equals d.\n\nBut how to compute this for a given v2, v1, and v3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given v2, and a given d, the minimal arc between v1 and v3 is d steps. So, the minimal path between v1 and v3 is of length d steps.\n\nSo, for v2 to be on that minimal path, it must lie between v1 and v3 along that path.\n\nThus, for a given v2, and a given d, the condition is that v2 is on the minimal path between some v1 and v3 that are d steps apart.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to translate that into code.\n\nPerhaps an alternative approach is to precompute for each v2, all possible d (from 1 to (n-1)//2), and for each d, determine whether it's possible for v2 to be on the minimal arc for that d.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each v2, the possible d's that can have v2 on their minimal arc are those where d is such that v2 can lie between some v1 and v3 that are d steps apart.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given v2, the possible d's that can have v2 on their minimal arc are those where d >=1 and <= (n-1)/2, and such that v2 is on the minimal path between some v1 and v3 that are d steps apart.\n\nWait, this is getting too vague. Perhaps the way forward is to loop through all possible v2, and for each, loop through all possible pairs (v1, v3) where v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2, and compute the angle.\n\nBut for n=105, this is manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize the best angle as infinity, and the best triplet as empty.\n\nFor each v2 in 1 to n:\n   For each v1 in 1 to n, where v1 != v2:\n       For each v3 in 1 to n, where v3 != v2 and v3 != v1:\n           compute the minimal step difference between v1 and v3:\n               d = min( (v3 - v1) % n, (v1 - v3) % n )\n               minimal_arc = d steps.\n               if v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3:\n                   angle = (n - d) * 180 / n\n               else:\n                   angle = d * 180 / n\n               compute the absolute difference between angle and a:\n                   diff = abs(angle - a)\n               if diff < current_best_diff:\n                   update best_diff and store the triplet (v1, v2, v3)\n               elif diff == current_best_diff:\n                   if the triplet is lex smaller, update (but the problem allows any, so perhaps not necessary)\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the triplet must consist of three distinct vertices. So in the loops, v1 and v3 cannot be equal to each other or to v2.\n\nBut in the current setup, v1 and v3 are allowed to be any except v2 and each other.\n\nWait, but in the case where v1 and v3 are the same, that's invalid. So the code must ensure that v1 != v3.\n\nWait, but the code above skips v1 = v3? No, in the current setup, v3 can be any except v2 and v1. So v1 and v3 can be same? No, because v3 can't be equal to v1.\n\nWait, no, because in the loop, v3 is in 1..n, v3 != v2 and v3 != v1. So v1 and v3 are always different.\n\nSo, the code correctly ensures that v1, v2, v3 are distinct.\n\nSo, the plan is feasible.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nBut wait, for n=105, the triple loops would result in 105 * 104 * 104 = about 1.1 million iterations. Each iteration involves computing d and checking if v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, the key part is, for a given v1, v3, and v2, determine whether v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWell, the minimal arc between v1 and v3 is d steps, which is min( (v3 - v1) % n, (v1 - v3) % n )\n\nWait, no, because (v3 - v1) could be negative, but mod n ensures it's positive. So d is the minimal steps between v1 and v3.\n\nOnce d is known, the minimal arc is d steps.\n\nNow, for v2 to be on the minimal arc between v1 and v3, the following must hold:\n\nEither:\n\nv2 is between v1 and v3 when moving clockwise, and the minimal path is d steps.\n\nOR:\n\nv2 is between v1 and v3 when moving counter-clockwise, and the minimal path is d steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition can be expressed as:\n\n(v2 is in the clockwise segment from v1 to v3 of length d steps) OR (v2 is in the counter-clockwise segment from v1 to v3 of length d steps).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, for a given v1 and v3, and minimal step difference d, v2 is on the minimal arc if and only if the clockwise distance from v1 to v2 plus the clockwise distance from v2 to v3 is equal to d, or the sum of the counter-clockwise distances is equal to d.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nIn a circular arrangement, the clockwise distance from v1 to v3 is d steps, which is the minimal path.\n\nSo, for v2 to be on this path, the sum of the clockwise distance from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3 must be equal to d.\n\nSimilarly, the counter-clockwise distance from v1 to v2 plus the counter-clockwise distance from v2 to v3 must be equal to d.\n\nWait, but since d is the minimal step difference, the minimal path is either the clockwise or counter-clockwise, whichever is shorter. So, if the minimal path is d steps, then the other path is (n-d) steps.\n\nSo, to check if v2 is on the minimal arc between v1 and v3, we can compute:\n\nclockwise_distance(v1, v2) + clockwise_distance(v2, v3) == d OR counter_clockwise_distance(v1, v2) + counter_clockwise_distance(v2, v3) == d.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's take an example.\n\nn=5, v1=1, v3=3. Minimal step difference is 2.\n\nCase 1: v2=2.\n\nClockwise distance from 1 to 2 is 1, from 2 to 3 is 1. Sum is 2, which equals d. So v2 is on the minimal arc.\n\nCase 2: v2=4.\n\nClockwise distance from 1 to 4 is 3 steps (1->2->3->4), and from 4 to 3 is 4 steps (since in a circle, 4 to 3 is one step counter-clockwise). So sum is 3+1=4 steps, which is more than d=2. So v2 is not on the minimal arc.\n\nAnother way: the minimal path between 1 and 3 is 2 steps. The other path is 3 steps.\n\nSo, for v2=4, the clockwise distance from 1 to 4 is 3 steps, which is longer than d=2. So, the sum in the clockwise direction is 3 + 1 =4 steps, which is not equal to d=2. So v2 is not on the minimal arc.\n\nThus, the condition holds.\n\nSo, the condition for v2 being on the minimal arc is:\n\nclockwise_dist(v1, v2) + clockwise_dist(v2, v3) == d OR counter_clockwise_dist(v1, v2)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The goal is to determine the optimal triplet of vertices that minimizes the absolute difference between the computed angle and 'a'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular polygon, each vertex lies on a circle. The angle at a vertex can be determined by the arcs between the other two vertices. The inscribed angle theorem tells us that an angle formed by two points on a circle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\n2. **Iterate Over All Vertices**: For each vertex `v2`, consider it as the vertex where the angle will be formed. Then, iterate over all possible pairs of other vertices `(v1, v3)` to compute the angle at `v2`.\n\n3. **Compute Minimal Arc**: For each pair `(v1, v3)`, compute the minimal arc length (in steps) between them. This arc length determines the potential angles that can be formed at `v2`.\n\n4. **Determine Angle**: Depending on whether `v2` lies on the minimal arc between `v1` and `v3`, the angle at `v2` will be either half of the minimal arc or half of the complementary arc.\n\n5. **Track Closest Angle**: Keep track of the closest angle to 'a' and the corresponding triplet `(v1, v2, v3)`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_tri = None\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for v1 in range(1, n+1):\n        if v1 == v2:\n            continue\n        for v3 in range(1, n+1):\n            if v3 == v2 or v3 == v1:\n                continue\n            \n            # Compute minimal step difference between v1 and v3\n            d_clockwise = (v3 - v1) % n\n            d_counter = (v1 - v3) % n\n            d = min(d_clockwise, d_counter)\n            \n            # Determine if v2 is on the minimal arc\n            cw_dist_v1_v2 = (v2 - v1) % n\n            cw_dist_v2_v3 = (v3 - v2) % n\n            on_minimal_arc = (cw_dist_v1_v2 + cw_dist_v2_v3) == d\n            \n            if on_minimal_arc:\n                angle = (n - d) * 180 // n  # since integer division\n            else:\n                angle = d * 180 // n\n            \n            current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n            if current_diff < best_diff:\n                best_diff = current_diff\n                best_tri = (v1, v2, v3)\n            elif current_diff == best_diff:\n                # Choose the lex smallest triplet\n                if (v1, v2, v3) < best_tri:\n                    best_tri = (v1, v2, v3)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, best_tri)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Read the input values for `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n- **Loop Through Vertices**: For each vertex `v2`, consider it as the vertex where the angle will be formed.\n- **Check Pairs**: For each pair of other vertices `(v1, v3)`, compute the minimal arc length between them.\n- **Determine Angle**: Based on whether `v2` lies on the minimal arc, compute the angle at `v2`.\n- **Track Best Solution**: Keep track of the closest angle to `a` and update the best triplet of vertices accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible configurations and find the optimal solution by leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and the inscribed angle theorem.",
