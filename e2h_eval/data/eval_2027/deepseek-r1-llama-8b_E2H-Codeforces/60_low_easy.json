Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain substrings as they are added to a string S. Each modification appends either a '0' or '1' to S, and after each step, I need to compute the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code. The answer has to be modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So, each time I add a character to S, I need to find all possible substrings that can form a valid Morse code for an English letter. Then, count the number of unique sequences these substrings represent.\n\nWait, but the Morse code for each letter is unique except for four invalid strings. So, any substring of S that doesn't match those four invalid codes is a valid Morse code for a letter.\n\nSo, the task boils down to, for each position in S, considering all possible substrings ending at that position and determining how many of them are valid Morse codes, but without counting duplicates.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each valid substring represents a unique letter, but different substrings could represent the same letter. So, the count isn't just the number of valid substrings, but the number of distinct letters they represent.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\" that are represented by some substring. Each such sequence is a series of letters, and each letter corresponds to exactly one Morse code string. So, the substring must correspond to a sequence of letters where each is formed by a consecutive part of the substring.\n\nWait, maybe not. Oh, wait, no. Each substring is a continuous string of dots and dashes. Each such substring corresponds to exactly zero or one English letters. If it's a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of the four bad ones), then it corresponds to exactly one letter. So, each substring can contribute one or zero to the count.\n\nBut the problem asks for the number of non-empty sequences of letters that are represented by some substring. So, if a substring is a valid Morse code, it contributes exactly one letter. But if multiple substrings can form the same letter, like two different substrings both being '1' which is 'T', then each occurrence would count as a separate letter in the sequence.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is about the number of non-empty sequences of letters. So, for example, if the string is '111', the substrings are '1' (T), '11' (M), '111' (O). Additionally, the substrings '1' starting at positions 2,3 are also T, M, O respectively. So, each occurrence of a valid substring contributes one letter to the count.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note in the problem statement.\n\nIn the note, for the first sample, after adding three '1's, the substrings are:\n\n- '1' → T\n- '11' → M\n- '111' → O\n- '1' (from positions 2) → T\n- '11' (positions 2-3) → M\n- '1' (position 3) → T\n\nSo, the total letters are T, M, O, T, M, T. So six letters, but the output is 3. Wait, no. Wait the output is 3. Hmm, what's going on?\n\nWait, the output in the example is 1 after the first '1'. So, that makes sense—only one substring '1' is present, which is T.\n\nAfter the second '1', the string is '11'. So, the substrings are '1' (T), '11' (M), and '1' (the second character). So, the letters are T, M, T. So total 3 letters, which matches the sample output.\n\nAh, right. So the problem counts each occurrence of a valid substring as a separate letter in the sequence. So, each new substring that is valid adds one to the count.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring. So, each valid substring is a single letter, but when you have multiple valid substrings, each can contribute to forming a longer sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nEach time a new character is added, we need to find all possible substrings that end at this new character. For each of these substrings, if it is a valid Morse code, it contributes to the count. The sum of all such contributions across all possible substrings ending at the current position is the answer.\n\nWait, but in the sample:\n\nAfter the third '1', the string is '111'.\n\nThe substrings are:\n- '1' (positions 1-1) →",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a given string after each modification. Each modification appends either a '0' or '1' to the string, and we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Morse Code Validity**: Each valid Morse code string is a sequence of '0's and '1's of lengths 1 to 4, except for four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid Morse code sequences ending at the i-th character of the string.\n\n3. **State Transition**: For each new character added to the string, we check all possible substrings ending at this character. If a substring is valid, it contributes to the count of valid sequences.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we take modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) at each step to ensure numbers remain manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    s = []\n    idx = 1\n    for _ in range(m):\n        c = input[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        s.append(c)\n    \n    dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)\n    total = 0\n    bad = {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(s)+1):\n        c = s[i-1]\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l >= 0:\n                substr = ''.join(s[i-l:i])\n                if substr not in bad:\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - l]) % MOD\n        total = (total + dp[i]) % MOD\n        print(total)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of characters.\n2. **DP Initialization**: We initialize a DP array where `dp[i]` tracks the number of valid sequences ending at the i-th character.\n3. **Processing Each Character**: For each new character, we check all possible substrings ending at this character of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid, we update the DP array.\n4. **Updating Total Count**: After processing each character, we update the total count of valid sequences and print the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid Morse code sequences using dynamic programming, ensuring we only consider valid substrings and handle large numbers appropriately.",
