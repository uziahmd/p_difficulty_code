            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read it carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, but with some special rules when the second digit is 'R' which stands for the Roman numeral system. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the input is a number c in base a, and we have to convert it into base b, but if b is R, then it's treated as the Roman numeral representation. Oh right, because in the input, b can be replaced by R, which indicates using the Roman numeral system.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe input is two integers a and b, where b may be R. Then, a number c in base a is given. We need to output c in base b, but if b is R, then it's represented as a Roman numeral.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then the output should be the Roman numeral equivalent of the number c (which is in base a). Otherwise, convert c from base a to base 10, then to base b as a string without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the conversion when b is R? Because c is in base a, which is an integer. So first, we convert c from base a to decimal, then represent that decimal number in Roman numerals.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that c is a non-negative integer in base a. So, for example, in the sample input, when a is 2 and b is R, the number is 5 in base 2 (binary 101), which is 5 in decimal. So the Roman numeral for 5 is V.\n\nAnother example: when a is 10 and b is 2, the number is 16 in base 10, which is 11110000 in binary, but since the length is 5, perhaps it's 1111001? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait the sample input has ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA'], and the output is ['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A'].\n\nLooking at the fourth case: input is 2 2 and 1111001 in base 2. So in base 2, 1111001 is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 +8 +1=121. So the output is 121 in base 2, which is 1111001. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each test case, read a, b, and c_str.\n- Determine whether b is R or not.\n- If b is R:\n   - Convert c_str from base a to a decimal integer.\n   - Then, convert that decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n- Else:\n   - Convert c_str from base a to decimal.\n   - Then, convert that decimal to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c can have leading zeros, but the output should have none. So for example, if c_str is \"001\", the output should be \"1\".\n\nNow, the main challenges are:\n\n1. Implementing a function to convert a string in base a to a decimal integer. This needs to handle leading zeros correctly, and also handle bases up to 25, which includes letters like A for 10, B for 11, etc.\n\n2. Implementing a function to convert a decimal integer to a Roman numeral. Also, considering that for bases higher than 10, letters beyond I, V, X, L, C, D, M would be used (e.g., for base 16, A=10, B=11, etc.), but wait, in the problem statement, it says that in bases greater than 10, letters A, B, etc., are used for 10 and above.\n\nWait, wait, the problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So for example, in base 15, 10 is A, 11 is B, up to F for 15.\n\nBut for the Roman numeral conversion, how does this work? Because Roman numerals are specific to their own symbols, but the problem says that when the base is greater than 10, the letters A, B, etc., are used for 10 and above.\n\nWait, but when we're converting to Roman numerals, the digits beyond 9 are represented by letters, but the Roman numeral system itself doesn't go beyond",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to base `b`. If `b` is 'R', the conversion should be done into Roman numerals. The problem involves handling different bases and converting between them, including special cases for Roman numeral representation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the values of `a`, `b`, and the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Determine Conversion Type:** Check if `b` is 'R'. If it is, convert the number to a decimal integer and then to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert the number directly from base `a` to base `b`.\n3. **Base Conversion:** Implement functions to convert a string in a given base to a decimal integer. This function handles bases up to 25, using letters for values greater than 9.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** Implement a function to convert a decimal integer to its Roman numeral equivalent, considering the subtractive principle used in Roman numerals (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n5. **Output Handling:** Ensure the output does not have leading zeros and is formatted correctly for both numeric and Roman numeral representations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    result = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = ord(c) - ord('0') if c.isdigit() else (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10)\n        if digit >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid character {c} in base {base}\")\n        result = result * base + digit\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    a = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    b = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    c_str = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    try:\n        decimal = str_to_int(c_str, a)\n    except:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Determine if we need to output as Roman\n    if b == 'R':\n        print(int_to_roman(decimal))\n    else:\n        # Convert decimal to base b, without leading zeros\n        if decimal == 0:\n            print(0)\n            return\n        res = []\n        while decimal > 0:\n            remainder = decimal % b\n            res.append(str(remainder) if remainder < 10 else chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n            decimal = decimal // b\n        res.reverse()\n        print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and split into components `a`, `b`, and `c_str`.\n2. **Conversion Functions:** \n   - `str_to_int` converts a string in a given base to a decimal integer, handling bases up to 25.\n   - `int_to_roman` converts a decimal integer to its Roman numeral equivalent.\n3. **Handling Different Bases:** Depending on whether `b` is 'R', the number is converted to either Roman numerals or another base.\n4. **Output:** The result is formatted to avoid leading zeros and printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different bases and ensures correct formatting for both numeric and Roman numeral outputs.",
