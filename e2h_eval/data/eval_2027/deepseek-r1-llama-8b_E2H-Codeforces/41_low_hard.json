There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house can be built on a spot, and each spot has a height between 0 and h. The profit for each spot is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges. \n\nHmm, the goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all the restrictions. So, I need to find the heights for each spot such that all the restrictions are met and the sum of squares is as large as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a dynamic programming problem because the choices for each spot depend on previous decisions, especially when considering overlapping ranges in the restrictions.\n\nWait, but the constraints are small: n, h, m are up to 50. So maybe a brute force approach with some optimizations could work. But even better, perhaps a DP approach where for each position, we track the maximum possible height given the constraints.\n\nSo, the idea is to process each spot from left to right, and for each possible height at that spot, determine the best possible choice that doesn't violate any restrictions based on the previously chosen heights.\n\nBut how do the restrictions affect the current spot? Each restriction [l_i, r_i] imposes that the maximum height in that range is <= x_i. So for any spot k in [l_i, r_i], the height can't exceed x_i. Additionally, for spots before l_i or after r_i, they are not directly affected by this restriction unless another restriction covers them.\n\nWait, no. Each spot can be covered by multiple restrictions. For example, if a spot is within multiple ranges, its height must be the minimum of all the x_i's that apply to it. Because each restriction says the maximum height in their respective ranges must not exceed x_i, so for a spot covered by multiple ranges, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_i across all applicable restrictions.\n\nAh, right! So for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include this spot. If a spot isn't covered by any restriction, then its maximum height is h.\n\nSo first, for each spot i (from 1 to n), we can compute the effective maximum height as the minimum x among all restrictions that cover i. If there are no restrictions covering i, then the max is h.\n\nOnce we have the effective max height for each spot, the problem reduces to selecting a height for each spot such that each is <= its effective max, and the sum of squares is maximized. Oh wait, but that's only part of the story. Because each restriction is a range, not just individual points. So the effective max for a spot is the minimum of all x_i's that include it, but also, for any range [l, r], the maximum height in that range must be <= x_i.\n\nWait, no. Because if a spot is in multiple ranges, each of which has their own x_i, the effective maximum for that spot is the minimum of all those x_i's. Because the maximum in any of those ranges cannot exceed x_i, so the spot's height can't exceed any x_i that applies to it. So the overall maximum is the min of all x_i for the spot.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i that cover it. So first, I need to compute for each spot i, the maximum allowed height as the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include i.\n\nOnce I have this, the problem becomes: assign a height to each spot such that each height is <= its maximum allowed height, and the sum of squares is as large as possible. Because all the restrictions are already considered in determining the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose a spot is included in two ranges, one with x=3 and another with x=5. Then the effective max for the spot is 3, because in the first range, the maximum can't exceed 3, and in the second, it's 5. So the spot can be at most 3.\n\nBut now, for the first range, the maximum is 3, which is okay because all spots in that range are <=3. Similarly, for the second range, the maximum is 3, which is <=5, so that's fine. So yes, the effective max for each spot is indeed the minimum x_i over all restrictions that include it.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute its effective maximum height, which is the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover i. If no restrictions cover it, then it's h.\n\n2. Now, the problem is to choose for each spot i a height a_i, such that a_i <= effective_max[i], and the sum of a_i squared is maxim",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house's height contributes to the total profit based on its square of the height, and each restriction limits the maximum height within specific ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Restrictions**: Each restriction specifies a range [l_i, r_i] and a maximum height x_i. For any spot within this range, the height must not exceed x_i.\n2. **Effective Maximum Height**: For each spot, determine the effective maximum height as the minimum x_i across all applicable restrictions. If no restrictions apply, the maximum height is h.\n3. **Maximize Profit**: Once we have the effective maximum height for each spot, the problem reduces to selecting heights that maximize the sum of their squares while respecting these maximums.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    restrictions = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n    \n    # Compute effective_max for each spot\n    effective_max = [h] * (n + 1)  # spots are 1-based\n    for l, r, x in restrictions:\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            if effective_max[i] > x:\n                effective_max[i] = x\n    \n    # Now, the problem is to assign a_i <= effective_max[i], maximize sum(a_i^2)\n    # Since n is small (<=50), we can try all possibilities for each spot\n    # But even better: since each spot's choice is independent once we know the effective max,\n    # We can compute the optimal choice for each spot individually.\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        max_h = effective_max[i]\n        # The optimal height for this spot is the largest possible, which is min(max_h, h)\n        # Wait, but the effective_max already takes into account all restrictions, so it's already <= h\n        # So for each spot, pick the highest possible a_i to maximize a_i^2, which is max_h\n        # Because higher a_i gives higher a_i^2\n        a_i = max_h\n        total += a_i * a_i\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of spots, maximum allowed height, and the number of restrictions. Each restriction is read and stored.\n2. **Effective Maximum Calculation**: For each spot, compute the effective maximum height by considering all applicable restrictions. This ensures that each spot's height does not violate any restriction.\n3. **Maximizing Profit**: For each spot, choose the highest possible height within its effective maximum to maximize the profit, as the square function increases with the height.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit from building the houses.",
