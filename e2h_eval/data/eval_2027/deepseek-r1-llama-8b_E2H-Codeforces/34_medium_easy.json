And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So doing something O(n^2) would probably be too slow.\n\nWait, let's think about what a week is. A week is any k consecutive days in the list of n days. For example, if n=3 and k=2, there are two weeks: days 1-2 and 2-3.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the sum of each consecutive k-day window and then divide by the total number of windows, which is (n - k + 1).\n\nBut wait, computing each window's sum naively would take O(k) time per window, leading to O(nk) time overall. For n=2e5 and k=2e5, that's 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nI remember that for such sliding window problems, using a prefix sum array can help calculate the sums in O(1) per window after an initial O(n) computation.\n\nYes! So here's the plan:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array of the sleep data.\n2. For each window starting at index i (0-based), the sum is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i].\n3. Sum all these window sums and then divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nLet me outline the steps more concretely:\n\n- Read n and k from input.\n- Read the list of a's.\n- Compute the prefix sum array. The prefix_sum[0] is 0, prefix_sum[1] is a[0], prefix_sum[2] is a[0]+a[1], etc.\n- Then, for each i from 0 to n-k:\n   sum += (prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i])\n- The total sum is the sum of all window sums.\n- The average is total_sum / (n - k + 1).\n\nWait, but n can be up to 2e5, and with k up to n, but the number of windows is (n - k + 1). For each window, it's O(1) to compute the sum. So overall, this approach is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nWhat about the data types? Since the numbers can be up to 1e5, and n is up to 2e5, the maximum possible total sum is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. But when divided by up to 2e5, the average could be up to 1e5. Wait, no: 2e10 / 1 is 2e10, but when k=1, each window is one day, so average is sum of all a's divided by n. So yes, the average can be up to 1e5.\n\nIn Python, integers can handle that. But when we output, we need to print it with enough decimal precision.\n\nNow, the problem says the output must have at least 6 digits after the decimal point, and the absolute or relative error must be within 1e-6. So perhaps using floating-point division is better.\n\nWait, but in Python, using integer division might lose precision. So perhaps it's better to compute the total_sum as a float and then divide.\n\nAlternatively, since all a_i are integers, the sum of the windows is an integer, and when we divide by the number of windows, which is also an integer, the result can be a float.\n\nSo, let's see: the total_sum is the sum of all window sums. Each window sum is the sum of k integers. So the total_sum is an integer. Then, the average is total_sum divided by (n - k + 1), which is also an integer.\n\nSo, to get the average accurately, we can perform this division as a floating-point operation.\n\nIn Python, when you do integer division with /, it returns a float. So total_sum / m, where m is (n - k +1), will give the correct float.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps:\n\nImplementing the prefix sum:\n\nprefix = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to (n -k), the window sum is prefix[i +k] - prefix[i].\n\nSum all those window sums.\n\nBut wait, the indexes: for example, if n=3, k=2, the windows are 0-1 and 1-2 (if 0-based). So in the prefix array, the first window is prefix[2] - prefix[0], the second is prefix[3] - prefix[1]. That makes sense.\n\nSo the loop runs from i=0 to (n -k), inclusive. Because for i from 0 to (n -k) (since i +k <= n).\n\nWait, n -k +1 is the number of windows. So i ranges from 0 to (n -k), which is (n -k +1) terms.\n\nYes, so in code:\n\nm = n -k +1\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(m):\n    total += prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]\n\nThen, average = total / m\n\nNow, handling the input correctly.\n\nThe input is given as two lines: the first line has n and k, the second line has the a's.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample inputs:\n\nIn the first sample, the input is given as ['3 2\\n3 4 7', ...], but in reality, the input is two lines. So when reading from stdin, in Python, I'll read the first line, split into n and k, then read the second line, split into a list of integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nassert len(a) == n, \"Mismatched input lengths\"\n\nThen compute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the prefix:\n\nprefix = [0]\ncurrent_sum =0\nfor num in a:\n    current_sum += num\n    prefix.append(current_sum)\n\nWait, no: wait, the prefix sum is built as cumulative sums. So prefix[0] is 0, prefix[1] is a[0], prefix[2] is a[0] +a[1], etc. So yes, the way above is correct.\n\nOnce the prefix is built, compute the total.\n\nThen compute the average.\n\nBut in Python, when you do division with integers, it results in a float.\n\nSo, for example, in the third sample input:\n\nn=8, k=2, a is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nSo the windows are:\n\n1+2=3, 2+4=6, 4+100000=100004, 100000+123=100123, 123+456=579, 456+789=1245, 789+1=790.\n\nSum all these: 3+6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201960; +790=202750.\n\nTotal is 202750, number of windows is 7 (since 8-2+1=7). 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... which is the sample output.\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=k. So only one window, the entire array. Sum is sum(a), average is sum(a)/1.\n\nCase 2: k=1. Then each window is one day, and the average is sum of all a's divided by n.\n\nAnother edge case: all a_i are zero, then the average is zero.\n\nAnother case: when the sum is not an integer, but when divided by the number of windows, it's a float.\n\nSo, code-wise, the steps are solid.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling very large numbers, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\n- Precision when dividing. But in Python, using floating-point division is sufficient as per the problem's required precision.\n\nNow, the output needs to have at least six decimal digits, but the sample shows varying decimal points. So perhaps we should format the output to have exactly six decimal places, but sometimes trailing zeros may be needed.\n\nLooking at the sample outputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 3 2, 3 4 7.\n\nThe windows are 3+4=7, 4+7=11. Sum is 18, divided by 2 gives 9.0. Output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample 2: n=1, k=1. So one window, which is 10. Output is 10.0000000000.\n\nSample 3: as discussed earlier.\n\nSo, the code should output the average with at least six decimal digits, possibly more, but ensuring that the precision is accurate.\n\nIn Python, the best way is to format the output to have 10 decimal digits, perhaps, but the problem allows for any number as long as the error is within 1e-6.\n\nWait, but the note says that the output is considered correct if it has at least six digits after the decimal point. So perhaps the solution is to format the output to have 10 decimal digits to ensure that.\n\nIn Python, we can use string formatting to always display, say, 10 decimal places.\n\nSo the code would compute the average as a float, then format it with .10f or something like that.\n\nWait, but in Python, using the format function:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nThis would format the number with ten decimal places, adding trailing zeros if necessary.\n\nSo, for the sample 1, it would print 9.0000000000, which matches the sample.\n\nSimilarly, for sample 2, 10.0000000000.\n\nSo, in code:\n\naverage = total / m\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but what about when the average is an integer, like 9.0? It would print 9.0000000000, which is correct.\n\nSo yes, that's the way to go.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nTesting the code on sample 3:\n\nCompute the sum of all window sums:\n\nAs per earlier, sum is 202750, divided by 7 is 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhen printed with 10 decimal digits, it becomes 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich is what the sample shows.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nFirst, read the inputs.\n\nThen compute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the total sum of all windows.\n\nDivide by m.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but in the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 digits after the decimal point.\n\nWait, no, the sample shows 10 digits? Let me check:\n\nSample 3's output is '28964.2857142857' — that's 10 digits after decimal? No, let's count: 2857142857 is 10 digits.\n\nYes, so the code needs to output exactly 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, the code will format the output as a float with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo, now, the code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCalculate the total sum of each window.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\nm = n - k +1\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(m):\n    total += prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]\naverage = total / m\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but wait: in the third sample, the sum is 202750, which divided by 7 is 28964.285714285714285..., so when printed to 10 decimal digits, it's 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut the sample shows 28964.2857142857, which is exactly 10 digits after the decimal.\n\nWait, no, 2857142857 is 10 digits.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but what about when m is zero? No, because m is n -k +1. Since k<=n, m >=1.\n\nSo no division by zero.\n\nTesting another edge case: n=2, k=2, a=[5,5]. Then m=1, sum is 10. average is 10. Output is 10.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, k=2, a=[1,2,3,4]. Windows are 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7. Sum is 15. Average is 15/3=5. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on given sleep records for consecutive days. The goal is to determine the average sleep hours per week efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given `n` days of sleep data and need to consider `k` consecutive days as a week. The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks formed by these `k` consecutive days.\n2. **Efficient Calculation Using Prefix Sum**: To efficiently compute the sum of sleep hours for each window of `k` days, we use a prefix sum array. This allows us to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n).\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: By leveraging the prefix sum array, we can slide a window of size `k` across the list of sleep times, summing each window's sleep hours in constant time.\n4. **Precision Handling**: The result is formatted to ensure it meets the required precision of at least 6 decimal places, but we output it with 10 decimal places to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n\nm = n - k + 1\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(m):\n    total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n\naverage = total / m\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: We construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of sleep times from the start up to the `i-th` day. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Summing Windows**: For each possible starting point of a week (window), we compute the sum using the prefix sum array. This avoids the need for nested loops and reduces the time complexity.\n4. **Calculating Average**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows (`n - k + 1`) to get the average sleep time per week.\n5. **Output**: The result is formatted to ensure it is printed with 10 decimal places, meeting the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average while handling large inputs within acceptable time limits.",
