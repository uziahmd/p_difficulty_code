Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And also, output these pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nWe have n left boots and n right boots. Each boot has a color, which is a lowercase letter or a '?'. Two boots can be paired if their colors are compatible.\n\nCompatibility rules:\n- If both are specific letters, they must be the same.\n- If one is '?' and the other is any (specific or '?'), then they are compatible.\n- If both are '?', they are compatible.\n\nSo, for example, 'a' and 'a' are compatible. 'a' and '?' are compatible. 'a' and 'b' are not.\n\nThe task is to pair each left with a right boot, making sure that each left and right is used at most once. We need the maximum number of such pairs.\n\nThe output should be the count, followed by the list of pairs in any order.\n\nNow, the input gives us two strings: l for left boots and r for right boots. Each character represents a boot's color.\n\nMy plan is to model this as a bipartite graph where edges represent compatible pairs. Then, we need to find the maximum matching in this graph. But wait, n can be up to 150,000, so a standard maximum matching algorithm like Hopcroft-Karp would be O(E√V), but building such a graph is impossible because E could be O(n^2), which is way too big for n=1.5e5.\n\nThat's way beyond what we can handle directly. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to count the pairs without explicitly checking all possibilities.\n\nMaybe group the left and right boots based on their color types and compute the maximum possible pairs between these groups.\n\nEach left boot can be in one of four categories:\n1. Fixed color (e.g., 'a')\n2. Wildcard ('?')\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to categorize each boot into its color type. For each left boot, determine whether it's fixed or wildcard. Same for each right boot.\n\nWait, but how do we pair them optimally?\n\nI think the key is to process the left and right arrays, count how many of each type they have, and then find the best way to match them.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFor left boots:\n- Let c be the count of fixed colors (excluding '?') — but each specific color has its own count. For example, count['a'] is the number of left boots with color 'a'.\n- Let w be the count of wildcards.\n\nSame for right boots:\n- Let d be a dictionary mapping each fixed color to its count.\n- Let w_r be the count of wildcards.\n\nNow, the strategy could be:\n\n1. Pair as many as possible between fixed-left and fixed-right, matching the same color. The sum here is the minimum of the counts of each color on both sides.\n\n2. Then, use the remaining fixed-left with wildcards on the right, but only if there are some left.\n\n3. Also, pair the wildcards from left with fixed on right, again using the min of w_l and sum of d_r.\n\n4. Finally, use the remaining wildcards on both sides to form pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps the order matters. Maybe pairing some fixed with wildcards first leaves more options for others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\n- First, pair all fixed-left with fixed-right (same color).\n- Then, pair the remaining fixed-left with the wildcards on the right.\n- Then, pair the wildcards on the left with the fixed on the right.\n- Finally, pair the remaining wildcards.\n\nWait, but maybe the last step isn't necessary because wildcards can pair with each other as well.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\nCompute the maximum possible pairs as follows:\n\na) For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nSum all these up. This gives the fixed-fixed pairs.\n\nb) Then, the remaining left_fixed = total_left_fixed - sum(left_count[c] for c in left_counts)\n   Similarly, remaining_right_fixed = total_right_fixed - sum(right_count[c] for c in right_counts)\n\nc) The number of possible pairs between left_fixed_remaining and right_wild is min(remaining_left_fixed, right_wild).\n\nd) Similarly, the number of pairs between left_wild and right_fixed_remaining is min(left_wild, remaining_right_fixed).\n\ne) The remaining wildcards on left and right can be paired together, which is min(left_wild_remaining, right_wild_remaining).\n\nBut wait, after steps b and c, the left_fixed_remaining and right_fixed_remaining may change.\n\nWait, no",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot has a color, which can be a specific letter or a wildcard '?'. The compatibility rules are such that two boots can be paired if they have the same specific color or if one is a wildcard.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Fixed Colors**: For both left and right boots, count how many boots have each specific color.\n2. **Count Wildcards**: Count the number of wildcards in both left and right boots.\n3. **Pair Fixed Colors**: Pair as many fixed colors from left boots with fixed colors from right boots of the same type.\n4. **Pair Remaining Fixed with Wildcards**: Use any remaining fixed left boots to pair with wildcards on the right.\n5. **Pair Wildcards with Fixed**: Use any remaining fixed right boots to pair with wildcards on the left.\n6. **Pair Wildcards Together**: Finally, pair any remaining wildcards from both sides.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs by efficiently utilizing both fixed and wildcard colors.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Count for left fixed colors\nleft_counts = defaultdict(int)\nleft_wild = 0\nfor c in l:\n    if c == '?':\n        left_wild += 1\n    else:\n        left_counts[c] += 1\n\n# Count for right fixed colors\nright_counts = defaultdict(int)\nright_wild = 0\nfor c in r:\n    if c == '?':\n        right_wild += 1\n    else:\n        right_counts[c] += 1\n\n# Compute fixed-fixed pairs\nfixed_pairs = 0\nfor c in left_counts:\n    if c in right_counts:\n        fixed_pairs += min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])\n\n# Subtract used fixed from both\nremaining_left_fixed = sum(left_counts.values())\nremaining_right_fixed = sum(right_counts.values())\nused_left = sum(min(left_counts[c], right_counts.get(c,0)) for c in left_counts)\nused_right = sum(min(left_counts[c], right_counts.get(c,0)) for c in right_counts)\n\nremaining_left_fixed -= used_left\nremaining_right_fixed -= used_right\n\n# Now, handle the cases where some fixed are left and wild is available\n# First, left fixed can pair with right wild\npair_lr_fixed_to_wild = min(remaining_left_fixed, right_wild)\nfixed_pairs += pair_lr_fixed_to_wild\nremaining_left_fixed -= pair_lr_fixed_to_wild\nright_wild -= pair_lr_fixed_to_wild\n\n# Then, right fixed can pair with left wild\npair_rl_wild_to_fixed = min(left_wild, remaining_right_fixed)\nfixed_pairs += pair_rl_wild_to_fixed\nleft_wild -= pair_rl_wild_to_fixed\nremaining_right_fixed -= pair_rl_wild_to_fixed\n\n# Now, use the remaining wilds\npair_wild_wild = min(left_wild, right_wild)\nfixed_pairs += pair_wild_wild\nleft_wild -= pair_wild_wild\nright_wild -= pair_wild_wild\n\ntotal = fixed_pairs + pair_wild_wild\n\n# Now, reconstruct the pairs\npairs = []\n\n# First, add all fixed-fixed pairs\nfor c in left_counts:\n    count = min(left_counts[c], right_counts.get(c,0))\n    if count > 0:\n        for i in range(count):\n            # Find an index for left\n            idx_l = next((i+1 for idx, c in enumerate(l) if c == c), None)\n            # Find an index for right\n            idx_r = next((i+1 for idx, c in enumerate(r) if c == c), None)\n            if idx_l is not None and idx_r is not None:\n                pairs.append((idx_l, idx_r))\n\n# Then, add fixed-to-wild on left\nif remaining_left_fixed > 0 and right_wild > 0:\n    for i in range(pair_lr_fixed_to_wild):\n        for idx_l in [x for x in range(n) if l[x] != '?' and l[x] in left_counts]:\n            if len(pairs) >= total:\n                break\n            for idx_r in [x for x in range(n) if r[x] == '?']:\n                if (idx_l, idx_r) not in pairs and idx_l not in [p[0] for p in pairs] and idx_r not in [p[1] for p in pairs]:\n                    pairs.append((idx_l+1, idx_r+1))\n\n# Similarly, add wild-to-fixed on right\nif left_wild > 0 and remaining_right_fixed > 0:\n    for i in range(pair_rl_wild_to_fixed):\n        for idx_r in [x for x in range(n) if r[x] != '?' and r[x] in right_counts]:\n            for idx_l in [x for x in range(n) if l[x] == '?']:\n                if (idx_l+1, idx_r+1) not in pairs and idx_l not in [p[0]-1 for p in pairs] and idx_r not in [p[1]-1 for p in pairs]:\n                    pairs.append((idx_l+1, idx_r+1))\n\n# Finally, add wild-wild pairs\nif left_wild > 0 and right_wild > 0:\n    wild_pairs = min(left_wild, right_wild)\n    for i in range(wild_pairs):\n        for idx_l in [x for x in range(n) if l[x] == '?']:\n            for idx_r in [x for x in range(n) if r[x] == '?']:\n                if (idx_l+1, idx_r+1) not in pairs and idx_l not in [p[0]-1 for p in pairs] and idx_r not in [p[1]-1 for p in pairs]:\n                    pairs.append((idx_l+1, idx_r+1))\n\nk = len(pairs)\nprint(k)\nfor a, b in pairs:\n    print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution first counts the number of fixed colors and wildcards in both left and right boots. It then pairs fixed colors with each other, followed by pairing remaining fixed boots with wildcards and vice versa. Finally, it pairs any remaining wildcards together to maximize the number of compatible pairs. This approach ensures that we efficiently utilize both specific and wildcard colors to form the maximum number of valid pairs.",
