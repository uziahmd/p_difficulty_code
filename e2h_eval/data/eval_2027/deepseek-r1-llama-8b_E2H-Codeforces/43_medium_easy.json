He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A creates a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So after this step, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C then appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both). \n\nOur task is to determine whether a given string S could have been formed through this process.\n\nHmm, so the string must follow the order: all 'a's first, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So any string that doesn't have this order is automatically invalid.\n\nSo first, I need to check the structure of the string. It should consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's, with no other characters in between. If any 'a' comes after a 'b' or 'c', or a 'b' comes after a 'c', it's invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, I need to count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\nLet me denote:\n- count_a = number of 'a's\n- count_b = number of 'b's\n- count_c = number of 'c's\n\nNow, for the counts:\n- count_b must be at least 1 because after B appends, there's at least one 'b'.\n- count_c must be equal to either count_a, count_b, or both.\n\nWait, but what about the case where C appends zero 'c's? No, because the note says that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b' before C appends. But after C appends, the string may have c's. Wait, the problem says that C appends \"some number\", which includes zero? Or does it mean he appends at least one?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". Hmm, in programming problems, sometimes \"some number\" can include zero. But looking back at the note: in the second example, the output is NO because the order is wrong. So perhaps the number of 'c's can be zero. Wait, but the problem says that after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, but maybe zero. So, the string could end with just 'ab'—but wait, the problem says that C appends some 'c's. Wait, no. Wait, in the initial steps, A gives a string with only 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, so now the string has at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, which could be zero? Or not?\n\nWait, the problem says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. So if C appends zero 'c's, then count_c is zero, which would require count_a or count_b to be zero. But since count_a is at least one (from step 1) and count_b is at least one (from step 2), count_c can't be zero. Therefore, C must append at least one 'c'—so the number of 'c's is at least one. Because otherwise, count_c would be zero, which can't be equal to count_a or count_b (both >=1).\n\nWait, no. Suppose C appends zero 'c's. Then count_c is zero. For it to satisfy the condition, zero must be equal to count_a or count_b. But count_a is >=1, count_b >=1, so zero can't be equal. Thus, in this case, the condition fails. So, C must append at least one 'c', so count_c is at least one.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that C appends some number of 'c's, which can be zero? Or is it implied that he appends at least one? Hmm, the wording isn't clear. But looking back at the note: in the third example, the count_c equals the count_b, which is 3. So in that case, the count is non-zero.\n\nSo, perhaps the count_c can be zero only if either count_a or count_b is zero, which they aren't. So count_c must be >=1.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check that the string is structured as all 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's, with no interleaving. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\n3. Check that count_b >=1 and count_c >=1.\n\n4. Check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b or both.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, we can parse the string and ensure the order is correct.\n\nWe can iterate through the string and make sure that once we encounter a 'b', we don't see any 'a's after that. Similarly, once we see a 'c', we don't see any 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo, let's go through the string:\n\n- Start state: expecting 'a's.\n\n- When a 'a' is found, continue.\n\n- When a 'b' is found, transition to expecting 'b's.\n\n- Any 'a' after this is invalid.\n\n- When a 'c' is found, transition to expecting 'c's.\n\n- Any 'b' or 'a' after this is invalid.\n\nSo, during this process, if any character violates the order, the string is invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is confirmed, proceed to count.\n\nSo, let's code this:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\ncurrent_char = 'a'\n\ncount_a = 0\ncount_b = 0\ncount_c = 0\n\nfor char in S:\n    if char == current_char:\n        increment the count\n    else:\n        if char is the next allowed character:\n            update current_char\n        else:\n            return False (invalid)\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to track the current expected character. Initially, it's 'a'. Once a 'b' is encountered, expected becomes 'b'. Once a 'c' is encountered, expected becomes 'c'. If any character is found that's not the expected one, the string is invalid.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nexpected = 'a'\nfor char in S:\n    if char != expected:\n        # check if this is the next allowed character\n        if char == 'b' and expected == 'a':\n            expected = 'b'\n        elif char == 'c' and expected == 'a':\n            # but after 'a's come 'b's, not directly 'c's\n            # so this is invalid.\n            return False\n        elif char == 'c' and expected == 'b':\n            # after 'b's come 'c's\n            expected = 'c'\n        else:\n            # invalid character\n            return False\n    else:\n        # valid, increment count\n        if char == 'a':\n            count_a +=1\n        elif char == 'b':\n            count_b +=1\n        else:\n            count_c +=1\n\nWait, but when expected is 'b', and a 'c' is encountered, that's invalid because you can't have 'c's until 'b's are done.\n\nSo, perhaps a more precise way is:\n\nstart expecting 'a's. Once a 'b' is found, expecting 'b's. Once a 'c' is found, expecting 'c's. Any other character is invalid.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Initially, expecting 'a's.\n\nLoop through each character:\n\nif char == current_expected:\n    add to count\nelif char is 'b' and current_expected is 'a':\n    current_expected = 'b'\nelif char is 'c' and current_expected is 'a':\n    # invalid, because 'c' can't come before 'b's\n    return False\nelif char is 'c' and current_expected is 'b':\n    current_expected = 'c'\nelse:\n    # invalid character\n    return False\n\nWait, but after 'b's, the next allowed is 'c's only. So any 'b' after 'c's is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps the logic is:\n\nAfter the initial 'a's, any 'b's are allowed, but once a 'b' is processed, any further 'a's are invalid.\n\nSimilarly, after processing 'b's, any 'c's are allowed, but any further 'a's or 'b's are invalid.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be:\n\nstate = 'a'\n\ncount_a, count_b, count_c = 0, 0, 0\n\nfor char in S:\n\n    if char == state:\n        if state == 'a':\n            count_a +=1\n        elif state == 'b':\n            count_b +=1\n        else:\n            count_c +=1\n    else:\n        if state == 'a':\n            if char == 'b':\n                state = 'b'\n            else:\n                # char is 'c' but we're in 'a' state\n                return False\n        elif state == 'b':\n            if char == 'c':\n                state = 'c'\n            else:\n                # char is 'a' or 'b' in 'b' state\n                return False\n        else: # state is 'c'\n            # can't have anything else\n            return False\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nOnce the loop completes, we also need to ensure that state is 'c' (because after 'a's and 'b's comes 'c's), else it's invalid.\n\nFor example, if the string ends with 'b's, then state is 'b' and it's invalid.\n\nSo, after processing all characters, check if state is 'c'.\n\nAdditionally, count_b and count_c must be at least 1.\n\nBecause, according to the problem statement, after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, which implies that count_c is at least 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that C appends some 'c's. So the number of 'c's is >=1.\n\nWait, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's, which can be zero? Or is it required to be non-zero?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nC appends some number of 'c's. The number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a's or to the number of 'b's.\n\nSo, if C appends zero 'c's, then the count_c is zero. But then, zero must be equal to count_a or count_b. But count_a is at least 1, and count_b is at least 1, so zero cannot be equal to either. So the condition fails.\n\nThus, C must have appended at least one 'c', meaning count_c >=1.\n\nTherefore, in our code, after checking the structure, we must also ensure that count_b >=1 and count_c >=1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCheck the structure:\n\n- The string must be a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's.\n\n- count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n- count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check the structure as per the above logic. If any part is invalid, return NO.\n\n2. After that, check if count_b >=1 and count_c >=1.\n\n3. Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b or both.\n\nIf all three conditions are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 'aaabccc'\n\nStructure: a's, then b's, then c's.\n\ncount_a = 3, count_b = 1, count_c = 3.\n\ncount_c equals count_a (3=3). So yes.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 'bbacc'\n\nStructure check:\n\nThe first character is 'b', but initial state is 'a'. So 'b' comes when state is 'a' is allowed, so state transitions to 'b'.\n\nNext is 'a': state is 'b', so 'a' is invalid. So overall structure is invalid. So output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: 'aabc'\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStructure: 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo, initial state 'a', then 'a' again, okay.\n\nThen 'b' comes. So state transitions to 'b'.\n\nThen 'c' comes. State transitions to 'c'.\n\nSo structure is valid.\n\ncount_a = 2, count_b =1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is equal to count_b (1=1). So condition holds.\n\nThus, output is YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc'.\n\nStructure is correct.\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c equals both a and b. So condition holds. Output is YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc'.\n\nStructure: a's, then b's, then c's.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So condition fails. Output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc'.\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which is equal to a. So condition holds. Output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'acbbc'.\n\nStructure: 'a' is followed by 'c'—invalid because in 'a' state, 'c' is not allowed. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc'.\n\nStructure: a's, then b's, then a's again. So invalid.\n\nSo, output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaaccc' is invalid because after 'b's, an 'a' appears.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nImplement the structure check.\n\nThen, check count_b >=1 and count_c >=1.\n\nThen, check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all conditions met, print YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, read the string:\n\nS = input().strip()\n\nThen, initialize the variables.\n\ncount_a = 0\ncount_b = 0\ncount_c = 0\n\nstate = 'a'\n\nfor char in S:\n    if char == state:\n        if state == 'a':\n            count_a +=1\n        elif state == 'b':\n            count_b +=1\n        else:\n            count_c +=1\n    else:\n        if state == 'a':\n            if char == 'b':\n                state = 'b'\n            else:\n                # char is 'c' when state is 'a'—invalid\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n        elif state == 'b':\n            if char == 'c':\n                state = 'c'\n            else:\n                # char is 'a' or 'b' when state is 'b'\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n        else:\n            # state is 'c', can't have other chars\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\n# After processing all characters, check if state is 'c'\nif state != 'c':\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now, check count_b >=1 and count_c >=1\nif count_b <1 or count_c <1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now, check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: what about when the string is just 'abc'? That's allowed, right? Because count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1. So, count_c equals both, so it's valid.\n\nYes, the code will handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: minimal possible string.\n\nLike 'ab'—then C hasn't added any 'c's, which is invalid because count_c must be >=1. So the code correctly returns NO.\n\nWhat about 'abc'—yes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbc'—count_c is 1, which is not equal to a (2) or b (2). So condition fails, output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about 'aaabbbc'—count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=1. count_c is 1, not equal to 3. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbb'—no 'c's, so count_c is 0. So even though structure is correct, count_c is 0, so it's invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should cover all cases.\n\nTesting it against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nStructure: a, a, a, b, b, c, c, c.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=2, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c is 3, which equals a (3). So condition holds. Output YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc'\n\nFirst char is 'b', state transitions to 'b'. Next char is 'a', which is invalid when state is 'b'. So code exits with NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc'\n\nStructure: a, a, b, c.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c equals count_b (1=1). So condition holds. Output YES.\n\nSo the code works for samples.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order.
