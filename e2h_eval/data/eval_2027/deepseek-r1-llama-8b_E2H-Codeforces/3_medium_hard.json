Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l in length. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d so that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, let's think about the input. The first line gives n and l. Then the next line has n integers, each representing the position of a lantern ai.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input, there are 7 lanterns at positions [15,5,3,7,9,14,0], and the street is length 15. The output is 2.5.\n\nWait, no, the sample output shows two cases. Oh, wait, looking back, the input seems to be two test cases. The first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which is the first case, and the second line is '2 5\\n2 5'—so n=2 and l=5, with both lanterns at 2 and 5. The output is 2.0.\n\nWait, no, the output is two lines because the input had two cases. But the problem says that the user will provide one input, but in the example, perhaps it's a formatting thing. Wait, no—the problem says that the input is given as two lines, the first being the first test case, and the second being the second test case. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" Then the example shows an input with two lines, each presumably being a separate test case. But the output has two lines, one for each.\n\nBut in the problem, the input is a single input, which may consist of multiple test cases? Or is it that the problem has only one test case, but the sample shows two lines for the input? Hmm, perhaps the sample input is a typo, but the actual problem expects a single test case. So perhaps the code should handle just one case.\n\nWait, looking again, the problem says: \"Print the minimum light radius d...\". So the output is a single number. But the sample shows two outputs. Oh, perhaps I misread; the sample input is actually two test cases, and the output is two lines each. Because in the sample, the first input line is '7 15\\n...' and the second is '2 5\\n...', so two test cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects that the input can have multiple test cases, each separated by a blank line or something. But in the problem statement, it's not specified. So perhaps the code should read all the data, process each test case separately, and print each result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code needs to process each test case, which is provided as a block. So the first line after the initial lines is a test case, followed by another line which is the next test case, etc.\n\nWell, regardless, for the code, I'll need to read the input correctly. So perhaps in the code, we can read all lines, split them into groups where each group has n and l, followed by the ai list.\n\nBut perhaps the code should read until EOF, processing each test case as it goes.\n\nBut for now, perhaps the problem is that the code should handle a single test case, and the sample includes two test cases for demonstration.\n\nWait, no, the sample input shows two test cases. So the code must be able to handle multiple test cases.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Your task is to write a Python script that reads input from standard input and prints desired outputs...\" So the input can have multiple test cases, each consisting of a line with n and l, followed by a line with the ai's.\n\nSo the code should process each test case as it comes.\n\nBut how are they separated? For example, in the sample input, the first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which is a test case. The second line is '2 5\\n2 5'—another test case.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the input is read as two separate test cases, each starting with their own n and l. So the code must read each test case, process it, and output the result.\n\nSo the approach is: Read each test case, process it, compute d, and print the result.\n\nSo how do we model the problem?\n\nWe need to find the minimal d such that every point on the street [0, l] is covered by at least one lantern's coverage.\n\nEach lantern covers from (ai -d) to (ai +d), but we have to make sure that these intervals cover [0, l].\n\nWait, but the coverage isn't just the union of individual intervals. Because the coverage is continuous, any point not covered by any lantern's interval would leave a gap.\n\nSo the minimal d is the smallest value such that when you sort the lanterns, the combined coverage of all lanterns with radius d covers the entire street.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n\n2. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the distance between them. The required d must be at least half of that distance, because otherwise, the middle point won't be covered.\n\nAdditionally, the first lantern's left end must be <=0, so the distance from the first lantern to 0 must be covered by d.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern's right end must be >=l.\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\nLet me think of the street as a line from 0 to l.\n\nEach lantern i has a coverage from (ai -d) to (ai +d). The union of all these intervals must cover [0, l].\n\nSo the minimal d is the minimal value such that:\n\n- The first lantern's left coverage is <=0.\n\n- The last lantern's right coverage is >=l.\n\n- For any two consecutive lanterns, the distance between them is <= 2d. Otherwise, the middle point is not covered.\n\nWait, yes. Because if two lanterns are at positions x and y (x < y), then the coverage intervals are [x-d, x+d] and [y-d, y+d]. If y > x+2d, then the point x +d +d = x+2d is beyond y -d, so there's a gap between x+d and y -d. Thus, the distance between x and y must be <= 2d.\n\nSo the minimal d must satisfy:\n\nmax( (distance between first lantern and 0)/2 , (distance between last lantern and l)/2, max over all consecutive lantern distances / 2 )\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the first lantern, the left coverage is (a1 -d) must be <=0. So the maximum allowed d is a1 (since a1 -d <=0 => d >=a1).\n\nWait, wait: a1 -d <=0 → d >= a1.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern's right coverage (al +d) must be >=l → d >= l - al.\n\nFor the middle parts, between two consecutive lanterns, say ai and aj (i < j). The distance between them is aj - ai. The minimal d needed for their coverage to overlap is that (aj - ai) <= 2d → d >= (aj - ai)/2.\n\nSo overall, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a1 (since d >= a1)\n- (l - al_last) (d >= l - al_last)\n- the maximum (aj - ai)/2 for consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, no: a1 is the position of the first lantern. So the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. So to cover 0, d must be at least a1, because a1 -d <=0 → d >=a1.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from al_last to l is l - al_last. So d must be at least that.\n\nAnd for the other lanterns, the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns must be covered by 2d.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of a1, (l - al_last), and the maximum of (aj - ai)/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nWait, but wait: what if the first lantern is already at 0? Then a1 is 0, so d can be zero. But in that case, if the last lantern is also at 0, then d can be zero.\n\nBut in general, the minimal d is the maximum between the three values mentioned above.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps to compute d are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n\n2. Compute the first required d as a1 (the first lantern's position, since 0 must be covered by a1's left edge).\n\n3. Compute the last required d as l - al_last (the last lantern's right edge must reach l).\n\n4. For each consecutive pair in the sorted list, compute (aj - ai)/2. The maximum of these is the third component.\n\n5. The minimal d is the maximum of the three components computed in steps 2, 3, and 4.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=7, l=15\n\nLanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nSort them: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCompute:\n\na1 is 0 → d must be >=0.\n\nal_last is 15 → l - al_last is 0 → d >=0.\n\nNow, the consecutive differences:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1\n\n7-5=2 →1\n\n9-7=2 →1\n\n14-9=5 →2.5\n\n15-14=1 →0.5\n\nThe maximum among these is 2.5.\n\nSo d is the maximum of 0, 0, 2.5 → 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\nLanterns at 2 and5.\n\nSort them: 2,5.\n\na1 is 2 → d >=2.\n\nal_last is5 → l-al_last=0.\n\nConsecutive difference:5-2=3 → 1.5.\n\nSo d is the maximum of 2,0,1.5 →2.0. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if lanterns are already covering the entire street without needing any d>0?\n\nE.g., n=1, l=10, lantern at 5.\n\nThen a1 is5 →d >=5.\n\nl -al_last is 5.\n\nNo consecutive pairs.\n\nSo d=5.\n\nBut wait, the lantern at5 covers from 0 to10, so d=0 would suffice. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, why? Because according to our formula, a1 is5, so d >=5. But in reality, d=0 is sufficient because the lantern at5 covers 5-0=5, but the street is 10 units. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, the lantern at5 with d=0 will only cover exactly 5, so the entire street is not lit. So in that case, d must be at least5.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, the lantern at5 with radius d=5 would cover from0 to10, which is the entire street. So in that case, d=5 is correct.\n\nBut if the lantern is at5, and the street is10 units, then with d=5, the coverage is [0,10], so correct.\n\nBut what if the lantern is at5, and the street is 10 units? Then, the minimal d is5.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 0 and10.\n\nSo a1=0, so d>=0.\n\nal_last=10, l-al_last=0.\n\nConsecutive difference is10-0=10 →5.\n\nSo d is max(0,0,5)=5.\n\nWhich makes sense: each lantern covers from 0-5= -5 (but since street starts at0, coverage is0-5=5 units?), wait no.\n\nWait, no. The lantern at0 with d=5 covers from0-5= -5 (but since the street starts at0, it's 0 to5. Similarly, the lantern at10 with d=5 covers from10-5=5 to10+5=15, but the street ends at10. So together, the coverage is0-5 and5-10, which covers the entire street. So yes, d=5 is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at1 and9.\n\nSo sorted:1,9.\n\na1=1 →d >=1.\n\nal_last=9 →l -9=1 →d >=1.\n\nConsecutive difference:8 →4.\n\nSo d is max(1,1,4)=4.\n\nCheck: with d=4, lantern1 covers from -3 (treated as0) to5. Lantern9 covers from5 to13 (treated as10). So the entire street is covered. Yes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, lantern at3.\n\nThen a1=3 →d >=3.\n\nl -3=2 →d >=2.\n\nNo consecutive pairs.\n\nSo d is max(3,2) →3.\n\nWhich makes sense: the coverage is from0 to6, which covers 0-5.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n- Read each test case.\n\n- Sort the lanterns.\n\n- Compute a1 (first lantern's position).\n\n- Compute l - al_last (last lantern's position).\n\n- Compute the maximum of (aj - ai)/2 for consecutive lanterns.\n\n- The minimal d is the maximum of a1, (l - al_last), and the maximum of the consecutive differences divided by two.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nIn Python, the steps are:\n\nRead the input.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read n and l.\n\n   Read the next line as a list of integers, ai.\n\n   Sort ai.\n\n   Compute a1 = ai[0]\n\n   Compute last = l - ai[-1]\n\n   Compute max_gap = 0\n\n   for i in range(len(ai)-1):\n\n       diff = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n\n       current_gap = diff / 2\n\n       if current_gap > max_gap:\n\n           max_gap = current_gap\n\n   d = max(a1, last, max_gap)\n\n   Print d with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but wait: a1 is the first lantern's position. Since a1 could be 0, but if the first lantern is at 0, then a1 is0, so d >=0.\n\nSimilarly, if the last lantern is at l, then last is0, so d >=0.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly is crucial.\n\nIn the sample input, each test case is given as a line with n and l, followed by the ai's.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' — which is n=7, l=15, and the lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nSo the code should read each test case as follows:\n\nRead a line for n and l.\n\nThen read the next line as the list of ai.\n\nSo, the code will read the entire input, split into lines, and process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, each test case is two lines: the first line is the n l line, the second is the ai line.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first test case is given as '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' — but perhaps the actual input is like that, meaning that each test case consists of two lines.\n\nSo, the code should read the lines, process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nSo, the code in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read a line, split into n and l.\n\n   read the next line, split into list of integers.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the input may have multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first is n and l, the second is the ai's.\n\nSo, the code can read all lines, then process them two by two.\n\nBut sometimes, the last line may not have a pair, but in practice, the problem says that each test case is valid.\n\nSo in code:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\ncurrent_line = 0\n\nwhile current_line < len(lines):\n\n   # read n and l\n\n   parts = lines[current_line].split()\n\n   n = int(parts[0])\n\n   l = float(parts[1])\n\n   current_line +=1\n\n   # read ai\n\n   ai = list(map(int, lines[current_line].split()))\n\n   current_line +=1\n\n   # process\n\n   ai.sort()\n\n   a1 = ai[0]\n\n   last = l - ai[-1]\n\n   max_gap = 0\n\n   for i in range(n-1):\n\n       diff = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n\n       current_gap = diff / 2.0\n\n       if current_gap > max_gap:\n\n           max_gap = current_gap\n\n   d = max(a1, last, max_gap)\n\n   print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=7, l=15\n\nai = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] → after sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\na1=0, last=15-15=0.\n\nconsecutive diffs:\n\n3-0=3 →1.5\n\n5-3=2 →1\n\n7-5=2 →1\n\n9-7=2 →1\n\n14-9=5 →2.5\n\n15-14=1 →0.5\n\nmax_gap is 2.5.\n\nd is max(0,0,2.5)=2.5 → printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5\n\nai = [2,5]\n\nsorted: [2,5]\n\na1=2, last=5-5=0.\n\ndiff 5-2=3 →1.5.\n\nmax_gap is1.5.\n\nd = max(2, 0, 1.5) →2.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, ai=[5].\n\na1=5, last=10-5=5.\n\nmax_gap is0.\n\nd is max(5,5,0) →5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, ai=[1,9].\n\na1=1, last=10-9=1.\n\ndiff 8 →4.\n\nd is max(1,1,4) →4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, ai=[0,5,10].\n\na1=0 →d >=0.\n\nlast=10-10=0.\n\nconsecutive diffs:5-0=5 →2.5, 10-5=5→2.5.\n\nd is max(0,0,2.5)=2.5.\n\nWhich is correct, because each lantern covers 0-2.5, 2.5-7.5, and 7.5-12.5. So combined, 0 to10 is covered.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=20, ai=[5,10,15].\n\na1=5 →d >=5.\n\nlast=20-15=5.\n\ndiffs:5,5 →2.5 each.\n\nmax_gap 2.5.\n\nd is max(5,5,2.5)=5.\n\nWhich is correct because each lantern covers 0-10, 5-15, 10-20, but wait, no. Wait, the lanterns are at5,10,15.\n\nWith d=5, lantern5 covers 0-10, 10 covers5-15, 15 covers10-20. So the coverage is 0-20, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n\n1. When the street is very small, like l=0. But l is given as >=1, per the constraints.\n\nWait, the problem statement says 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9. So l can be 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, ai=[0].\n\na1=0 →d >=0.\n\nlast=1-0=1 →d >=1.\n\nNo consecutive pairs.\n\nSo d is max(0,1,0) →1.\n\nWhich is correct: the lantern covers 0-1, so d=1 is needed to cover the entire street.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, ai=[0.5].\n\na1=0.5 →d >=0.5.\n\nlast=1-0.5=0.5 →d >=0.5.\n\nNo consecutive pairs.\n\nd=0.5.\n\nWhich is correct: the lantern at0.5 with d=0.5 covers 0 to1.\n\nAnother edge case: when the lanterns are all at0.\n\nn=3, l=100, ai=[0,0,0].\n\na1=0, last=100-0=100.\n\nConsecutive diffs are0 →0.\n\nSo d is max(0,100,0) →100.\n\nWhich is correct because the lanterns are all at0, so to cover the entire street, each point x must be within 100 of0. So x can be up to100, so d=100.\n\nAnother case: when the lanterns are not in order.\n\nBut the code sorts them, so it's okay.\n\nI think the code should handle all cases.\n",
