    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. Hmm. The main condition is that after rearrangement, each set in the array is a child of the next one. And we need to find this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement again.\n\nA set A is a child of B if for every x in A, x+1 is present in B. So for example, if A has {1}, then B must have at least {2}. But wait, no—actually, it's for each x in A, there exists an x+1 in B. So B could have more elements, but for each element in A, the next integer must be present in B.\n\nSo when considering the array of sets [S1, S2, ..., SN], after rearrangement, S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1} for all i from 1 to N-1. That means that each S'_i must be a subset of the next in some way, based on the child definition.\n\nWait, not exactly a subset, but each element x in S'_i implies x+1 is in S'_{i+1}.\n\nHmm. So the sequence of sets must form a chain where each is a child of the next. So how can we model this?\n\nI think the key is to model the possible sets and their transitions. But given that N and K can be up to 2e5, we need a solution that is O(K) or O(N*K), but not anything higher.\n\nLet me think about what the structure of such arrays looks like.\n\nEach set S_i can be any subset of {1, ..., K}. But the arrangement must allow for a permutation where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nWait, but the sets are part of an array, which is a list. The problem allows any order of this list, as long as the required condition holds when the array is reordered. So the array itself doesn't have to be in a specific order; it's the possibility of reordering that matters.\n\nBut how do we count the number of arrays where such a rearrangement exists?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem in terms of the possible sequences that can be arranged in such a way.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to model this as a graph where each node represents a possible state (a set S) and edges represent the possible transitions between states where the next state is a parent of the current. Then, the problem reduces to counting the number of paths of length N-1 in this graph, multiplied by the number of ways to permute the path into any order that satisfies the constraints.\n\nNo, wait. Because the array is a list of sets, and after rearrangement, the sequence must form a chain where each step is a child. So the array's sets must form a collection of sets that can be ordered into a chain S_1 → S_2 → ... → S_N, where each S_i is a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: find the number of arrays of N sets such that their multiset of sets can be arranged into a chain according to the child relation.\n\nBut since the arrays are considered different if any index's set is different, regardless of rearrangement, we need to count all possible arrays where the sets can be ordered into such a chain.\n\nSo the approach is to consider the possible chains of sets and count all possible arrays that can form such a chain.\n\nBut considering the size of N and K, we need a mathematical way to compute this without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about what each set S must look like in the chain.\n\nEach S_i must be such that when ordered, S_1 is a child of S_2, S_2 is a child of S_3, etc.\n\nSo for S_i, it must be that for every x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum element in S_1 is less than or equal to the maximum element in S_2 minus 1, and so on. Or perhaps it's better to model each S_i as being contained within the next, but not necessarily.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to model each set as a bitmask, but with K up to 2e5, that's impossible directly.\n\nWait, perhaps each set can be represented by the set of elements it contains. For the child condition, S must be a subset of T minus 1 for each element in S. Wait, no—because for each x in S, x+1 must be in T. So T must contain all x+1 for x in S.\n\nBut S can have elements that are not present in T. Like, if T has {2}, then S can't have 1 because 1+1=2 is in T. So if S contains 1, then T must contain 2.\n\nWait, the other way around: S is a child of T if S is a subset of T's elements minus one. Or perhaps not exactly, but for every x in S, x+1 is in T.\n\nSo for S to be a child of T, T must contain all x+1 for x in S.\n\nNow, the chain requires that S_1 is a child of S_2, S_2 is a child of S_3, and so on.\n\nSo S_1 ⊆ (S_2 - 1), but not exactly, because S_2 could have elements beyond what's needed. For example, S_2 could have 2 and 3, and S_1 could have 1 and 2. Then S_1 is a child of S_2 because 1+1=2 is in S_2 and 2+1=3 is also in S_2.\n\nHmm. So each S_i must be a subset of the next S_{i+1} minus 1, but perhaps not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal requirement is that for each x in S_i, x+1 is present in S_{i+1}.\n\nBut S_{i+1} can have elements not covered by S_i.\n\nSo, the chain of sets must be such that each set is built upon the previous, ensuring that for each element in the previous set, the next set has the next integer.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe each set in the chain can be characterized by the maximum element it contains.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum element in the chain is non-decreasing. Because S_1 can have x, which requires S_2 to have x+1. Then S_2 could have y, requiring S_3 to have y+1. But the maximum of S_1 is less than or equal to the maximum of S_2 minus 1, but perhaps that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, no. Suppose S_1 has elements 1 and 2, so S_2 must have 2 and 3. Then S_2's max is 3. S_3 must have 3 and 4, so its max is 4. So in this case, the maximum is increasing.\n\nAnother example: S_1 has {2}, so S_2 must have {3}. S_2 has {3}, so S_3 must have {4}, and so on. The max increases by 1 each time.\n\nBut what if S_1 is empty? Then S_2 can be any set, because the condition is trivially satisfied.\n\nWait, if S_1 is empty, then for all x in S_1 (which is none), x+1 is in S_2. So S_2 can be any set.\n\nSo the chain can start with any set, including empty.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the chain can have varying structures, but the critical point is that each set in the chain depends on the next.\n\nBut the problem is to count all possible arrays of N sets that can be arranged in such a way.\n\nAn alternative approach: think of the sets in the array as forming a sequence where each set is a child of the next. So the entire array, when sorted into the correct order, forms a chain where each step satisfies the child condition.\n\nBut the array can have any number of sets, as long as their combination allows for such an ordering.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of N-length sequences of sets where the sets can be arranged into a chain S_1 → S_2 → ... → S_N, meaning that each S_i is a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nWait, no. It's the other way around: the array is S_1, S_2, ..., S_N, but we can reorder them into S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N such that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nSo the original array's sets can be in any order, but they must be able to be rearranged into a chain where each is a child of the next.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to counting the number of multisets of N sets (allowing duplicates) such that the multiset can be arranged into a chain where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nWait, but the problem counts arrays, not multisets. So the order matters in the sense that the array is ordered, but the condition depends on whether a rearrangement exists.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find for each possible chain length m (but here m is N), the number of possible arrays that can be formed into such a chain.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative idea: for the chain S'_1 → S'_2 → ... → S'_N, each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nWe need to count the number of possible sequences [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N] such that there exists a permutation of this sequence into a chain satisfying the above condition.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the array can be any length, and the sets can be anything as long as they can be ordered into a chain.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's useful to model the problem using dynamic programming. Let's think about the process of building the chain step by step.\n\nEach step, we add a set S, and it must be a child of the previous set in the chain.\n\nWait, but the chain can be built in any order, but the array is a fixed sequence. So perhaps instead, the problem is to find the number of arrays where the sets can be arranged into a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting the number of possible tuples (s_1, s_2, ..., s_N) such that there exists a permutation p of [1..N] where s_p[i] is a child of s_p[i+1}.\n\nHmm, but how to count this without considering all permutations.\n\nAlternative approach: think about the possible configurations that the sets can have. For instance, each set in the chain must be a superset of the previous minus one.\n\nWait, perhaps each set in the chain can only have elements up to a certain maximum. For example, the first set can have a maximum of m, then the next must have a maximum of at least m+1, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, for a chain S_1 → S_2 → ... → S_n, the maximum element in S_i must be <= the maximum element in S_{i+1} - 1.\n\nWait, no. Because S_1 can have maximum m, S_2 must have m+1, but S_2 can also have larger elements, like m+2, but S_3 must have m+2 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum in each set is strictly increasing. Because for S_i to be a child of S_{i+1}, all elements x in S_i must have x+1 in S_{i+1}. So, the maximum x in S_i is at most the maximum in S_{i+1} minus 1.\n\nWhich would imply that the maximum in S_{i+1} is at least the maximum in S_i + 1.\n\nSo the maximum elements in the chain must form a non-decreasing sequence, but each step increases by at least 1.\n\nWait, no. Because if S_i has a maximum m, then S_{i+1} must have m+1, but it can have higher elements as well. So the maximum of S_{i+1} can be anything >= m+1.\n\nSo the maximum in the chain can increase by any amount as long as each step is >= previous +1.\n\nWait, but in the chain, the maximum can jump multiple steps. For example:\n\nS_1: max 2\n\nS_2: max 4 (so S_1's 2 is covered by S_2's 3, but S_2 could have 4. Then S_3 needs to have 5, etc.)\n\nSo the maximum can have jumps, but each step must be at least 1 more than the previous.\n\nWait, no, because the maximum of S_1 is 2, so S_2 must have 3 (since 2 is in S_1). So S_2's maximum can be 3, 4, 5, etc., as long as 3 is present.\n\nSo S_2 can have a maximum of 3, which is 2+1.\n\nOr S_2 could have a maximum of 5, which is 2+3.\n\nSo the maximum can increase by any amount, but each step must include the next integer after the previous maximum.\n\nSo the maximum in S_{i} is m, then S_{i+1} must have m+1, but can have higher elements.\n\nThus, for a chain of sets, the maximums form a sequence m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where m_{i} >= m_{i-1} + 1.\n\nBut m_i can be larger than m_{i-1} + 1.\n\nSo the chain can have varying increases in maximum.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can model this with some dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the maximum elements in the chain.\n\nSuppose for a chain of length L, the maximum elements are m_1, m_2, ..., m_L, where m_1 <= m_2 -1, m_2 <= m_3 -1, etc. So the maximum can only stay the same or increase, but when it increases, it must be by at least 1.\n\nWait, no. Because if m_1 is 2, then m_2 must be at least 3, which is 2+1. So m_2 >= m_1 +1.\n\nSimilarly, m_3 >= m_2 +1 >= m_1 +2, and so on.\n\nThus, the maximum elements in the chain must form a strictly increasing sequence where each term is at least 1 greater than the previous.\n\nSo the maximums are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, where m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, and m_i >= m_{i-1} + 1.\n\nWait, no. Because if m_1 is 2, m_2 can be 3, which is 2+1, but m_3 can be 4, which is 3+1. Or m_3 could be 5, which is 3+2. So yes, m_i can be any value >= m_{i-1}+1.\n\nThus, the maximums can form a sequence where each step increases by at least 1.\n\nBut this complicates the modeling.\n\nAlternative idea: for a chain of length n, the maximums are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, with m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, and each m_i >= m_{i-1} +1.\n\nWait, no. Because m_1 could be 1, m_2 could be 3 (since 1+1 is 2, which is not present in m_2, but wait—no, the condition is that for each x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}.\n\nWait, if S_i has a maximum of m, then S_{i+1} must have m+1. So the maximum of S_{i+1} is at least m+1.\n\nBut the maximum can be higher, like m+2, etc.\n\nSo the maximum of the chain is a non-decreasing sequence, but each step increases by at least 1.\n\nSo for the chain, the maximums are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, and each m_{i} >= m_{i-1} + 1.\n\nWait, no. Because m_1 could be 0 (if the set is empty), but let's think about that.\n\nWait, the empty set S has no elements. So for S to be a child of T, it's automatically true because there are no elements x in S. So the empty set can be followed by any set.\n\nSo the chain can start with the empty set, followed by any set.\n\nSo the maximum can be 0 (if the set is empty) and then any value.\n\nWait, but in reality, the maximum is not really 0 because the elements are from 1 to K. So perhaps the maximum is considered as 0 when the set is empty.\n\nSo in the chain, the maximum starts at 0 (empty set), then next could be any m >= 1, then next any m' >= m+1, etc.\n\nBut this complicates things further.\n\nHmm. Another angle: for the chain S_1 → S_2 → ... → S_n, each set can be represented by the elements it contains, but the crucial thing is that for each x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}.\n\nThus, the chain must be such that the elements are \"progressing\" towards higher numbers.\n\nSo perhaps, for the chain, each set S_i can be thought of as containing some elements, but any element in S_i must be covered in S_{i+1} plus possibly others.\n\nBut modeling this is difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached combinatorially by considering the inclusion of certain ranges.\n\nFor example, suppose that the chain uses a certain maximum value M, and all the sets in the chain are subsets of [1, M]. Then, the maximum in the chain is M.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nWait, let's consider that the chain has a certain maximum M. Then, each set S_i in the chain must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., M}.\n\nMoreover, for the chain to be valid, each set must be such that for any x in S_i, x+1 is present in S_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for the entire chain, the maximum M must be such that all x in any S_i have x+1 <= M.\n\nWhich is naturally satisfied since M is the overall maximum.\n\nSo, for a given M, how many valid chains of length N can be formed where the maximum is M.\n\nThen, the total answer would be the sum over all M from 0 to K of the number of valid chains with maximum M.\n\nBecause each chain corresponds to a unique M, which is the maximum of the chain.\n\nWait, but M can be 0 (empty chain), but in our problem, the chain is of length N.\n\nWait, no. Each chain has N sets. So for M=0, the only possible set is the empty set. Thus, all sets in the chain must be empty, but that's allowed because the empty set is a child of itself.\n\nWait, the empty set is a child of any set, including itself. So in this case, all sets in the chain must be empty. So for M=0, the chain is just N empty sets.\n\nSo, for each possible M (from 0 to K), we can compute the number of chains of length N where all sets are subsets of [1..M], and for each i, S_i is a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to model for each M, the number of chains where the maximum is exactly M.\n\nSo the answer is the sum over M=0 to K of f(M), where f(M) is the number of chains of length N with maximum exactly M.\n\nThen, we can compute f(M) for each M and sum them up.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding f(M) for each M.\n\nHow to compute f(M)?\n\nFor a given M, the chain consists of N sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_N, each subset of [1..M], such that S_1 is a child of S_2, and so on.\n\nMoreover, for the maximum to be exactly M, there must exist at least one set in the chain that includes M.\n\nBecause otherwise, the maximum would be less than M.\n\nWait, no. Because M is the maximum of the chain, so at least one set in the chain must contain M. Otherwise, the maximum would be less than M.\n\nSo, for f(M), the chain must have at least one set with M, and all sets are subsets of [1..M].\n\nSo, f(M) can be computed as the number of chains of length N where all sets are subsets of [1..M], and at least one set contains M, and the chain satisfies the child condition.\n\nAlternatively, f(M) = (number of chains of length N with all sets subsets of [1..M]) - (number of chains where all sets are subsets of [1..(M-1)].\n\nSo, f(M) = g(M) - g(M-1), where g(M) is the number of chains of length N where all sets are subsets of [1..M], and the chain satisfies the child condition.\n\nIf we can compute g(M) efficiently, then f(M) can be found as the difference.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute g(M).\n\nWhat's g(M)? It's the number of chains of length N where each set is a subset of [1..M], and each consecutive set in the chain is a child of the next.\n\nSo, for each step, the next set must include all x+1 for x in the current set.\n\nWait, but the chain is a sequence of N sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_N where S_1 is a child of S_2, S_2 is a child of S_3, etc.\n\nSo, for each i, S_i is a subset of S_{i+1}'s x+1 for all x in S_i.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternative approach: model each possible set as a binary vector of size M bits. Then, for two sets A and B, A is a child of B if for every x in A, x+1 is in B.\n\nBut with M up to 2e5, this is not feasible for standard DP approaches.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we model the problem for each M as a state, and find a recurrence for g(M).\n\nBut perhaps we can find a generating function or a combinatorial formula for g(M).\n\nLet me think about the possible transitions between sets.\n\nEach set S can transition to any set T where T includes all x+1 for x in S.\n\nIn other words, T must be a superset of S's \"successors\"—the set {x+1 | x ∈ S}.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly a superset. Because T can have other elements, but it must include all x+1 where x is in S.\n\nSo, T can be any set that includes {x+1 | x ∈ S}, but can have other elements as well.\n\nSo, for a given set S, the possible next sets T are those that include all elements x+1 for x in S.\n\nBut how does this help us count the number of chains of length N?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible set S, the number of sets T that can follow S is the product of (some factors) based on S's elements.\n\nBut considering that K is up to 2e5, this approach is computationally infeasible.\n\nAlternative idea: for a given M, model the possible states as the subsets of [1..M], but group them based on their maximum element.\n\nLet me define for each possible maximum m in 0..M, the number of ways to reach a set with maximum m.\n\nWait, but since each transition requires that the next set's maximum is at least the previous set's maximum +1, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current maximum and the position in the chain.\n\nBut even that might not be manageable for large M.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each M, the maximum can vary, but for g(M), the maximum is allowed up to M.\n\nWait, perhaps for each M, the number of chains is the same as the number of chains where the maximum is at most M. So, perhaps the problem can be modeled using DP where dp[i][m] represents the number of chains of length i with maximum m.\n\nThen, for each i, dp[i][m] can be computed based on dp[i-1][m'] where m' < m.\n\nWait, let's think about this.\n\nFor dp[i][m], the number of chains of length i where the last set has maximum m.\n\nTo compute this, the previous set (at i-1) could have maximum m' where m' < m, and the next set must include m' + 1, which is m'' = m' + 1. So the new maximum is at least m''.\n\nBut wait, the next set can have a maximum higher than m'' as well.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: note that for a chain of sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_n, the maximum elements m_1, m_2, ..., m_n must satisfy m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, and each m_i >= m_{i-1} + 1.\n\nBecause each S_i must be a child of S_{i+1}, so S_i's maximum is m_i, and S_{i+1} must include m_i + 1, making m_{i+1} >= m_i + 1.\n\nSo the maximums form a strictly increasing sequence where each step is at least 1.\n\nSo for a chain of length n, the maximums can be any sequence m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n and m_{i} >= m_{i-1} +1.\n\nMoreover, the maximum of the entire chain is m_n, which can be up to K.\n\nSo, for a given maximum m, the number of possible maximum sequences ending at m is the number of ways to choose a sequence of n elements starting from some m_1, increasing by at least 1 each step, ending at m.\n\nSo, for each m, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of compositions of m - m_1 into n-1 steps, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to stars and bars. For example, the number of ways to choose m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n and m_i >= m_{i-1} + 1.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where each m_i >= m_{i-1} + 1. This can be transformed by letting a_i = m_i - (i-1). Then, a_1 can be 0, a_2 >= a_1 + 1 -1 = a_1, etc. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, for a chain of length n, the maximums can be seen as selecting n distinct integers where each is at least 1 more than the previous.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of such sequences of length n, ending at m.\n\nFor a given m, the number of sequences is equal to the number of ways to select a strictly increasing sequence of length n, starting at some a_1, such that a_1 + (n-1) <= m.\n\nWait, no. Because each step increases by at least 1.\n\nSo for example, for n=3 and m=5:\n\nPossible sequences:\n\n1,2,5\n\n1,3,5\n\n2,3,5\n\n1,2,4\n\n1,2,3\n\n1,3,4\n\n1,3,5\n\n2,3,4\n\n2,3,5\n\nEtc.\n\nWait, but perhaps the number of such sequences is C(m -1, n-1). Because we're choosing n-1 increments, each at least 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of sequences of length n with elements a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n, where each a_i >= a_{i-1} +1, is equal to C(m -1, n-1). Because you can model this as placing n-1 dividers in the m-1 possible gaps between 1..m.\n\nYes! Because each such sequence is determined by choosing positions to split the sequence, ensuring that each step is at least 1. So the number of such sequences is C(m-1, n-1).\n\nWait, for example, for n=2 and m=3: possible sequences are (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). So 3 sequences, which is C(3-1, 2-1) = C(2,1)=2. Wait, but that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, for m=3, n=2: the number of sequences is 3: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3. So C(m-1, n-1) is C(2,1)=2, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, so that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: for a given m and n, the number of sequences is the number of ways to choose n elements from [0, m-1], allowing any order as long as they are strictly increasing. Because each step must increase by at least 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of such sequences is equal to the number of ways to choose n-1 points among the m-1 possible steps, which is C(m-1, n-1). But that doesn't fit the earlier example.\n\nWait, in the example where m=3 and n=2, C(2,1)=2, but the actual count is 3. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is C(m-1 + n-1, n-1). Because each sequence can be viewed as choosing n elements with at least 1 increment between them.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the problem is similar to placing n items into m slots, with each item at least one apart.\n\nSo, the number of sequences is equal to C(m-1, n-1). Because we can model it as inserting n-1 separators between the m-1 possible gaps between 1..m.\n\nWait, but earlier example contradicts this. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps for n=2, m=3, the number of sequences is C(3-1, 2-1) = 2, but the actual count is 3. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me model the problem as follows: the sequence m_1, m_2, ..., m_n must satisfy m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, and each m_{i+1} >= m_i +1.\n\nSo, let’s perform a change of variables. Let d_i = m_i - m_{i-1} - 1, where m_0 is 0. Then, each d_i >=0.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right substitution. Alternatively, let’s define b_i = m_i - m_{i-1}, with m_0 =0. Then, each b_i >=1.\n\nSo the sum of b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n = m.\n\nBecause m = m_1 + (b_2) + (b_3) + ... + b_n, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. Because m_1 = b_1, m_2 = m_1 + b_2, ..., m_n = m_{n-1} + b_n.\n\nSo m_n = b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n.\n\nEach b_i >=1.\n\nSo the number of sequences is the number of ways to choose n positive integers that sum to m.\n\nWhich is C(m-1, n-1), because it's the number of compositions of m into n parts, each at least 1.\n\nAh! So for each m, the number of sequences is C(m-1, n-1).\n\nYes! So for m=3 and n=2: C(2,1)=2, but earlier I thought the count was 3. Wait, but what are the possible sequences for m=3, n=2?\n\nThey are (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). So 3 sequences. Which is not equal to C(2,1)=2.\n\nHmm, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in my substitution, each b_i >=1, so the sum is m = b_1 + ... + b_n.\n\nBut the number of such sequences is C(m-1, n-1). So for m=3 and n=2: C(2,1)=2, but actual count is 3.\n\nSo the formula is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is C(m-1, n-1) for the number of sequences, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, for m=3, n=2:\n\nThe possible sequences are:\n\n(1,2)\n\n(1,3)\n\n(2,3)\n\nThat's 3 sequences.\n\nC(m-1, n-1) = C(2,1)=2, which is less than 3.\n\nSo the formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is C(m, n-1). No, for m=3, n=2, that gives C(3,1)=3, which matches.\n\nWait, wait. Let me see:\n\nWait, for the substitution, the sum is m = b_1 + ... + b_n, with each b_i >=1.\n\nThe number of solutions is C(m-1, n-1). So for m=3, n=2: 3-1=2, n-1=1. C(2,1)=2, but the actual count is 3.\n\nSo that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is to count the number of sequences m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, and each m_{i+1} >= m_i +1.\n\nSo for m=3 and n=2, the possible sequences are:\n\n1,2 → 2 >=1+1=2 → yes.\n\n1,3 →3 >=1+1=2 → yes.\n\n2,3 →3 >=2+1=3 → yes.\n\nSo 3 sequences.\n\nSo the number is 3.\n\nBut according to the formula C(m-1, n-1), it's 2.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula is not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: for each m and n, the number of such sequences is C(m-1, n-1) + C(m-1, n-2). Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is C(m-1, n-1) + C(m-1, n-2) ?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is C(m-1 + n-1, n-1) ) ?\n\nBut for m=3, n=2: 3-1 +2-1=4 → C(4,1)=4, which is larger than 3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of sequences is equal to the number of ways to place n elements in m positions with each next element at least one more than the previous.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the problem of placing n non-overlapping intervals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using stars and bars with each step being at least 1.\n\nWait, for n steps, each step adding at least 1 to the previous, so the sum is m.\n\nSo the number of sequences is equal to the number of compositions of m into n parts, each at least 1.\n\nWhich is C(m-1, n-1).\n\nBut earlier example shows that this isn't matching.\n\nWait, for m=3, n=2: C(2,1)=2, but the actual count is 3.\n\nSo perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial substitution is wrong.\n\nLet me think differently: each sequence m_1, m_2, ..., m_n must satisfy m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, and m_{i+1} >= m_i +1.\n\nThis is equivalent to m_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i, where a_j >=1.\n\nWait, no. Because m_1 = a_1, m_2 = a_1 + a_2, etc. But that would require a_j >=1 for each j.\n\nBut then, m_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n.\n\nBut the sum a_1 + ... + a_n = m_n.\n\nBut the sum a_1 + ... + a_n must equal m_n.\n\nBut since each a_j >=1, the sum is at least n.\n\nSo m_n >=n.\n\nSo for m=3 and n=2, a_1 + a_2=3.\n\na_1 >=1, a_2 >=1.\n\nPossible (a_1, a_2) pairs:\n\n(1,2), (2,1).\n\nWait, but m_1 = a_1, m_2 = a_1 + a_2.\n\nSo for (1,2), m_1=1, m_2=3.\n\nFor (2,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of arrays of sets that can be rearranged into a chain where each set is a child of the next. The solution involves combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Child Condition**: A set \\( A \\) is a child of set \\( B \\) if every element \\( x \\) in \\( A \\) has \\( x+1 \\) in \\( B \\). This implies that the maximum element in each subsequent set must be at least one more than the previous set's maximum.\n\n2. **Combinatorial Insight**: For a given maximum value \\( M \\), the number of valid chains of length \\( N \\) where the maximum elements form a strictly increasing sequence can be computed using combinatorial methods.

We maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid ways to form a chain of length `i`.
