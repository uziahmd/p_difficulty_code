The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. The goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the keys. Each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by only one key.\n\nHmm, the condition for a key j to unlock chest i is that a_i + b_j is odd. So that means one must be even and the other odd. Because even plus odd is odd, right?\n\nSo, to rephrase: For a chest to be unlocked by a key, the sum of their values must be odd. That implies that one is even and the other is odd.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because 1 + 2 is 3, which is odd. So yes, a_i and b_j must be of opposite parity.\n\nSo the approach here is to figure out how many even and odd keys there are, and similarly for the chests, and then pair them in the best way possible.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll need to count:\n\n- Number of even a's (a_even)\n- Number of odd a's (a_odd)\nSimilarly for the b's:\n- Number of even b's (b_even)\n- Number of odd b's (b_odd)\n\nBecause a key can only unlock a chest if they are of opposite parity. So for example, an even a can be unlocked by an odd b, and an odd a can be unlocked by an even b.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests we can open would be the sum of the minimums between the available even a's and odd b's, and the available odd a's and even b's.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nFor example, suppose we have:\n\na_even = x\na_odd = y\n\nb_even = p\nb_odd = q\n\nThen, the maximum number of pairs is min(x, p) + min(y, q). Because each even a needs an odd b, and each odd a needs an even b.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd elements in a.\n2. Count the same for b.\n3. The result is the sum of min(a_even, b_odd) and min(a_odd, b_even).\n\nBut wait, what about the order? Like, maybe sometimes taking some from one pair affects the other. But since we're taking the minimum, it's already optimal because any other combination would not yield a higher sum.\n\nFor example, if a_even is 3, b_odd is 5: we take 3, all of a_even. Then a_odd is 2, b_even is 4: we take 2, but wait, maybe b_even has 4, so it's enough.\n\nWait, no. Because after taking min(3,5)=3, then a_odd is 2, and b_even is 4. So min(2,4) is 2. So total is 5.\n\nAlternatively, if I took less from the first, but more from the second, would that give a better total? No, because 3+2 is 5, and any other distribution like 2+2 would be 4, which is worse.\n\nSo yes, taking the sum of the two minima is the optimal approach.\n\nSo, the steps are clear.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen read the a array and the b array.\n\nCompute for a:\n\na_even = number of even numbers in a.\na_odd = n - a_even.\n\nSimilarly, compute for b:\n\nb_even = number of even in b.\nb_odd = m - b_even.\n\nThen compute:\n\nmax_chests = min(a_even, b_odd) + min(a_odd, b_even)\n\nAnd output max_chests.\n\nWait, but what about when there are more keys than needed? Like, for example, if a has 10 even, and b has 100 odd. Then a_even is 10, so only 10 keys (odd) are used. The rest are unused.\n\nWhich is correct, as each key can be used once.\n\nSo the logic holds.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\na array: [9,14,6,2,11]\n\nEven a's: 14,6,2 → 3 even.\n\nOdd a's: 9,11 → 2.\n\nb array: 8,4,7,20.\n\nEven b's: 8,4,20 → 3.\n\nOdd b's:7 →1.\n\nSo min(3,1) is 1.\n\nmin(2,3) is 2.\n\nTotal 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample 2:\n\n5 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their values have opposite parity (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Values**: First, count the number of even and odd values in both the chests and the keys.\n2. **Calculate Pairing Possibilities**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the number of valid pairs between even and odd values from the chests and keys. Specifically:\n   - Even chests can be unlocked using odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be unlocked using even keys.\n3. **Sum of Minimums**: Compute the sum of the minimum counts of these valid pairs. This gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, m = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr +=2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr +=n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+m]))\n    \n    a_even = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    a_odd = n - a_even\n    \n    b_even = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    b_odd = m - b_even\n    \n    res = min(a_even, b_odd) + min(a_odd, b_even)\n    print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of values on the chests `a`, and the list of values on the keys `b`.\n- **Counting Evens and Odds**: We count how many even numbers are present in both lists `a` and `b`. The remaining numbers are odd.\n- **Calculating Maximum Pairs**: Using the counts of even and odd values, we determine the maximum number of valid pairs where an even chest uses an odd key and an odd chest uses an even key.\n- **Output Result**: The result is the sum of these valid pairs, which is printed as the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked using the given keys, leveraging simple counting and arithmetic operations for optimal performance.",
