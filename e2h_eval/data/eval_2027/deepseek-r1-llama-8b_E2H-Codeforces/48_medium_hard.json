He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but if the second part of a door is 'R', then it's using Roman numerals instead of a normal base. Hmm, let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the input has two lines. The first line is a and b, where b can be R. The second line is c in base a, which could be a very long string. My task is to output c in base b, but if the second part was R, then we have to represent it as a Roman numeral.\n\nWait, right. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then the output should be in Roman numerals. Otherwise, output the number in base b as a string.\n2. Read the number c which is in base a. It can have leading zeros but shouldn't be zero itself.\n3. Convert c from base a to an integer value.\n4. Then, if the second part is R (i.e., we're dealing with Roman numerals), convert that integer to a Roman numeral string. Otherwise, convert it to base b and output without leading zeros.\n\nBut wait, how do I know whether to use Roman numerals or base b? Oh, because in the input, the second line's second part is either a number or R. So for each test case, I have to check whether the second part is R or not.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the input is given as the first line being a and b, and the second line is c in base a. But in the problem statement, the second part is either an integer b or R. So the second part is part of the door's setup, which affects how to interpret the number.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe door's second part is either an integer b or R. So, when the second part is R, it means that the number is represented in Roman numerals, regardless of what a and b are. Or wait, perhaps not. Wait, the problem says: \"the second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R.\" So, the second part is either b or R.\n\nSo, the door's setup is determined by the second part. So for each door, the second part tells us how to process the number. So, the second part is either b (as an integer) or R (which implies using Roman numerals).\n\nWait, but the first line gives a and b, so perhaps the second part is either the same as the first part's b or R. Because the problem says, \"Shapur found out the secret behind the locks. c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system used only in the Roman empire.\"\n\nAh, so the second part of the door is either b (as an integer) or R. So, the door's second part is either the base b or R, which determines how to interpret c.\n\nWait, I think I get it now. So for each door, the second part is either an integer (b) or R. So, for example, if the second part is 2, then c is converted to base 2. If it's R, then c is converted to a Roman numeral.\n\nBut in the problem, the input is such that the first line gives a and b, and the second line gives c in base a. Wait, perhaps the second part of the door is the second part of the input line. For example, the input format is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\n\nSo, for each test case, after reading a and b, we read c in base a. Then, for each digit in c, we need to consider whether the second part is R or not. Wait, no. Maybe the second part is the second token in the input line. Like, the first line is a and b, and the second line is c and s, where s is either a number or R.\n\nWait, looking at the example input:\n\nSample Input:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nEach line seems to have two parts separated by a space. So the first line is a=10, b=2. The second line is c='1' and s='16 R'? No, wait, the sample shows that the first line is '10 2\\n1'—so the first line is a=10, b=2. The second line is '16 R\\n5'—so c is '16' and s is 'R'.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, for each test case, the second line is c and s, where s is the representation of the number in base b or R. Or wait, no, perhaps s is the base in which to represent the number. So, the second part of the door determines whether the conversion is to base b or to Roman numerals.\n\nWait, perhaps the second part is the target base or R. So, for each test case:\n\n- Read a and b. If b is R, then the number must be converted into Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the processing steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is 'R', then the output will be a Roman numeral. Else, output as base b.\n\n2. Read the number c in base a. It can have leading zeros but is non-zero.\n\n3. Convert c from base a to an integer.\n\n4. If b is 'R', then convert the integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\n5. Else, convert the integer to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, one of the cases is:\n\nInput:\n['2 2\\n1111001']\n\nWhich means a=2, b=2. Since b is not R, convert c=1111001 (base 2) to base 2. Which is just 1111001, but leading zeros are omitted, so the output is 1111001.\n\nAnother sample input is ['12 13\\nA'], which implies a=12, b=13, and c is 'A'. So, since b is 13, we need to convert 'A' from base 12 to base 13. Wait, but 'A' in base 12 is 10. So in base 13, it's still 10, which is represented as 'A' as well. So the output is 'A'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each test case, read a and b. Check if b is 'R'. If yes, process as Roman numeral. Else, process as base b.\n\n- Read c in base a. Convert to integer.\n\n- Depending on b, output accordingly.\n\nNow, the main challenges are:\n\n1. Converting a string in base a to an integer.\n\n2. Converting an integer to Roman numerals.\n\n3. Converting an integer to a base b string, without leading zeros.\n\nLet's tackle each part.\n\nFirst, converting a base a string to an integer.\n\nThis is straightforward. We'll iterate through each character in the string, multiply the current total by a and add the value of the current digit.\n\nBut note that the digits in base a can go up to a-1. So, each character in the string must be a valid digit for base a.\n\nWe need to handle uppercase and lowercase letters, but probably the input is all uppercase. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per the examples, so perhaps it's better to process each character correctly.\n\nWait, the problem says that c is given in base a, which can have letters. For example, in the sample input, one of the cases is 'A' in base 12.\n\nSo, when a is greater than 10, the digits can include letters A-Z (uppercase). So, when converting from base a, each character is mapped to its corresponding value. For example, 'A' represents 10, 'B' 11, etc.\n\nSo, for a base a, the digits allowed are 0 to a-1, but the letters are treated as their numerical values starting from 10.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input c may have leading zeros but is not zero itself. So, we have to process the string correctly.\n\nImplementing this in code:\n\nWe can create a helper function to convert a string in base a to an integer.\n\nNow, for the integer to Roman numeral conversion.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because Roman numerals have specific rules for subtraction and additive forms.\n\nWe need to generate the correct Roman numeral based on the integer value.\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of tuples representing the value and corresponding Roman numeral, ordered from largest to smallest. For values up to 300010, the maximum needed is up to 3999, but wait, no. The problem says that in the case where the number is represented in Roman numerals, it's less than or equal to 300010. Wait, but when you convert to Roman numerals, the maximum possible is 300010, which is way beyond what standard Roman numerals can represent. So, how to handle that?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects that when the door's second part is R, the number is converted into Roman numerals as per the rules described, even for larger numbers.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\" So, the maximum number to convert is 300010.\n\nSo, I need to implement a function that converts numbers up to 300010 into Roman numerals, following the rules.\n\nThe standard approach for Roman numerals works up to 3999, but for higher numbers, we need to adjust.\n\nSo, the standard approach is to use a list of values and their Roman representations, including those for subtractive combinations beyond 1000, like 400 (CD), 900 (CM), etc.\n\nSo, the list will include:\n\n[\n(1000, 'M'),\n(900, 'CM'),\n(500, 'D'),\n(400, 'CD'),\n(100, 'C'),\n(90, 'XC'),\n(50, 'L'),\n(40, 'XL'),\n(10, 'X'),\n(9, 'IX'),\n(5, 'V'),\n(4, 'IV'),\n(1, 'I')\n]\n\nWait, but this list goes up to 1000. For numbers beyond 1000, we can add M's.\n\nFor example, 2000 is 'MM', 3000 is 'MMM', etc.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Create a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from largest to smallest.\n\n- Iterate over each pair, subtracting the value from the number as many times as possible, appending the corresponding symbols each time.\n\n- Continue until the number is reduced to zero.\n\nThis approach should work for numbers up to 300010.\n\nLet me test this logic with an example.\n\nFor 3999, the correct Roman numeral is 'MMMCMXCIX'.\n\nUsing the list above:\n\nStart with 1000: MMM (subtract 3000, remaining 999)\nThen 900: CM (subtract 900, remaining 99)\nThen 90: XC (subtract 90, remaining 9)\nThen 9: IX (subtract 9, done). So 'MMMCMXCIX'.\n\nAnother example: 400 is 'CD'.\n\nAnother example: 201 = 'CCI' → no, wait, 200 is 'CC', 1 is 'I', so 'CCI'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the algorithm should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nNext, handling the base conversion.\n\nConverting an integer to a string in base b, without leading zeros.\n\nWe can do this by repeatedly dividing the number by b and collecting the remainders. However, we need to handle the case when the number is zero, but according to the problem statement, the number is non-zero.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. If the number is zero, return '0' (but the problem says it's not zero, so this is unnecessary).\n\n2. Else, while the number is greater than zero:\n\n   a. Take the remainder when divided by b. This is the current digit.\n\n   b. Prepend this digit to the result.\n\n   c. Divide the number by b, integer division.\n\n3. The digits collected are the digits of the number in base b, from least significant to most. So, we need to reverse them.\n\nBut also, we have to make sure that the digits are represented correctly for bases higher than 10. For digits >=10, we use letters A-Z, where A is 10, B is 11, etc.\n\nSo, for a base b, each digit is represented as follows:\n\ndigit < 10 → str(digit)\n\ndigit >=10 → chr(ord('A') + (digit -10))\n\nBut the input can have letters like 'A' which represent 10 in base a.\n\nSo, in the code, for the base b conversion, we have to map each digit (0-9, A=10, B=11, etc.) to the correct character.\n\nWait, but the base conversion function is for outputting the number in base b, which can be any base between 2 and 25.\n\nSo, for example, if b is 16, the digit 15 is represented as 'F'.\n\nSo, in the helper function, for each digit in the number, we have to map it to the corresponding character.\n\nBut wait, the function to convert the integer to base b's string requires that each digit is represented as a single character. So, for numbers in base b, each digit is 0 <= d < b.\n\nSo, for d in 0-9: represent as '0'-'9'\n\nFor d >=10: represent as 'A'-'Z' (for 10-35, since b can be up to 25, so 25-1=24 is the max digit, which is 'O').\n\nSo, in code, for a digit value d:\n\nif d < 10: str(d)\n\nelse: chr(ord('A') + (d - 10))\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps for the code.\n\nRead a and b from the first line.\n\nCheck if b is 'R' (case-sensitive?), but in the input, it's either 'R' or a number.\n\nWait, the problem says that only b may be replaced by R. So, the second part is either a number or R.\n\nWait, no. Looking back: \"Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\"\n\nSo, the first line's second part is b, which may be R. So, in the first line, the second token can be 'R' or a number.\n\nSo, in the code, after splitting the first line, the second token is b, which is either 'R' or an integer.\n\nSo, the code needs to read a and b, where b can be 'R' or a number.\n\nSimilarly, the second line's second token is s, which is either a number or R.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second line is the number c in base a, and the second token is s, which is either a number or R.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample input line, it's '10 2\\n1' → a=10, b=2.\n\nSecond line is '16 R\\n5' → c is '16', s is 'R'.\n\nThird line is '5 R\\n4' → c is '5', s is 'R'.\n\nFourth line: '2 2\\n1111001' → c is '1111001', s is '2'.\n\nFifth line: '12 13\\nA' → c is 'A', s is '13'.\n\nSo, for each test case, the second line is c followed by s. And s is either a number (like 2, 13) or R.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the second part is either an integer or R. So, the second token in the second line is s, which is either a number or R.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\n- Read a and b (from first line). b can be 'R' or a number.\n\n- Read c and s (from second line). s can be 'R' or a number.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a, which may contain leading zeros. So, the second line is c, which is a string in base a. The rest of the line is irrelevant. So, perhaps the second line is c plus other stuff, but in the code, we need to extract c correctly.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input, each line has the form \"x y\\nz\", where x is the first part, y is the second part, and z is c.\n\nSo, for each line, it's a two-part string, split by \\n. So, for the second line, it's [c_part, rest]. But in the sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → c is '16', and the rest is ' R\\n5'?\n\nNo, that can't be right. Because the second line is the number c in base a. So, perhaps the entire line is the number c in base a, possibly containing spaces? No, because in the sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → perhaps it's a typo and the actual c is '16 R' and the rest is '\\n5'? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that the second line is a single string, which is c in base a. So, the entire line is c, but in the sample input, the lines are formatted as \"something\\nsomething_else\". So, perhaps in the code, for each test case, the second line is read, and the entire line is considered as c, ignoring any newlines.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the sample input. For example, the first sample's second line is '16 R\\n5', which suggests that the c is '16 R' and the rest is '5'? That can't be, because '16 R' is not a valid base 10 number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second line is read as the entire string, stripping any newlines. So, in the code, for each test case, read the second line, and take everything except the newline as c.\n\nYes, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read the first line, split into a_str and b_str. a is int(a_str), b is b_str.\n\n   But wait, no. Because in the first line, it's a and b, where b can be 'R'. So, the first line is a and b, which can be 'R'.\n\n   So, a = int(a_str), b = b_str.\n\n   So, if b_str is 'R', then output in Roman numerals; else, output in base b.\n\n2. Read the second line, strip any leading/trailing whitespace, and take everything except the newline as c_str.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → c_str is '16 R' ?\n\nWait, but '16 R' is not a valid number in base 10. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a, but it's given as a string that may contain spaces, but the code should treat it as the entire string, ignoring any spaces.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\nSo, the second line is a single string c, which is in base a.\n\nSo, in code, read the entire second line, strip any whitespace, and that's c_str.\n\nSo, for the sample input:\n\nSecond line is '16 R\\n5' → c_str is '16 R' ? Or is it '16'?\n\nNo, because in the sample input, the output for that case is 'V'. Let's see:\n\nIn the first sample input, the first test case is a=10, b=2.\n\nSecond line is '16 R\\n5' → c_str is '16 R'.\n\nWait, that would be invalid for base 10. So, perhaps the problem statement is that the second line is c in base a, and the rest of the line is irrelevant.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should read the entire second line as c_str, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, and ignoring any internal whitespace.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5', which would become '16 R' as c_str. But that's not a valid number in base 10. So, something's wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second line is the number c in base a, and the rest is ignored. So, perhaps the code should read the entire line, and take the part before the first space as c_str.\n\nBut in the sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → perhaps the code reads the part before the first space as '16', and ignores the rest.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is 'V', which suggests that c is '16' in base 10, which is 16 in decimal. Then, since b is 2, the output is 16 in base 2, which is '10000', but the sample output is 'V'. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's look at the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first test case is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nLooking at the first test case:\n\na=10, b=2.\n\nSecond line is '16 R\\n5' → c is '16 R' ? Or is it '16'?\n\nIf c is '16 R', then converting from base 10 to base 2 would be 16 in base 10 is 10000 in binary. But the output is 'V', which is 5 in base 2? No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\n\nSo, the second line is c in base a. So, the entire second line is c.\n\nSo, for the first sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → c is '16 R'?\n\nBut '16 R' is not a valid integer in base 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should read the entire line, strip any leading/trailing whitespace, and take all characters except the newline as c.\n\nSo, for the first sample's second line, the c_str is '16 R\\n5' → but that's not a valid number.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the second line is c in base a, and any other parts of the line are not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should read the entire second line as c, ignoring any other content. So, in the sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → c is '16 R\\n5', but that's not a valid number.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe the sample input is presented differently. Let me look at the sample input again.\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nOutput\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nSo, for the first test case, a=10, b=2.\n\nc is '16 R\\n5' → but that's not a valid base 10 number. So, perhaps the code is supposed to read the entire second line, but only consider the part before any spaces or newlines.\n\nWait, perhaps the second line is c, and the rest is ignored.\n\nSo, in code, for the second line, read the entire line, and take the first part until the first non-digit (or non-alphanumeric) character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should split the second line into tokens, and take the first token as c.\n\nSo, for the second line '16 R\\n5', the first token is '16', and the rest is 'R\\n5'.\n\nThat would make sense. Because in the first sample test case, c is '16' in base 10, which is 16 in decimal.\n\nSince b is 2, the output is 16 in base 2, which is 10000. But the sample output is 'V', which is 5 in base 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the test case analysis.\n\nWait, in the first test case, the second line is '16 R\\n5'. So, the code would read c as '16 R' and s as '5'? Or perhaps c is '16' and s is 'R'?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Because in the problem statement, the second part is either an integer or R.\n\nWait, the problem says that the first line's second part is b, which can be R. The second line's second part is s, which is the representation of the number in base b or R.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong. The second line is c in base a, and the second part is s, which can be R or a number. So, for each test case, s is the target representation.\n\nWait, no. Re-reading the problem statement:\n\nThe first line is a and b. The second line is c in base a.\n\nThe problem says: \"to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire.\"\n\nSo, the second part is about how to write c. So, for each door, the second part is either the base b or R. So, the door's second part is either b or R.\n\nThus, the second line's second part is s, which is either R or a number. So, for each test case:\n\n- Read a and b.\n\n- Read c in base a.\n\n- Determine whether to output c in base b or in Roman numerals, based on whether b is R.\n\nSo, the second line's second token is s, which is either R or a number. So, in code:\n\nAfter reading the first line, a and b are known.\n\nRead the second line, split into two parts: c_str and s_str.\n\ns_str can be 'R' or a number.\n\nThus, the processing is:\n\nif s_str is 'R', then output c in Roman numerals.\n\nelse, output c in base b.\n\nSo, in the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2.\n\nc_str is '1' → which is 1 in base 10.\n\ns_str is '16 R\\n5' → which is '16 R' (assuming the rest is ignored) → no, wait, the second part is '16 R\\n5' → perhaps s_str is '16 R\\n5' → but that's not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the second part is only the second token of the second line.\n\nSo, for the second line, it's split into two parts: c_str and s_str. So, in the first test case, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → c_str is '16 R' and s_str is '5'.\n\nBut then, s_str is 5, which is a number. So, output c in base b=2.\n\nWait, but c is '16 R' in base 10. How do I parse that?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Perhaps the problem statement has a typo in the sample input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second line is read as a single string, and the entire string is c, ignoring any newlines or spaces.\n\nSo, for the first test case, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → c_str is '16 R\\n5'.\n\nBut then, in base 10, '16 R\\n5' is not a valid number.\n\nThis is not making sense. I think perhaps the sample input is misrepresented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second line is c in base a, and the rest of the line is irrelevant. So, in code, c is read as the entire line, stripped of newlines.\n\nSo, for the first test case, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → c is '16 R\\n5'.\n\nBut that's not a valid number in base 10.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem statement is that the second line is c, which is a string that may consist of digits and letters, but the rest of the line is ignored.\n\nSo, in code, c_str is the entire second line, stripped of newlines and leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nThus, for the first test case, c_str is '16 R\\n5' → which is invalid.\n\nBut that can't be, because the sample output is 'V', which is 5 in base 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should read the second line as c, but any non-digit/non-letter characters are ignored.\n\nSo, in the first test case, c_str is '16 R5'.\n\nBut that's still not a valid number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second line is c in base a, and the rest of the line is ignored. So, in the first test case, c is '16' in base 10, and the rest is ' R\\n5' → which is ignored.\n\nSo, c is 16, and since b is 2, output 16 in base 2, which is 10000. But the sample output is 'V', which is 5.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to process each test case as per the sample.\n\nSample Test Case 1:\n\nInput line 1: 10 2 → a=10, b=2.\n\nInput line 2: 16 R\\n5 → c is '16 R\\n5' ?\n\nBut in base 10, that's invalid. So, perhaps the code is supposed to read the entire second line, and treat it as c, but ignore any non-digit characters.\n\nSo, c_str is '16 R5' → which is '16 R5' in base 10, which is 16*10^2 + 5 = 165.\n\nBut then, converting 165 to base 2 is 10100101, which is 8 digits, but the sample output is 'V' which is 5.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read the second line as c, and any spaces or newlines are ignored. So, for the first test case, c_str is '16 R5', which is invalid.\n\nI think I'm stuck on this part. Let's try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the second line is read as c, and any non-digit and non-letter characters are ignored. So, for the first test case, c_str is '16 R5' → but that's not a valid number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second line is split into two parts, where the first part is c, and the second is s.\n\nSo, for each test case, the second line is split into c_str and s_str, with s_str being either R or a number.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsecond_line = input().strip()\n\nparts = second_line.split()\n\nc_str = parts[0]\n\ns_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n\nSo, for the first test case:\n\nsecond_line is '16 R\\n5' → split into ['16', 'R'] → c_str is '16', s_str is 'R'.\n\nAh, that makes sense!\n\nBecause in the sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5' → when split(), it becomes ['16', 'R', '5']? Or does the split() method split on any whitespace, including newlines?\n\nWait, no. The split() method splits on whitespace, so in the string '16 R\\n5', the split() would produce ['16', 'R', '5'].\n\nSo, parts[0] is '16' → c_str is '16' → which is 16 in base 10.\n\ns_str is parts[1], which is 'R' → so output in Roman numerals.\n\nSo, for the first test case, c is 16 in base 10 → 16 → in Roman numerals, 16 is XVI.\n\nBut the sample output is 'V', which is 5. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, no. Because the second part is R, which indicates that the number should be represented in Roman numerals. So, c is 16, which is XVI in Roman numerals. But the sample output is 'V' → which is 5.\n\nSo, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in processing the second line.\n\nWait, perhaps the second line is c in base a, and s is the second part of the door's setup. So, s is either R or a number, which determines whether to output in Roman or base b.\n\nSo, in the first test case:\n\na=10, b=2.\n\nc is '16 R\\n5' → but that's not a valid number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second line's s is the second part of the door's setup, which is either R or a number, and the c is the rest of the line.\n\nSo, for the first test case:\n\nThe second line is '16 R\\n5' → s is 'R', so output in Roman numerals.\n\nc is '16\\n5' → which is 16 in base 10.\n\n16 in Roman is XVI.\n\nBut sample output is 'V' → which is 5.\n\nWait, this isn't adding up.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with writing the code, assuming that the second line is split into c_str and s_str, and s_str is either R or a number.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    a, b = input().split()\n\n    a = int(a)\n\n    if b == 'R':\n\n        roman_mode = True\n\n    else:\n\n        roman_mode = False\n\n    c_line = input().strip()\n\n    parts = c_line.split()\n\n    c_str = parts[0]\n\n    s = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n\n    # Now, process c_str as a number in base a.\n\n    # Convert c_str to integer.\n\n    # Then, depending on roman_mode, output in Roman or base b.\n\nSo, in the first test case, c_str is '16', s is 'R' → output in Roman numerals.\n\n16 in Roman is XVI.\n\nBut sample output is 'V' → which is 5.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the second line is the c in base a, and the s is the second part of the door's setup, which is either R or a number. So, the door's second part is either R or a number, which determines how c is processed.\n\nWait, perhaps the second line is c in base a, and the s is the second part of the door's setup.\n\nSo, for each door, the second part is either R or a number. Thus, for each door, the processing is:\n\nif second part is R → output c as Roman numerals.\n\nelse → output c in base b.\n\nSo, the second line is c in base a. The first line's second part is b, which can be R.\n\nThus, the second line's second part is s, which is either R or a number.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\nRead a and b (b can be R or a number).\n\nRead c in base a.\n\nProcess c:\n\nif b is R → output c as Roman numerals.\n\nelse → output c in base b.\n\nSo, the code should read the first line, then the second line.\n\nIn the sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2 → not R.\n\nRead c in base 10 → '1' → 1.\n\nOutput 1 in base 2 → '1'.\n\nSample output is '1' → matches.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=10, b=R.\n\nRead c in base 10 → '16' → 16.\n\nConvert to Roman numerals → XVI.\n\nBut sample output is 'V' → which is 5.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the second line is s, and the first line is a and b. So, the code reads a and b, then reads s, and c is the rest.\n\nNo, that can't be.\n\nI think I'm stuck on the input parsing.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the second line is entirely s, and the first line is a and b.\n\nNo, that can't be because the second line is c in base a.\n\nI think the confusion comes from the sample input structure. So, perhaps the sample input is not accurately represented in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is not the actual input but just an example. So, perhaps the actual test cases have different structures.\n\nWell, perhaps for the purpose of writing the code, I can proceed with the assumption that the second line is c in base a, and the rest is irrelevant.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nRead a and b from the first line.\n\nRead c_str from the second line, stripping any newlines and leading",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to either another base `b` or Roman numerals, depending on the input. The solution involves reading the input values, parsing them, and then converting the number accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the first line to get bases `a` and `b`. The second line contains the number `c` in base `a` and an optional parameter `s` which can be either 'R' for Roman numerals or a number.\n2. **Determine Conversion Mode:** Check if `b` is 'R'. If it is, we will convert the number to Roman numerals. Otherwise, we will convert the number to base `b`.\n3. **Convert Base `a` to Integer:** Convert the given number `c` from base `a` to an integer.\n4. **Convert to Roman Numerals or Base `b`:** Depending on the conversion mode, either convert the integer to Roman numerals or to a string representation in base `b`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef base_b_str(number, base):\n    if number == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while number > 0:\n        remainder = number % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        number = number // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    for _ in range(5):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        first_line = input[idx].strip()\n        idx += 1\n        a, b = first_line.split()\n        a = int(a)\n        roman_mode = (b == 'R')\n        c_line = input[idx].strip()\n        idx += 1\n        parts = c_line.split()\n        c_str = parts[0]\n        s = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        # Convert c_str from base a to integer\n        c = 0\n        for ch in c_str:\n            if ch.isdigit():\n                c_val = int(ch)\n            else:\n                c_val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n            c = c * a + c_val\n        if roman_mode:\n            print(int_to_roman(c))\n        else:\n            print(base_b_str(c, int(b)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and split into lines. Each test case consists of two lines: one with bases `a` and `b`, and another with the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion Mode:** Determine if the number should be converted to Roman numerals or to another base by checking if `b` is 'R'.\n3. **Base `a` to Integer:** The function converts the string `c` from base `a` to an integer by iterating through each character and applying the base conversion rules.\n4. **Roman Numerals Conversion:** The integer is converted to a Roman numeral string using a lookup table that maps values to their corresponding Roman symbols.\n5. **Base `b` Conversion:** The integer is converted to a string representation in base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number and collecting remainders, then reversing the result to form the correct string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion requirements and ensures that the output is correctly formatted without leading zeros.",
