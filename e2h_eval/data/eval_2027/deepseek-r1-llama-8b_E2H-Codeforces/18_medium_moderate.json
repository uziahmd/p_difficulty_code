The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where a frog starts at position 0 and can jump either +a or -b each time. For each x from 0 to m, I need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without going outside [0, x]. Then, sum all these f(x) values.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand what's happening here.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible positions the frog can reach. The frog's movement depends on the steps it takes. Each step adds a or subtracts b. But wait, since the frog can't go beyond [0, x], when x increases, more positions become reachable.\n\nWait, but for each x, we have to calculate how many unique positions are reachable without stepping outside 0 and x.\n\nSo for each x, f(x) is the count of reachable positions in [0, x].\n\nBut calculating f(x) for each x up to m (which can be 1e9) directly is impossible because it's way too slow. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the nature of the jumps. Since a and b are positive integers, the frog can make various combinations of jumps. The key is to find all positions that can be reached by some combination of a and -b steps, without exceeding x.\n\nWait, but the frog can also make multiple jumps. So perhaps the problem is related to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Because, in number theory, the set of reachable positions forms an arithmetic progression once you've taken certain steps.\n\nRight! So, the minimal step that can be achieved is d = gcd(a, b). So any position that is a multiple of d is potentially reachable.\n\nBut wait, not exactly. Because the frog can only add a or subtract b. So the reachable positions are all numbers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position remains within [0, x].\n\nBut considering that, the frog's reachable positions can be represented as multiples of d, plus some offset.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem as: the frog can reach any position congruent to (initial position) modulo d. Since initial position is 0, all reachable positions are multiples of d.\n\nSo, for the frog, the reachable positions are all x such that x ≡ 0 mod d. But wait, no, because the frog can also move in the negative direction, but in the problem statement, the frog cannot go below 0. So the reachable positions are all non-negative integers that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, but without going negative.\n\nWait, but if a and b are such that a > b, then after some steps, the frog can reach various positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the reachable positions as the set S = {k*a - l*b | k, l ≥ 0, and the position is ≥0 and ≤ current x}.\n\nBut again, for each x, the set S varies. How can I model f(x)?\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find for each x the maximum reachable position, and then determine the number of reachable positions up to x.\n\nWait, but for x, the frog can jump as far as possible, but must stay within [0, x]. So the frog can make any number of a steps and any number of b steps, but not go beyond x.\n\nWait, but the frog can choose to stop making jumps as well, so the maximum reachable position could vary.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should consider the structure of the reachable positions.\n\nSince a and b are fixed, the frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients, but without going negative.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the reachable positions as follows: starting at 0, each step adds a or subtracts b. But since we can't go below 0, the frog can't perform a step that would take it into negatives.\n\nWait, but the frog can make a jump of -b only if k - b >= 0. So, for example, if the frog is at position k, it can jump to k+a (if k+a <=x) or to k-b (if k >= b).\n\nHmm. So the frog's movement is a bit constrained because it can't go below zero.\n\nBut for the purposes of calculating f(x), which counts all reachable positions up to x, perhaps the key is to find the maximum reachable position when x is large enough, and then model how f(x) grows as x increases.\n\nWait, for x less than some critical value, the frog can't make certain jumps. Once x reaches that critical value, the frog can make more jumps.\n\nSo maybe I should first find the point where the frog can reach as far as possible given the constraints, and then model the function f(x) in two parts: before this critical point, and after.\n\nLet me try to find the minimal x where the frog can reach the farthest possible point.\n\nWait, the frog can keep jumping a steps as long as it doesn't exceed x. So, the maximum position it can reach without any b steps is x, but if a is larger than x, it can't make any a steps beyond 0.\n\nAlternatively, if a is small enough, the frog can make multiple a jumps, but perhaps taking some b steps can allow it to reach higher positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and then beyond that x, the frog can reach every d (d = gcd(a,b)) steps.\n\nNo, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nThe frog's movement can be thought of as a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent possible jumps. The reachable nodes form a connected component, but due to the constraint of not going below 0, the graph isn't infinite.\n\nBut for the problem, we're interested in all the nodes reachable from 0 without stepping outside [0, x], for each x.\n\nNow, for each x, f(x) is the size of the reachable set from 0, within [0, x].\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of reachable positions in [0, x], and then summing those counts.\n\nBut for x up to 1e9, we can't compute each f(x) individually. So we need to find a pattern or formula that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the case when a and b are such that a and b are coprime (their gcd is 1). In this case, the frog can reach every position beyond a certain point, provided that x is large enough.\n\nWait, but even when a and b are coprimes, the frog can't reach every position because of the step constraints. Because each step is adding a or subtracting b, but the frog can't go below 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to find for each x, the earliest time when the frog can reach x, and then model how f(x) changes as x increases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function f(x) increases in steps. For x less than some critical value, f(x) is a certain function, and after that, it's another function.\n\nWait, perhaps the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and beyond that, every x+1 can add 1 to f(x+1) if possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function f(x) is equal to x+1 for all x beyond a certain point, but that's only possible if the frog can reach every position up to x, which might not always be the case.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the second sample, m is 1e9, a=1, b=2019.\n\nSo, the frog can make a step of +1 each time. So for any x, the frog can reach every position from 0 to x, because adding 1 each time.\n\nThus, f(x) = x+1, and the sum is sum_{i=0 to 1e9} (i+1) = (1e9)(1e9+3)/2, which is 500000001500000001, as per the sample.\n\nSo in this case, the function f(x) is x+1 for all x >=0.\n\nSo, the sum is easy to compute as (m+1)*(m+2)/2.\n\nAnother sample is when a=100, b=1, and m=100. Since the frog can't make any jumps beyond a certain point because adding a is 100, but the maximum x is 100. So the frog can't make any a steps (since 0+100=100 is allowed, but 100+100=200 exceeds x=100). So the frog can only make a single a step (to 100) or no steps, but then it can't make any other a steps. Also, since b=1, the frog can make steps of -1, but only if it's at least 1.\n\nWait, wait, let's see: the frog starts at 0. It can choose to make a step of +100, reaching 100. From there, it can make steps of -1 as long as it doesn't go below 0.\n\nSo, the frog can reach 100, and then 99, 98, ..., 0. So the reachable positions are all from 0 to 100, which is 101 positions. Thus, f(100)=101.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, in this case, f(x) increases to 101 when x is 100.\n\nSo, perhaps the function f(x) can be broken down into several intervals, each with a certain behavior, and we can compute the sum by handling each interval.\n\nHmm. So, the general approach might involve:\n\n1. Find the critical x where the frog can reach beyond that x, allowing for all further x to have f(x) increasing by 1 each step.\n\nWait, but that's only the case when a and b are coprime and certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be split into two parts:\n\n- The part where the frog can't reach x, so f(x) is determined by the maximum position it can reach.\n\n- The part where the frog can reach x, and beyond that, f(x) increases by 1 for each x until m.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the smallest x where the frog can reach x, and beyond that, all x' >=x will have f(x') = f(x) + (x' - x), but only if certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and from there, for every x >= this point, f(x) = x + 1.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because when a and b are such that the frog can't reach every position beyond a certain x, f(x) may not increase by 1 each time.\n\nBut wait, in the second sample, when a=1 and b=2019, the frog can reach every position from 0 to x. So f(x) =x+1.\n\nBut in cases where a and b are such that the frog can't reach every position, f(x) may not follow that.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to determine whether the frog can reach every position beyond a certain x.\n\nHow can I determine that?\n\nWell, the condition for the frog to be able to reach any position beyond some x is when the frog can make steps that cover all residues modulo d, where d = gcd(a, b).\n\nWait, but since the frog starts at 0, and each step adds a or subtracts b, the reachable positions are all multiples of d.\n\nSo, for the frog to reach every position beyond some x, the following must hold:\n\nOnce the frog can reach x, then for x+1, x+2, etc., it can reach them as well, possibly by using a combination of a and b steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the minimal steps required to reach certain points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and after that, the frog can also reach x+a, x+a- b, etc., without being blocked by the upper limit of x.\n\nWait, perhaps the critical x is when the frog can reach x, and x + a is greater than x, which is always true. So, perhaps the critical x is when the frog can reach x, and also, x + a can be reached.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because x is the upper limit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nAnother idea: the set of reachable positions is a superset of all positions that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is non-negative and <= current x.\n\nBut for each x, the reachable positions are the union of all positions reachable from 0 without stepping beyond x.\n\nWait, but how can I model this for all x up to m?\n\nPerhaps it's better to find for each x the maximum reachable position, and then determine how many reachable positions are there up to x.\n\nBut again, for x up to 1e9, we can't do this for each x.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nFind the point where the frog can reach any position beyond x, and for all x beyond that, f(x) = x+1.\n\nWait, but under what conditions is this true?\n\nIt's similar to the concept of \"covering\" all residues in the modulus system.\n\nSo, when d = gcd(a, b), the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d. So, the reachable positions are all x where x mod d == 0.\n\nBut wait, no, because the frog can also subtract b, which is equivalent to adding (-b) mod d.\n\nWait, since a and b are both multiples of d, adding a is adding d * (a/d), and subtracting b is adding d * ( (d - b/d) ) mod d.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, but also has certain properties based on a and b.\n\nSo, the reachable positions are all x such that x is a multiple of d, and x >= c for some c.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal position that can be reached beyond which all positions can be reached is when the frog can make a full cycle of steps, thus covering all possible residues mod d.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: find the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and then find how f(x) behaves beyond that.\n\nWait, perhaps the critical x is when the frog can reach x, and x + a is larger than x, meaning that the frog can make a jump beyond x, but then can come back.\n\nWait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the critical x is when the frog can reach x, and then also can reach x + a, which is beyond x, but then the frog can use the -b steps to reach x + a - b, which is x + (a - b). If a - b is positive, then x + a - b is larger than x, but that's only if a > b.\n\nHmm, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let's think about when a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = 1. So, the frog can reach every position beyond a certain x.\n\nWait, but that's not true because the frog can't make steps that decrease the position below zero.\n\nFor example, a=3, b=2. So d=1.\n\nThe frog can reach 0, 3, 5 (3+2), 6 (3*2), 8 (6+2), etc.\n\nBut it can't reach 1 or 2 unless it makes a certain combination of steps.\n\nWait, no, in this case, the frog can't reach 1 because a=3 and b=2. Let's see:\n\nStarting at 0.\n\nPossible jumps: 0+3=3, 0-2=-2 (invalid).\n\nFrom 3: can jump to 6 or 1 (3-2=1). So now, 1 is reachable.\n\nFrom 1: can jump to 4 (1+3) or -1 (invalid).\n\nFrom 4: can jump to 7 or 2 (4-2=2).\n\nFrom 2: can jump to 5 or 0.\n\nSo yes, in this case, the frog can reach 1, 2, etc.\n\nSo for a=3, b=2, the frog can reach every position >=0 once x is large enough.\n\nSo, for x beyond a certain point, f(x) =x+1.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find for each x whether it's in the region where the frog can reach every position beyond some x_c.\n\nIf that's the case, then for x >= x_c, f(x) =x+1, and for x <x_c, f(x) is something else.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x_c, and then compute the sum in two parts: x from 0 to x_c-1, and x from x_c to m.\n\nBut how to find x_c?\n\nWell, x_c is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and from x, it can make a step of a, which would be x +a, but since x +a is beyond x, but when x is increased to x+a, the frog can then make more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps x_c is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and x + a <= x + a <= x +a (but that's not helpful).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_c is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and the next step a can be made, and then from there, the frog can reach x + a, and from there, perhaps make a step of -b to reach x +a -b, and so on.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative idea: the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, the frog can make a step of a and then a step of -b, thus allowing the frog to reach x +a -b, which is x + (a -b). If a >b, this is larger than x, but if a <b, it's smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and the next steps allow it to reach x +a, which is beyond x, but then from there, it can reach x +a -b, which is x + (a -b). If a -b is positive, then this is larger than x, but then the frog can continue this process, adding a and subtracting b, thus effectively moving forward by (a -b) each time.\n\nBut for this to happen, a must be greater than b.\n\nWait, for example, if a=5, b=3, as in the first sample.\n\nThen, the frog can reach 5, then 8 (5+3), then 13 (8+5), etc. Each time, the frog can make a step of +5 and then +3, net gain of 8 per two steps.\n\nWait, but the sample shows that for x=7, the frog can reach 0, 3, 5, 6, 8 (but 8 is beyond 7, so not counted). So f(7) is 3, which is different.\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative plan: model the reachable positions as the set of all x such that x is a linear combination of a and b, and x >=0, and x <= current x.\n\nBut again, for each x, it's unclear.\n\nAnother idea: the set of reachable positions is the set of x such that x is >=0, x is congruent to 0 mod d, and x can be expressed as k*a - l*b, with k and l non-negative, and x >=0.\n\nBut how can I find the count of such x <= x_i?\n\nWait, but the problem requires the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x), where f(x) is the number of reachable x's <= current x.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution can be found by determining the earliest x where the frog can reach x, and beyond that, the function f(x) increases by 1 for each x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be split into two parts:\n\n1. For x up to some critical point, f(x) can be computed as the number of reachable positions, which is O(k), where k is the number of steps the frog can take.\n\n2. Beyond this point, f(x) increases by 1 each time.\n\nSo, the sum is the sum for x up to the critical point, plus the sum for x beyond, which is (m - critical_point +1) * (f(critical_point) + 1) / 2.\n\nWait, but how to find the critical point.\n\nMaybe the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and from x, it can make a step of a, which is x +a, and then from there, make a step of -b, leading to x +a -b.\n\nIf a > b, then this is x + (a -b), which is larger than x. So, if the frog can make such steps, it can reach x + (a -b), and then x + 2*(a -b), etc.\n\nThus, the frog can reach an unbounded number of positions beyond x, as long as a > b.\n\nSo, the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and from there, the frog can make a series of steps that allow it to reach x + k*(a -b) for any k >=0.\n\nIn this case, once the frog can reach x, it can reach x + a, which is x +a, and then from there, it can reach x +a -b, which is x + (a -b). If a -b is positive, then this is a new, larger position.\n\nSo, if a > b, the frog can reach an infinite number of positions, each (a -b) apart, beyond x.\n\nBut if a <=b, then a -b is zero or negative, so the frog can't make progress beyond x.\n\nThus, the critical point occurs when the frog can reach x, and a >b. Then, the frog can reach infinitely many positions beyond x, each (a -b) apart.\n\nBut how does this affect f(x)?\n\nWait, for x beyond the critical point, the frog can reach every position in the arithmetic sequence starting from x, with step (a -b), as long as a >b.\n\nSo, for each x beyond the critical point, the frog can reach x, x + (a -b), x + 2*(a -b), etc., as long as they are <=x.\n\nWait, no. Because x is the upper bound, the frog can't exceed x.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as the sum of f(x) for x from 0 to m.\n\nWe can find for each x, the number of reachable positions is s(x), and then sum s(x) for x=0 to m.\n\nBut for x up to 1e9, we can't compute s(x) for each x. So, we need to find a mathematical pattern or formula.\n\nLet me think about the structure of s(x):\n\ns(x) is the number of positions y in [0, x] that can be reached by a series of a and -b steps, starting from 0, without exceeding x during the process.\n\nSo, y can be written as y = k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the process, the frog never goes below 0 or above x.\n\nBut modeling this for each x is difficult.\n\nPerhaps, instead, I should model the maximum reachable position for a given x, and then compute the number of reachable positions as (max_reachable +1) / 2, or something like that.\n\nWait, but the frog can reach positions in a certain range, and the number of positions is not necessarily linear.\n\nAnother idea: for a given x, the set of reachable positions is the union of all positions reachable via any path without exceeding x. This is equivalent to the set of all positions y where y can be expressed as y = k*a - l*b, with y >=0, y <=x, and there exists a sequence of steps that leads to y without ever exceeding x.\n\nBut again, it's unclear how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum reachable position for x is min(x, k*a - l*b), where k and l are chosen to maximize k*a - l*b without exceeding x.\n\nBut finding this maximum for each x is challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum reachable position for x is the minimal between x and the maximum position reachable without considering x.\n\nWait, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nPerhaps, the problem can be split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: a > b.\n\nIn this case, the frog can eventually make steps that allow it to reach any x beyond a certain point.\n\nSo, for x beyond a certain threshold, f(x) =x +1.\n\nCase 2: a <= b.\n\nIn this case, the frog can't make progress beyond a certain point, so f(x) is limited.\n\nWait, but this is not accurate. For example, when a=3, b=2, which is a> b, the frog can reach every x beyond a certain point.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, a=5, b=3, which is a> b. And the sample shows that f(7)=8, which is more than 7. So, perhaps for x>= a certain point, f(x) increases by 1 each time.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Compute the earliest x where the frog can reach x, and from there, can make steps that allow it to reach x + (a -b), which is larger than x, thus enabling the frog to reach positions beyond x.\n\n2. For x >= this critical point, f(x) =x +1.\n\n3. For x < this critical point, f(x) is the number of positions reachable via a series of jumps, considering the constraints.\n\nSo, the sum would be the sum for x from 0 to critical_point-1 of f(x), plus the sum from x=critical_point to m of (x+1).\n\nBut how to find the critical point.\n\nWait, the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and from x, it can make a jump of a, which brings it to x +a. If x +a >x, which it always is, but then the frog can make a jump of -b from x +a to reach x +a -b. If a >b, then x +a -b is larger than x. So the frog can make a series of steps, each adding (a -b), which is positive.\n\nThus, the frog can reach x +k*(a -b) for any k >=0, as long as these positions are <=x.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if x +k*(a -b) <=x, which implies k=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and the next step after x is to make a jump of a, which would take it beyond x, but from there, it can make a jump of -b to reach x +a -b.\n\nIf a >b, then x +a -b is x + (a -b), which is larger than x if a >b.\n\nSo, if x is such that x +a -b <=x, then it's not useful. Wait, but a> b implies a -b>0, so x +a -b is larger than x.\n\nSo, in this case, from x, the frog can reach x +a, which is beyond x, but then from there, it can make a jump of -b to reach x +a -b, which is x + (a -b).\n\nIf a -b is positive, this is a new position beyond x.\n\nThus, the frog can reach x + (a -b), which is larger than x.\n\nSo, the frog can reach positions x, x +a, x +a -b, x +a -b +a, x +a -b +a -b, etc.\n\nEach of these steps is adding (a -b), which is positive, thus moving further away.\n\nThus, the frog can reach an infinite number of positions, each (a -b) apart, as long as a> b.\n\nThus, the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and from there, can make a series of jumps adding (a -b) each time, thus reaching x +k*(a -b) for any k >=0.\n\nSo, for x beyond this critical point, the frog can reach any position of the form x +k*(a -b), as long as they are <=x.\n\nWait, but that's not possible, because x +k*(a -b) can be larger than x.\n\nSo, perhaps the critical point is when the frog can reach x, and can reach x +a -b, which is beyond x, but then, for x' =x +a -b, the frog can make a jump of -b, reaching x' -b =x +a -b -b =x +a -2b.\n\nIf a -2b is positive, this is still larger than x.\n\nSo, the frog can reach x +a, x +a -b, x +a -2b, etc., as long as each step is allowed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: The minimal x where the frog can reach x, and then make a step of a, then a step of -b, leading to x +a -b, which is beyond x, thus allowing the frog to reach more positions beyond x.\n\nSo, the critical x is the minimal x such that x can be reached, and x +a -b can be reached (which is x + (a -b)), and a >b.\n\nSo, the critical x is the minimal x where x is reachable and x +a -b is also reachable.\n\nOnce this x is found, for all x' >=x, f(x') =x' +1.\n\nBut I'm not certain.\n\nSo, to proceed:\n\nFirst, find d = gcd(a, b).\n\nThe reachable positions are all multiples of d.\n\nSo, for any x, the maximum reachable position is min(x, ... ). Hmm.\n\nWait, for each x, the frog can reach any position y that is a multiple of d, and y >=c, where c is the minimal reachable position.\n\nWait, perhaps for x >= c, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut that's only if the frog can reach x, and then from there, can make steps to reach higher multiples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x >= some x_c, f(x) = (x //d) +1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for the second sample where a=1, b=2019, d=1.\n\nSo, f(x) =x+1, which is (x//1)+1.\n\nYes, this holds.\n\nIn the first sample, a=5, b=3, d=1.\n\nSo, for x=7, f(x)=8, which is 7+1. So, it's x+1.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample.\n\nSo, perhaps for x >=x_c, f(x) =x+1.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute x_c, the minimal x where f(x) =x+1.\n\nThen, sum f(x) from 0 to m is:\n\nsum_{x=0}^{x_c-1} f(x) + sum_{x=x_c}^{m} (x+1)\n\nBut how to find x_c.\n\nWait, x_c is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from there, can make a series of steps adding (a -b) each time, thus allowing the frog to reach all positions beyond x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps x_c is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and x +a is reachable.\n\nBecause, from x, the frog can make a step of a to x+a, which is beyond x, but then from x+a, can make a step of -b to x+a -b.\n\nIf a >b, then x +a -b is x + (a -b), which is larger than x.\n\nThus, the frog can reach x + (a -b), which is larger than x.\n\nSo, from x, the frog can reach positions x, x+a, x+a -b, x+a -b +a, etc.\n\nEach step adds (a -b) to the previous position.\n\nThus, for a >b, once the frog can reach x, it can reach all positions x +k*(a -b) for k >=0, as long as they are <=x.\n\nWait, but x +k*(a -b) can be larger than x if a -b is positive, which it is when a> b.\n\nSo, perhaps x_c is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from there, can reach x +a, which is beyond x, and from there, x +a -b.\n\nThus, x_c is the minimal x such that x is reachable, and x +a -b is also reachable.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps x_c is the minimal x such that x is reachable, and x +a is reachable, and a >b.\n\nSo, for a> b, x_c is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and x +a is reachable.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think about the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from there, can reach x +a, which is beyond x.\n\nThen, from x +a, the frog can make a step of -b, reaching x +a -b, which is x + (a -b).\n\nSince a> b, this is larger than x.\n\nThus, the frog can reach positions x, x +a, x +a -b, x +a -b +a, etc.\n\nEach step adds (a -b), which is positive.\n\nThus, the frog can reach x +k*(a -b) for any k >=0.\n\nBut these positions must be <=x.\n\nWait, no, because x +k*(a -b) can be larger than x.\n\nThus, for x >=x_c, the frog can reach all positions up to x, and beyond x, the frog can't reach anything.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps for x >=x_c, the frog can reach all positions up to x, and then for x' >=x_c, the frog can reach all positions up to x', thus f(x')=x'+1.\n\nYes, that's what the samples show.\n\nSo, the critical x_c is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from there, can make a series of steps that allow it to reach x +a -b, which is beyond x, and from there, the frog can reach x +a -b +a, and so on.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to find x_c.\n\nWait, perhaps x_c is the minimal x such that x is reachable, and x +a is reachable, and a> b.\n\nSo, x_c is the minimal x where x can be expressed as k*a - l*b, and x +a can also be expressed as (k+1)*a - l'*b.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_c is the minimal x such that x is reachable, and x + (a -b) is reachable.\n\nBecause, from x, the frog can reach x +a (beyond x), then from there, subtract b to get x +a -b.\n\nIf a> b, then x +a -b is larger than x.\n\nThus, the frog can reach x +a -b, which is beyond x.\n\nSo, for x_c, the frog can reach x, and from there, can reach x +a -b, which is beyond x.\n\nThus, x_c is the minimal x such that x is reachable, and x + (a -b) is reachable.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe minimal x where the frog can reach x, and then from there, can make a step of a and then a step of -b to reach x +a -b, which is beyond x.\n\nThus, x_c is the minimal x where x is reachable, and x +a is reachable, and x +a -b is reachable.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to find x_c as the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, the frog can make a step of a, then a step of -b, leading to x +a -b.\n\nThus, x_c is the minimal x such that x can be reached, and x +a -b can be reached.\n\nBut how to find this x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_c is the minimal x where x is reachable, and x +a -b is reachable, and x +a -b >x.\n\nWhich implies a -b>0, i.e., a> b.\n\nSo, for a <=b, x_c doesn't exist, and f(x) can't reach x +a -b, so the frog can't make progress beyond x.\n\nThus, for a <=b, the frog can't reach beyond a certain x, and f(x) remains bounded.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1.

If \\( a \\leq b \\), the frog cannot make progress indefinitely, and we compute the reachable positions directly. If \\( a > b \\), we identify a critical point \\( x_c \\) beyond which the frog can reach every position up to \\( x \\). We then sum the values of \\( f(x) \\) efficiently using these insights. This approach ensures that we handle large values of \\( m \\) efficiently by leveraging mathematical properties of the frog's movement.",
