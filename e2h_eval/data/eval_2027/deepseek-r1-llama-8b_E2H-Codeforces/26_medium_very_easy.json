    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, z. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem says that x, y, z are the sides of a triangle. The triangle is non-degenerate if x + y > z. Also, the variables are constrained such that A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Additionally, since the sides must form a valid triangle, we need to make sure that x + y > z. \n\nHmm, wait, but the way the variables are set up—x can be from A to B, y is at least B but up to C, and z is at least C but up to D. So, for each possible x in [A,B], y in [B,C], and z in [C,D], we need to check if x + y > z. But considering all possible triples directly would be too slow because the ranges can be up to 5e5, leading to O(N^3) time which is impossible.\n\nI need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the constraints:\n\nFor each valid triple (x, y, z), the conditions are:\n- A ≤ x ≤ B\n- B ≤ y ≤ C\n- C ≤ z ≤ D\n- x + y > z\n\nBut since x can vary from A to B, y from B to C, and z from C to D, perhaps I can find a way to compute the number of valid z's for each x and y.\n\nWait, but that might still involve a lot of iterations. Maybe I can precompute for each possible z, how many (x, y) pairs satisfy x + y > z, along with the other constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to fix z first and then count the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x + y > z, considering their ranges.\n\nYes, that could work. Because for each z, the condition x + y > z must hold, and x and y are within their respective ranges.\n\nBut what are the ranges for x and y? For a fixed z, x can be between A and B, y between B and C. So for each z, I need to find the number of (x, y) pairs such that x + y > z.\n\nSo let's think about this: for each z in [C, D], calculate the number of (x, y) pairs where A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, and x + y > z.\n\nThe total number of valid triangles is the sum over all z in [C, D] of the number of valid (x, y) pairs for that z.\n\nNow, how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me consider the possible x and y. For each x in [A, B], the minimum y needed is max(B, z - x + 1). Because y has to be >= B and also >= (z - x + 1) to ensure x + y > z.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a given x and z, the condition is y > z - x. Since y is an integer, y >= (z - x + 1). But y also must be >= B and <= C.\n\nSo for a particular x, the lower bound on y is the maximum of (B, (z - x + 1)), and the upper bound is C. If the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound, then the number of y's for this x is C - lower_bound + 1. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo for each z, the total number of (x, y) pairs is the sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, min(C, ...) - max(B, z -x +1) + 1) if applicable.\n\nBut computing this for each z individually might not be efficient enough, especially when D is up to 5e5. So I need a way to compute this without iterating each z from C to D and for each z, iterating x from A to B.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find a mathematical formula that allows me to compute the sum for all z in a range efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the variables involved. Let's define:\n\nFor a given z, we can model the problem as finding the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and y > z - x.\n\nWait, but y is >= B, so for each x, the required y must be >= max(B, z - x + 1).\n\nSo for each x, the minimal y is max(B, z - x + 1). And since y can't exceed C, the count is max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1) if max(...) <= C.\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is:\n\nif (max(B, z -x + 1)) <= C → then (C - (max(B, ... )) + 1) else 0.\n\nSo, for a given z, the total is the sum over x of [max(0, C - max(B, (z -x + 1)) + 1)] if max(B, ...) <= C.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the condition in terms of x and y. Let's see:\n\nWe have x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nSince z varies from C to D, maybe for each (x, y), we can determine for how many z's does the condition x + y > z hold, and z is in [C, D].\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Because for each (x, y), the condition x + y > z must be satisfied. And z can range from C to min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo for each (x, y), the number of z's that satisfy is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nWait, that's a clever idea. Because for each (x, y), any z between C and (x+y-1) is acceptable, provided it's <= D. So the number of z's is the overlap between [C, D] and [C, x+y-1].\n\nSo the count for (x, y) is:\n\nnumber_of_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C.\n\nOtherwise, zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of the number_of_z for that (x, y).\n\nThat's a different way to compute the problem. Now, the question is: how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nBecause now, the problem reduces to iterating through all x and y, and for each, adding the number of z's that fit.\n\nBut again, x can be up to 5e5 and y up to 5e5, so iterating through all possible x and y is O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)) which can be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the constraints on x and y.\n\nx is between A and B.\n\ny is between B and C.\n\nWe can note that y must be >= B, x >= A, and y <= C.\n\nAlso, for (x, y) to contribute to the sum, x + y must be greater than C (since z must be >= C and < x + y). So x + y > C.\n\nWait, no. Because z starts at C. So for a particular (x, y), the minimal z is C, and the maximal z is min(D, x + y - 1). So if x + y <= C, then there are zero z's, since even the minimal z (C) would require x + y > C, which isn't true. So only pairs (x, y) where x + y > C will contribute.\n\nSo, the first condition is x + y > C.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can model the problem as:\n\nsum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)} ] where x + y > C.\n\nBut again, this is O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which is too slow.\n\nAlternative approach: group the x's and y's into ranges where certain conditions hold, and compute the contributions using mathematical expressions.\n\nLet me try to find a way to express the sum in terms of x and y.\n\nFirst, let's denote that for each (x, y), the contribution is:\n\nif x + y > C → then the contribution is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C.\n\nElse, 0.\n\nWait, no. It's more precise to say that the contribution is:\n\nif x + y > C → then the number of z's is the number of integers z in [C, D] that are < x + y.\n\nWhich is:\n\nnumber_of_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C.\n\nElse, zero.\n\nSo, the total is the sum over x and y of that.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a way to model this as a function of x and y, and then find the sum over the rectangle [A, B] x [B, C].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can split the problem into two cases:\n\nCase 1: x + y <= D → in this case, the number of z's is (x + y - C) if x + y > C, and x + y - C must be positive.\n\nWait, no, because z can go up to D. So:\n\nif x + y -1 < C → then no z's.\n\nIf C <= x + y -1 <= D → then the count is (x + y - 1 - C + 1) = x + y - C.\n\nIf x + y -1 > D → then the count is D - C + 1.\n\nSo, the number_of_z can be written as:\n\nif x + y > C and x + y <= D → count = x + y - C.\n\nif x + y > D → count = D - C + 1.\n\nelse → 0.\n\nSo, the total is the sum of:\n\nfor (x, y) where x + y > C and x + y <= D: (x + y - C)\n\nplus the sum of:\n\nfor (x, y) where x + y > D: (D - C + 1)\n\nSo, the problem can be split into these two parts.\n\nNow, let's compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, let's compute the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > D. For each such pair, the contribution is (D - C + 1).\n\nSecond, for pairs where x + y > C and x + y <= D, the contribution is (x + y - C).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > D. Multiply that by (D - C + 1) and add to the result.\n\n2. Compute the sum of (x + y - C) for all (x, y) pairs where C < x + y <= D.\n\nBut again, calculating this for all x and y is O(1e10), which is impossible. So, we need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about the constraints for the first part:\n\nPart 1: x + y > D.\n\nGiven that x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C].\n\nWhat is the minimum x + y? It's A + B.\n\nThe maximum x + y is B + C.\n\nSo, if A + B > D, then all pairs (x, y) satisfy x + y > D. Otherwise, some don't.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for x in [A, B], y in [B, C], the sum x + y can range from A+B to B+C.\n\nSo, if B + C > D, then there are some pairs where x + y > D.\n\nIf B + C <= D, then no pairs satisfy x + y > D.\n\nSo, the condition for Part 1 is whether B + C > D.\n\nLet me denote S_max = B + C.\n\nIf S_max <= D → no contribution from Part 1.\n\nElse, the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > D is equal to the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > D.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate that?\n\nHmm. Let's imagine that for x and y, x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C]. We need to count the number of pairs where x + y > D.\n\nThis is similar to a 2D range counting problem, but can be solved using some mathematical approach.\n\nLet me fix x and find the minimal y that satisfies x + y > D.\n\nFor a fixed x, the minimal y is y_min = max(B, D - x + 1).\n\nBut y must also be <= C.\n\nSo, for a fixed x, the number of y's is:\n\ncount_y(x) = max(0, C - max(B, D - x + 1) + 1) if max(...) <= C.\n\nSo, the total number of pairs is the sum of count_y(x) for x in [A, B], but only if max(B, D -x + 1) <= C.\n\nWait, but this approach would require iterating over x from A to B, which can be up to 5e5 steps. That's manageable, perhaps.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSo, for Part 1, the number of (x, y) pairs is the sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, min(C, D - x + 1) - B + 1) if D -x +1 >= B.\n\nWait, no. Because y must be >= max(B, D - x + 1) and <= C.\n\nSo, the lower bound is max(B, D -x +1), and the upper bound is C.\n\nIf lower_bound > upper_bound, then count is zero.\n\nElse, count is (upper_bound - lower_bound + 1).\n\nSo, the count for each x is:\n\ny_low = max(B, D - x + 1)\n\nif y_low > C → 0.\n\nelse → C - y_low + 1.\n\nSo, the total for Part 1 is sum over x from A to B of max(0, C - y_low + 1).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the function y_low = max(B, D -x +1).\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\ny_low = max(B, (D - x + 1)).\n\nSo, for x in [A, B], the value (D -x + 1) decreases as x increases.\n\nWait, because as x increases, D -x +1 decreases.\n\nSo, when x increases, the term (D -x +1) gets smaller.\n\nSo, the point where (D -x +1) is equal to B is when x = D - B + 1.\n\nLet me call this x0 = D - B + 1.\n\nSo, for x <= x0, (D -x +1) >= B. So, y_low is D -x +1.\n\nFor x > x0, y_low is B.\n\nSo, the sum can be split into two intervals: x <= x0 and x > x0.\n\nBut x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo, the actual x ranges where x <= x0 and x >= A, and x >= x0 and x <= B.\n\nSo, let's find the x0.\n\nx0 = D - B + 1.\n\nNow, we can split the x into three regions:\n\n1. x < x0: y_low = D -x +1.\n\nBut since x >= A and x <= B.\n\nBut D -x +1 may be larger than C, which would mean that even if y is at C, x + y may not be sufficient.\n\nWait, no. Because in Part 1, we're considering x + y > D, which requires y > D -x.\n\nBut for the count in Part 1, it's just the count of (x,y) pairs, regardless of z's. So, for each (x, y) where x + y > D, it contributes 1 to the count for Part 1.\n\nSo, for each x in [A, B], the number of y's is as computed.\n\nSo, back to splitting the x into x <= x0 and x > x0.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nCompute x0 = D - B + 1.\n\nThen, for x in [A, min(x0, B)], y_low is D -x +1.\n\nBut y can't exceed C.\n\nSo, for each x in this interval, the count is max(0, C - (D -x + 1) + 1) if D -x +1 <= C.\n\nWait, but D -x +1 is y_low, which is >= B.\n\nSo, if D -x +1 > C → no y's satisfy, so count is zero.\n\nElse, count is C - (D -x +1) + 1 = x + C - D.\n\nWait, because:\n\nC - (D -x +1) + 1 = C - D +x -1 +1 = x + C - D.\n\nSo, for x in [A, min(x0, B)], if D -x +1 <= C → count += (x + C - D).\n\nElse, count += 0.\n\nSimilarly, for x in [max(A, x0 + 1), B], y_low is B.\n\nIn this case, the count is max(0, C - B + 1) if B <= C.\n\nElse, zero.\n\nSo, for x in [max(A, x0 + 1), B], if B <= C → count += (C - B + 1).\n\nElse, zero.\n\nSo, the steps for Part 1 are:\n\n1. Compute x0 = D - B + 1.\n\n2. Find the lower and upper bounds for x in the first interval (x <= x0):\n\n   lower_x1 = A\n\n   upper_x1 = min(x0, B)\n\n   For x in [lower_x1, upper_x1], if D -x +1 <= C → add (x + C - D) to the sum.\n\n3. For x in [max(A, x0 + 1), B], if B <= C → add (C - B + 1) to the sum.\n\nBut how do I compute the sum for x in [lower_x1, upper_x1] where D -x +1 <= C?\n\nThis is equivalent to x >= D - C + 1.\n\nBecause D -x +1 <= C → x >= D - C + 1.\n\nSo, in the first interval, x must be >= (D - C + 1) and <= upper_x1.\n\nSo, the x in this interval is [max(A, D - C + 1), min(x0, B)].\n\nBut this is only possible if D - C +1 <= x0 and x >= A.\n\nSo, the effective x interval is [max(A, D - C +1), min(x0, B)].\n\nIf the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, then no contribution.\n\nSo, the sum for the first interval is the sum of (x + C - D) for x from l to u, where l = max(A, D - C +1), u = min(x0, B).\n\nSimilarly, for the second interval, x is from max(A, x0 +1) to B. And in that interval, the count is (C - B + 1) if C >= B.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCompute the sum for Part 1.\n\nNow, moving to Part 2.\n\nPart 2 is the sum of (x + y - C) for all (x, y) where C < x + y <= D and x is in [A, B], y in [B, C].\n\nSo, for each (x, y) in the rectangle, if x + y > C and x + y <= D → add (x + y - C) to the sum.\n\nWe can re-express this as:\n\nsum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C (x + y - C) * I(x + y > C and x + y <= D)\n\nWhere I is 1 if the condition holds, else 0.\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{x=A}^B sum_{y= max(B, C -x +1)}^{C} (x + y - C) * I(x + y <= D)\n\nWait, because x + y > C → y > C -x → y >= C -x +1. But y is also >= B.\n\nSo, for each x, y starts from max(B, C -x +1) and goes up to min(C, D -x).\n\nWait, no, because x + y must be <= D → y <= D -x.\n\nBut since y is originally up to C, the upper limit is min(C, D -x).\n\nSo, for each x, y ranges from y_start to y_end, where:\n\ny_start = max(B, C -x + 1)\n\ny_end = min(C, D -x)\n\nIf y_start > y_end → no contribution.\n\nElse, the sum for this x is sum_{y=y_start}^{y_end} (x + y - C).\n\nWhich can be simplified as:\n\nsum = (x - C) * (y_end - y_start + 1) + sum_{y=y_start}^{y_end} y.\n\nSum of y from y_start to y_end is (y_end - y_start + 1) * (y_start + y_end) / 2.\n\nSo, the sum becomes:\n\n(x - C) * N + (N*(y_start + y_end)) // 2,\n\nwhere N = y_end - y_start + 1.\n\nSo, for each x, we can compute this and add it to the total.\n\nBut again, x can be up to 5e5, and for each x, we need to compute these values.\n\nThis is manageable, as it's O(5e5) operations.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFor Part 2:\n\nInitialize sum_part2 = 0.\n\nFor each x in [A, B]:\n\n   compute y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   compute y_end = min(C, D -x)\n\n   if y_start > y_end → continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      N = y_end - y_start + 1\n\n      sum_part2 += (x - C) * N + (N * (y_start + y_end)) // 2\n\nSo, this would handle all (x, y) pairs where x + y > C and x + y <= D.\n\nPutting it all together, the total number of triangles is:\n\ntotal = part1 * (D - C + 1) + sum_part2\n\nBut wait, no. Because in Part 1, the count is the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > D. Each such pair contributes (D - C + 1) to the total.\n\nIn Part 2, the count is the sum of (x + y - C) for pairs where x + y > C and <= D.\n\nSo, the overall total is:\n\ntotal = part1_count * (D - C + 1) + part2_sum.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nBut let's test it against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nSo, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nPart 1: count the number of (x,y) where x + y >4.\n\nPossible x: 1,2; y:2,3.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nx=1, y=2 → 3>4? No.\n\nx=1, y=3 →4>4? No.\n\nx=2, y=2 →4>4? No.\n\nx=2, y=3 →5>4 → yes. So part1_count is 1.\n\nPart1 contributes 1 * (4-3+1) =1*2=2.\n\nPart2: sum of (x+y -3) for pairs where 3 < x+y <=4.\n\nLooking for x in 1,2; y in 2,3.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nx=1, y=2: 3 → not >3 → no.\n\nx=1, y=3:4>3 and <=4 → yes. Contribution: (4-3)=1.\n\nx=2, y=2:4>3 and <=4 → contribution:4-3=1.\n\nx=2, y=3:5>4 → no.\n\nSo sum_part2 is 1 + 1 =2.\n\nTotal is 2 + 2 =4. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5'\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nPart1: x + y >5.\n\nx can be 1,2; y can be 2.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nx=1, y=2:3>5? No.\n\nx=2, y=2:4>5? No.\n\nSo part1_count is 0.\n\nPart2: x+y>2 and <=5.\n\nAll pairs (x,y) in the rectangle.\n\nSo x can be 1 or 2, y can be 2.\n\nFor each x:\n\nx=1:\n\ny=2.\n\nx+y=3>2 → yes.\n\ny_end = min(2,5 -1=4) →2.\n\nsum for x=1:\n\ny_start = max(2, 2-1+1)= max(2,2)=2.\n\ny_end=2.\n\nN=1.\n\nsum_part2 += (1-2)*1 + (1*(2+2))/2 → (-1)*1 + 2/2 = -1 +1=0.\n\nWait, wait, x=1, y=2: x+y=3. So x+y -C=3-2=1.\n\nSo the contribution should be 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps my earlier logic is wrong.\n\nWait, in Part2, the sum is (x + y - C) for each (x,y) in the rectangle where x + y > C and x + y <= D.\n\nIn this case, C=2.\n\nSo for x=1, y=2: x+y=3>2 → yes, and 3<=5 → yes. So contribution is 1.\n\nBut according to the formula:\n\n(x - C) * N + (N*(y_start + y_end))//2.\n\nx=1, C=2.\n\nx-C = -1.\n\nN=1.\n\n(y_start + y_end) = 2+2=4.\n\nSo ( -1 * 1 ) + (1 *4 )//2 → -1 + 2 =1. Which is correct.\n\nSo sum_part2 +=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny=2.\n\nx+y=4>2 and <=5 → yes.\n\nContribution:4-2=2.\n\nUsing formula:\n\nx=2, C=2.\n\nx-C=0.\n\nN=1.\n\n(y_start + y_end) =2+2=4.\n\n0 *1 + (4)/2 = 0 +2=2. So sum_part2 +=2.\n\nTotal sum_part2=3.\n\nSo overall total is 0 * (5-2+1) +3= 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nSo x can only be 5e5, y can only be 5e5, z can only be 5e5.\n\nCheck x + y = 1e6.\n\nIs x + y > z? 1e6 >5e5 → yes.\n\nSo part1: x + y >5e5? 1e6>5e5 → yes. So part1_count is 1.\n\nPart1 contributes 1 * (5e5 -5e5 +1) =1 *1=1.\n\nPart2: x + y >5e5 and x + y <=5e5.\n\nWait, x + y is 1e6 which is >5e5, but D is 5e5. So x + y <= D is 1e6 <=5e5 → no. So Part2 contributes zero.\n\nSo total is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nGreat. So the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in code.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute Part1:\n\nCompute x0 = D - B + 1.\n\nCompute the sum for x in [A, min(x0, B)] where x >= D - C +1.\n\nAnd sum for x in [max(A, x0 +1), B] where B <= C.\n\nThen, compute Part2:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], compute y_start = max(B, C -x +1).\n\ny_end = min(C, D -x).\n\nIf y_start > y_end → skip.\n\nElse, compute N = y_end - y_start +1.\n\nCompute sum_part2 += (x - C) * N + (N * (y_start + y_end)) // 2.\n\nThen, the total is part1_count * (D - C +1) + sum_part2.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where D < C: but according to the input constraints, C <= D, so D is at least C.\n\nCase where A > B: but input constraints say A <= B.\n\nCase where B > C: but input constraints say B <= C.\n\nSo, the code can proceed safely.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, read A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute part1_count:\n\nx0 = D - B + 1\n\nx_low1 = A\n\nx_high1 = min(x0, B)\n\nlow_x_for_first = max(A, D - C + 1)\n\nhigh_x_for_first = min(x_high1, B)\n\nif low_x_for_first > high_x_for_first → part1_count1 =0.\n\nElse:\n\nsum1 = sum of (x + C - D) for x from low_x_for_first to high_x_for_first.\n\nThis is an arithmetic series.\n\nThe number of terms is high_x_for_first - low_x_for_first +1.\n\nFirst term: low_x_for_first + C - D.\n\nLast term: high_x_for_first + C - D.\n\nSum is (first + last) * n // 2.\n\nSo, part1_count1 = sum of these.\n\nThen, for the second interval:\n\nx_low2 = max(A, x0 +1)\n\nx_high2 = B\n\nif B > C → no contribution.\n\nElse:\n\nn_terms = x_high2 - x_low2 +1.\n\npart1_count2 = n_terms.\n\nSo, part1_count = part1_count1 + part1_count2.\n\nBut wait, only if B <= C.\n\nSo, if B > C → part1_count2 =0.\n\nElse:\n\npart1_count2 = max(0, x_high2 - x_low2 +1).\n\nNow, compute part1_total = part1_count * (D - C +1).\n\nWait, no: part1_count is the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > D.\n\nEach such pair contributes (D - C +1) to the total.\n\nSo, part1_total = part1_count * (D - C +1).\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 3, part1_count is 1, D - C +1 is 1.\n\nSo, 1 * 1 =1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, compute part2.\n\nLoop over x from A to B.\n\nFor each x:\n\ny_start = max(B, C -x +1)\n\ny_end = min(C, D -x)\n\nif y_start > y_end → continue.\n\nElse:\n\nN = y_end - y_start +1\n\nterm1 = (x - C) * N\n\nterm2 = N * (y_start + y_end) // 2\n\nsum_part2 += term1 + term2\n\nSo, the code.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nFinally, the output is the total as a string.\n\nNow, handling large numbers:\n\nSince A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, the sum_part2 could be up to (5e5)^2 * (5e5) → which is 1.25e16, which fits into Python's int.\n\nSo, no issues with integer overflows.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nTesting it on the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nCompute part1:\n\nx0 =4 -2 +1=3.\n\nx_high1 = min(3,2)=2.\n\nlow_x_for_first = max(1,4-3+1)=max(1,2)=2.\n\nhigh_x_for_first = min(2,2)=2.\n\nSo, x runs from 2 to 2.\n\nsum1 is (2 +3 -4) =1.\n\nSo part1_count1=1.\n\nx_low2 = max(1, 3+1)=4 → which is > B=2 → so part1_count2=0.\n\nSo part1_count=1.\n\npart1_total=1*(4-3+1)=2.\n\npart2:\n\nx runs from 1 to 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_start= max(2,3-1+1)= max(2,3)=3.\n\ny_end= min(3,4-1=3) →3.\n\nso y_start=3, y_end=3.\n\nN=1.\n\nterm1= (1-3)*1= -2.\n\nterm2=1*(3+3)//2=3.\n\nsum += (-2 +3)=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_start= max(2,3-2+1)=max(2,2)=2.\n\ny_end= min(3,4-2=2) →2.\n\nN=1.\n\nterm1=(2-3)*1=-1.\n\nterm2=1*(2+2)//2=2.\n\nsum += (-1+2)=1.\n\nTotal part2 sum is 2.\n\ntotal=2+2=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nSample 2:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nCompute part1:\n\nx0=5-2+1=4.\n\nx_high1= min(4, 2)=2.\n\nlow_x_for_first= max(1,5-2+1=4) →4.\n\nBut x_high1=2 <4 → no sum in part1_count1.\n\nSo part1_count1=0.\n\nx_low2= max(1,4+1=5) →5 >2 → part1_count2=0.\n\nSo part1_count=0.\n\npart1_total=0.\n\npart2:\n\nx runs 1 and 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_start= max(2, 2-1+1=2).\n\ny_end= min(2,5-1=4) →2.\n\nN=1.\n\nterm1=(1-2)*1=-1.\n\nterm2=1*(2+2)/2=2.\n\nsum +=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_start= max(2,2-2+1=1) →2.\n\ny_end= min(2,5-2=3) →2.\n\nN=1.\n\nterm1=0*1=0.\n\nterm2=1*(2+2)/2=2.\n\nsum +=2.\n\nTotal part2 sum is 3.\n\ntotal=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute x0 = D -

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that can be formed with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) under specific constraints. The sides must satisfy \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\) and form a valid triangle (i.e., \\(x + y > z\\)).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting valid triangles where each side is within given ranges. A triangle is valid if \\(x + y > z\\). Given the constraints, we need an efficient way to count these without iterating over all possible triples directly.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible \\(z\\) in the range \\([C, D]\\), determine the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This approach allows us to break down the problem into manageable parts.\n\n3. **Efficient Counting**:\n   - **Part 1**: Count pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y > D\\). Each such pair contributes \\(D - C + 1\\) valid \\(z\\) values.\n   - **Part 2**: For each valid pair \\((x, y)\\) where \\(C < x + y \\leq D\\), compute the contribution as \\(x + y - C\\).\n\n4. **Mathematical Formulation**: Use arithmetic series and range calculations to efficiently sum contributions without iterating over all possible pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    A = int(input[0])\n    B = int(input[1])\n    C = int(input[2])\n    D = int(input[3])\n\n    # Part 1: count pairs where x + y > D\n    part1_count = 0\n    x0 = D - B + 1\n    # First interval: x <= x0, y_start = max(B, D - x + 1)\n    low_x1 = max(A, D - C + 1)\n    high_x1 = min(x0, B)\n    if low_x1 <= high_x1:\n        n = high_x1 - low_x1 + 1\n        first = low_x1 + C - D\n        last = high_x1 + C - D\n        sum1 = (first + last) * n // 2\n        part1_count1 = sum1\n    else:\n        part1_count1 = 0\n\n    # Second interval: x > x0, y_start = B, but only if B <= C\n    part1_count2 = 0\n    if B <= C:\n        x_low2 = max(A, x0 + 1)\n        x_high2 = B\n        if x_low2 <= x_high2:\n            n = x_high2 - x_low2 + 1\n            part1_count2 = n\n    part1_count = part1_count1 + part1_count2\n\n    part1_total = part1_count * (D - C + 1)\n\n    # Part 2: sum (x + y - C) for pairs where C < x + y <= D\n    sum_part2 = 0\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        y_start = max(B, C - x + 1)\n        y_end = min(C, D - x)\n        if y_start > y_end:\n            continue\n        N = y_end - y_start + 1\n        term1 = (x - C) * N\n        term2 = N * (y_start + y_end) // 2\n        sum_part2 += term1 + term2\n\n    total = part1_total + sum_part2\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n\n2. **Part 1 Calculation**: This part counts pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y > D\\). It splits the range of \\(x\\) into two intervals and uses arithmetic series to sum contributions efficiently.\n\n3. **Part 2 Calculation**: For each \\(x\\), it calculates the valid range for \\(y\\) and sums the contributions using arithmetic series and range operations to avoid nested loops.\n\n4. **Total Calculation**: The total number of valid triangles is the sum of contributions from both parts, ensuring efficient computation even for large input sizes.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is computed efficiently without iterating over all possible triples, making it suitable for large input ranges.",
