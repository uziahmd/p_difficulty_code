The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. The goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the keys. Each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by only one key. \n\nThe condition for a key j and chest i is that a_i + b_j must be odd. So, the sum needs to be congruent to 1 mod 2. That means either a_i is even and b_j is odd, or vice versa.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I need to figure out is how to pair the keys and chests in such a way that as many chests as possible are opened.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since each key can only be used once, and each chest can only be unlocked once, the problem reduces to matching the keys to chests in a way that satisfies the parity condition.\n\nI think the key here is to count how many chests have even a_i and how many have odd a_i. Similarly, count how many keys have even b_j and how many have odd b_j.\n\nWait, because for a key j, if it's even, it can only open chests with an odd a_i. And if the key is odd, it can open even a_i chests.\n\nSo maybe the strategy is:\n\n1. Split the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i.\n2. Split the keys into two groups: those with even b_j and those with odd b_j.\n3. Then, see how many keys of each type can be matched to each group of chests.\n\nFor example, suppose there are X even chests and Y odd chests. Also, K_even even keys and K_odd odd keys.\n\nThen, the number of chests we can open is the minimum of:\n\n- The number of even chests that can be matched by even keys (but wait, no. Because even keys can only match odd a_i chests, right? Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify.\n\nWait, when a_i is even and b_j is even: a_i + b_j is even, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So, for a_i even, we need a b_j that is odd.\n\nSimilarly, for a_i odd, we need a b_j that is even.\n\nSo, the correct pairing is:\n\nEven a_i chests can be unlocked by odd b_j keys.\nOdd a_i chests can be unlocked by even b_j keys.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For the even a_i chests, they can be unlocked by any of the odd b_j keys.\n- For the odd a_i chests, they can be unlocked by any of the even b_j keys.\n\nSo, the total number of chests that can be unlocked is the minimum between the number of even a_i chests and the number of odd b_j keys plus the minimum between the number of odd a_i chests and the number of even b_j keys.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can only be used once. So, it's not just the sum of the two minima. It's more like:\n\nWe have two separate pools: even chests and odd chests. We also have two pools for keys: even and odd.\n\nWe can allocate the odd keys to even chests, and even keys to odd chests.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests is the sum of:\n\nmin(number of even chests, number of odd keys) + min(number of odd chests, number of even keys).\n\nBut wait, no. Because after using some keys, others might be left, but perhaps it's better to maximize the sum by choosing the best possible allocation.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible is the minimum between the total chests and the sum of the two minima.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number is the minimum between the sum of the two minima and the total chests.\n\nWait, let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose:\n\nChests: even chests = 3, odd chests = 2.\nKeys: even keys = 4, odd keys = 1.\n\nSo, even chests can use odd keys. We have 3 even chests and 1 odd key. So, we can unlock 1 even chest.\n\nOdd chests can use even keys. We have 2 odd chests and 4 even keys. So, we can unlock 2.\n\nTotal unlocked: 1+2=3.\n\nBut what if we have more keys than needed?\n\nLike, suppose:\n\nChests: even = 3, odd =2.\n\nKeys: even =5, odd=5.\n\nThen, even chests can take up to min(3,5) =3 odd keys, leaving 2 odd keys unused. But no, because each key can be used once. So, all 3 even chests can be unlocked by 3 of the 5 odd keys. Then, the remaining 2 odd keys can't do anything else.\n\nWait, no",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using given keys. Each key can unlock a specific type of chest based on their parity (odd or even).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Chests and Keys**: Separate the chests into those with even and odd values. Similarly, separate the keys into even and odd values.\n2. **Count Each Category**: Count the number of even and odd chests, as well as the number of even and odd keys.\n3. **Pair Even and Odd**: Use even keys to unlock odd chests and odd keys to unlock even chests. Calculate how many such pairings are possible.\n4. **Sum the Pairings**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the maximum possible pairings from both categories.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    odd_chests = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chests += 1\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    odd_keys = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n        else:\n            odd_keys += 1\n    \n    # Max possible from even chests and odd keys\n    use_even_chest = min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n    use_odd_chest = min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    \n    total = use_even_chest + use_odd_chest\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of chests and keys, followed by the values on the chests and keys.\n2. **Categorization**: Count how many chests have even and odd values, and similarly count the keys.\n3. **Pairing Strategy**: \n   - Even chests can be unlocked using odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be unlocked using even keys.\n4. **Calculate Maximum Opened Chests**: Determine the maximum number of each type of chest that can be unlocked by the available keys and sum these values to get the total number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently use the available keys and chests to maximize the number of chests opened, adhering to the constraints and conditions provided.",
