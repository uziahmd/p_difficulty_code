His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have in an Olympiad based on his total points. The teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x points. The input gives us the points from the first and second tours, but not which participant got which score. Our task is to determine the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya.\n\nHmm. So, each participant has a score from the first tour (a_i) and the second tour (b_j), but the way they're paired isn't given. The sum of a_i + b_j could be any possible combination, as long as it meets certain conditions.\n\nWait, but the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So, there exists some i and j where a_i + b_j >= x. But in reality, Vasya's actual total is exactly a_i + b_j, but we don't know which one.\n\nThe problem wants us to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could get, considering all possible valid pairings of a's and b's.\n\nSo, how do we approach this?\n\nI think the key is to consider all possible ways to assign the a's and b's to participants, ensuring that the sum for each participant is a_i plus some b_j, with no overlaps. But wait, each a and b must be used exactly once, because each participant took part in both tours.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation of the b array such that each a_i is paired with a unique b_j, and then compute the total for each participant, sort them, and see where Vasya fits.\n\nBut since the pairing can vary, the best and worst positions depend on how we arrange the sums.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because the pairing determines the sum for each participant, and thus their rank.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal possible rank (best) and maximal possible rank (worst) that Vasya can have, given that his sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but Vasya's sum is exactly a_i + b_j for some i and j. So, when considering the best case, we want to maximize his sum so that he's as high as possible, and in the worst case, minimize his sum (but still >=x) to be as low as possible.\n\nBut also, the other participants' sums will affect the ranking.\n\nWait, maybe the approach is:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\n- Assign the largest possible sum to Vasya. That would be the maximum a_i + b_j, which is max(a) + max(b).\n\nThen, arrange the rest of the sums such that as many others as possible have higher or equal sums than Vasya. Wait, but no, because if Vasya's sum is the maximum, then he can be in 1st place.\n\nWait, but perhaps not. For example, if multiple participants have the same maximum sum, then the jury can assign Vasya any position among them. So in the best case, he is first.\n\nSimilarly, in the worst case, he is placed last among those with the same sum.\n\nWait, but in the worst case, how do we arrange the sums so that Vasya has the minimal possible rank, but his sum is at least x.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible, while others are as large as possible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute for the best case: the maximum possible sum Vasya can have, which is max_a + max_b. Then, in this scenario, arrange the other participants' sums such that Vasya is first.\n\nFor the worst case: find the minimal sum Vasya can have, which is at least x. Then, arrange the other participants' sums to make Vasya's rank as bad as possible.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum greater than or equal to Vasya's sum, and the worst is determined by how many can have a sum less than or equal to Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but since the sum depends on the pairing, perhaps the approach is:\n\nTo find all possible pairs (i,j) where a_i + b_j >= x, and for each possible such (i,j), compute what the best and worst possible ranks could be, then choose the minimum and maximum across all possibilities.\n\nBut n can be up to 105, so 105^2 is manageable.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases because the pairing has to be a perfect matching between a and b arrays.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to generate all possible permutations of the b array, pair them with a's, compute the sums, sort, and then for each possible Vasya's sum",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The goal is to consider all possible valid pairings of participants' scores from the two tours and compute the resulting ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each participant's total score is the sum of their scores from two tours. The task is to find the best and worst ranks Vasya can achieve given that his total score is at least `x`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: \n   - For the best possible rank, Vasya should have the highest possible total score. This is achieved by pairing the highest scores from both tours.\n   - For the worst possible rank, Vasya should have the lowest possible total score that still meets the condition `a_i + b_j >= x`. This involves considering the minimal valid total score and arranging other participants' scores to maximize their totals relative to Vasya's.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the best rank by considering the maximum possible total score for Vasya.\n   - Compute the worst rank by considering the minimum possible total score for Vasya that still meets the condition.\n   - Use permutations of scores to simulate all possible valid pairings and determine the ranks.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Given the constraints (n up to 105), we can efficiently use permutations and sorting to determine the ranks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    \n    max_a = max(a)\n    max_b = max(b)\n    best_sum = max_a + max_b\n    best_rank = 1  # He can be first\n    \n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    for ai in a:\n        for bj in b:\n            if ai + bj >= x and (ai + bj) < min_sum:\n                min_sum = ai + bj\n    # Now, we need to find how many participants can have sum > min_sum\n    # To get the worst rank, we want as many as possible above Vasya's sum\n    # So, arrange others to have higher sums\n    # But since it's not possible to know all permutations, perhaps we can model it as:\n    # The worst case is when Vasya's sum is min_sum, and as many others as possible have higher sums.\n    \n    # To compute the worst rank:\n    # Find the number of pairs (i,j) where a_i + b_j > min_sum\n    # Then, the worst rank is 1 + that number (since all those pairs are better than Vasya)\n    # But wait, no, because the sum depends on the permutation.\n    # Alternatively, the worst possible rank is determined by the number of participants who have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum, plus one (since Vasya is among them if they are equal).\n    # But how?\n    \n    # Maybe the worst case is when Vasya has the smallest possible sum (min_sum), and others have as many high sums as possible.\n    # So, the worst rank is the number of participants with sum > min_sum, plus 1 (since Vasya is included if any have same sum).\n    \n    # Let's proceed with that approach.\n    \n    # First, compute all possible sums for each participant in all possible pairings.\n    # But since n is 105, this is impossible to do directly.\n    \n    # Alternative approach: compute all possible pairs (i,j) and see what's the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > min_sum.\n    \n    # Wait, but for the worst case, we need to arrange the pairing such that as many participants as possible have a sum greater than Vasya's sum.\n    # So, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum number of participants who can have a sum greater than min_sum, then add 1 (as Vasya will be after them).\n    \n    # So, the worst rank is (number of participants with sum > min_sum) + 1.\n    \n    # To find this, we need to see if there exists a way to pair the a's and b's such that as many participants as possible have sums greater than min_sum.\n    \n    # So, for each possible pairing, count how many have sum > min_sum, and find the maximum possible such count across all possible pairings.\n    # Then, the worst rank is that maximum count + 1.\n    \n    # But considering all possible pairings is computationally expensive.
