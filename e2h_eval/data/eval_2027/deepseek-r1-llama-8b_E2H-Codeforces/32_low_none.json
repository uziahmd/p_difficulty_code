    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an array of integers, and we need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, my goal is to remove one element such that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible element to remove, I need to compute the instability of the remaining array and then find the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, which is 10^5. If I try to iterate over each element, compute the max and min each time, that would be O(n^2) time, which is definitely too slow. Because 1e5 squared is 1e10 operations—way beyond what can be handled in the time constraints.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's note that the original array has a certain max and min. When I remove an element, the new max or min could change depending on whether the removed element was the current max, min, or something else.\n\nWait, but the minimal instability might not necessarily be achieved by the original max or min. For example, maybe there's a middle element that, when removed, allows the other elements to have a smaller range.\n\nSo perhaps I should consider all possible candidates for being the max or min after removal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal choice is to remove either the current max, current min, or some element that is in between but somehow contributes to the instability.\n\nLet me think: suppose the array is sorted. Then the original max is the last element, and the original min is the first. Removing any element will affect the max and/or min only if the removed element is the current max or min.\n\nWait no. Wait, if I remove an element that's not the current max or min, then the max and min of the new array remain the same as the original max and min. So the instability remains the same as before. But if I remove the current max, then the new max is the second largest element. Similarly, if I remove the current min, the new min is the second smallest.\n\nSo for the cases where the element removed is neither the max nor the min, the instability doesn't change. That's interesting.\n\nSo this suggests that the minimal instability can only come from considering the cases where we remove the current max, the current min, or perhaps some other elements that, when removed, significantly reduce the instability.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal instability comes from removing either the current max, current min, or some other element that is adjacent to either the max or min.\n\nBut wait, the initial idea is that when you remove a non-max and non-min element, the max and min don't change. So the instability remains the same as the original array. But when you remove the max, the new max is the second max, and the min remains the same. So the new instability is (second_max - min). Similarly, when you remove the min, the new instability is (max - second_min). And when you remove another element, the instability remains (max - min), unless the array had duplicates or something.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to compute the minimal possible instability after removing exactly one element. So the minimal could be either:\n\n- The original instability minus some amount (if removing a max or min)\n- Or the same as the original (if removing a non-extreme element)\n\nBut since the original instability is the max minus min, when you remove a non-extreme element, the new instability is the same as before. So the minimal instability can't be lower than the original. Wait, no. Because the original instability is (max - min). If you remove an element that isn't part of the extremes, the new max and min are same as before, so the instability is same.\n\nBut if you remove an element that is either the current max or current min, then the new instability could be less than the original.\n\nSo the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the original instability (which happens when you remove a non-extreme element) and the minimal instability when you remove either the current max or current min.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, suppose the array is [1,3,3,7]. The original max is 7, min is 1, so instability is 6. If you remove 7, the new array becomes [1,3,3], with max 3 and min 1, so instability is 2, which is better than 6. Alternatively, if you remove 1, the new array is [3,3,7], which has max 7 and min 3, instability is 4. So the minimal is 2, which comes from removing the max.\n\nIn this case",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Elements**: The key elements that influence the instability are the current maximum and minimum values of the array. Removing either of these elements can potentially reduce the instability.\n2. **Compute Instability for Extremes**: Calculate the instability if we remove the current maximum or the current minimum. This gives us two potential candidates for the minimum instability.\n3. **Check Non-Extreme Removal**: Removing a non-extreme element (neither the maximum nor the minimum) will not change the current maximum or minimum values, so the instability remains the same as the original array's instability.\n4. **Determine Minimum Instability**: Compare the instability values obtained from removing the maximum, removing the minimum, and keeping the rest of the elements unchanged. The smallest value among these will be the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, *rest = map(int, open(0).read().split())\na = rest[:n]\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_val = min(a)\n    max_val = max(a)\n    # Compute the second max and second min\n    sorted_a = sorted(a)\n    second_max = -1\n    for num in reversed(sorted_a):\n        if num != max_val:\n            second_max = num\n            break\n    second_min = float('inf')\n    for num in sorted_a:\n        if num != min_val:\n            second_min = num\n            break\n    # Case 1: Remove max\n    case1 = second_max - min_val\n    # Case 2: Remove min\n    case2 = max_val - second_min\n    # Case 3: Remove non-extreme, which gives original max - min\n    case3 = max_val - min_val\n    # The minimal instability is the minimum of the three cases\n    min_instability = min(case1, case2, case3)\n    print(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the array `a`.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element, the instability is zero.\n3. **Finding Extremes**: The minimum and maximum values of the array are identified.\n4. **Finding Second Extremes**: The second maximum and second minimum values are determined by iterating through the sorted array.\n5. **Calculating Instability Cases**: Three cases are considered:\n   - Removing the maximum value.\n   - Removing the minimum value.\n   - Keeping the array as is (which corresponds to removing a non-extreme element).\n6. **Determining the Result**: The minimum instability from the three cases is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all possible scenarios and ensures that we find the optimal element to remove in O(n log n) time due to sorting, which is suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
