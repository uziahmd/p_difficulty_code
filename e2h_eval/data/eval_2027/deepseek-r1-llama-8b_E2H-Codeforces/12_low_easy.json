The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order of the tasks matters because she has to process them in the order given.\n\nHmm, I need to find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first test case, n=4, m=3, and the tasks are 3,2,3. The output is 6. The sequence is 1 →2→3→4→1→2→3. So she moves from 1 to 2 (costs 1), then 2→3 (another 1, total 2), then 3→4 (total 3), then 4→1 (total 4), then 1→2 (5), then 2→3 (6). \n\nWait, but why does she go all the way around the ring? Because after the first task (3), she needs to get back to 2 for the second task. Oh right, because the second task is 2, which is before the third task 3. So she must be at 2 before handling the third task.\n\nSo, the key is to process the tasks in order, and for each task, determine the earliest possible time she can reach that house, considering that she must have completed all previous tasks.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems like a dynamic programming or greedy approach might work here.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Sort the tasks in the order they are given. Because each task i must be done after all j < i. So the order is fixed as per the input.\n\n2. For each task, we need to determine the latest point she arrives at before this task, and calculate the minimal path from there to ai, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to process the tasks in the order they appear, and for each task, find the shortest path from her current position to the required house, considering the direction she's moving.\n\nWait, no. Because sometimes she might have to loop around the ring. Like in the first example, she goes all the way around to reach the third task.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the movement as follows: for each task, compute the required arrival time, and keep track of the current position.\n\nLet's think about variables:\n\n- current_position: where Xenia is after completing the previous tasks.\n- time_so_far: the total time taken up to this point.\n\nFor each task in the list a_i:\n\n- The next target is a_i.\n- The time needed to get from current_position to a_i is the minimal steps on the ring.\n- But since it's a ring, the minimal steps could be either going clockwise or counter-clockwise. Wait, but traffic is only allowed in the clockwise direction, so she can't move counter-clockwise. So all movement is in the clockwise direction, meaning the distance is always (target - current_position) mod n, but when moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower, she wraps around.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is arranged such that house 1 is followed by 2, ..., n, and then 1 again. So movement is strictly clockwise. So from any house x, the next is x+1, except when x is n, which wraps to 1.\n\nSo, the movement is always in the clockwise direction. So the distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n if y >=x, otherwise (n - x + y) mod n?\n\nWait, no. Let's see: for example, moving from 4 to 1: 1 is next, so the distance is 1 step. From 3 to 1: you can't go counter-clockwise, so you have to go 3 →4 →1, which is 2 steps.\n\nSo, the minimal steps from x to y is (y - x) % n if y >x, else (n - x + y) % n.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because in a ring of n houses, moving clockwise, the number of steps from x to y is (y - x) mod n, but if y <=x, it's (y -x + n) mod n.\n\nYes, because for x=3 and y=1, the steps are 1 -3 is -2, adding n=4 gives 2, which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula for the steps between x and y is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and can only move clockwise around the ringroad. Each task must be completed in the given order, and she must be at the specified house when it's her turn.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the ringroad is one-way and clockwise, Xenia can only move from house `i` to house `i+1`, with house `n` connecting back to house `1`.\n2. **Task Order**: The tasks are processed in the given order, meaning each task must be completed after all previous ones.\n3. **Path Calculation**: For each task, calculate the shortest path from her current position to the target house, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    # Calculate steps from current to a\n    if a > current:\n        steps = a - current\n    else:\n        steps = (n - current) + a\n    time += steps\n    current = a\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with time 0.\n2. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, determine the shortest path from the current house to the target house.\n3. **Steps Calculation**: If the target house is ahead (clockwise) of the current house, the steps are the difference. If behind, wrap around the ringroad by adding the remaining steps from the end to the target.\n4. **Update Time and Position**: Add the calculated steps to the total time and update the current house to the target house.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always take the minimal path required to complete each task in the given order, efficiently solving the problem within the constraints.",
