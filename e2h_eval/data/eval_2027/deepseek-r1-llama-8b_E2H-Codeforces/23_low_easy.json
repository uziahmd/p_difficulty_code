In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, each with a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). The goal is to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu, which is either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, right. So the task is to determine for each possible initial set what is the minimal number of additional tiles needed.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, \"1s 2s 3s\" is a shuntsu already, so the output for that would be zero.\n\nSo, for each tile in the input, we need to compute the minimal draws required to form at least one mentsu in any way.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says, the output should be three numbers, each corresponding to the minimal draws required for each tile's scenario. Or no, wait, looking back: the input is three strings, and the output is three integers. Oh, perhaps for each of the three possible initial sets, compute the minimal draws. Or maybe the problem is that the three tiles are given, and the output is three numbers, each being the minimal draws for each possible group? Wait, no, the output is a single integer. Wait, no, looking at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, the output is ['0', '0', '1'], which suggests that each of the three input groups is processed, and for each, the minimal draws required is computed. So for the first group, it's 0, the second is 0, the third is 1.\n\nSo the function needs to process each of the three tiles as a separate case, and for each, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu. Then, output three numbers, each on a new line.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says, \"print a single integer\", but in the sample, the output is three numbers. Oh, wait, looking again: the problem says, \"Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\" Wait, but in the sample, the output is three numbers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the sample shows the output as a list of three strings, like ['0', '0', '1']. But according to the problem statement, it says \"print a single integer\". That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the problem is not that the input is three strings, but that the input is a list of three strings. So the output is three integers, each being the minimal draws needed for each of the three cases. Or perhaps it's considering all possibilities when adding tiles to the initial three, but then the output is a single number, which is the minimal across all possibilities. Hmm, no, the sample shows an output of three numbers. So probably, the output is three numbers, each for the three initial sets.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says, \"the only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" So the input is three tiles, and the output is three integers. Each integer corresponds to the minimal number of tiles needed to make each of those three sets into a mentsu. No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the problem is that the three initial tiles are part of a larger collection, and the output is three numbers, each indicating the minimal draws for each tile in the initial set. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the output is a single integer. So perhaps the initial three tiles are considered together, and the output is the minimal number of draws needed for the entire set. But in the sample, the output is three numbers. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the three tiles are separate, and for each of them, we compute the minimal draws to form a mentsu starting from that tile. Or perhaps each tile is treated as a separate hand, and the output is three numbers, each for each tile.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nInput:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nExplanation: In the first case, the three tiles already form a shuntsu (1s,2s,3s), so 0 draws. Second case is a triplet (three 9m), so 0. Third case: she",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand of three tiles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). The goal is to find the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form such a structure.\n\n2. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three strings, each representing a tile. Each tile is identified by a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s).\n\n3. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current set of tiles already forms a mentsu. If it does, no additional tiles are needed.\n\n4. **Generate Possible Combinations**: For each tile, generate all possible combinations of tiles that can be formed by adding 0, 1, 2, or 3 more tiles. Check each combination to see if it forms a valid mentsu.\n\n5. **Determine Minimum Tiles**: For each initial set of tiles, determine the smallest number of additional tiles required to form a valid mentsu. This involves checking all possible sequences and triplets that can be formed with the current tiles and the added ones.\n\n6. **Output the Results**: For each of the three initial sets of tiles, output the minimum number of additional tiles needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_extra_tiles(tiles):\n    # Helper function to check if a given list of tiles forms a mentsu\n    def is_mentsu(tiles_list):\n        from itertools import permutations\n        # Check for triplet\n        for tile in tiles_list:\n            count = tiles_list.count(tile)\n            if count >= 3:\n                return True\n        # Check for sequence in each suit\n        suits = set()\n        for tile in tiles_list:\n            suits.add(tile[1])\n        for suit in suits:\n            numbers = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles_list if t[1] == suit])\n            for i in range(len(numbers) - 2):\n                if numbers[i+1] == numbers[i] + 1 and numbers[i+2] == numbers[i] + 2:\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible tiles that can be added\n    # Each tile can be any of 1m-9m, 1p-9p, 1s-9s\n    # To make it efficient, we can consider the minimal adds\n    # For each initial set, compute the minimal draws needed\n    min_draws = 0\n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Generate all possible ways to add 1, 2, 3 tiles\n        # To avoid redundant work, for each possible draw count, check if any combination works\n        # We'll try adding 1, then 2, then 3 tiles, and return the first possible\n        # So for k in 1,2,3:\n        #   create all possible combinations of k tiles (all possibilities, including duplicates)\n        #   for each combination, add to the initial tiles, sort, and check if is_mentsu\n        # Once found, return k\n        # But to optimize, perhaps we can stop at the first found k\n        for k in range(1,4):\n            new_tiles = tiles.copy()\n            # Generate all possible k tiles (including same as existing)\n            # We can represent each tile as a string, e.g., '1m'\n            from itertools import product\n            possible_adds = []\n            for num in range(1,10):\n                for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n                    possible_adds.append(f\"{num}{suit}\")\n            # Now, generate all combinations of k adds from possible_adds\n            for adds in product(possible_adds, repeat=k):\n                temp = new_tiles + list(adds)\n                if is_mentsu(temp):\n                    return k\n        # If after adding 3 tiles still not found, return 3 (but according to the problem, it's always solvable)\n        return 3\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\ntiles_input = input_line.split()\ntiles_list = [t.strip() for t in tiles_input]\n\n# Process each tile group\nresults = []\nfor group in tiles_list:\n    # Extract the three tiles\n    tiles = group.split()\n    # Ensure exactly three tiles (as per problem statement)\n    # Compute min draws for this group\n    results.append(str(min_extra_tiles(tiles)))\n\n# Print the results\nprint('\\n'.join(results))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves checking each possible set of tiles to determine if they can form a mentsu. The function `is_mentsu` checks for both triplets and sequences. For each initial set of tiles, we generate all possible combinations of additional tiles up to three, checking each time if a valid mentsu can be formed. The minimum number of additional tiles needed is returned for each initial set.",
