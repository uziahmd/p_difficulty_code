    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side (left, right, top, bottom) loses 2 cells. Wait, no— wait, each ring is one cell wide, but when you add another ring, the inner rectangle is reduced by 2 cells on each side? Or is it that each ring is added in such a way that it's one cell in from the previous edge?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: Each ring has a width of 1 cell. The i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w -4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). So for the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. For the second, it's (w-4) x (h-4), because i=2: 4*(2-1) =4 subtracted from each dimension.\n\nSo for each ring i, the rectangle is (w -4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)), and the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) -4. Because for a rectangle with width w and height h, the perimeter is the sum of all cells on the borders. So for each ring i, the number of cells is 2*(a + b) -4, where a is the width and b is the height of the rectangle for that ring.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute the current width as w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute the current height as h -4*(i-1)\n   c. If either width or height is less than or equal to 0, we stop since there can't be any more rings.\n   d. Compute the perimeter: 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   e. Sum all these perimeters for each ring.\n\nBut wait, what if adding k rings makes some of them have zero width or height? Like, for example, when the initial w and h are just enough for k rings.\n\nWe need to make sure that for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. Because a rectangle must have at least 3 cells in each dimension to form a ring (since a ring requires at least 1 cell on each side). Wait, no. Let's think: the rectangle for the i-th ring must be at least 3x3, because otherwise, the perimeter would not form a proper ring.\n\nWait, wait. For a rectangle to have a perimeter (i.e., a ring), it needs to have at least 1 row and 1 column on each side. So, the width and height after subtraction must be >= 3 for each ring.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the current_w is 3, then the ring would be a single line around a 3x3 square. But that's correct because the perimeter is 8, which matches the first example.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w -4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nIf current_w < 3 or current_h < 3, then that ring cannot exist. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. So we don't have to handle cases where a ring can't be formed. So in our code, perhaps we can assume that for all i up to k, current_w and current_h are >=3.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   \n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   total += perimeter\n\nPrint total\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1\n\nFor i=1:\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h=3.\n\nperimeter = 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:7 9 1.\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9.\n\nperimeter=2*(7+9)-4=32-4=28. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird example:7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7 and 9 → 28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 =16-4=12.\n\nTotal is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if k is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nWhat about when k is larger than possible? But according to the problem statement, the input ensures that k is valid, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe input is given as a single line with three integers. So, read the line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nCompute the sum as described.\n\nThen print the total as an integer string.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead the input line: line = input().strip()\nw, h, k = map(int, line.split())\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) -4\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting with the samples:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1 →28.\n\nSample3:7 9 2 →40.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=7, h=7, k=2.\n\nRing1: 7x7 → perimeter 2*(14) -4=24.\n\nRing2: 3x3 → 8.\n\nTotal 32.\n\nSo output is 32.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nRing1:5x5 → 16.\n\nRing2:1x1? No, wait, 5-4=1. So current_w=1, current_h=1. Wait, but 1x1 is a single cell. So the perimeter would be 2*(1+1) -4= 4-4=0. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, wait! Oh no, wait. Because for a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 1 cell (just the single cell). But according to the formula, it gives 0. So there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, this suggests that my approach is incorrect for certain cases.\n\nHmm, perhaps my understanding of the ring is wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says: the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)).\n\nWait, for a 3x3 rectangle, the perimeter is 8. For a 5x5, it's 16. For a 1x1, the inner rectangle is 1x1, which has no perimeter— the border is zero cells.\n\nBut that's impossible because the problem statement says that each ring is a border, but for a 1x1, the border is zero cells. So, perhaps, the formula is correct, but only applies when the current_w and current_h are >=3.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem allows k up to floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So, for example, w=5, h=5.\n\nmin(w,h) is 5. (5+1)/4 is 6/4=1.5 → floor is 1. So k can be 1.\n\nThus, in that case, the second ring is not considered.\n\nWait, but suppose someone inputs k=2 for w=5, h=5. According to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to have k within the allowed maximum, so perhaps I don't have to handle that case.\n\nWait, but in the code, when current_w becomes 1, the perimeter is 0, but perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. So, for a 1x1 rectangle, the border is zero cells. So the code correctly adds 0 for that ring.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input constraints ensure that k is such that all rings can be formed. So, for w=5, h=5, k can be 1. So the second ring is not considered. So in the code, when i=2, current_w=5-4=1, which is allowed only if k=1, but in that case, i runs from 1 to k=1, so the loop doesn't process i=2.\n\nSo perhaps the code is correct.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem statement says that k is at most floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see why.\n\nBecause each ring reduces the dimensions by 4. So the maximum number of rings is determined by how many times 4 fits into min(w, h) + something.\n\nWait, let's see. For a rectangle of w x h, each ring reduces both dimensions by 4. So the number of possible rings is the maximum i such that w -4*(i-1) >= 3 and h -4*(i-1)>=3. Because each ring requires the inner rectangle to have at least 3 cells on each side to form a perimeter.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So the condition is that for each i, current_w >=3 and current_h >=3.\n\nSo the maximum possible rings is the largest i where both (w -4*(i-1)) >=3 and (h -4*(i-1))>=3.\n\nSo, for w=5, h=5:\n\ni=1: 5 >=3 yes.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1 <3 → can't have a second ring.\n\nSo the maximum k is 1.\n\nSo, in the code, when processing i=2, it's not allowed.\n\nSo, the code is correct as written because the input ensures that for all i<=k, the current_w and current_h are >=3.\n\nWait, but in the code, when i=1, current_w = w, which is >=3, so it's okay.\n\nSo, for the code, it's safe.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the case where current_w=3 and current_h=3, which is okay.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=7, h=9, k=2.\n\nAs in the third example.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: w=3, h=3, k=1 → 8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=7, h=11, k=2.\n\ni=1: 7x11 → perimeter 2*(18) -4=32.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 11-4=7 → perimeter 2*(10) -4=16.\n\nTotal 48.\n\nSo the code returns 48.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings.
