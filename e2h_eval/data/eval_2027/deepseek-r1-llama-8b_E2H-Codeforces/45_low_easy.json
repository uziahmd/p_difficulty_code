There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, so for example, when n is 3, the winner can play two games: first against someone (say player 2), then against another (player 3). Wait, no. Because after playing one game, the winner has played once. The next opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games as well. So yes, that's possible.\n\nAnother example: when n is 10, the output is 4. How does that happen? Oh right, because the structure of the tournament allows the winner to play four matches. So maybe the solution involves figuring out a pattern or mathematical approach to find the maximum games.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. For the winner to play as many games as possible, they need to keep winning each time, and each opponent must be such that their game counts are compatible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is determined by finding the largest Fibonacci-like sequence that fits into n. Because each step requires that the next opponent has played either the same or one less than the current number of games. So the series would go like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as finding the maximum k such that the sum of the first k+1 Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n. Or perhaps not exactly Fibonacci, but some similar recursive relation.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. To maximize the number of games the winner plays, each match they play should be against someone who has either the same number of previous games or one less. But since it's a knockout, the winner must eliminate all opponents along the way.\n\nSo, suppose the maximum number of games the winner can play is m. Then, the opponent in the m-th game must have m-1 games played before, because the difference can't be more than one. But wait, no: the rule is that in each game, the two players' current game counts differ by at most one. So the winner's count can be one more than the opponent's, or vice versa.\n\nWait, no. Because the winner could have played more games than the opponent. So for each step, the next opponent can have either the same number of games as the winner or one less.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as a tree. Each time the winner plays, they add a layer. So the number of players needed for the winner to have m games is the sum of the first m+1 terms in a certain sequence.\n\nWait, let's see for small m:\n\nm=0: just the winner, no games. Not applicable since n is at least 2.\n\nm=1: the winner plays one game, so needs at least 2 players.\n\nm=2: the winner must have played two games. Each game requires an opponent. So for the first game, opponent has 0 games. For the second game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 game. But wait, the opponent in the first game is eliminated, so the second opponent must have played one game. So the total players required for m=2 is 3.\n\nBecause:\n\nGame 1: winner (1) vs someone (2). Both have 0 games before this. So after this, winner has 1, opponent 2 has 1.\n\nGame 2: winner (1) vs someone else (3). Now, opponent 3 has 0 games. So the winner can play against them because 1-0=1 <=1. So yes.\n\nThus, for m=2, total players needed is 3.\n\nFor m=3: what's needed?\n\nThe third game's opponent must have either 2 or 1 games. But the opponent in the second game had 1, but was eliminated. So the third opponent must have played 2 games.\n\nWait, no. Because each opponent is defeated and thus can't play again. So the path for the winner is a chain where each opponent has one less than the previous step.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is determined by the largest k such that Fib(k+2) ≤ n, where Fib is the Fibonacci sequence starting with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=2.\n\nWait, let me think about the minimal number of players required for m games.\n\nEach game adds an opponent. The first game requires 2 players (winner + 1). The second game requires 3 players (winner + 2). Wait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is the sum of the first `k+2` Fibonacci numbers. This is because each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has either played the same number of games or one less than the winner.\n\nWe can use a loop to compute the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where the next Fibonacci number exceeds the given number of players, `n`. The largest number of games the winner can play is then determined by finding the largest index where the cumulative Fibonacci sum is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_games(n):\n    fib = [1, 2]\n    total = 3\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_fib > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_fib)\n        total += next_fib\n    return total - fib[-1]\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation:** We initialize a Fibonacci sequence starting with 1 and 2. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.\n3. **Cumulative Sum Check:** We keep adding Fibonacci numbers until the next number would exceed `n`.\n4. **Determine Maximum Games:** The result is derived from the cumulative sum of the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where the next Fibonacci number would exceed `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum number of games the winner can play by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 1018`.",
