    "thought": "Okay, I'm trying to solve this competitive programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is about directed graphs and something called p-reachable. The problem asks for two things: the minimum number of nodes needed to create a p-reachable graph, and among all such minimal graphs, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet me break down the definitions.\n\nFirst, an ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So, it's a directed edge in a way that's one-way.\n\nA p-reachable directed graph has exactly p such ordered pairs where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Wait, so these are edges that go both ways but only count once? Or wait, no. Because if u can reach v and v can reach u, then (u, v) would not be unidirectional. So, the p refers to the number of bidirectional edges that satisfy u < v? Or wait, no—wait, no. Because u < v implies that (u, v) is considered as an unordered pair, but since the graph is directed, (u, v) could have a path and (v, u) could have a path or not.\n\nWait, the definition says: p is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u ≠ v, there exists a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. But wait, no, the condition is that u and v are reachable from each other. So, in other words, u can reach v and v can reach u, but that's not possible because if they can reach each other, then (v, u) is also a path. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"p-reachable\" is when the graph contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each unordered pair {u, v}, if both (u, v) and (v, u) are present as paths, then this counts as one pair towards p. But since (u, v) and (v, u) are both possible, but u < v, so each such pair contributes 1 to p.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: a directed graph is called p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\n\nWait, so for each unordered pair {u, v} where u < v, if both u can reach v and v can reach u, then (u, v) is counted once towards p. If u can reach v but v cannot reach u, then (u, v) is not counted because u and v are not mutually reachable.\n\nWait, no. Because the condition is that u and v are reachable from each other. So, for (u, v), u must be able to reach v, and v must be able to reach u. Because otherwise, the pair wouldn't be counted. So, each unordered pair {u, v} where u < v and u and v can reach each other contributes exactly one to p.\n\nSo, the total p is equal to the number of such unordered pairs {u, v} where u < v and u and v are in a mutual reachable relationship.\n\nNow, the goal is to find the minimal number of nodes required to create such a graph with exactly p such pairs.\n\nAdditionally, among all such minimal-node graphs, find the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo, the first part is to find the minimal n such that the graph has exactly p of these mutual pairs.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nEach such mutual pair {u, v} (with u < v) contributes 1 to p. So, the total p is equal to the number of such mutual pairs.\n\nIn a directed graph, if u can reach v and v can reach u, then the pair contributes 1. So, the graph is made up of strongly connected components (SCCs). For each SCC that is a single node, it doesn't contribute anything. But for each SCC that consists of multiple nodes, say k nodes, then within the SCC, each pair of nodes contributes 1 to p because they can reach each other.\n\nWait, no. Because for an SCC of size k, the number of unordered pairs {u, v} where u < v is C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2. So, the total p is the sum over all SCCs of C(k_i, 2), where k_i is the size of the i-th SCC.\n\nSo, the problem reduces",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and, among all such graphs with this minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**:\n   - A p-reachable graph contains exactly `p` unordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v`, and both `u` can reach `v` and `v` can reach `u`.\n\n2. **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**:\n   - Each SCC contributes to the count of `p` by the number of unordered pairs within it. For an SCC of size `k`, it contributes `k*(k-1)/2` pairs.\n\n3. **Finding Minimum Nodes**:\n   - The goal is to find the smallest `n` such that the sum of contributions from all SCCs equals `p`.\n\n4. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**:\n   - To maximize unidirectional pairs, we should minimize the number of edges within SCCs, as each edge within an SCC reduces the potential for unidirectional pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_min_nodes(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return (0, 0)\n    \n    # Find the minimal n such that sum_{i} C(k_i, 2) = p\n    # We need to maximize the sum C(k_i, 2), which for fixed sum k_i = m, is achieved when one component is as large as possible.\n    # Alternatively, for minimal n, we can model this as finding the maximal number of components with k=1, then k=2, etc., but here since we need to find minimal n, perhaps we can think differently.\n\n    # Wait, no. To find minimal n for given p, we can model it as the problem of partitioning p into sums of C(k,2), where each term is the contribution of an SCC.\n\n    # Let me think: C(k,2) = k*(k-1)/2. So, for each SCC, it contributes a certain number of pairs.\n\n    # The minimal n is the minimal number of nodes such that the sum over all SCCs' C(k, 2) equals p.\n\n    # So, we need to find the minimal n where there exists a partition of p into terms t_i, where each t_i is C(k_i, 2), and the sum of k_i is n.\n\n    # To minimize n, we want to maximize the number of pairs contributed by each SCC. So, the minimal n is achieved when the sizes of the SCCs are as large as possible.\n\n    # Since C(k,2) increases with k, the more pairs we get per node, the better. So, the minimal n is the smallest integer where the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals p.\n\n    # Let's model this as solving for the largest possible s where s(s-1)/2 <= p. Because the largest possible contribution comes from a single SCC of size s.\n\n    # If s(s-1)/2 >= p, then maybe we can have a single SCC of size s.\n\n    # Otherwise, split into two or more components.\n\n    # For example, if p = 3, the largest s is 3, because 3*2/2=3, so n=3.\n\n    # For p=6, s=4 because 4*3/2=6, so n=4.\n\n    # For p=5, s=3, 3*2/2=3, remaining 2. Next, another SCC of size 2 contributes 1, total 3+1=4 <5. So we need to add another SCC of size 2: 3+1+1=5. So n=3+2+2=7? Wait, no, because 3+2 gives us 3*2/2 + 2*1/2 = 3+1=4, not 5. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\n    # Alternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum of C(k_i,2) is at least p, but that doesn't seem right.\n\n    # Wait, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal number such that the sum of C(k_i,2) >= p, but no, that's not correct. Because we need exactly p.\n\n    # Let's think differently. Let's consider that each SCC contributes C(k,2) pairs. So, the problem is to find a set of integers {k_1, k_2, ..., k_m} such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals p, and the sum of k_i is minimized.\n\n    # So, to minimize the sum of k_i, we need to maximize the C(k_i, 2) per unit increase in k_i. This happens when each k_i is as large as possible.\n\n    # Therefore, the strategy is to have as few SCCs as possible, each as large as possible.\n\n    # So, first, find the largest s where s*(s-1)/2 <= p.\n\n    # Then, see how much remains.\n\n    # For example, p=3: s=3, rem=0. So n=3.\n\n    # p=4: s=3, rem=1. So we take another SCC of size 2, which contributes 1. Total sum 3+1=4. So n=3+2=5.\n\n    # p=5: s=3, rem=2. Take another SCC of size 2 (contributes 1), rem=1. Then another SCC of size 2 (but that would contribute 1, making total 3+1+1=5). So n=3+2+2=7.\n\n    # Wait, but 3+2+2=7, but perhaps there's a better way. Maybe split the remaining 2 into one SCC of size 2 and another of size 1, but that would contribute 1+0=1, which isn't enough.\n\n    # So, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal number of nodes needed to express p as a sum of C(k_i, 2).\n\n    # So, let's find the minimal n such that p can be written as the sum of some C(k_i, 2), and sum k_i = n.\n\n    # Let's try to find the minimal n by considering the maximal possible contributions.\n\n    # Let's find the maximum s where s(s-1)/2 <= p.\n\n    # Then, the remaining p' = p - s(s-1)/2.\n\n    # Now, for the remaining p', we can form it with smaller components.\n\n    # Each component of size 2 contributes 1, size 3 contributes 3, etc.\n\n    # Let's think about the remaining p'.\n\n    # Let's start with the largest possible s where s(s-1)/2 <= p.\n\n    # Then, if p' is 0, done.\n\n    # Else, for p' > 0:\n\n    # The next possible contribution is from a component of size 2, contributing 1.\n\n    # If p' >=1, we can add a component of size 2, which contributes 1, and now p' -=1.\n\n    # Repeat until p' is zero.\n\n    # Wait, but perhaps larger components can give more contributions.\n\n    # For example, p'=3 can be achieved by a component of size 3, contributing 3, which is better than adding three components of size 2 (each contributing 1, totaling 3, but sum k_i is 6).\n\n    # So, perhaps it's better to always take the largest possible component for the remaining p'.\n\n    # So, let's formalize:\n\n    # 1. Find the largest s where s(s-1)/2 <= p. Call this s_max.\n\n    # 2. Subtract s_max*(s_max-1)/2 from p to get p_remaining.\n\n    # 3. Now, for p_remaining, find the largest possible t where t(t-1)/2 <= p_remaining. Add t to the nodes, subtract t(t-1)/2 from p_remaining.\n\n    # 4. Repeat until p_remaining is 0.\n\n    # The sum of all the s and t's is the minimal n.\n\n    # Let's test this approach.\n\n    # Example 1: p=3.\n\n    # s_max =3, p_remaining=0. So n=3.\n\n    # Example 2: p=4.\n\n    # s_max=3, p_remaining=1.\n\n    # Now, find largest t where t(t-1)/2 <=1: t=2 (contribution 1). So p_remaining becomes 0. n=3+2=5.\n\n    # Example 3: p=5.\n\n    # s_max=3, contribution 3, p_remaining=2.\n\n    # Now, find largest t where t(t-1)/2 <=2: t=2 (contribution 1). p_remaining=1.\n\n    # Then, find largest t where t(t-1)/2 <=1: t=2 (contribution 1). p_remaining=0. So n=3+2+2=7.\n\n    # But wait, 3+2+2=7, but is there a better way? Like 3+3? No, because 3+3=6, but their contributions sum to 3+3=6, which is larger than 5.\n\n    # Hmm, no. So the approach seems to work.\n\n    # Another example: p=6.\n\n    # s_max=4, contribution 6. p_remaining=0. So n=4.\n\n    # For p=7:\n\n    # s_max=4, contribution 6. p_remaining=1.\n\n    # Then, add a component of size 2: contribution 1. So n=4+2=6.\n\n    # So, the minimal n for p=7 is 6.\n\n    # Let's see if that's correct.\n\n    # The SCCs would be of sizes 4 and 2. Their contributions are 6+1=7.\n\n    # Yes.\n\n    # So, the approach is:\n\n    # 1. While p > 0:\n\n    #     a. Find the largest s where s(s-1)/2 <= p.\n\n    #     b. Add s to the nodes.\n\n    #     c. Subtract s(s-1)/2 from p.\n\n    # 2. Sum all the s's added to get n.\n\n    # Now, for the maximum number of unidirectional pairs, we need to arrange the graph such that as few edges as possible are within each SCC, allowing for more unidirectional edges between different SCCs.\n\n    # The maximum number of unidirectional pairs occurs when the graph has as many possible edges as possible that go from one SCC to another, without reciprocation.\n\n    # So, after determining the minimal n, we need to structure the graph into its SCCs, and then connect them in a way that maximizes the unidirectional edges between them.\n\n    # The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved when each pair of distinct SCCs is connected in a single direction, i.e., all edges go from one to the other, but not vice versa.\n\n    # The number of such unidirectional pairs is the product of the sizes of all ordered pairs of distinct SCCs, minus any reciprocal edges.\n\n    # However, since we want the maximum, we can arrange that every possible edge from a larger SCC to a smaller one is present, and none in the reverse.\n\n    # The exact calculation involves summing over all i < j (size_i * size_j).\n\n    # So, the maximum unidirectional pairs is the sum of size_i * size_j for all i < j, where the sizes are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n    # For example, if the sizes are [a, b, c], then the maximum unidirectional pairs is a*b + a*c + b*c.\n\n    # So, putting it all together:\n\n    # Given p, compute the minimal n by greedily taking the largest possible SCC contributions.\n\n    # Then, compute the maximum unidirectional pairs by arranging the sizes in a way that maximizes the product of their sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_min_nodes(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return (0, 0)\n    \n    n = 0\n    remaining = p\n    \n    while remaining > 0:\n        # Find the largest s where s(s-1)/2 <= remaining\n        s = int((1 + (1 + 8 * remaining)) // 2)\n        while s * (s - 1) // 2 > remaining:\n            s -= 1\n        n += s\n        remaining -= s * (s - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Now, we need to compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n    # To maximize, arrange the components in decreasing order, and connect them in a linear chain.\n    # The maximum is the sum of products of all pairs in the order.\n    # For example, if the components are a >= b >= c >= ... >= z, the max is a*b + a*c + ... + b*c + ...\n    # How to compute this efficiently?\n    \n    # Compute the product sum.\n    # One efficient way is to sort the sizes in descending order, then compute the sum of products of all pairs.\n    \n    sizes = []\n    # Extract the components' sizes from the computation above.\n    # Wait, no, in our approach, the components are built by taking s as large as possible each time.\n    # So, the sizes are in non-increasing order.\n    # For example, for p=5, the sizes are [3, 2], sum is 5.\n    \n    # So, sizes is a list where each element is the size s taken each step.\n    # So, we can proceed directly.\n    \n    # Compute the sum of s_i * s_j for all i < j.\n    max_uni = 0\n    for i in range(len(sizes)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(sizes)):\n            max_uni += sizes[i] * sizes[j]\n    \n    return (n, max_uni)\n\np = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\nmin_n, max_uni = compute_min_nodes(p)\nprint(f\"{min_n} {max_uni}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single integer `p`.\n2. **Compute Minimum Nodes**:\n   - The function `compute_min_nodes` calculates the minimal number of nodes `n` by iteratively finding the largest possible SCC that contributes to `p`.\n3. **Compute Maximum Unidirectional Pairs**:\n   - After determining the minimal `n`, the function calculates the maximum number of unidirectional pairs by considering the sizes of the SCCs and summing the products of all pairs of different SCCs.\n4. **Output**: The results are printed as two integers.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimal number of nodes required and maximize the number of unidirectional pairs efficiently.",
