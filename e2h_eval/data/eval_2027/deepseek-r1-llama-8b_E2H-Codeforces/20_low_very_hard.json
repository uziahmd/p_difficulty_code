For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about binary strings and choosing certain values for each string such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: We have n, k, f as inputs. We need to consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to n. For each string s, we choose a c_s between 0 and k. Then, a multiset is beautiful if, for every possible binary string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. Our goal is to find the number of ways to choose these c_s values such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nWait, okay. So the key is that when we set all the c_s's, the largest possible beautiful multiset size is f. And we have to count how many such c_s assignments exist.\n\nHmm, but how do we model this? It seems like we need to compute for each possible assignment of c_s's whether the maximum size is f, and then sum those up.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 15, the number of possible strings is 2^15 = 32768, which is manageable. But k and f are up to 2e5, so we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about what defines the maximum size of the beautiful multiset.\n\nFor each string s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of all extensions of s. Because any extension would have s as a prefix.\n\nWait, more precisely: For a given string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the sum over all t where s is a prefix of t, of the count of t in the multiset.\n\nSo, for the multiset to be beautiful, for every s, the sum of counts of all t that start with s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints on all these sums. So the problem reduces to selecting c_s's such that the maximum possible sum over all s of (sum of t starting with s) is exactly f.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum for each s is constrained to be ≤ c_s. The maximum possible total size is the sum over s of min(c_s, ...). Wait, not exactly. Because the constraints are interdependent. For example, if s is a prefix of t, then the sum for t includes the count of t, which also contributes to s's sum.\n\nSo it's not straightforward. The constraints form a hierarchical structure because longer strings depend on their shorter prefixes.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of counting the number of valid colorings under certain constraints, but with a hierarchical structure.\n\nI remember that for problems involving hierarchical constraints, dynamic programming (DP) on the trie structure might be useful. Because each node in the trie represents a string, and its children are its extensions.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this using a DP approach where we build the trie from the leaves (longest strings) up to the root (empty string). Or perhaps from the root down, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since each c_s affects all its suffixes, perhaps we can model the problem by considering each string in order of decreasing length. Because a longer string is a prefix of fewer strings than a shorter one.\n\nWait, for example, the empty string is a prefix of all strings. A string of length 1 is a prefix of some longer strings, and so on.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to process the strings in order of increasing length, setting c_s such that the constraints are satisfied, and track the maximum possible size.\n\nBut how does that tie into the count of valid c_s assignments?\n\nAnother approach: The problem requires that the maximum possible beautiful multiset size is exactly f. So for each possible assignment of c_s, we can compute the maximum possible size, and then count all assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut computing this for each assignment is computationally impossible because there are way too many possibilities.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the sum of the minimums along the paths from the root to each node in the trie.\n\nWait, wait. The maximum beautiful multiset size is the sum over all nodes s of the minimal value in the path from the root to s, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. Because each node s has a constraint c_s. The sum of all the counts for the strings that have s as a prefix cannot exceed c_s. But the counts for the children of s (strings that extend s) also affect s's sum.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined",
