Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any will do.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, given a regular polygon with n sides, we need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on the sides adjacent to v2. The angle at v2 should be as close to 'a' degrees as possible. And among all possible angles, we need the one that's closest, and if there's a tie, any solution is acceptable.\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, each internal angle is known. For a regular polygon with n sides, each internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. So maybe the possible angles that can be formed by choosing three consecutive points could be either the internal angle or some other angle based on the steps between the points.\n\nWait no, because when you select three points, they form an angle which depends on the positions of the points. For example, in a square (n=4), selecting three consecutive points would give an angle of 90 degrees. But if you skip a point, like selecting points 1, 3, 4, then the angle at 3 would be 45 degrees.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet of points (v1, v2, v3), we calculate the angle at v2 and see how close it is to 'a'. Then, we pick the triplet(s) with the minimal difference.\n\nBut with n up to 105, iterating through all possible triplets might not be feasible because the number of combinations is O(n^3), which for n=105 is about a million and something. Wait, 105 choose 3 is 105*104*103/(6) which is 105*104*103 / 6 = let's see: 105*104 is 10920, times 103 is 1122860, divided by 6 is around 187,380. That's manageable for Python, right? Because even in the worst case, that's about 200k iterations, which is nothing for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible triplets of distinct vertices (v1, v2, v3).\n2. For each triplet, compute the angle at v2.\n3. Compute the absolute difference between this angle and 'a'.\n4. Keep track of the triplet(s) with the smallest difference.\n5. After checking all triplets, output the triplet with the smallest difference. If multiple, any can be chosen.\n\nWait, but wait. How do we compute the angle at v2 for a given triplet?\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angle between two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So, the angle between two vertices k apart is 360*k/n degrees.\n\nBut when considering the angle formed by three points, the angle at v2 is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nLet me think: suppose the polygon is arranged in a circle. Each vertex is equally spaced around the circle. So, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc from v1 to v3, but the way it's measured depends on the order.\n\nWait, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n\nSo, for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 is (arc_length / 2), where arc_length is the measure of the arc that isn't containing v2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, suppose the three points are v1, v2, v3 in order around the polygon. Then, the angle at v2 is formed by the arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it, which is the sum of the arcs from v3 to v1, but going the other way around the circle.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the polygon as being on a unit circle. Then, each vertex has a position at (cos(theta), sin(theta)), where theta is (2*pi*(k-1))/n radians, for k from 1 to n.\n\nThen, given three points v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 can be computed using vector math. The vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 can be used to find the angle between them.\n\nYes, that's a more precise approach. So, for each triplet, we can compute the angle at v2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves generating all possible triplets of vertices and computing the angle at each vertex for each triplet. We then select the triplet with the smallest difference between the computed angle and 'a'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate Triplets**: Iterate through all possible triplets of vertices (v1, v2, v3) where each vertex is distinct.\n2. **Compute Angles**: For each triplet, compute the angle at v2 using vector math. This involves calculating the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 and finding the angle between these vectors.\n3. **Track Minimum Difference**: Keep track of the triplet with the smallest absolute difference between the computed angle and 'a'. If multiple triplets have the same minimum difference, any can be chosen.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\nmin_diff = float('inf')\nbest_triplet = None\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for d1 in range(1, n):\n        if v2 == d1:\n            continue\n        v1 = (v2 - d1) % n\n        for d2 in range(1, n):\n            if v2 == d2 or d2 == d1:\n                continue\n            v3 = (v2 + d2) % n\n            if v3 <= v1:\n                continue\n            # Compute vectors\n            theta1 = 2 * math.pi * (v1 - 1) / n\n            theta2 = 2 * math.pi * (v2 - 1) / n\n            theta3 = 2 * math.pi * (v3 - 1) / n\n            # Vector from v2 to v1\n            vector_v1 = (math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1))\n            # Vector from v2 to v3\n            vector_v3 = (math.cos(theta3), math.sin(theta3))\n            # Compute angle between vectors\n            dot_product = vector_v1[0] * vector_v3[0] + vector_v1[1] * vector_v3[1]\n            magnitude_v1 = math.hypot(vector_v1[0], vector_v1[1])\n            magnitude_v3 = math.hypot(vector_v3[0], vector_v3[1])\n            if magnitude_v1 == 0 or magnitude_v3 == 0:\n                angle = 180\n            else:\n                cos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_v1 * magnitude_v3)\n                angle = math.acos(cos_theta)\n            # Convert to degrees\n            angle_deg = math.degrees(angle)\n            diff = abs(angle_deg - a)\n            if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and not best_triplet):\n                min_diff = diff\n                best_triplet = (v1 + 1, v2, v3 + 1)\n\nprint(f\"{best_triplet[0]} {best_triplet[1]} {best_triplet[2]}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Generating Triplets**: We loop through each vertex as the middle vertex (v2). For each v2, we consider possible positions for v1 and v3 by stepping around the polygon clockwise and counterclockwise.\n- **Vector Math**: Using the positions of the vertices on the unit circle, we calculate the vectors from v2 to v1 and v3. The angle between these vectors gives the angle at v2.\n- **Finding Minimum Difference**: For each computed angle, we determine how close it is to 'a' and keep track of the triplet with the smallest difference. If there are multiple triplets with the same minimum difference, any can be selected.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible angles and find the optimal solution within the constraints.",
