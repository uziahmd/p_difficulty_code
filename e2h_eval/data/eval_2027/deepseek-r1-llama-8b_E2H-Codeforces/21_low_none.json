The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. The goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the keys. Each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by only one key. \n\nThe condition for a key j and chest i is that a_i + b_j must be odd. So, the sum needs to be congruent to 1 mod 2. That means either a_i is even and b_j is odd, or vice versa.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I need to figure out is how to pair the keys and chests in such a way that as many chests as possible are opened.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since each key can only be used once, and each chest can only be unlocked once, the problem reduces to matching the keys to chests in a way that satisfies the parity condition.\n\nI think the key here is to count how many chests have even a_i and how many have odd a_i. Similarly, count how many keys have even b_j and how many have odd b_j.\n\nWait, because for a key to open a chest, the sum must be odd. So:\n\n- If the key is even (b_j is even), then the chest must be odd (a_i is odd) for their sum to be odd.\n- If the key is odd (b_j is odd), then the chest must be even (a_i is even) for the sum to be odd.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i values in the chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j values in the keys.\n3. Then, determine how to best match the keys and chests based on parity.\n\nLet's denote:\n- even_a = number of chests with a_i even\n- odd_a = n - even_a\n- even_b = number of keys with b_j even\n- odd_b = m - even_b\n\nNow, for the keys, we can have two types: even and odd. For each type, we can use them to unlock chests of the opposite parity.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use as many even keys as possible to unlock odd chests.\n- Use as many odd keys as possible to unlock even chests.\n\nBut wait, the order in which we process these could affect the total. Or maybe not, since it's optimal to take the maximum possible.\n\nWait, let's model this. Let's say:\n\nThe maximum number of chests that can be unlocked is the sum of the minimum between the available keys of one parity and the available chests of the opposite parity.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can only be used once. So, the process is:\n\n- The number of chests that can be unlocked by even keys is the minimum of even_b and the number of odd_a chests.\nSimilarly, the number of chests that can be unlocked by odd keys is the minimum of odd_b and even_a.\n\nBut wait, but each key can be used only once, so we have to allocate the keys optimally.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of chests is the sum of the min(even_b, odd_a) and the min(odd_b, even_a). But no, that can't be right because if you have overlapping possibilities, like using some even keys to unlock odd chests, and others to unlock even chests. Hmm, no, because each key is either even or odd, and each chest is either even or odd. So the two cases are separate.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nSuppose there are 3 even keys and 5 odd chests. We can use 3 even keys to unlock 3 odd chests.\n\nThen, separately, if there are 4 odd keys and 2 even chests, we can use 2 odd keys to unlock 2 even chests.\n\nSo total is 3+2=5.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the counts of even_a, odd_a, even_b, odd_b.\n\n2. Compute the number of chests that can be unlocked by even keys: this is the minimum between even_b and odd_a.\n\n3. Compute the number of chests that can be unlocked by odd keys: this is the minimum between odd_b and even_a.\n\n4. The total is the sum of these two numbers.\n\nWait, but wait! What if the sum exceeds the total number of chests? No, because each chest can be unlocked at most once. So for example, if all keys are used, but some chests are left unopened.\n\nWait, no, because the sum is adding two separate contributions. Because each contribution is from different parities.\n\nFor example, the even_b is used to unlock odd_a chests, and the odd_b is used to unlock even_a chests. These are entirely separate sets of chests, unless a chest is both even and odd, which is impossible.\n\nAh, right",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using given keys. Each key can unlock a specific type of chest based on their parity (odd or even).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd values in both the chests and keys.\n2. **Match Keys to Chests**: Use even keys to unlock odd chests and odd keys to unlock even chests. This ensures that each key is used optimally to maximize the number of chests opened.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Opened Chests**: Compute the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by considering the minimum of available keys and chests of opposite parity for each key type.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n, m = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_a = n - even_a\n    \n    even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_b = m - even_b\n    \n    # Use even keys to unlock odd chests\n    use_even_key = min(even_b, odd_a)\n    # Use odd keys to unlock even chests\n    use_odd_key = min(odd_b, even_a)\n    \n    total = use_even_key + use_odd_key\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of values on chests `a`, and the list of values on keys `b`.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We count how many chests have even values (`even_a`) and how many have odd values (`odd_a`). Similarly, we count the even and odd values among the keys.\n3. **Matching Keys to Chests**: We determine the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked using even keys by taking the minimum of the number of even keys and the number of odd chests. Similarly, we determine the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked using odd keys.\n4. **Summing Up**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the two matched values from the previous step.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and optimally use the keys to unlock the maximum number of chests, leveraging the properties of parity to ensure correctness.",
