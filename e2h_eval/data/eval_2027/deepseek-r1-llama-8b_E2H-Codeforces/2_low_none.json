Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Valera's paper is a square with side length n, which is odd. Each cell has a letter. The teacher considers it as forming an 'X' if two conditions are met:\n\n1. Both diagonals (the main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right and the other diagonal from top-right to bottom-left) consist of the same letters all along their length.\n2. All the other cells (not on either diagonal) must be the same letter, and this letter must be different from the ones on the diagonals.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check that both diagonals are the same character. Then, check that all non-diagonal cells are the same, but a different character.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, for each test case (each input), I need to:\n\n- Read the grid. Since the input is given as lines, each line represents a row in the grid. For example, the first sample input is 5x5, with each line being 5 characters.\n\nSo, the first step is to read the grid correctly. Wait, the input is given as the first line being n, followed by n lines, each containing n characters. So, for each test case, I can read the next n lines into a grid.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I need to process it.\n\nStep 1: Check the two diagonals.\n\nFor the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right), each cell (i,j) where i == j must have the same character.\n\nSimilarly, the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left), each cell (i,j) where i + j = n - 1 (since it's zero-based or one-based?) Hmm, need to clarify indices.\n\nWait, in programming, we often use zero-based indices, but sometimes people use one-based. So I need to decide. Let's assume the grid is stored as a list of lists, where grid[i][j] is the ith row and jth column, starting from 0.\n\nThen, for the main diagonal, the cells are (0,0), (1,1), ..., (n-1, n-1).\n\nFor the anti-diagonal, the cells are (0, n-1), (1, n-2), ..., (n-1, 0).\n\nSo, for both diagonals, I need to collect all their characters and see if they are all the same.\n\nWait, but the problem says that both diagonals must consist of the same letters. So, the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must have the same character each.\n\nWait no. Wait, the first condition is that on both diagonals, all letters are the same. So the main diagonal must consist of all the same character, say c, and the anti-diagonal must consist of all the same character, which must also be c.\n\nSo first, I should check if all the main diagonal elements are the same, and all the anti-diagonal elements are the same. Then, these two must be equal.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says \"both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So each diagonal must consist of the same letter, and the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\nSo, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x's, and the anti-diagonal is all 'x's, then that's good. But if the main diagonal is all 'x's and anti-diagonal is all 'o's, then it's invalid.\n\nSo first, I need to get the main diagonal's character and the anti-diagonal's character. If they are not the same, then it's automatically 'NO'.\n\nSecond, after ensuring that the two diagonals are made of the same character, I need to ensure that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same, but different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Check that all cells in the main diagonal are the same. Let's call this character d.\n\n2. Check that all cells in the anti-diagonal are the same, and that d is equal to the anti-diagonal's character.\n\n3. Then, check that all other cells (i.e., those not on either diagonal) are the same, and that this common character is different from d.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output 'YES', else 'NO'.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next n lines, each line being a string of length n. So, grid is a list of n strings.\n\nThen, collect all the main diagonal cells:\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n\nSimilarly, collect all the anti-diagonal cells:\n\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The grid must satisfy specific conditions regarding its diagonals and non-diagonal cells.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** First, read the integer `n` which specifies the size of the grid. Then, read the next `n` lines, each containing `n` characters, forming the grid.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** \n   - Extract the characters along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).\n   - Extract the characters along the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n   - Ensure that all characters in both diagonals are the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells:** \n   - Collect all characters from cells not on either diagonal.\n   - Ensure all these characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Output Result:** If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if all elements in a list are the same\ndef all_same(lst):\n    return len(set(lst)) == 1\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nif not all_same(main_diag) or not all_same(anti_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check the rest of the cells\nother_chars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not all_same(other_chars):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif other_chars[0] == main_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The grid is read into a list of strings where each string represents a row.\n2. **Diagonal Check:** We check if all characters on both diagonals are the same by converting lists of diagonal characters into sets and checking their lengths.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check:** We collect characters from cells not on the diagonals and ensure they are all the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Efficiency:** The solution efficiently processes each cell exactly once, ensuring it handles up to the maximum input size within acceptable time limits.",
