    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and also find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph with that minimum number of nodes.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully again.\n\nSo, a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Wait, no—wait, the problem says it's p-reachable if it has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u ≠ v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. Oh wait, no, I think I misread. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says: an ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u ≠ v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. Then, a directed graph is called p-reachable if it contains exactly p such ordered pairs where u < v. Or wait, no, wait. The problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\" Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, no. The problem says a p-reachable graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Or wait, perhaps it's the count of edges in the underlying undirected graph? No, no, the definition is about ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, and they're mutually reachable. So for each such pair, it contributes to p.\n\nWait, but what does that mean for the structure of the graph? It seems like the graph must have certain properties. Maybe the graph is strongly connected, but not sure.\n\nBut the main goal is to find the minimal number of nodes N such that the graph can be p-reachable. And then, among all such graphs with minimal N, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, but first, let's think about what the minimal N is for a given p.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the sample input:\n\nIn the first test case, p=3. The output is 3 nodes. So how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal N is determined by the structure of the graph. Let me think about the structure of a graph that has exactly p such ordered pairs.\n\nEach such ordered pair (u, v) with u < v implies that u is reachable from v, but since the pair is counted when u < v and they are mutually reachable, perhaps the graph is a DAG where each component is a DAG, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. Because if u and v are reachable from each other, that means the graph is strongly connected between them. So the graph must consist of strongly connected components (SCCs). Each SCC is a maximal subset of nodes where every node is reachable from every other.\n\nSo, within each SCC, any pair (u, v) with u < v would contribute to p only if u and v are mutually reachable, which they are. So the total number of such pairs is the sum over each SCC of the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v in that SCC.\n\nWait, because in an SCC, every node can reach every other, so for any u < v, (u, v) is counted as part of p.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a collection of k SCCs, each with size s_1, s_2, ..., s_k, such that the sum over all i of s_i choose 2 equals p. Because for each SCC of size s, the number of such pairs is s*(s-1)/2.\n\nWait, because for each SCC of size s, the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v is C(s, 2) = s(s-1)/2.\n\nSo the sum of C(s_i, 2) for all i must equal p.\n\nAnd we want the minimal total number of nodes, which is the sum of s_i. So to minimize the sum, we should maximize the individual s_i as much as possible.\n\nBecause for a fixed sum of C(s_i, 2), the sum s_i is minimized when the s_i are as large as possible. For example, to get a certain sum, having larger s_i will give a smaller total.\n\nSo, for example, if p is 3: the sum C(s_i, 2) = 3. What are the possible ways?\n\nWe can have one SCC of size 3: C(3,2)=3, so total nodes is 3.\n\nAlternatively, two SCCs: say one of size 2 (C(2,2)=1) and another of size 2 (another 1), sum is 2. But 1+1=2 <3, so that's not enough. Or maybe 2 and 1: C(2,2)+C(1,2)=1+0=1<3.\n\nWait, maybe three SCCs of size 2 each: 3*1=3. Then total nodes is 3*2=6, which is larger than the 3-node solution.\n\nSo yes, the minimal N is achieved when the sum of C(s_i, 2) is p, and the s_i are as large as possible.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the minimal N such that the sum of s_i is minimized, where the sum of s_i*(s_i-1)/2 equals p.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the minimal N where the sum of s_i is as small as possible, given that sum s_i choose 2 equals p.\n\nNow, how to compute this?\n\nWe can model this as a partition problem, where we need to partition p into terms of t_i = s_i*(s_i-1)/2, such that the sum of t_i equals p, and the sum of s_i is minimized.\n\nTo minimize the sum, we need to maximize each t_i as much as possible. Because for a given t_i, s_i is as large as possible.\n\nWait, for a given t_i, the s_i that maximizes t_i for a given s_i is when s_i is as large as possible. So to minimize the sum of s_i, for each term t_i, we want to take the largest possible s_i.\n\nSo, the approach is to represent p as the sum of triangular numbers, where each triangular number is m*(m-1)/2, and the sum of these is p, and the sum of m's is as small as possible.\n\nSo, the minimal N is the sum of the m's, where the sum of m(m-1)/2 is p.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal N such that the sum of some m_i(m_i -1)/2 is equal to p, and N is the sum of m_i.\n\nOur task is to find the minimal N and then, given that N is fixed, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal N?\n\nLet's think about how to construct such a partition.\n\nWe can think of the problem as, given p, find a sequence of integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_k such that sum_{i=1 to k} m_i(m_i-1)/2 = p, and sum m_i is minimized.\n\nThe minimal sum occurs when the m_i are as large as possible.\n\nFor example, to maximize each term, we can take the largest possible m, subtract its contribution, and proceed recursively.\n\nLet me see. Suppose p is 3.\n\nThe largest possible m is 3, since 3*2/2 =3. So sum is 3, which gives N=3.\n\nAnother example: p=4.\n\nWhat's the minimal N?\n\nLooking for the largest m such that m(m-1)/2 <=4.\n\nm=3: 3*2/2=3. Remaining p=1.\n\nNow, find m for 1: m=2, 2*1/2=1. Sum is 3+2=5 nodes.\n\nWait, but 5 is the sum. Alternatively, could we have a single m=4: 4*3/2=6>4, which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, m=3 and m=1: 3+1=4. 3*2/2 +1*0/2=3+0=3 <4. So no.\n\nWait, maybe m=2 and m=2: each contributes 1, sum 2*1=2, which is less than 4. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe m=3 and m=1: 3+1=4, but sum of t_i is 3+0=3 <4. So that's not sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps another way: m=2, m=2, m=0? No, because m must be at least 1, but their contributions sum to 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: for each possible m, compute how many times m appears.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal N is achieved when all but one m are as large as possible, and the last m is whatever is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps for p=4, the minimal N is 5, as in 3+2.\n\nBut wait, 3+2=5 nodes, contributing 3+1=4. So that works.\n\nIs there a way to have a smaller N?\n\nWhat about m=3 and m=1: 3+1=4 nodes, contributing 3+0=3, which is less than 4. So no.\n\nAlternatively, m=4: 4*3/2=6>4, which is too big.\n\nHmm. So the minimal N for p=4 is 5.\n\nWait, but what about another partition: m=3 and m=2: 3*2/2 +2*1/2=3+1=4. Sum is 3+2=5.\n\nSo yes, N=5.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way: m=2 and m=2 and m=0. But no, m=0 is not allowed.\n\nSo for p=4, minimal N is 5.\n\nWait, but wait: what about m=4 is not possible, but perhaps another combination.\n\nWait, perhaps m=3, m=1: sum is 3+1=4, but their contributions are 3 and 0, sum is 3 <4.\n\nSo no.\n\nSo, for p=4, minimal N is 5.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, when p=4, the output is 5 nodes. So yes.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the minimal N by finding the largest possible m's such that their t_i sum up to p.\n\nNow, the algorithm to find N is:\n\nFind the largest m such that m(m-1)/2 <= p.\n\nSubtract that value from p, and repeat for the remaining p, until p becomes zero.\n\nEach step, add m to the sum.\n\nThis will give us the minimal N.\n\nSo, for example:\n\np=3: m=3, sum is 3.\n\np=4: m=3, rem=1. Then m=2, rem=0. Sum is 5.\n\np=6: 3+3, sum 6 nodes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nWe can write a loop where we find the largest m such that m(m-1)/2 <= current p, subtract that from p, add m to the sum, and proceed until p is zero.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef min_nodes(p):\n    n = 0\n    while p >0:\n        m = floor( (sqrt(8*p +1)+1)/2 )\n        # because m(m-1)/2 <= p < (m+1)m/2\n        # but maybe m needs to be adjusted.\n        # for example, if m(m-1)/2 == p, then take m.\n        # else, take m-1?\n        # let's compute m as the largest integer where m(m-1)/2 <= p.\n        # solving m^2 -m - 2p <=0.\n        # roots are [1 ± sqrt(1+8p)] /2. So m is the floor of [1 + sqrt(1+8p)] /2.\n        m = int( (math.sqrt(1 + 8 * p) +1 ) // 2 )\n        # but sometimes m might be larger than needed, so we need to check.\n        # for example, if m(m-1)/2 >p, then decrease m by 1.\n        while m*(m-1)//2 > p:\n            m -=1\n        n +=m\n        p -= m*(m-1)//2\n    return n\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for p=0, the minimal N is 0.\n\nFor p=1: m=2, because 2*1/2=1. So N=2.\n\nWait, but wait, for p=1, the sum is 1. So the minimal N is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the first part of the problem is solved by this function.\n\nNow, the second part: among all such minimal N graphs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nAn unidirectional pair is an ordered pair (u, v) where u≠v, u can reach v, and v cannot reach u.\n\nBut since the graph is p-reachable, which requires that for the ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are mutually reachable, the count is p.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the p-reachable graph is defined as having exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the count is p for the number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are mutually reachable.\n\nSo, each such pair is a mutual edge in the sense that both can reach each other.\n\nWait, but in a directed graph, that's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph is a DAG, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no—because if u and v are in the same SCC, then u can reach v and v can reach u. So for any u < v in the same SCC, the pair (u, v) is counted towards p.\n\nSo, the p is the number of such ordered pairs across all the SCCs.\n\nSo, the structure of the graph is a collection of SCCs, each of which is a DAG (but wait, no—each SCC is a strongly connected component, so it's not a DAG unless it's a single node).\n\nWait, no. An SCC is a maximal subset where every node can reach every other. So each SCC is a strongly connected directed graph.\n\nBut for the purposes of counting the number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are reachable from each other, each such pair is within the same SCC.\n\nSo, the problem is to partition the graph into SCCs such that the sum of C(s_i, 2) equals p, and the sum of s_i is minimized.\n\nNow, for the second part: among all such graphs with minimal N, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nAn unidirectional pair is a pair (u, v) where u can reach v but v cannot reach u. So it's a directed edge from u to v in the condensation graph.\n\nWait, because the condensation graph is a DAG of SCCs. So, in the condensation, each edge from component A to component B represents that every node in A can reach every node in B, and vice versa is not true.\n\nSo, in the condensation, for each edge A→B, all pairs (u, v) where u is in A and v is in B form unidirectional pairs.\n\nBut wait, the problem counts the number of unidirectional pairs as the total number of such (u, v) in the entire graph.\n\nSo, for each edge A→B in the condensation, the number of unidirectional pairs contributed is |A| * |B|.\n\nBecause for each u in A and v in B, (u, v) is an unidirectional pair.\n\nSo, the total unidirectional pairs is the sum over all edges A→B in the condensation of |A| * |B|.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to arrange the condensation graph as a DAG where the sum of |A| * |B| for all edges A→B is maximized.\n\nAdditionally, the condensation must have components whose sizes' binomial coefficients sum to p.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging the components in a way that the sum of |A| * |B| for edges is as large as possible.\n\nNow, to maximize the sum, we can arrange the condensation as a linear chain where each component points to the next, except for the last one. This way, each component contributes |A| * |B| for each edge it has.\n\nWait, but the sum depends on how the components are arranged. Let's think: for a set of components c_1, c_2, ..., c_k, arranged in a topological order, the sum is c_1*c_2 + c_2*c_3 + ... + c_{k-1}*c_k}.\n\nThis is maximized when the components are as large as possible early on. Because the product of larger components multiplied by the next component will be higher.\n\nWait, for example, suppose you have two components of sizes a and b. If you arrange them in a chain, the sum is a*b. If you reverse the order, it's also a*b. So for two components, the order doesn't matter.\n\nWait, no, if the components are a and b, then regardless of the order, the sum is a*b.\n\nWait, but if you have three components, a, b, c.\n\nIf arranged as a → b → c: sum is a*b + b*c.\n\nIf arranged as a → c → b: sum is a*c + c*b.\n\nWhich is larger depends on whether a*b +b*c is larger than a*c +c*b. Which would be the case if a > c.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Maybe the order in which the components are arranged affects the sum.\n\nWait, let's try specific numbers.\n\nSuppose a=3, b=2, c=4.\n\nCase 1: 3 →2 →4: sum is 3*2 +2*4=6+8=14.\n\nCase 2: 3 →4 →2: sum is 3*4 +4*2=12+8=20.\n\nWhich is larger.\n\nSo, arranging the larger components later may help.\n\nWait, but in this case, 3 is the smallest, then 2, then 4. In the first case, the sum is 14, in the second case, 20.\n\nSo, arranging the components in the order of increasing size may not maximize the sum. Hmm, perhaps the optimal arrangement is to arrange the components in a way that larger components come after smaller ones.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the components are arranged in decreasing order of size.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nTake a=4, b=3, c=2.\n\nArrange as 4→3→2: sum is 4*3 +3*2=12+6=18.\n\nArrange as 4→2→3: sum is4*2 +2*3=8+6=14.\n\nArrange as 3→4→2: sum is3*4 +4*2=12+8=20.\n\nSo, in this case, arranging in decreasing order of size gives a higher sum.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the components in decreasing order of size.\n\nSo, the steps to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs are:\n\n1. Find the minimal N and the corresponding component sizes s_1, s_2, ..., s_k.\n\n2. Arrange the components in decreasing order of size.\n\n3. Compute the sum of s_i * s_j for each edge s_i → s_j in the condensation.\n\nThis sum is maximized when the components are arranged in decreasing order.\n\nSo, the problem now is to find, given the component sizes, how to arrange them to maximize the sum.\n\nBut wait, in the example above, arranging in decreasing order of size gives a higher sum.\n\nSo, the approach is to sort the component sizes in non-increasing order and connect them in a chain.\n\nThus, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is the sum over i < j of s_i * s_j, but wait no: in the chain, each component is connected to the next, so it's the sum of s_1*s_2 + s_2*s_3 + ... + s_{k-1} * s_k}.\n\nWait, no. Because each edge in the chain contributes s_i * s_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but the total sum for all unordered pairs is s_1*s_2 + s_1*s_3 + ... + s_1*s_k + s_2*s_3 + ... + s_2*s_k + ... etc.\n\nWait, but in the chain, each component is connected to the next one, but not to the ones after that. So the sum is the sum of s_i * s_{i+1} for i from 1 to k-1.\n\nBut the maximum possible sum is the sum of all possible s_i * s_j where i < j.\n\nWait, no, because if we arrange all components in a line, each component is connected to the next, but not directly to those further ahead. So the sum is the sum of adjacent products.\n\nBut the maximum sum is achieved when the sum of adjacent products is as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved when the components are arranged in a way that the product of consecutive components is as large as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all s_i * s_j for i < j, minus some terms.\n\nWait, but for the chain arrangement, the sum is s_1*s_2 + s_2*s_3 + ... + s_{k-1} * s_k.\n\nWhich is less than the sum of all possible s_i * s_j for i < j.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the components are arranged in a way that maximizes the sum of adjacent products, which may or may not be the same as the overall maximum.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut for our problem, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the components are arranged in a chain, and the sizes are in non-increasing order.\n\nSo, the approach is to:\n\n- Sort the component sizes in non-increasing order.\n\n- Connect them in a chain.\n\n- Compute the sum of s_i * s_{i+1} for i=1 to k-1.\n\nSo, for the sample input where p=3, the components are one component of size 3. So the sum is zero, since there are no edges between different components.\n\nIn the sample input where p=4, the components are two components: 3 and 2. So the sum is 3*2=6.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output was 5 nodes and 6 unidirectional pairs. Yes, that matches.\n\nAnother example: p=6.\n\nThe minimal N is 3+3=6 nodes, with two components of size 3 each.\n\nArrange them in a chain: 3→3.\n\nSum is 3*3=9.\n\nSo the maximum unidirectional pairs is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the approach seems to work.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Given p, find the minimal N and the component sizes s_i.\n\n   - The component sizes are as large as possible, each contributing as much as possible to p.\n\n   - The component sizes are found by the process I described earlier.\n\n2. Once we have the component sizes, sort them in non-increasing order.\n\n3. Compute the sum of s_i * s_{i+1} for i from 1 to len(s)-1.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead p.\n\nCompute the minimal N and the list of component sizes.\n\nSort the component sizes in descending order.\n\nCompute the sum of s_i * s_{i+1} for each consecutive pair.\n\nReturn N and the sum.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nBut wait, what about when p is zero?\n\nWhen p=0, the minimal N is zero, and the sum is zero.\n\nSo, code-wise, handle p=0 as a special case.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFirst, import math.\n\nThen, for a given p:\n\nif p ==0:\n\n    return (0, 0)\n\nelse:\n\n    compute the component sizes as per the function above.\n\n    sort them in descending order.\n\n    compute the sum of s_i * s_{i+1} for each consecutive pair.\n\nSo, for p=3:\n\ncomponents = [3], sum=0.\n\nfor p=4: components = [3,2], sum=3*2=6.\n\nfor p=6: components=[3,3], sum=3*3=9.\n\nAnother example: p=10.\n\nLet me compute.\n\nLargest m where m(m-1)/2 <=10.\n\nm=4: 4*3/2=6 <=10. Remaining p=4.\n\nNext m=3: 3*2/2=3 <=4. Remaining p=1.\n\nNext m=2: 2*1/2=1<=1. Remaining p=0.\n\nSo components are 4,3,2.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graph**: A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and both u and v are mutually reachable. This implies that the graph can be decomposed into strongly connected components (SCCs).\n\n2. **Minimum Number of Nodes**: The goal is to find the smallest number of nodes such that the sum of the binomial coefficients of the sizes of these SCCs equals `p`. This is achieved by finding the largest possible SCC sizes that contribute to the sum of binomial coefficients.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal number of nodes is determined, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. This is done by arranging the SCCs in a chain where each component points to the next, maximizing the product of their sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_min_n(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return 0\n    n = 0\n    components = []\n    while p > 0:\n        m = int((math.sqrt(1 + 8 * p) + 1) // 2)\n        while m * (m - 1) // 2 > p:\n            m -= 1\n        components.append(m)\n        n += m\n        p -= m * (m - 1) // 2\n    return n, components\n\ndef max_unidirectional(components):\n    components.sort(reverse=True)\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(components) - 1):\n        total += components[i] * components[i + 1]\n    return total\n\np = int(input().strip())\nif p == 0:\n    print(\"0 0\")\nelse:\n    min_n, comp_list = compute_min_n(p)\n    max_uni = max_unidirectional(comp_list)\n    print(f\"{min_n} {max_uni}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Compute Minimum Nodes**: The function `compute_min_n` calculates the minimum number of nodes by iteratively finding the largest possible SCC size that contributes to the sum of binomial coefficients equal to `p`.\n\n2. **Maximize Unidirectional Pairs**: The function `max_unidirectional` sorts the SCC sizes in descending order and computes the maximum number of unidirectional pairs by summing the products of consecutive SCC sizes in the sorted list.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal node count and maximize unidirectional pairs using properties of binomial coefficients and graph theory.",
