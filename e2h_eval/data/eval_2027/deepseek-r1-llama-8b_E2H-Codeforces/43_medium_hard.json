He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A creates a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So now the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C appends some 'c's to the end. The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C adds them. It can be equal to both.\n\nThe task is to check if a given string S satisfies these conditions.\n\nFirst, let's think about what the string should look like.\n\nThe string must have all 'a's first, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. Because each step appends only one type of character, so the order is a's, then b's, then c's. If any other order exists, it's invalid.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to check is whether the string is in the form of a^+ b^+ c^+. If not, it's automatically a \"NO\".\n\nNext, after ensuring the order is correct, we need to count the number of 'a's (let's call it count_a), 'b's (count_b), and 'c's (count_c).\n\nNow, according to the problem statement, C appends 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to either count_a or count_b. But wait, when C appends, the counts are from the combined string before C added his part. So, count_a + count_b is the total before C adds 'c's. Wait no: because the string before C appends is the string after B. So B's string is a's followed by b's. So count_a is the number of a's, count_b is the number of b's.\n\nThen, C appends count_c = count_a OR count_b.\n\nWait, but count_c can be equal to count_a or count_b. So count_c must be equal to at least one of them, right?\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the number of 'c's appended by C is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string. So, the count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, since the string is formed by A, B, then C, the count_c must be at least 1 because the problem says that both A and B have at least one 'a' and 'b'. So C must add at least one 'c'.\n\nSo, the steps I need to do:\n\n1. Check if the string is non-decreasing in terms of 'a's, 'b's, 'c's. So, the string must consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by a sequence of 'b's, followed by a sequence of 'c's. No interleaving or other characters in between.\n\n   How to check this? We can iterate through the string and ensure that once a character is 'b', the next ones cannot be 'a's, and similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, the rest must be 'c's.\n\n2. Once the order is confirmed, calculate count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\n3. Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b, or possibly both.\n\nAdditionally, since C appends some 'c's (must be >=1), the count_c must be >=1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the number of 'c's appended is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string. So, for example, if count_a is 3 and count_b is 5, then count_c can be 3 or 5.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n- Split the string into a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n- Check that the split is correct. For example, the string should not have any 'a's after 'b's or 'c's, etc.\n\nHow to split:\n\nWe can find the indices where the characters change.\n\nFor example, the string starts with 'a's until some index i, then 'b's until j, then 'c's until the end.\n\nIf any part is missing, it's invalid. Like, if there are no 'b's, then B didn't append any, which is not allowed because the initial string after A has at least one 'a' and 'b'. So, the count_a and count_b must be at least 1.\n\nWait, yes. Because A gives a string with some 'a's, and B appends some 'b's. So the string after B has at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. So, count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nThen, C appends 'c's. So count_c must be >=1.\n\nSo, in our code, after splitting, we must have count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nAlso, the entire string must be a's, then b's, then c's, with no other characters.\n\nSo, how to implement this:\n\nWe can loop through the string and track the current allowed characters.\n\nInitially, allowed are 'a's. Once a 'b' is found, allowed becomes 'b's and 'c's, but not 'a's. Once a 'c' is found, allowed is only 'c's.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to split the string into runs. Each run is a consecutive same character.\n\nFor example, 'aaabccc' would be split into runs: 'aaa' (a), 'bb' (b), 'ccc' (c).\n\nThen, the runs must be exactly three in number, and the characters must be a, then b, then c.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nruns = []\ncurrent_char = None\ncurrent_count = 0\n\nfor char in S:\n    if char == current_char:\n        current_count +=1\n    else:\n        if current_char is not None:\n            runs.append( (current_char, current_count) )\n        current_char = char\n        current_count = 1\nif current_char is not None:\n    runs.append( (current_char, current_count) )\n\nThen, check if len(runs) ==3, and the characters are 'a', 'b', 'c' in order.\n\nIf not, return NO.\n\nIf yes, proceed.\n\nAlso, count_a = runs[0][1], count_b=runs[1][1], count_c= runs[2][1].\n\nCheck that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf any of them is zero, it's invalid.\n\nThen, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nWait, but what if count_c is equal to both count_a and count_b?\n\nLike, if count_a = count_b = count_c, then it's valid.\n\nSo, the condition is count_c equals count_a OR count_c equals count_b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns: a:3, b:2, c:3.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=2, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c is 3, which equals count_a (3). So condition is satisfied. So output YES.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 'bbacc'\n\nWait, the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'.\n\nSo the runs are 'bb' (b), 'a' (a), 'cc' (c). So the runs are a, b, c? No, because the second run is 'a' which comes after 'b's. So the runs are not in order a, b, c. So the string is invalid. Hence, output NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc'\n\nWait, no, the third input is 'aabc'? Or the third example in the sample input is ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] and the outputs are ['YES', 'NO', 'YES'].\n\nWait, third example is 'aabc'. Let's see.\n\nThe string is 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo the runs are a:2, b:1, c:1.\n\nSo the runs are a, b, c. So order is correct.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1. Is 1 equal to count_a (2)? No. Is it equal to count_b (1)? Yes. So condition is met. So output is YES.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc'.\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which equals count_a. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc'.\n\ncount_c is 1, count_a is 2, count_b is 2.\n\ncount_c is 1, which is not equal to 2, so output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbc'.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1. Not equal to 3. So output NO.\n\nWhat about 'aaabbbccc'? count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=3. So count_c is equal to both. So output YES.\n\nWhat about 'aabbaa'? Well, the runs would be a:2, b:2, a:2. So the runs are a, b, a. Which is invalid, so output NO.\n\nSo, the plan seems solid.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCompute the runs.\n\nCheck if the runs are exactly 3, and their characters are 'a', 'b', 'c' in order.\n\nIf not, output NO.\n\nElse, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nCheck count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf any is zero, output NO.\n\nCheck if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, coding steps:\n\nRead S.\n\nCompute runs.\n\nIf runs length is not 3, output NO.\n\nElse, check the sequence of characters: 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nIf not, output NO.\n\nElse, get the counts.\n\nCheck if all counts are >=1.\n\nIf any is zero, output NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nImplementing the runs.\n\nIn Python, perhaps:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif len(s) <3:\n    # Since the string must have a's, b's, c's. At least one of each.\n    # So minimum length is 3.\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nruns = []\nprev = s[0]\ncount = 1\n\nfor c in s[1:]:\n    if c == prev:\n        count +=1\n    else:\n        runs.append( (prev, count) )\n        prev = c\n        count =1\nruns.append( (prev, count) )\n\n# Now, check runs.\n\nif len(runs) !=3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nchars = [run[0] for run in runs]\n\nif chars != ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ncount_a, count_b, count_c = runs[0][1], runs[1][1], runs[2][1]\n\nif count_a <1 or count_b <1 or count_c <1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where the string is something like 'aabbaaccc'? Then, the runs would have 'a', 'b', 'a', 'c's. So len(runs) is 4, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother edge case: the string is 'abc'. So runs are a:1, b:1, c:1. So count_c is 1, which equals a and b. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'acbc' → runs are a:1, c:1, b:1, c:1 → len(runs)=4, so invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → runs are a:1, b:3, c:1. So count_c is 1, which equals a (1). So output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbc' → count_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=1. count_c is 1, which is not equal to 2 or 3. So output NO.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns: a:3, b:2, c:3.\n\ncount_c is 3, which equals a (3). So output YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → runs are b:2, a:1, c:2. So runs are not a, b, c. So output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → runs a:2, b:1, c:1. count_c is 1, which equals b (1). So output YES.\n\nSo, the code works for samples.\n\nWhat about a string like 'aabbaaccc'? The runs would be a:2, b:2, a:2, c:3. So len(runs) is 4, invalid.\n\nWhat about 'aabbcc' → runs a:2, b:2, c:2. So count_c is 2, which equals a and b. So output YES.\n\nWait, but in this case, count_a is 2, count_b is 2, count_c is 2.\n\nSo count_c equals both, so condition is met.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'ab' → len(runs) is 2, which is less than 3. So output NO.\n\nAnother edge case: 'accc' → runs are a:1, c:3. So len(runs)=2, output NO.\n\nWhat about 'aaabbbc' → runs a:3, b:3, c:1. count_c is 1. Not equal to 3. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaaabbbbbccccc' → count_a=5, count_b=5, count_c=5. So condition is met.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaacc' → runs are a:2, b:2, a:2, c:1. len(runs)=4, so invalid.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending certain characters in a specific order. The string must be constructed by first appending 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's, with the number of 'c's being equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Order**: The string must be in the form of consecutive 'a's followed by consecutive 'b's and then consecutive 'c's. This can be verified by splitting the string into runs of the same character and ensuring these runs are exactly 'a', 'b', 'c' in order.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that there is at least one of each character ('a', 'b', 'c'). The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nif len(s) < 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nruns = []\nprev = s[0]\ncount = 1\n\nfor c in s[1:]:\n    if c == prev:\n        count += 1\n    else:\n        runs.append((prev, count))\n        prev = c\n        count = 1\nruns.append((prev, count))\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nchars = [run[0] for run in runs]\n\nif chars != ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ncount_a, count_b, count_c = runs[0][1], runs[1][1], runs[2][1]\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and checked for its length. If the length is less than 3, it immediately prints \"NO\" since it can't meet the minimum requirements.\n2. **Splitting into Runs**: The string is processed to split it into consecutive runs of the same character. Each run is stored as a tuple of the character and its count.\n3. **Order Check**: The runs are checked to ensure they form exactly three segments: 'a', 'b', and 'c' in order.\n4. **Character Count Validation**: The counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are extracted. Each count must be at least 1. Finally, the count of 'c's is checked against the counts of 'a's and 'b's to determine if the string is valid according to the problem's constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, providing the correct result based on the problem's requirements.",
