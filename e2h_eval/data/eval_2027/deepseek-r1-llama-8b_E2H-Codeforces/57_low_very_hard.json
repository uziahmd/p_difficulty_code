His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have in an Olympiad based on his total points. The teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x points. The input gives us two lists: one for the first tour scores and another for the second tour, but they're not sorted or linked to specific participants. Our task is to determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could achieve.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem: each participant has a score from the first tour and a score from the second tour. The sum of these two determines their rank. If two people have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order, which affects the rank. So, for the best rank, we want as few people as possible to have a higher sum than Vasya's. For the worst rank, we want as many people as possible to have a higher sum.\n\nWait, but since Vasya's own sum is part of the calculation, we need to consider all possible sums that are possible for him given the constraints.\n\nLet me restate the problem:\n\nWe have two lists A and B, each of size n. Each A[i] is paired with some B[j], and the sum A[i] + B[j] is Vasya's total. But wait, no—Vasya is a single participant, so his total is A[i] + B[j], but for others, it's A[k] + B[l], where k and l are not necessarily equal to i and j. Oh wait, no, because each participant took both tours. So for each participant, their total is the sum of their first and second tour points.\n\nBut the way the input is given is that the first list is the first tour scores, the second is the second tour, but they are in arbitrary order. So, the actual pairing between A and B is unknown. That complicates things because the problem is to find, considering all possible pairings (matching each A to a B), what is the best and worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya's sum is at least x. So for each possible pairing, there exists some pair (i,j) such that A[i] + B[j] >= x.\n\nBut our task isn't just to find a valid pairing, but to find the best and worst possible rank across all possible pairings.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x, but doesn't know which participant he is. So, for each possible way of pairing the A and B scores, we can compute Vasya's sum as A[i] + B[j], and then compute his rank based on that pairing.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider all possible pairs (a, b) where a is from A and b is from B, and a + b >=x, then for each such pair, compute how many other pairs (a',b') would have a' + b' >= a + b, which would determine his rank. Then, find the minimal and maximal possible rank over all valid a and b.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because in a particular pairing, each a is used exactly once, and each b is used exactly once. So the pairing is a perfect matching between A and B.\n\nAh right! Because each participant took both tours, the pairing must be a bijection. So, for each permutation π, we can compute for each i, A[i] + B[π(i)], and then sort all these sums in descending order to determine the ranks.\n\nBut since n can be up to 105, checking all possible permutations is impossible (n! is way too big).\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what determines Vasya's rank in a given pairing. For a particular pairing, Vasya's sum is s = A[i] + B[j]. The number of participants who have a sum greater than s will determine how many people are above him. The rest could be either above or below depending on ties.\n\nBut since the jury can arrange tied participants in any order, the best possible rank for Vasya is when as few as possible have a sum greater than his, and as many as possible have a sum less than or equal. Wait, but for the best possible rank, we want Vasya to have the highest possible sum, so that as few people as possible have a sum higher than his.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible s that Vasya can have, given the constraints.\n\nSimilarly, the worst possible rank is determined by the minimum possible s that Vasya can have, given that s >=x.\n\nWait, but how? Because",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The key is to consider all possible pairings of participants' scores from the two tours and compute the ranks accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Each participant's total score is the sum of their scores from two tours. The goal is to find the best and worst ranks Vasya can achieve given that his total score is at least `x`.\n\n2. **Pairing Consideration**: Since each participant took both tours, the scores from the two tours must be paired uniquely. This means we need to consider all possible valid pairings of the scores.\n\n3. **Maximize Vasya's Score for Best Rank**: To find the best rank, we need to maximize Vasya's score. This involves finding the highest possible sum of scores from the two tours such that it is at least `x`.\n\n4. **Minimize Vasya's Score for Worst Rank**: For the worst rank, we need to minimize Vasya's score while ensuring it is at least `x`.\n\n5. **Calculate Ranks**: For each possible valid score of Vasya, calculate how many participants have a higher score than him. This determines his rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    A = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    B = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    max_possible = 0\n    min_possible = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (A[i] + B[j]) >= x:\n                s = A[i] + B[j]\n                current_max = 0\n                current_min = n\n                for a in A:\n                    for b in B:\n                        temp_sum = a + b\n                        if temp_sum > s:\n                            current_max += 1\n                        elif temp_sum == s:\n                            pass\n                        else:\n                            pass\n                max_possible = max(max_possible, s)\n                min_possible = min(min_possible, s)\n                \n    best_rank = 1\n    worst_rank = n\n    for s in [max_possible, min_possible]:\n        count = 0\n        for a in A:\n            for b in B:\n                temp_sum = a + b\n                if temp_sum > s:\n                    count += 1\n        if count < best_rank - 1:\n            best_rank = count + 1\n        if count >= worst_rank:\n            worst_rank = count + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and two lists of scores from the first and second tours.\n\n2. **Finding Valid Scores**: We iterate through all possible pairs of scores from the two tours to find valid scores for Vasya that are at least `x`.\n\n3. **Maximize and Minimize Scores**: We track the maximum and minimum valid scores Vasya can have.\n\n4. **Calculate Ranks**: For each valid score, we determine how many participants have a higher score, which helps us compute the best and worst ranks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently consider all possible scenarios and determine the optimal ranks for Vasya based on his score constraints.",
