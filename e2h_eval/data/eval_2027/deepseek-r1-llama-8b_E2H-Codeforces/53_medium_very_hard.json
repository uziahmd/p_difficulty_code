Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The substrings can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they provided. For 'abcd', since all characters are unique, the longest possible substring that repeats is of length 1. Wait, no—because each single character appears only once, right? So the output is 0? Or maybe the problem expects that if there's no such substring, it returns 0.\n\nWait looking back at the sample input: for 'zzz', the output is 2. Because the substring 'zz' appears starting at position 0 and 1, overlapping. So the maximum length is 2.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that occurs at least twice in the string.\n\nHow do I approach this? Let's think about possible approaches.\n\nThe brute-force way would be to check all possible substrings and see which ones appear more than once. But considering the string can be up to 100 characters long, that might be manageable because the number of possible substrings isn't too big.\n\nBut wait, for each possible length from the maximum possible down to 1, we can check if any substring of that length appears at least twice. Once we find the largest such length, we can return it.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths starting from the largest possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1.\n2. For each length L, check all possible substrings of length L in the string.\n3. For each substring of length L, see if it appears again somewhere else in the string.\n4. If for any L, we find such a substring, then return L as the answer.\n\nIf no such L is found (like when the string has all unique characters), return 0.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nFor each L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   Create a set to keep track of seen substrings of length L.\n   Iterate through the string, extracting each substring of length L.\n   For each substring:\n      If it's already in the set, then return L as the answer.\n      Else, add it to the set.\n   Continue until all substrings are checked for this L.\n\nIf after checking all Ls, none found, return 0.\n\nThis approach should work because we're checking the largest possible L first. Once found, we can immediately return without checking smaller Ls.\n\nWhat's the time complexity? For a string of length n, the outer loop runs n times (from n-1 down to 1). For each iteration, we process n-L+1 substrings. For each substring, we check if it's in a set, which is O(1) average case.\n\nSo overall, the time is O(n^2), which is acceptable since n is up to 100.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\n\nCheck L=3: There are 2 substrings: 'abc' and 'bcd'. Both are unique. So no duplicates. Move to L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique. Then L=1: 'a','b','c','d'. All unique. So output is 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa'\n\nL=4: substrings 'abab', 'baba'. Are they same? No. So no duplicate. Then L=3: check 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. Oh, 'aba' appears twice. So return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz'\n\nL=2: substrings 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So yes, duplicates. Return 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → the maximum is 4, since substrings like 'aaaa' occur multiple times.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's see. For 'aaaaa', the maximum substring that appears at least twice is of length 4. Because 'aaaa' appears starting at 0 and 1. So the function should return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' → the maximum is 3, as 'abc' appears twice.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababab' → maximum is 4, because 'abab' appears at positions 0 and 2.\n\nWait, let's see: 'abab' starts at 0, then at 2, so yes, it's duplicated. So the length is 4.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input string. For s in input().strip()\n\nThen for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n   for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n       if substr in seen:\n           print(L)\n           exit()\n       seen.add(substr)\nIf no L found, print 0.\n\nWait, but the output is not just a single number, but for each test case, it's one number. The input is a single string, so the output is a single number.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but what about when the string is of length 1, like 'a'? Then n-1 is 0, so the loop doesn't run, and it prints 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: empty string? But according to the problem statement, the string is non-empty.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nWait another test case: 'abba' → possible substrings of length 2: 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. 'bb' appears once, but 'ab' and 'ba' are different. So the maximum is 1, but wait, no. Because 'a' appears at 0 and 3. So the maximum is 1.\n\nSo for 'abba', the code will check L=3 first. Substrings are 'abb' and 'bba'. Not same. Then L=2: 'ab' (i=0), 'bb' (i=1), 'ba' (i=2). None duplicates. So L=1: 'a' at i=0, 'b' at i=1, 'b' at i=2, 'a' at i=3. So 'a' is in seen when i=3. So when i=3, substr is 'a', which is already in seen. So returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The substrings can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find the maximum length of a substring that occurs at least twice. If no such substring exists, the result should be 0.\n2. **Intuition**: We can check all possible substrings starting from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each length, we track the substrings we've seen and check if any repeat.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a brute-force approach with nested loops. The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from the longest down to 1. The inner loop checks each substring of that length and tracks seen substrings using a set for quick lookups.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested loops, which is efficient enough for the problem constraints (string length up to 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Iterate Over Lengths**: We start from the longest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each length, we generate all possible substrings, checking if any have been seen before using a set.\n4. **Early Exit**: If a repeating substring is found, we immediately print the length and exit. If no repeats are found after checking all lengths, we print 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination once the longest valid substring is found, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
