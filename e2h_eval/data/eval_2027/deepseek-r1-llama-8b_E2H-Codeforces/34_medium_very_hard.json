And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is probably not going to work because that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved. For each possible window of size k, I need to sum the values in that window and then compute the average over all windows.\n\nWait, but adding each window from scratch every time would take O(k) per window, which when multiplied by O(n) windows gives O(nk) time—this would be 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to calculate the sums of all sliding windows. Oh right! That's where a sliding window technique or using a prefix sum array comes into play.\n\nYes, the prefix sum approach seems suitable here. Let me outline how that would work.\n\nFirst, I'll compute the prefix sum array. Then, for each window starting at index i, the sum is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i]. This way, I can get each window's sum in O(1) time after the prefix sum is computed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the list of a's.\n3. Compute the prefix sum array.\n4. Iterate over all possible windows (from 0 to n-k), calculate each sum using the prefix array.\n5. Sum all these window sums to get the total.\n6. Divide the total by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n7. Output the result with sufficient precision.\n\nWait, but how to handle the prefix sum? Let me think.\n\nThe prefix sum array can be built as follows: prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. Then, the sum from i to j (inclusive) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\nSo for a window starting at index i (0-based) and ending at i + k - 1, the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nOnce I have all the window sums, I can add them all together. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the total sum directly without storing all individual window sums if memory is a concern, but since n is up to 2e5, even 2e5 elements are manageable.\n\nWait, but in Python, even for 2e5 elements, it's manageable. So perhaps just compute each window sum on the fly and accumulate the total.\n\nSo, let's structure it:\n\nCompute the prefix sum, then loop from i=0 to i=(n-k) inclusive, compute sum_i = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i], add to total.\n\nThen, average = total / (n - k + 1).\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nNow, what about handling large numbers? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem there.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: k = n. Then there's only one window, the entire array. So the average is the sum of all elements divided by 1.\n\nEdge Case 2: k = 1. Then each element is its own window, and the average is the sum of all elements divided by n.\n\nAnother case: n=1 and k=1. Only one element, average is itself.\n\nWhat about when the sum is zero? But according to the problem statement, ai is at least 1, so the sum can't be zero.\n\nWait, the constraints say 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1e5, so no zeros in the input. So we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\nBut when computing the average, we need to make sure that the output has enough decimal digits.\n\nThe output requires that the answer is correct up to 1e-6 absolute or relative error. So, we can output the average with, say, 10 decimal places, which should cover the required precision.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum array.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor each i in 0 to (n - k):\n    sum_window = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n    total += sum_window\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\n\nPrint average with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but wait: how to compute the prefix sum correctly.\n\nIn code:\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n    sum_window = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n    total += sum_window\n\nYes.\n\nNow, considering the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nSo n=3, k=2. So there are 2 windows: [3,4], [4,7].\n\nSum1: 7, sum2: 11. Total 18. Average 9.0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 3:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nWait, n=8, k=2. So number of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nEach window is two elements.\n\nCalculating the sum for each:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nAdding all these: 3 +6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201,960? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Anyway, in code, it's handled correctly.\n\nSo in the third example, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is the sum of all windows divided by 7.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for very large n, like 2e5, will this be efficient enough?\n\nWell, the prefix sum is O(n), which is acceptable. Then, the loop is O(n) as well. So overall O(n) time, which should be fine.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the prefix sum correctly, especially for indices.\n\n- Making sure that the loop runs from 0 to n - k inclusive.\n\nWait, in code, for i in range(n - k + 1). Because the starting index i can be 0, 1, ..., (n - k). Because when you have a window of length k, the last possible window starts at i = n - k.\n\nBecause for example, n=3, k=2: i can be 0 and 1. So 3-2=1, but the number of windows is 2. So in the loop, it's for i in 0 to (n - k) inclusive, which is (n - k + 1) iterations.\n\nYes, because range is exclusive on the upper end. So in code, to loop i from 0 to (n - k) inclusive, the range is range(n - k + 1). Because n - k + 1 is the count of iterations.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute prefix sum.\n\nCompute total sum of all window sums.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal points.\n\nNow, in Python, for reading the input, note that the first line is two integers, and the second line is n integers.\n\nSo, something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut wait, sometimes the input might have leading or trailing spaces, but split() handles that.\n\nCompute prefix sum:\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nCompute total:\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(n - k + 1):\n    total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to format the output?\n\nWe can use the format string \"%.10f\" % average, but that rounds to 10 decimal places. However, sometimes, the exact representation may require more than 10 digits, but the problem says to output with at least 6 digits after the decimal point. So 10 is safe.\n\nWait, but in the sample outputs, the third example is printed with 10 digits after decimal, but perhaps with more digits if necessary. So perhaps using a higher precision and then cutting to 10 digits.\n\nAlternatively, in Python, we can use the 'g' format specifier to avoid unnecessary trailing zeros. Or perhaps not, as the problem expects a fixed number of digits.\n\nLooking back at the sample outputs:\n\nSample Output 1: 9.0000000000 — 10 decimal digits.\n\nSample Output 2: 10.0000000000 — same.\n\nSample Output 3: 28964.2857142857 — 10 digits.\n\nSo the problem expects exactly 10 decimal digits, regardless of whether they are zero or not.\n\nThus, in the code, the output should be formatted to 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, using the format string \"%.10f\" should suffice.\n\nBut wait, in Python, floating-point numbers can have precision issues. For example, when the average is an integer, like 9, it's stored as 9.0, which when printed as %.10f becomes 9.0000000000.\n\nYes, which matches the sample.\n\nBut in the third example, 28964.2857142857 is 10 digits after decimal point, but the actual sum divided by 7 is 28964.28571428571428..., so when printed to 10 decimal digits, it's 28964.2857142857.\n\nWait, but 10 digits after the decimal point. So 10 decimal places.\n\nSo the code can do:\n\nprint(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, in Python, sometimes using floating points could lead to inaccuracies due to binary vs. decimal representation. To avoid that, perhaps using fractions or precise decimal arithmetic would be better. However, given that the problem allows for a relative or absolute error up to 1e-6, using floating points should be acceptable.\n\nBut another approach is to represent the average as a fraction, then perform exact division and output as a decimal with sufficient precision.\n\nBut for now, perhaps the straightforward approach is sufficient.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nprefix sum is [0,3,7,14]\n\nsum for i=0: 3+4=7\n\ni=1: 4+7=11\n\nTotal sum 18. Average 9.0.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nCompute the sum of all windows:\n\nwindow 0: 1+2=3\n\nwindow 1:2+4=6\n\nwindow 2:4+100000=100004\n\nwindow3:100000+123=100123\n\nwindow4:123+456=579\n\nwindow5:456+789=1245\n\nwindow6:789+1=790\n\nSum all these:\n\n3+6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201,960? Wait, wait, let me calculate step by step:\n\n3 + 6 = 9\n\n9 + 100004 = 100013\n\n100013 + 100123 = 200136\n\n200136 + 579 = 200715\n\n200715 + 1245 = 201,960\n\nWait, 200715 + 1245 is 202, 960? No, 200715 + 1245 is 201,960. Then adding 790:\n\n201960 + 790 = 202,750.\n\nSo total is 202750.\n\nNumber of windows is 7.\n\nAverage is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich is approximately 28964.2857142857 when rounded to 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the output is as expected.\n\nThus, the code should handle this correctly.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\nCase where k = n: only one window, sum is sum(a), average is sum(a)/1.\n\nCase where k = 1: sum all a's and divide by n.\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=2, a = [5,5]. Sum is 10, average is 5.0.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, for the prefix sum, let's test it.\n\nFor a = [3,4,7], prefix is [0,3,7,14].\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: the code should read from stdin. So in the sample input, the first line is '3 2\\n3 4 7', but in the actual code, the input is read as two lines, the first being n and k, the second the list.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is provided as strings, but in code, the way to read is via sys.stdin.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is given as three separate lines, but in reality, the first line is two integers, the second is n integers.\n\nSo the code reads the first line, splits into n and k.\n\nSecond line is the list of a's.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix sum.\n\nCompute total.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(n - k + 1):\n    total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but wait, the output in the sample has varying decimal digits beyond 10, like in the third sample, which is 28964.2857142857. How many digits after decimal? It's 10.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe third sample's average is 202750 / 7 = 28964.28571428571428...\n\nWhen printed to 10 decimal digits, it would be 28964.2857142857.\n\nBecause:\n\nAfter the decimal point, the digits are 2857142857142857... So the 10th digit is 5, followed by 7, etc.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nDigits after decimal: 2 8 5 7 1 4 2 8 5 7 ... \n\nWait, no. Let's compute 202750 /7:\n\n202750 ÷7 = 28964.285714285714285714...\n\nSo the decimal part is .285714285714..., repeating every 6 digits.\n\nSo the first 10 digits after the decimal are 2857142857.\n\nWait, 2857142857 — that's 10 digits.\n\nSo when printed with 10 decimal digits, it's 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich is what the sample shows.\n\nSo the code's print statement with .10f should handle that.\n\nWait, but in the code, when we do average = total / (n -k +1), total and (n -k +1) are integers, but in Python 3, dividing two integers gives a float. So that's correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, k=1, a=[5]. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, k=2, a=[5,5]. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, k=3, a=[1,2,3,4]. Windows are [1,2,3], [2,3,4]. Sums 6, 9. Total 15. Average 7.5. So output is 7.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on given sleep records for consecutive days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each possible week using a sliding window technique.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** We start by reading the input values which include the number of days `n`, the number of consecutive days `k` considered as a week, and the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array:** We compute a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time. This helps in quickly determining the sum of sleep times for each possible week.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation:** Using the prefix sum array, we iterate through each possible starting point of a week and compute the sum of sleep times for that week. We accumulate these sums to find the total sleep time across all weeks.\n4. **Compute Average:** The average sleep time is calculated by dividing the total sleep time by the number of weeks, which is `n - k + 1`.\n5. **Output Precision:** The result is formatted to ensure it is printed with exactly 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n - k + 1):\n        total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n    \n    average = total / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Prefix Sum Array:** This array helps in calculating the sum of any subarray in constant time. For an array `a`, the prefix sum array `prefix` is built such that `prefix[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`. This allows us to compute the sum of elements from index `i` to `j` as `prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]`.\n- **Sliding Window Technique:** By iterating over each possible starting index of a week, we use the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of each week's sleep times. This reduces the complexity from O(nk) to O(n), making the solution efficient even for large inputs.\n- **Precision Handling:** The result is printed with exactly 10 decimal places to ensure the required precision is met, accommodating both small and large values accurately.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks while maintaining the necessary precision and handling large input sizes within acceptable time limits.",
