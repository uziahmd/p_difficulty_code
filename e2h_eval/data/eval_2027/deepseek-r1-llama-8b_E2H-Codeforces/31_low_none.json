Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero, but the absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But since some are missing, we need to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to achieve this.\n\nWait, no. Wait. The way the problem is phrased: Natasha hid all, but he found n. So the initial total sum (sum of all found) plus what he needs to find should make the total sum zero. Or wait, no—no, the sum of the found cards is S. He wants the sum of all found plus the sum of the missing ones to be zero. Because Natasha hid all, but he found n, meaning that the sum of found is S, and the sum of the missing is such that S + sum_missing = 0. But the question is, what is the minimal number of additional cards he needs to find so that when their values are added, the total is zero.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read:\n\nVanya wants the sum of all the numbers on found cards equal to zero. So the sum of the found cards must be zero. But initially, Natasha hid all of them, but he found n. So the sum of the found cards (the n he has) plus the sum of the missing ones must equal zero? Or is it that the found cards' sum plus the sum of the missing ones equals zero? No, wait, no. Because Natasha hid all, so the total sum of all cards is the sum of the found plus the sum of the hidden (which is S_found + S_hidden = 0). So Vanya found S_found, but he can get more cards by finding, and he wants S_found + sum_of_new_cards = 0.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the sum of the found cards should be zero. So the sum of the found cards plus any new cards he finds must be zero. So he can add as many cards as needed, but each new card's value can't exceed x in absolute value. We need to find the minimal number of such cards to add so that the sum becomes zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the current sum S of the found cards.\n2. The required sum for the new cards is -S. Let's call this T = -S.\n3. Now, find the minimal k such that T can be achieved by adding k cards, each with absolute value ≤x.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each new card can be any integer between -x and x. So for the new cards, their sum is T. We need to find the minimal k where |T| ≤ k * x, because each card can contribute at most x towards the sum (either positive or negative).\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. For example, if T is 5 and x is 3, then each card can contribute up to 3. So two cards would give 6, which is more than 5. But perhaps one card can be 5, but if x is 3, that's not allowed. Wait, no, because the maximum is x. So in that case, we can have 2 cards: 3 and 2, but wait, 2 exceeds x=3? No, wait x is the maximum absolute value. So each card can be any value between -x and x, including x and -x.\n\nWait, for example, x=2. So a card can be 2, -2, 1, etc.\n\nSo, given that, the minimal number of cards k is the smallest integer such that |T| ≤ k*x.\n\nBecause each card can contribute at most x towards reducing the deficit (or surplus). So the minimal k is ceiling( |T| / x ), unless T is zero, in which case k is zero.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nCase 1: T = 0 → no cards needed.\n\nCase 2: T is non-zero. Then, the minimal k is the smallest number of cards such that the sum can reach T. Each card contributes up to x (in magnitude). So the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ).\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nFor example, T=5, x=2. Each card can contribute at most 2. So 3 cards: 2+2+1 =5. But wait, each card can be 2, so 2+2+1 is 5, but 1 is allowed because it's <=x. Alternatively, 3*2 =6, which is more than 5, but that's allowed if the sum is 5. Hmm, but how do we get exactly",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the current sum (i.e., if the current sum is S, the required sum is -S).\n3. **Compute Minimum Cards Needed**: The minimum number of cards needed is determined by the absolute value of the required sum divided by the maximum allowed value x, rounded up to the nearest integer. This is because each card can contribute at most x towards the required sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nrequired = -s\n\nif required == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Calculate minimal k such that |required| <= k * x\n    k = abs(required) // x\n    if k * x < abs(required):\n        k += 1\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of a card), followed by the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards to determine the current total.\n3. **Target Adjustment**: Calculate the required adjustment to make the total sum zero, which is the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Determine Minimum Cards**: Using the formula `ceil(|required| / x)`, compute the minimum number of additional cards needed. If the required sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution in constant time, making it suitable for large inputs within the problem constraints.",
