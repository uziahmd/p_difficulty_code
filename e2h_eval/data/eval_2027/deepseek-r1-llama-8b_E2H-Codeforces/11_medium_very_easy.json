A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given the available resources.\n\nHmm, let's break down the input variables. The input is a line of 8 integers:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo, n is the number of friends.\nk is the number of bottles bought.\nl is the milliliters in each bottle.\nc is the number of limes they have.\nd is the number of slices per lime.\np is the grams of salt they have.\nnl is the milliliters of drink each toast needs per person.\nnp is the grams of salt each toast needs per person.\n\nEach toast requires for each friend: nl ml of drink, one slice, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl ml, a slice, and np grams per toast. So for all n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices (since each of the n friends takes a slice), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me read the note again. Oh, the sample says that the total drink is 4*5=20ml, which is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Wait, but n is 3 friends. So each toast requires 3 * nl? Because each friend needs nl, so per toast, for all friends, it's n * nl.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Calculate the total resources available and how much is needed per toast.\n\n2. For each resource, determine how many toasts are possible based on that resource.\n\n3. The minimum of these will be the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute total_drink = k * l.\n- Compute total_slices = c * d.\n- Compute total_salt = p.\n\nEach toast requires:\ndrink_per_toast = n * nl\nslices_per_toast = n * 1 (since each friend takes one slice)\nsalt_per_toast = n * np\n\nSo for each resource, the number of possible toasts is:\n\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // drink_per_toast\ntoasts_slices = total_slices // slices_per_toast\ntoasts_salt = total_salt // salt_per_toast\n\nThe maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo the answer is min(toasts_drink, toasts_slices, toasts_salt).\n\nBut wait, if any of the required per toast is zero, that would cause a division by zero. But since all inputs are positive integers, we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo now, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute:\ntotal_drink =4*5=20\ndrink_per_toast=3*3=9. 20 /9 is 2 with remainder 2. So toasts_drink is 2.\n\ntotal_slices =10*8=80. slices_per_toast=3*1=3. 80//3 is 26, but wait, no, 3*26=78, leaving 2 slices. So toasts_slices is 26? But in the note, it's said that limes are enough for 80 toasts, but divided by 3 friends, so 80/3 is 26.666, which floors to 26. Hmm, but the note says the answer is 2 because min(6,80,100)/3.\n\nWait wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the note explains that the total drink is 20ml, which is enough for 20 /3=6 toasts. So why is toasts_drink 6?\n\nAh, because drink_per_toast is n * nl =3 *3=9. But 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2 toasts. But the note says 20 /3=6 toasts. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters. So for each toast, each friend takes nl. So for one toast, all n friends take together n * nl ml.\n\nYes. So drink_per_toast is n * nl.\n\nIn the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So 3*3=9ml per toast.\n\nTotal drink is 20ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2 toasts.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows 20 /3=6 toasts. That suggests that perhaps each toast only requires n * nl for all friends, but that's what I thought. So why does the note say 20/3=6 toasts?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the note:\n\nOverall, the friends have 4*5=20ml, which is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So that suggests that each toast requires 3ml of drink, but that's not correct because nl is 3.\n\nWait, no, in the note, it's written that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So that implies that each toast requires 3ml in total. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl=3ml. So for 3 friends, each toast needs 3*3=9ml. So 20ml allows 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says 20/3=6 toasts. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the drink is 4 bottles, each 5ml. So 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires n * nl =3 *3=9ml. So 20 /9=2.22, so 2 toasts.\n\nBut in the note, it's said that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So perhaps my initial understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the drink is 20ml, and each toast requires 3ml in total, not per person. But that doesn't fit the problem description.\n\nProblem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\". So per friend per toast: nl. So for all friends, per toast, it's n * nl.\n\nSo for the sample, that's 3*3=9ml per toast.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows 6 toasts. 6 toasts *9ml =54ml, but they only have 20ml. That can't be right.\n\nWait, that suggests that perhaps each toast requires just nl, not n * nl. Maybe I misread the problem.\n\nLooking back: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink.\" So per friend per toast, it's nl. So for one toast, all friends together require n * nl.\n\nBut the note says 20 /3 =6 toasts. So 6 toasts would require 6 *3=18ml. Which is less than 20ml. So that makes sense.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is that for each toast, the total drink needed is n * nl. So in the first sample, each toast requires 3*3=9ml. 20ml allows 20/9=2.222, which is 2 full toasts.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows 20/3=6 toasts. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the drink is enough for (total_drink) / (nl * n) toasts.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nMaybe each toast requires that each friend takes nl. So for all friends, it's n * nl per toast. So the total drink is k*l, which is 20ml.\n\nSo the number of toasts is (k*l) / (n * nl). But integer division, floor.\n\nIn the sample, that's 20 / (3*3)=20/9=2.222, which is 2.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So 20 /3=6.666, but that's 6 toasts.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So why in the note is the drink sufficient for 6 toasts?\n\nUnless I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nWait, perhaps each friend needs nl per toast, but all friends make a toast at the same time, so each toast requires n * nl. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for the sample, 3 friends, each needing 3ml, so 9ml per toast. 20ml gives 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So 6 *9=54ml, but they have 20. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the numbers in the note. Let me check.\n\nThe note says: Overall, the friends have 4*5=20ml of drink, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts. Hmm, that seems impossible unless each toast requires 3ml in total.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each toast requires 1ml per person, not nl. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each friend needs nl per toast, but for all friends together, it's just nl multiplied by the number of friends. So for each toast, all friends drink nl, so the total per toast is n * nl.\n\nBut then the note's calculation is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the drink is k*l, and each toast requires n * nl, so the number of toasts is (k*l) // (n * nl). But in the sample, that's 20/(3*3) = 2.222, so 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says 20 /3 =6 toasts.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each toast requires that each friend drinks nl, but the total drink per toast is just nl. But that can't be because n friends would need n * nl.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires that each friend drinks nl, but the total is per toast, regardless of the number of friends. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires that each friend has a certain amount, but the total across all friends is considered. So perhaps the drink per toast is n * nl, but the note is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is correct, and I'm miscalculating something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each friend uses nl per toast, but the total number of toasts is determined per friend, not per group.\n\nNo, the problem says that all friends must drink the same amount. So the number of toasts is the same for all.\n\nSo perhaps the note is correct, but I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total drink is 4*5=20.\n\nEach toast requires 3 *3=9ml.\n\n20 /9 =2.222... → 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says 20/3=6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires that each friend has nl milliliters, but that the drink is consumed per toast, not per friend. So perhaps each toast requires n * nl, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires that each friend has nl, but the total is per friend. So for one friend, the number of toasts is (k*l)/(nl). Then, for all friends, it's (k*l)/(n*nl). So that's the same as before.\n\nBut according to the note, it's 20/(3) =6 toasts. So 6 toasts ×3 friends each requiring 3ml, that's 6×3=18ml, which is within 20ml. So that's 6 toasts.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. So perhaps I was wrong in thinking that the drink per toast is 9ml, but perhaps it's 3ml.\n\nSo why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nProblem statement says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nSo each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So per toast, for all friends, it's n * nl ml. So the drink required per toast is n * nl.\n\nSo in the sample, 3 friends, each needing 3ml: 9ml per toast.\n\nSo 20ml allows 20 /9 =2.22 → 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says 20/3=6 toasts. So that's a conflict.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is using a different set of numbers. Let me see the note.\n\nNote says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20ml of drink, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100/1=100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3=2.\n\nWait, so according to the note, the drink allows 6 toasts. So that suggests that each toast requires 3ml (because 6×3=18ml, which is <=20ml).\n\nBut that's contradicting the earlier reasoning.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that each toast requires that each friend drinks 1ml of drink, and then each friend also takes a slice and np grams of salt. But that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires that each friend takes one slice and np grams, but the drink is separate. Or perhaps the drink is not per toast per friend, but per toast overall.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires that all friends together drink nl ml. So for example, if n=3, each toast requires 3ml in total, not per friend.\n\nBut that would mean that each toast, the group consumes 3ml, so for 6 toasts, 18ml, which fits into 20ml.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem statement which says each friend needs nl milliliters.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo each friend needs nl, per toast. So per toast, each friend takes nl. So for n friends, per toast, n * nl is consumed.\n\nSo in the sample, 3 friends, each needing 3ml: 9ml per toast.\n\nSo 20ml allows 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says drink is enough for 6 toasts. So 6×9=54ml, which is more than 20ml. So that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, I'm confused. How can the note say that the drink allows 6 toasts when the calculation based on the problem statement gives 2?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but then each friend can make 6 toasts, but since there are 3 friends, each can make 2 toasts. But that's the final result.\n\nWait, the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but each friend can make 6 toasts, but since there are 3 friends, each can make 2.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but each toast requires that each friend makes one. So each toast, all friends drink once. So each toast is a single event where each friend drinks once.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend contributes one drink.\n\nSo the total number of drinks is n * t, where t is the number of toasts.\n\nSo the total drink is k * l = n * t * nl → t = (k * l) / (n * nl)\n\nIn the sample, 20 / (3*3)=2.222 → t=2.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So 6 toasts ×3 friends =18 drinks. 18 ×3ml =54ml, but they have 20ml. So that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires that each friend makes a toast, which requires nl drink. So each toast increases the count by one for each friend. So for t toasts, each friend has t drinks.\n\nSo total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nSo t is (k*l) / (n * nl). So in the sample, 20/(3*3)=2.222 → t=2.\n\nBut note says 6 toasts, which would require 3*6=18 drinks, but they have 20ml.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the drink is used per toast, regardless of the number of friends. Like, each toast requires 3ml of drink, regardless of how many friends are making it. So for t toasts, the drink required is t *3ml.\n\nSo in the sample, 20ml allows 6 toasts (6*3=18ml). Then, the limes allow 10*8=80 slices, each toast requires 3 slices (3 friends, each taking a slice). So 80 /3=26 toasts. Salt is 100 grams, each toast requires 3*1=3 grams. 100 /3=33 toasts. So the minimum is 6. Then, each friend can make 6 /3=2 toasts.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that each toast requires n * nl milliliters of drink, but wait, no, because in that case, each toast requires 3*3=9ml, which would make 20ml allow 2 toasts.\n\nSo this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the drink is used per toast, not per friend. So each toast requires 3ml, regardless of the number of friends. So in the sample, 20ml allows 6 toasts, each requiring 3ml.\n\nBut then, the drink is 20, which is enough for 6 toasts.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl, which is 3ml per toast. So 3 friends ×6 toasts=18 drinks. 18 ×3ml=54ml, but they only have 20ml.\n\nThat's impossible.\n\nSo I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires that each friend has 1ml of drink, and then they take a slice and salt. But that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires that each friend takes 1ml, but that's not what the problem says.\n\nWait, perhaps I should read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice, and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs those.\n\nSo per toast, each friend needs nl, a slice, and np. So for all friends, per toast, it's n * nl, n slices, and n * np.\n\nThus, the total drink per toast is n * nl.\n\nSo in the sample, 3 friends, 3ml each: 9ml per toast.\n\nSo 20ml allows 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, which is 6×3=18ml. So that's 18ml, which is under 20ml.\n\nSo that would suggest that each toast requires 3ml in total, not per friend.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that each toast requires n * nl, but the note is considering drink per toast as nl, not per friend.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires that the total drink is nl, regardless of the number of friends.\n\nBut that can't be, because the problem says each friend needs nl.\n\nI'm really confused here. Let me try to re-express the problem.\n\nLet me restate the variables:\n\nn: number of friends.\n\nk: number of bottles.\n\nl: milliliters per bottle.\n\nc: number of limes.\n\nd: slices per lime.\n\np: grams of salt.\n\nnl: milliliters per friend per toast.\n\nnp: grams per friend per toast.\n\nSo for each toast:\n\nEach friend must have nl ml, so total drink per toast is n * nl.\n\nEach friend must have a slice, so total slices per toast is n.\n\nEach friend must have np grams, so total salt per toast is n * np.\n\nSo the total drink available is k * l.\n\nTotal slices available is c * d.\n\nTotal salt is p.\n\nThus, the maximum number of toasts t is the minimum of:\n\nt_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_slices = (c * d) // n\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, the answer is t.\n\nWait, in the sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink=20.\n\nt_drink =20/(3*3)=2.222 → 2.\n\nc=10, d=8 → slices=80.\n\nt_slices=80/3=26.666 →26.\n\nt_salt=100/(3*1)=33.333→33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut the note says that the drink allows 6 toasts. So according to that, perhaps the way of calculating t_drink is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the drink is enough for t toasts, where each toast requires that each friend has nl, so t is such that n * t * nl ≤ k*l.\n\nYes, that's what I thought before.\n\nSo in the sample, 3* t *3 ≤20 → t*9 ≤20 → t=2.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts.\n\nWait, 20 divided by 3 is 6.666, which is 6 toasts.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that each toast requires n * nl in total, but not per friend.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires that each friend makes a single drink, but the total is per toast, not per friend.\n\nWait, perhaps each toast requires that all friends take one drink, so the total per toast is n * nl.\n\nSo for t toasts, the total is t * n * nl.\n\nSo t is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nBut in the sample, that's 20//9=2.\n\nBut the note says 20/3=6 toasts, which would imply that each toast requires 3ml, not 9.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each friend can make as many toasts as possible, but all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the number of toasts is the same for all.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend uses their own nl, slice, and salt.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nt * n * nl ≤ k*l\n\nt * n ≤ c*d\n\nt * n * np ≤ p\n\nSo t must satisfy all three inequalities.\n\nSo t is the minimum of:\n\nt_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_slices = (c*d) // n\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nSo in the sample:\n\nt_drink = 20/(3*3) = 2.222 →2.\n\nt_slices=80/3=26.666 →26.\n\nt_salt=100/(3*1)=33.333→33.\n\nSo t is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nBut the note says that the drink allows 6 toasts. So perhaps the note is considering a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is wrong. Or perhaps the problem is that the drink is per toast, not per friend.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires that the group consumes nl, not per friend. So each toast requires n * nl.\n\nWait, no, that's what I thought before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the drink is per toast, and each friend can take any amount, but the problem says each friend needs nl per toast.\n\nSo perhaps the note is correct, but the initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires that each friend takes one drink, but the total is not per toast, but globally. So the drink is consumed over all toasts.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because each toast is an independent event.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should try to code the solution as per the initial approach and see.\n\nBut according to the sample, the approach is correct.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the initial approach.\n\nSo perhaps the note is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is referring to the fact that after 6 toasts, the friends have some leftover resources.\n\nBut that's not relevant because the problem is about the maximum number of toasts each can make.\n\nSo perhaps the note is trying to say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but perhaps each toast is for one friend only.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is correct, but the initial approach is wrong, and the problem statement is that each toast requires 3ml in total.\n\nBut that would mean that the problem statement is wrong.\n\nSo I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps it's better to proceed with the initial approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_needed_per_toast = n * nl\n\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // drink_needed_per_toast\n\nSimilarly:\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\nslices_needed_per_toast = n\n\ntoasts_slices = total_slices // slices_needed_per_toast\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nsalt_needed_per_toast = n * np\n\ntoasts_salt = total_salt // salt_needed_per_toast\n\nThe maximum number of toasts is the minimum of toasts_drink, toasts_slices, toasts_salt.\n\nThe answer is this value.\n\nSo for the sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 →20ml.\n\ndrink_needed =3*3=9 →20//9=2.\n\nc=10, d=8 →80 slices.\n\nslices_needed=3 →80//3=26.\n\np=100, np=1 →3*1=3 →100//3=33.\n\nSo the min is 2. Output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond input is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 →1000ml.\n\ndrink_needed=5*4=20 →1000//20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 →19 slices.\n\nslices_needed=5 →19//5=3.\n\np=90, np=3 →5*3=15 →90//15=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6) →3.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 →1,000,000ml.\n\ndrink_needed=10*50=500 →1e6//500=2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 →575 slices.\n\nslices_needed=10 →575//10=57.\n\np=1, np=1 →10*1=10 →1//10=0.\n\nSo min(2000,57,0) →0.\n\nWhich matches the third sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the 8 integers.\n\nCompute the four variables as above.\n\nThe minimum of the three is the answer.\n\nSo the code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntoasts_slices = total_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_slices, toasts_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n\nWait, but in Python, when you do integer division, it automatically floors the result. So for cases where division isn't exact, it correctly gives the floor.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nTesting the samples:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 →20.\n\ntoasts_drink=20//9=2.\n\nc=10, d=8 →80.\n\ntoasts_slices=80//3=26.\n\np=100, np=1 →3*1=3 →100//3=33.\n\nmin is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where one of the resources is insufficient.\n\nFor example, n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink=1.\n\ntoasts_drink=1//1=1.\n\nslices=1//1=1.\n\nsalt=1//1=1.\n\nmin is 1. Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: when n=1, and any of the other resources is zero. But according to the problem statement, the inputs are positive.\n\nAnother case: when n is larger than the slices available.\n\nLike n=5, c=1, d=3 →3 slices.\n\nso toasts_slices=3//5=0.\n\nSo the answer is zero.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each friend needs a certain amount of drink (nl milliliters), one lime slice, and a specific amount of salt (np grams) per toast.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n3. **Determine Resource Limits**:\n   - The total drink required per toast for all friends is `n * nl`.\n   - The total lime slices required per toast for all friends is `n`.\n   - The total salt required per toast for all friends is `n * np`.\n4. **Compute Maximum Toasts**:\n   - Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the available drink.\n   - Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the available lime slices.\n   - Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the available salt.\n5. **Determine the Limiting Resource**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is the minimum of the three computed values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntoasts_slices = total_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\ntoasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_slices, toasts_salt)\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The code reads the input values which represent the number of friends, bottles, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total resources (drink, lime slices, salt) are computed by multiplying the respective input values.\n- **Toast Calculation**: For each resource, the maximum number of toasts possible is calculated by dividing the total resource by the resource needed per toast for all friends.\n- **Limiting Resource**: The minimum of these three values gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends can make the same number of toasts without running out of any resource.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make by considering each resource constraint and finding the most restrictive one.",
