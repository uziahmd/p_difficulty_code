He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or suffix of the original string s. Each string is either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S), and I need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's in the order of the input.\n\nHmm, the input has 2n-2 strings, each of which is either a prefix or a suffix of length 1 to n-1. The task is to assign each of these strings as P or S correctly.\n\nWait, but how do I determine that? Because for each possible string s, the prefixes and suffixes would vary. But since the input is guaranteed to be consistent with at least one s, I need to find a way to model this.\n\nI remember that in such problems, the key is to find for each possible length k, the correct prefix and suffix. So for each k from 1 to n-1, there are two strings: one is the prefix of length k, and another is a suffix of length k. Or wait, no—each string could be a prefix or a suffix for some k.\n\nWait, no. For each k, there are exactly two strings provided in the input. One of them is a prefix of length k, the other is a suffix of length k. So for each k, we have two strings, and one is P, the other is S.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each k from 1 to n-1, among the two strings of length k, determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nI think the approach is to construct the possible candidates for the original string s and then check which assignments are consistent with all the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 100, so the number of possible s is 26^100, which is way too big. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each k, the correct prefix of length k must be equal to the correct prefix of k+1's prefix, etc. Similarly, the suffix of length k must match the suffix of k+1's suffix.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because the prefix of k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of k is the last k characters of s.\n\nSo, for any k, the prefix of k must be a substring of the prefix of k+1. Similarly, the suffix of k must be a substring of the suffix of k+1.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of k is the last k characters of s, which is a part of the suffix of k+1, which is the last k+1 characters. So the suffix of k is the same as the suffix of k+1, except perhaps the first character.\n\nSimilarly, the prefix of k is a part of the prefix of k+1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the possible s by considering the constraints from all k.\n\nLet me think about building the possible s step by step.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nWe have two strings of length 1. One is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nWait, but that might not be true because for k=1, the prefix is the first character, and the suffix is the last character of s. So for example, if s is \"ababa\", then the prefixes are 'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab' and the suffixes are 'a', 'ba', 'aba', 'bab'.\n\nSo for each k, the two strings of length k are one prefix and one suffix.\n\nBut how do they relate across different k?\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is to find for each k, the string that is a prefix for k, and see how it relates to the prefix for k+1. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is to find the correct prefix for each k by ensuring that the prefix of k is a prefix of the prefix of k+1. Similarly, the suffix of k must be a suffix of the suffix of k+1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we have the correct prefix and suffix for each k. Then, for each k, the prefix of k must be equal to the first k characters of the prefix of k+1. Similarly, the suffix of k must be equal to the last k characters of the suffix of k+1.\n\nWait, but this may not always hold because the suffix of k is the last k of s, and the suffix of k+1 is the last k+1, so the suffix of k is the same as the last k of the suffix of k+1.\n\nSo, for the suffixes, the suffix of k must be the suffix of the suffix of k+1, but only the first k characters. Similarly for prefixes.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nAnother approach: Let's collect all possible candidates for the full string s by trying to reconstruct it based on the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find the full string s such that for each k, one of the two strings of length k is the prefix, and the other is the suffix.\n\nHow?\n\nLet me try to model it.\n\nThe full string s must have, for each k, a prefix p_k and a suffix s_k, where p_k is a string of length k, s_k is a string of length k.\n\nBut for each k, the two given strings of length k are one p_k and one s_k.\n\nWait, no. For each k, there are exactly two strings, which are either p_k or s_k. So for each k, among the two strings, one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nBut how do we know which is which?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find for each possible k, the possible candidates for the prefix and suffix, and then build s step by step.\n\nLet me think about the structure of s.\n\ns is a string of length n.\n\nFor each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n- There are two strings of length k: say A and B.\n\nOne of them is the prefix p_k of s, and the other is the suffix s_k.\n\nNow, for k=1, the two strings are p_1 and s_1. For k=2, the two strings are p_2 and s_2, which are the prefix and suffix of length 2.\n\nWait, but p_2 must be the first two characters of p_3, etc. Similarly, s_2 must be the last two characters of s_3, etc.\n\nSo, for each k, p_{k} must be a prefix of p_{k+1}, and s_{k} must be a suffix of s_{k+1}.\n\nBecause p_{k+1} is the first k+1 characters of s, so p_k is the first k.\n\nSimilarly, s_{k+1} is the last k+1 characters of s, so s_k is the last k.\n\nSo, for each k, the correct p_k and s_k must satisfy:\n\np_k is a prefix of p_{k+1}, and s_k is a suffix of s_{k+1}.\n\nBut how do we find which of the two strings for each k is p_k and which is s_k?\n\nPerhaps the process is as follows:\n\nWe can create for each k a list of possible pairs (p_candidate, s_candidate). But for k=1, since p_1 is the first character and s_1 is the last, the two strings of length 1 must be one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the entire set of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nEach prefix p_k is a substring of s of length k.\n\nEach suffix s_k is a substring of s of length k, but starting at position n -k.\n\nSo, for the correct s, all the given prefixes and suffixes must fit into this structure.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to find for each possible k, the correct p_k and s_k, ensuring that for all k, the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative idea is to consider that for each k, the correct p_k must be a prefix of p_{k+1} and s_k must be a suffix of s_{k+1}.\n\nSo, for each k, among the two strings of length k, one is p_k and the other is s_k.\n\nWait, but for each k, there are two options: the first string is p_k and the second is s_k, or vice versa.\n\nSo, for each k, we can try both possibilities and see which assignment leads to a consistent solution across all k.\n\nBut for n=100, this could be computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each k from 1 to n-1, collect all the strings of length k. Since each k has exactly two strings, for each k, we have two options: which one is p_k and which is s_k.\n\n2. Try all possible combinations of selecting, for each k, which of the two strings is p_k and which is s_k.\n\n3. For each combination, check whether it satisfies the conditions for all k: p_k must be a prefix of p_{k+1}, and s_k must be a suffix of s_{k+1}.\n\n4. Once a valid combination is found, assign the corresponding labels (P or S) to each string in the input.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the input is a list of 2n-2 strings, but they are not grouped by their lengths. So the first step is to group the input strings by their lengths.\n\nYes, that's an important step. So the first thing I'll do is read all the input strings, group them by their lengths. For each k from 1 to n-1, there will be two strings.\n\nOnce the grouping is done, for each k, I have two strings: let's call them a and b.\n\nFor each k, I can consider two possibilities:\n\nOption 1: a is p_k, b is s_k.\n\nOption 2: b is p_k, a is s_k.\n\nThen, for each option, I need to check for all k from 1 to n-1 whether the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but checking for all k may be time-consuming, but for n=100, it's manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read all the input strings.\n\n2. Group them by their lengths into a dictionary, say by_length, where by_length[k] is a list of two strings.\n\n3. For each k from 1 to n-1, consider the two possible assignments of p_k and s_k.\n\n4. For each assignment, check if for all k, p_{k} is a prefix of p_{k+1}, and s_{k} is a suffix of s_{k+1}.\n\n5. If an assignment satisfies all these conditions, then proceed to assign the labels.\n\n6. Once the correct assignment is found, output the labels in the order of the input strings.\n\nBut how do I track which assignment is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the p_k and s_k are determined by the previous assignments. So the process is iterative.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose for each k, I have the current best candidate for p_k and s_k. Then, for k+1, I can compute what p_{k+1} and s_{k+1} must be, given p_k and s_k.\n\nWait, but that might not work because for k+1, the two strings are given, and I have to choose which is p_{k+1} and which is s_{k+1}, but also ensuring that p_{k} is a prefix of p_{k+1}, and s_{k} is a suffix of s_{k+1}.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to process the k's in order and build the possible p_k and s_k step by step.\n\nLet's try to outline this.\n\nInitialize for k=1:\n\nWe have two strings, a and b.\n\nWe need to choose which is p_1 and which is s_1.\n\nBut for k=1, p_1 is the first character of s, and s_1 is the last character.\n\nBut for k=2, p_2 must be the first two characters of s, which is the concatenation of p_1 and the second character.\n\nSimilarly, s_2 is the last two characters, which is the second last character followed by s_1.\n\nWait, but for k=2, the two strings are the possible p_2 and s_2.\n\nSo, for each possible choice of p_1 and s_1, we can compute what p_2 and s_2 should look like, and see if one of them matches the given strings.\n\nSo, for example, suppose for k=1, we choose a as p_1 and b as s_1.\n\nThen, p_2 must start with a, and end with s_1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, p_2 is the first two characters of s. So p_2 starts with p_1, which is a. So p_2 must be a + some character c.\n\nSimilarly, s_2 is the last two characters of s. So s_2 is some character d followed by s_1.\n\nSo, for k=2, the two given strings must include p_2 and s_2.\n\nSo, when processing k=2, given the choices for p_1 and s_1, we can compute the required p_2 and s_2, and check whether the two given strings for k=2 match p_2 and s_2 in some order.\n\nIf yes, proceed. Otherwise, backtrack.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nStart with k=1, choose which string is p_1 and which is s_1.\n\nFor each possible choice, compute what p_2 and s_2 must be, and see if the two strings for k=2 match p_2 and s_2 in any order.\n\nIf yes, proceed to k=3.\n\nRepeat this until k=n-1.\n\nIf a path is found that satisfies all k, then it's the correct assignment.\n\nThis seems manageable, especially since for each step, the branching factor is small (only 2 choices per step).\n\nSo now, the question is how to model this in code.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read all the input strings. Then, group them by their lengths into a dictionary, where for each k, we have a list of two strings.\n\nThen, for each possible starting point (for k=1), try both possibilities:\n\nCase 1: The first string is p_1, the second is s_1.\n\nCase 2: The second string is p_1, the first is s_1.\n\nFor each case, proceed to k=2.\n\nFor each case, compute p_2 and s_2.\n\np_2 must start with p_1, and s_2 must end with s_1.\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\np_2 is the first two characters of s, which is p_1 followed by the second character.\n\ns_2 is the last two characters of s, which is the (n-2)th character followed by s_1.\n\nWait, but how do we get the second character and the (n-2)th character without knowing s?\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: for a given k, p_k is the prefix of length k. So, p_{k} is the first k characters of s.\n\nSimilarly, s_k is the last k characters.\n\nSo, for k=2:\n\np_2 must be equal to the first two characters of s, which is p_1 concatenated with the second character.\n\ns_2 must be equal to the last two characters of s, which is the (n-2)th character concatenated with s_1.\n\nBut how do we get the second character and the (n-2)th character?\n\nWell, perhaps the idea is that, given p_1 and s_1, the next step is to find p_2 and s_2 such that:\n\np_2 starts with p_1, and s_2 ends with s_1.\n\nMoreover, the second character of p_2 must be the same as the second character of s.\n\nSimilarly, the (n-2)th character of s_2 must be the same as the (n-2)th character of s.\n\nBut again, without knowing s, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of trying to model the entire s, I can model p_k and s_k, and for each step, enforce that p_k is a prefix of p_{k+1} and s_k is a suffix of s_{k+1}.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nBecause:\n\np_{k+1} is the first (k+1) characters of s. So p_k is the first k, which must be a prefix of p_{k+1}.\n\nSimilarly, s_{k+1} is the last (k+1) characters of s. So s_k is the last k, which must be a suffix of s_{k+1}.\n\nSo, for each k, given p_k and s_k, when moving to k+1, p_{k+1} must be a string such that p_k is a prefix of p_{k+1}, and s_{k+1} must be a string such that s_k is a suffix of s_{k+1}.\n\nAdditionally, for k+1, the two strings are given as candidates for p_{k+1} and s_{k+1}.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nFor each possible initial assignment of p_1 and s_1:\n\n   For k = 1 to n-2:\n\n      Get the two strings for k+1.\n\n      Check if one of them starts with p_k (so is a possible p_{k+1}).\n\n      Check if the other ends with s_k (so is a possible s_{k+1}).\n\n      If both conditions are met for some pair, proceed to the next k.\n\n      Else, backtrack.\n\n   If all k are processed successfully, this is a valid assignment.\n\nOnce a valid assignment is found, assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how do I implement this?\n\nPerhaps using recursion or backtracking.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible initial assignment, simulate the process step by step.\n\nLet me think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, group the input by the length of the strings.\n\nThen, for each possible initial choice (for k=1), simulate building the sequence.\n\nLet's represent the state as (current_p, current_s), where current_p is the current prefix, and current_s is the current suffix.\n\nFor each step from k=1 to n-2:\n\n   For the next k+1, get the two strings for that k+1.\n\n   For each string in those two, check if it starts with current_p (could be a candidate for p_{k+1}).\n\n   For each such candidate p_candidate, check if the other string ends with current_s (could be a candidate for s_{k+1}).\n\n   If both are found, update current_p and current_s to p_candidate and s_candidate, respectively.\n\n   Proceed to the next k.\n\nIf all steps are processed, then this initial choice is valid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead all the input strings.\n\nGroup them by their lengths into a dictionary.\n\nThen, for each possible initial choice (which is choosing which string is p_1 and which is s_1):\n\n   current_p = chosen_p1\n\n   current_s = chosen_s1\n\n   valid = True\n\n   for k in 1 to n-2:\n\n       next_k = k + 1\n\n       candidates = by_length[next_k]\n\n       # Find possible p_next and s_next\n\n       possible_p = []\n\n       possible_s = []\n\n       for candidate in candidates:\n\n           if candidate.startswith(current_p):\n\n               possible_p.append(candidate)\n\n       for candidate in candidates:\n\n           if candidate.endswith(current_s):\n\n               possible_s.append(candidate)\n\n       # Now, for each possible_p and possible_s, see if they form a pair.\n\n       if len(possible_p) <1 or len(possible_s) <1:\n\n           valid = False\n\n           break\n\n       # Take the first possible_p and possible_s, assuming they form a pair.\n\n       # But wait, the two candidates for k+1 are the two given strings. So, for the next step, the two candidates are the two strings for k+1.\n\n       # So, for each pair (p_candidate, s_candidate) in possible_p and possible_s, check if the two strings are the ones in the list.\n\n       # Because the two candidates for k+1 must be the two given strings.\n\n       # So, the p_candidate must be one of the two, and the s_candidate must be the other.\n\n       # So, for each p_candidate in possible_p:\n\n       #   if the other candidate in the list is a string that ends with current_s.\n\n       #   then, proceed.\n\n       # So:\n\n       for p_candidate in possible_p:\n\n           if p_candidate not in candidates:\n\n               continue\n\n           s_candidate = candidates[0] if p_candidate == candidates[1] else candidates[1]\n\n           if s_candidate.endswith(current_s):\n\n               current_p = p_candidate\n\n               current_s = s_candidate\n\n               break\n\n       else:\n\n           valid = False\n\n           break\n\n   if valid:\n\n       # Assign the labels accordingly.\n\n       # Now, we need to map each input string to its label.\n\n       # So, for each string in the input, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\n       # To do this, for each string, find its length k.\n\n       # Then, check whether it is the p_k or s_k in the assignment.\n\n       # But wait, for each k, the two strings are assigned as p_k and s_k.\n\n       # So, for each string in the input, find its k, and see whether it's p_k or s_k.\n\n       # So, for each string in the input:\n\n       #   k = len(string)\n\n       #   if string == current_p for k: label is 'P'\n\n       #   elif string == current_s for k: label is 'S'\n\n       # But wait, for k=1, current_p is p_1, current_s is s_1.\n\n       # For k=2, current_p is p_2, current_s is s_2, etc.\n\n       # So, for each string in the input, find its k, and compare to the current_p and current_s for that k.\n\n       # So, the plan is:\n\n       # Create a list of the input strings.\n\n       # For each string, determine its k.\n\n       # For that k, if the string is equal to current_p: mark as 'P'\n\n       # else, if it's equal to current_s: mark as 'S'\n\n       # But wait, for each k, there are exactly two strings: one p_k and one s_k.\n\n       # So, for the input, the strings are all the p_k and s_k for various k.\n\n       # So, the output string will have 'P' for each p_k and 'S' for each s_k.\n\n       # So, the output is built by going through each string in the input, find their k, and assign 'P' or 'S' based on whether it's p_k or s_k.\n\n       # So, in code:\n\n       output = []\n\n       for s_in in input_list:\n\n           k = len(s_in)\n\n           #

So, first, create a dictionary that for each k, knows the current_p and current_s.\n\n       # We can create a dictionary current_p_dict where current_p_dict[k] is the prefix for that k.\n\n       # Similarly, current_s_dict[k] is the suffix.\n\n       current_p_dict = {}\n\n       current_s_dict = {}\n\n       current_p_dict[1] = p1\n\n       current_s_dict[1] = s1\n\n       for k in range(2, n):\n\n           current_p_dict[k] = current_p\n\n           current_s_dict[k] = current_s\n\n       #

No, wait in the sample input, perhaps the input is as follows:\n\nWait, the sample input seems to have multiple lines, but perhaps the actual input is a list of 2n-2 strings, each of varying lengths.\n\nBut in any case, the code should handle it.\n\nSo, the code reads all the strings, groups them by length, and tries the initial possibilities.\n\nIn the sample input, for k=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a' perhaps, but in reality, the code will find the correct initial p1 and s1.\n\nOnce the initial assignment is correct, the rest follows.\n\nAnother test case is when n=2, and the input has two strings of length 1.\n\nIn that case, the code would try both initial possibilities, and whichever leads to a valid sequence is taken.\n\nSo, for example, the third sample input is:\n\n['2\\na\\nc']\n\nSo, n=2, the two strings are 'a' and 'c'.\n\nSo, possible initial assignments:\n\np1='a', s1='c' → then for k=2, which is beyond n-1 (since n=2, k can be 1 only). So it's valid.\n\nOr, p1='c', s1='a' → then for k=2, again no more steps.\n\nSo, both initial possibilities are valid.\n\nIn this case, the output can be 'PS' or 'SP'.\n\nSo, the code would return 'SP' if the initial is p1='c', s1='a'.\n\nThus, the output would be 'SP'.\n\nWhich is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\nI think this approach should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or suffix of the original string based on the provided inputs. The goal is to output a string consisting of 'P' (prefix) and 'S' (suffix) for each input string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input and Group by Length**: First, read all input strings and group them by their lengths into a dictionary. Each length from 1 to n-1 will have exactly two strings.\n2. **Initial Assignment**: For each possible initial assignment of the first character (either as a prefix or suffix), simulate building the original string step by step.\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each subsequent length, check if the current prefix can be extended and the current suffix can be truncated to match the given strings for that length.\n4. **Validation**: If a valid assignment is found that satisfies all constraints, assign labels ('P' or 'S') to each input string based on whether it matches the computed prefix or suffix for its respective length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\nby_length = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in by_length:\n        by_length[l] = []\n    by_length[l].append(s)\n\n# Try both possibilities for k=1\ncandidates_k1 = by_length.get(1, [])\nif not candidates_k1:\n    # This should not happen as per problem statement\n    pass\nelse:\n    for p1, s1 in [(candidates_k1[0], candidates_k1[1]), (candidates_k1[1], candidates_k1[0])]:\n        current_p = p1\n        current_s = s1\n        valid = True\n        for k in range(1, n-1):\n            next_k = k + 1\n            if next_k not in by_length:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            candidates = by_length[next_k]\n            possible_p = [c for c in candidates if c.startswith(current_p)]\n            possible_s = [c for c in candidates if c.endswith(current_s)]\n            if not possible_p or not possible_s:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            found = False\n            for p_candidate in possible_p:\n                if p_candidate in candidates:\n                    s_candidate = candidates[0] if p_candidate == candidates[1] else candidates[1]\n                    if s_candidate.endswith(current_s):\n                        current_p = p_candidate\n                        current_s = s_candidate\n                        found = True\n                        break\n            if not found:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Now, create the output\n            current_p_dict = {}\n            current_s_dict = {}\n            current_p_dict[1] = current_p\n            current_s_dict[1] = current_s\n            for k in range(2, n):\n                current_p_dict[k] = current_p\n                current_s_dict[k] = current_s\n            output = []\n            for s_in in strings:\n                k = len(s_in)\n                if s_in == current_p_dict[k]:\n                    output.append('P')\n                else:\n                    output.append('S')\n            print(''.join(output))\n            exit()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input and Grouping**: The input strings are read and grouped by their lengths into a dictionary. This helps in efficiently accessing the strings based on their lengths.\n2. **Initial Assignment**: For the first character (length 1), we consider both possibilities where one string could be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each subsequent length, we check if the current prefix can be extended and the current suffix can be truncated to match the given strings. This ensures that each step builds on the previous valid state.\n4. **Validation and Output**: If a valid assignment is found that satisfies all constraints, we then determine the correct labels for each input string and print the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible assignments and ensures that the solution is consistent with the given constraints.",
