    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about counting triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D, and the triangle is non-degenerate, which means x + y > z must hold.\n\nHmm, let's break down the constraints:\n\n- x is between A and B (inclusive)\n- y is between B and C (but since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, y starts from x)\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So for each x in [A,B], y must be in [B,C], but also y must be >= x because x ≤ B and y >= B. So for a given x, y can range from max(x, B) to C. But wait, since x is <= B and y is >= B, then y starts at B, but if x is less than or equal to B, y can be as low as B but higher than x? Or wait, no: the problem says x ≤ B ≤ y, so y must be >= B, but x can be up to B. So for a given x, y can range from B to C, but also y has to be >= x? Or wait, no: the condition is x ≤ B ≤ y. So y can be B, but x could be less than or equal to B. So for example, x could be 2, B is 3, y is 3. So y can start at B regardless of x.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement says \"A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D\". So yes, x is up to B, and y is at least B. So for each x, y starts from B and goes up to C. But wait, wait, no: the problem says x can be up to B, and y can be as small as B, but what about when x is larger than B? No, because x is in [A,B], so x cannot be larger than B. So for any x, y must be at least B, but since x is ≤ B, y can be as low as B.\n\nWait, but what about when x is equal to B? Then y can be from B to C. But if x is less than B, like x=2, B=3, then y can be 3,4,...,C.\n\nSo, for each x in [A, B], y can be in [B, C], and for each y, z can be in [max(y, C), D].\n\nWait, no: the condition is C ≤ z ≤ D, but also z must be ≥ y because the ordering is x ≤ y ≤ z. So z must be ≥ y and ≥ C. So z starts from max(y, C) to D.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nThe approach is to iterate over all possible x, y, z and count the valid triples where x + y > z, x <= B, y >= B, etc. But with the constraints, doing this naively would be too slow because A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, leading to O(1e15) operations, which is impossible.\n\nWe need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all possible triples.\n\nLet's think about the variables:\n\nx ranges from A to B.\n\nFor each x, y ranges from B to C, but since x can be up to B, and y is at least B, y can be from B to C. However, for a given x, y must be >= x? Or wait, no. Because the condition is x <= y, right? Because the problem statement says x ≤ B ≤ y. So y is >= B, and x can be up to B, so y is always >= x. Because x is at most B, and y is at least B, so y >= x holds.\n\nSo for a given x, y can vary from B to C, and for each y, z can vary from max(C, y) to D.\n\nBut wait, the condition on z is that it's >= y and >= C. So z can be from max(y, C) to D.\n\nSo for each x and y, the number of possible z is max(0, D - max(y, C) + 1). But only if max(y, C) <= D.\n\nAdditionally, for the triangle to be non-degenerate, we need x + y > z. So for each z, the condition is x + y > z.\n\nBut z can be up to D, so for each (x, y), the maximum z allowed is min(D, x + y - 1). Because z must be less than x + y. But wait, z must also be >= max(y, C).\n\nSo for each (x, y), the valid z's are those that are >= max(y, C) and <= min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nBut if max(y, C) > min(D, x+y-1), then there are zero z's.\n\nOtherwise, the count is min(D, x+y-1) - max(y, C) + 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over x from A to B.\n\nFor each x, loop over y from B to C.\n\nFor each (x, y), compute lower_z = max(y, C)\n\nupper_z = min(D, x + y - 1)\n\nif upper_z < lower_z: continue\n\nelse: add (upper_z - lower_z + 1) to the total.\n\nBut even this approach is O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)), which can be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo this approach won't work. We need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: For each y in [B, C], find the x's that are <= B and >= A, and for each such x, calculate the contribution to the total based on y.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each y, the x's that can form a triangle with z >= max(y, C) and z <= min(D, x + y -1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each y, we can find the range of x's that, when paired with this y, contribute some z's.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to fix y and find all x's and z's that satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me think about the constraints:\n\nFor each (x, y, z):\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C\n\ny ≤ z ≤ D\n\nAnd x + y > z.\n\nAdditionally, z >= C.\n\nSo, for a fixed y, x can be from A to min(B, y-1). Because x ≤ B and x ≤ y-1 (since x + y > z, and z >= y, so x + y > z >= y → x + y > y → x>0, which is always true since x ≥ A ≥ 1).\n\nWait, no. For z >= y, x + y > z implies that x + y > z ≥ y → x + y > y → x > 0, which is already satisfied since x ≥ A ≥1.\n\nSo, for a fixed y, x can be from A to B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for each x, y starts from B, but now for a fixed y, x can be up to B and down to A.\n\nSo for a fixed y, x can vary from A to B.\n\nNow, for each (x, y), the z's must satisfy:\n\nz >= max(y, C)\n\nz <= D\n\nand z < x + y.\n\nSo for a fixed y, we can think of x varying from A to B, and for each x, the z's are in [lower_z, upper_z], where lower_z = max(y, C), upper_z = min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nBut again, calculating this for each x and y is O(N^2), which is too slow.\n\nWe need a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's precompute for each y, the range of x and the corresponding z's.\n\nFor a fixed y, the x can be from A to B.\n\nBut perhaps we can find for each y, the minimal and maximal x that allows z to exist.\n\nWait, but the contribution of x and y depends on z's possible values, which in turn depend on x and y.\n\nAnother idea: For each y, determine the range of x where the lower_z <= upper_z.\n\nThat is, for each y, find x such that max(y, C) ≤ min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nmax(y, C) ≤ x + y - 1 → x ≥ max(y, C) - y + 1 = max(1, C - y + 1).\n\nAnd since x must be ≥ A and ≤ B.\n\nSo, for each y, x must be ≥ max(A, C - y + 1) and ≤ B.\n\nIf max(A, C - y + 1) > B, then there are no x's for this y, so no contribution.\n\nElse, the x's are in [x_min, B], where x_min = max(A, C - y + 1).\n\nOnce we have the x's for a given y, for each x in this range, the z can vary from lower_z to upper_z.\n\nBut again, we need a way to compute the total contribution for all x in [x_min, B] quickly.\n\nWait, for each y, the x's are in [x_min, B]. For each x in this interval, the z's are in [lower_z, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nSo for each x, the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - lower_z + 1).\n\nSumming over x from x_min to B, but this is still O(N) per y, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each y, instead of considering each x, perhaps find the number of x's that contribute a certain amount to the total.\n\nWait, perhaps for a fixed y, the lower_z is L = max(y, C), and D is known.\n\nSo for a given y, the x's that satisfy x >= (L) - y + 1.\n\nWait, because x + y -1 >= L → x >= L - y + 1.\n\nBut x must be >= A and <= B.\n\nSo x must be >= max(A, L - y + 1).\n\nBut wait, L is max(y, C). So L is either y or C, whichever is larger.\n\nCase 1: y >= C → L = y.\n\nSo x >= y - y + 1 = 1. Since x >= A >= 1.\n\nSo for this case, x can be from A to B, but only if B >= A.\n\nWait, no, wait: x >= max(A, 1) is same as x >= A since A >=1.\n\nSo for y >= C:\n\nx must be >= A and <= B.\n\nBut also, z must be >= y, <= D.\n\nAnd for each x, z can be up to min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], the z's are from y to min(D, x + y -1).\n\nSo the number of z's for each x is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - y + 1) → which is min(D, x + y -1) - y +1 = min(D - y +1, x).\n\nBecause x + y -1 - y +1 = x.\n\nSo for y >= C, the contribution is the sum for x from A to B of min(D - y + 1, x).\n\nBut wait, that's only when x + y -1 >= y → which is always true.\n\nSo the number of z's for each x is min(D - y + 1, x).\n\nWait, no: because z can be up to min(D, x + y -1), but z must be >= y.\n\nSo the length is min(D, x + y -1) - y + 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to min(D - y + 1, x).\n\nYes.\n\nSo for y >= C:\n\nthe total contribution is sum_{x=A}^B min(D - y + 1, x).\n\nBut how to compute this sum quickly.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: y < C → L = C.\n\nSo for x, we need x >= C - y + 1.\n\nSo x must be >= max(A, C - y + 1).\n\nAnd x <= B.\n\nIf max(A, C - y + 1) > B → no contribution.\n\nElse, x runs from x_min to B.\n\nFor each x in this range, the z can be from C to min(D, x + y -1).\n\nSo the number of z's is min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1.\n\nWhich is (min(D, x + y -1) - C +1) → same as before.\n\nSo for each y, depending on whether y >= C or not, we have different expressions.\n\nBut again, for each y, evaluating this is O(1) for some cases and O(B - x_min) for others, which is still too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a mathematical way to compute the sum for both cases.\n\nLet me consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: y >= C.\n\nIn this case, lower_z = y.\n\nFor each x in [A, B], the number of z's is min(D - y + 1, x).\n\nSo the sum is the sum of min(D - y + 1, x) for x from A to B.\n\nCase 2: y < C.\n\nThen, lower_z = C.\n\nWe need x >= C - y + 1.\n\nFor x in [x_min, B], the number of z's is min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nWait, no: the number of z's is min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1.\n\nWhich is (x + y -1) - C + 1 if x + y -1 <= D → x + y - C <= D - C +1.\n\nWait, x + y -1 >= C → x >= C - y + 1.\n\nSo for each x >= x_min, the number of z's is min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nWait, because x + y -1 - C + 1 = x + y - C.\n\nSo if x + y - C <= D - C → then z can go from C to x + y -1, which is (x + y - C) terms.\n\nElse, if x + y - C > D - C → then z can only go up to D, which is (D - C + 1) terms.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the number of terms is (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nif x + y -1 >= D → D - C + 1.\n\nelse → (x + y -1 - C + 1) = x + y - C.\n\nSo the number of z's is min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the count is (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\nif x + y -1 >= D:\n\nthen D - C + 1.\n\nElse:\n\n(x + y -1 - C + 1) = x + y - C.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo for case 2, the number of z's is min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nBut how to compute the sum for x in [x_min, B] of min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to express it in terms of the x's.\n\nLet me denote K = D - C + 1.\n\nThen, the term is min(K, x + y - C).\n\nSo for x in [x_min, B], we can split into two parts:\n\n1. x + y - C <= K → x <= K + C - y.\n\n2. x + y - C > K → x > K + C - y.\n\nSo for each y, compute the x's that fall into these regions.\n\nBut K is fixed for a particular D and C.\n\nWait, for a particular y and given K, the threshold x is T = K + C - y.\n\nIf T < x_min → then all x in [x_min, B] are in region 1.\n\nIf T > B → then all x in [x_min, B] are in region 2.\n\nElse, the x's are split into two ranges: [x_min, T] in region 1, and [T+1, B] in region 2.\n\nSo for each y, the sum can be computed as follows:\n\nCompute T = K + C - y.\n\nCompute the lower and upper bounds for x.\n\nIf T < x_min:\n\nsum += (number of x's) * min(K, ...) → but since x <= T < x_min, no x's in this category.\n\nWait, no: in this case, T < x_min → all x >= x_min will be in region 2.\n\nWait, because T = K + C - y.\n\nSo for x >= x_min:\n\nif x <= T → region 1.\n\nBut if T < x_min → x >= x_min implies x > T → region 2.\n\nSo for case 2, if T < x_min:\n\nsum += (B - x_min + 1) * K.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, for region 2, each x contributes K.\n\nWait, no, in region 2, the contribution is K.\n\nWait, no: in region 2, min(K, x + y - C) is K, so each x contributes K.\n\nSo in this scenario, the total is (B - x_min + 1) * K.\n\nBut wait, K is D - C + 1, which may be negative if D < C. But since D >= C (as per problem statement), K is >=1.\n\nSo in this case, sum is (B - x_min + 1) * K.\n\nIf T > B:\n\nsum += (x_min ... B) x's, each contributing (x + y - C).\n\nSo we need to compute the sum of (x + y - C) for x from x_min to B.\n\nWhich can be written as sum x from x_min to B of (x + (y - C)).\n\nWhich is (sum x) + (y - C) * (B - x_min + 1).\n\nSum x is (B*(B+1)/2) - ((x_min -1)*x_min)/2.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nIf T is between x_min and B:\n\nsum is sum from x=x_min to T of (x + y - C) → which is (sum x) + (y - C)*(T - x_min + 1).\n\nPlus sum from x=T+1 to B of K.\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nsum_part1 = (sum_x x=x_min to T (x + (y - C))) → which is (sum x) + (y - C)(T - x_min +1).\n\nsum_part2 = (B - T) * K.\n\nTotal sum is sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\nSo for each y, we can compute T, and based on whether T is less than x_min, between x_min and B, or greater than B, compute the sum accordingly.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWe can loop through each y from B to C.\n\nFor each y:\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nCompute L = max(y, C).\n\nCompute x_min_case1 = max(A, L - y + 1).\n\nWait, no: for case 1, y >= C → L = y.\n\nSo x_min_case1 = max(A, 1) → but since A >=1, it's A.\n\nWait, no, earlier analysis for case 1 shows that for y >= C, x must be >= A and <= B.\n\nSo for case 1, x ranges from A to B.\n\nWait, but in case 1, the number of z's is min(D - y +1, x).\n\nSo for case 1, the sum is sum_{x=A}^B min(D - y +1, x).\n\nWhich can be split into two regions:\n\nx <= (D - y +1) and x > (D - y +1).\n\nWait, no: for each x, the min is x if x <= (D - y +1), else D - y +1.\n\nWait, no: min(a, b) is a if a < b, else b.\n\nSo for x <= (D - y +1): min is x.\n\nElse: min is D - y +1.\n\nSo the sum can be broken into:\n\nif (D - y +1) >= B:\n\nsum = sum x from A to B → (B*(B+1)/2 - (A-1)*A/2).\n\nElse:\n\nsum = sum from x=A to (D - y +1) of x → which is (D - y +1)*(D - y +2)/2 - (A-1)*A/2.\n\nPlus sum from x=(D - y +2) to B of (D - y +1).\n\nWhich is (B - (D - y +2) + 1) * (D - y +1).\n\nSo for case 1, the sum can be calculated using these steps.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, we have the earlier approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop y from B to C:\n\n   if y >= C:\n\n      compute case 1:\n\n         K_case1 = D - y +1\n\n         if K_case1 < A:\n\n             no contribution from case1.\n\n         else:\n\n             if K_case1 >= B:\n\n                 sum_case1 = (B - A +1) * (B + A) // 2.\n\n             else:\n\n                 sum_part1 = (K_case1) * (K_case1 +1) // 2 - (A-1)*A//2\n\n                 sum_part2 = (B - K_case1) * K_case1\n\n                 sum_case1 = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\n             add sum_case1 to total.\n\n   else:\n\n      compute case 2:\n\n         L = C\n\n         K = D - L +1 = D - C +1.\n\n         x_min_case2 = max(A, L - y +1) → max(A, C - y +1).\n\n         if x_min_case2 > B:\n\n             no contribution.\n\n         else:\n\n             T = K + C - y\n\n             if T < x_min_case2:\n\n                 # all x >= x_min_case2 are in region 2.\n\n                 count_x = B - x_min_case2 +1\n\n                 sum_case2 = count_x * K\n\n             elif T > B:\n\n                 # all x >= x_min_case2 are in region 1.\n\n                 # sum x from x_min_case2 to B of (x + y - C)\n\n                 sum_x = (B*(B+1)//2) - (x_min_case2 -1)*x_min_case2//2\n\n                 sum_case2 = sum_x + (y - C) * (B - x_min_case2 +1)\n\n             else:\n\n                 # split into two parts.\n\n                 sum_part1 = sum from x=x_min_case2 to T of (x + (y - C))\n\n                 sum_part2 = sum from x=T+1 to B of K.\n\n                 sum_part1 = ((T*(T+1)//2) - (x_min_case2 -1)*x_min_case2//2) + (y - C)*(T - x_min_case2 +1)\n\n                 sum_part2 = (B - T) * K\n\n                 sum_case2 = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\n             add sum_case2 to total.\n\nSo, for each y, we have to handle both cases, but the computation is manageable in O(1) time.\n\nThis way, the total time complexity is O(C - B + 1), which is up to 5e5 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nSample Output: 4.\n\nLet's see:\n\nLoop y from 2 to 3.\n\nFor y=2:\n\ncase1: y < C=3.\n\nCompute K=D-C+1=4-3+1=2.\n\nx_min_case2 = max(A=1, C - y +1=3-2+1=2).\n\nSo x ranges from 2 to 2 (since B=2).\n\nT = K + C - y = 2 +3-2=3.\n\nCompare T=3 with x_min_case2=2.\n\nSince T> B=2:\n\nsum_case2 is sum x from 2 to 2 of (x + 2 -3) → (2 -1)=1.
