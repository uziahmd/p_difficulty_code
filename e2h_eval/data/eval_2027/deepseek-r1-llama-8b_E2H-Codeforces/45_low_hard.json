There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, so for example, when n=2, there's only one game, so the output is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games: first against someone, then against another. But wait, how does that work? Because after the first game, the winner has one game played. Then, the next opponent must have either 0 or 1 game played. Since the opponent hasn't played any yet, but the winner has one, that's allowed. So yes, two games.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The maximum is 2. Oh wait, no, the sample says for n=10, the output is 4. Wait, let me check the examples again.\n\nWait, in the third sample, n=4, the output is 2. How does that happen? Because the winner plays two games: maybe beating two opponents in the first round and then the final. Or perhaps the structure is such that the winner can't have more than two games because the other players are arranged in a way that limits their path.\n\nWait, no, the note says that for n=4, the answer is 2. So how is that possible? Oh right, because after playing two games, the winner has two games played. But what about the third game? Is it possible?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me think differently. The tournament is a knockout, so each game eliminates one player. To maximize the number of games the winner plays, we need to arrange the matches such that the winner can play as many as possible, adhering to the rule about the difference in the number of games played.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible chain of games the winner can participate in, given that each step's opponent has a game count differing by at most one from the current winner's count.\n\nLet me model this. Let's say the winner has k games. Each game they play must be against an opponent who has either k-1, k, or k+1 games before facing them. Wait, no, the condition is that the difference is at most one. So the opponent can have either (k-1) or (k) games before the match.\n\nWait, no. Because when the two players meet, the winner's own game count increases by one. So, suppose before the match, the winner has x games played, and the opponent has y. The condition is |x - y| ≤ 1. After the match, the winner's x becomes x+1.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of games, the winner must choose opponents in a way that allows them to have as many steps as possible, each time increasing their game count by one, but ensuring that each opponent has a game count that's either equal or differs by one.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of binary trees or Fibonacci sequences. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each step adds a new level, and the number of players needed grows exponentially.\n\nFor instance, to reach k games, the minimum number of players required is Fib(k+2). Because:\n\n- 1 game: needs 2 players (Fib(3) = 2)\n- 2 games: needs 3 players (since the first game leaves one winner, then another game with another player)\nWait, no. Wait, for 2 games, the winner must have two wins. So, for example, in a three-player scenario, the winner beats two players in two consecutive games.\n\nWait, but for 3 players, the initial arrangement might have the winner play two games. So the minimal n required for k games is Fib(k+2). Let me see:\n\nFor k=1, Fib(3)=2.\nk=2: Fib(4)=3.\nk=3: Fib(5)=5.\nk=4: Fib(6)=8.\nk=5: Fib(7)=13.\n\nWait, but when n is 10, the sample output is 4. So the maximum k is 4, which requires at least 8 players. But wait, 10 is larger than 8, so it's possible. But why isn't k=5 possible? Because 13 is larger than 10, so for n=10, the maximum k is 4.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest k such that Fib(k+2) ≤ n.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where Fib(m) exceeds 1018 (since n can be up to ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the problem can be modeled using the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. This is because each subsequent game the winner plays requires opponents who have either played the same number or one fewer game than the winner, leading to a structure similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. For example:\n   - To play 1 game, you need 2 players (Fib(3) = 2).\n   - To play 2 games, you need 3 players (Fib(4) = 3).\n   - To play 3 games, you need 5 players (Fib(5) = 5), and so on.\n\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We compute the Fibonacci sequence iteratively until the value exceeds the maximum possible number of players (1018). For each value of `k`, we check if the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`. The largest such `k` is our answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n    # Now find the largest k where fib[k+2] <= n\n    k = 0\n    for i in range(len(fib)):\n        if fib[i] <= n:\n            k = i - 1\n        else:\n            break\n    return k\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: The code starts by initializing the Fibonacci sequence with the first two values (1, 1). It then iteratively computes each subsequent Fibonacci number until it exceeds the given number of players `n`.\n\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: After computing the Fibonacci sequence, the code iterates through the sequence to find the largest index `i` such that the Fibonacci number at that index is less than or equal to `n`. The index `i` is adjusted to determine the maximum number of games `k` the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limit of the input constraints.",
