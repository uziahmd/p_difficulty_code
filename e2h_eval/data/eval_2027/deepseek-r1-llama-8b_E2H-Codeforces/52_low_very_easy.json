Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about candles and figuring out how many hours they can burn for. The process goes like this: each candle burns for an hour and then goes out. But Vasily is smart because he can take 'b' number of burned-out candles and make a new one. So the question is, what's the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let's think about the example given. For instance, when a is 4 and b is 2. So initially, he has 4 candles burning for 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned ones can be turned into 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 more hours. Now, after burning those, he has 2 more burned candles. Since b is 2, he can make another candle. That burns for another hour, making it 7 total.\n\nSo the approach here is that each time you collect the burned candles, you can convert them into new ones as long as you have enough to make at least one new candle.\n\nWait, right. So the algorithm should be something like:\n\n- Start with 'a' hours.\n- While the number of burned candles (let's call it rem) is >= b:\n   - add the number of new candles made (rem // b)\n   - subtract the used ones (so rem = rem % b + new_candles)\n   - increase the total hours by new_candles.\n\nWait, no. Because each new candle burns for an hour, which adds to the total. And each time, the new candles are added to the rem for the next iteration.\n\nLet me model it step by step.\n\nTake the first example: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial rem is 0? Wait, no. Wait, initial a is the number of candles. So the initial burn is a hours. After that, rem is a.\n\nSo rem = a.\n\nThen, while rem >= b:\n\n   new = rem // b\n   total += new\n   rem = rem % b + new\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nIn the first case: rem starts at 4.\n\n4 >= 2: new is 2. total becomes 4+2=6. rem is 4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nNow rem is 2 >=2: new is 1. total is 7. rem is 0 +1=1. Now rem is less than b, so loop stops. So total is 7.\n\nAnother example: 6 3.\n\nInitial a=6. rem=6.\n\n6 >=3: new=2, total 8. rem becomes 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3, so stop. So output is 8.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nWhat about another case, say a=5, b=5.\n\nThen initial rem=5.\n\nnew=1, total 6. rem is 5%5=0 +1=1. Now rem <5, so total is 6.\n\nAnother example: a=10, b=3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nrem=10.\n\n10//3=3, total 13. rem=10%3=1 +3=4.\n\n4 >=3: new=1, total 14. rem=4%3=1 +1=2. Now 2<3, so total is 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the initial total as a.\n2. rem = a.\n3. while rem >= b:\n   a. new = rem // b\n   b. total += new\n   c. rem = rem % b + new\n4. return total.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo in code, we can implement this.\n\nHow to handle the input: two integers a and b on the same line.\n\nRead them, compute the total as per above.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: a is less than b. For example, a=3, b=5. Then rem=3, which is less than b. So total is 3.\n\nEdge Case 2: a is exactly divisible by b. Like a=6, b=3. Then new is 2, rem becomes 0+2=2. Which is less than b, so total is 6+2=8.\n\nAnother edge case: a=0. But according to the problem statement, a is at least 1.\n\nWait, the constraints are 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000. So a can't be zero.\n\nSo our code doesn't have to handle a=0.\n\nSo now, the code structure is:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nCompute total = a.\n\nrem = a.\n\nwhile rem >= b:\n\n    new = rem // b\n\n    total",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for an hour and then goes out, but Vasily can convert a certain number of these burned-out candles into new ones, which can be used again.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Burned Candles Collection**: After burning all initial candles, we collect the burned-out candles, which we'll refer to as `rem`.\n3. **Recycling Process**: While the number of burned-out candles (`rem`) is enough to make at least one new candle (i.e., `rem >= b`), continue recycling:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from `rem` (which is `rem // b`).\n   - Add the number of new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update `rem` to the remainder of the division plus the newly made candles.\n4. **Termination**: The process stops when `rem` is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis approach ensures that we optimally use every possible burned-out candle to maximize the illumination time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nrem = a\n\nwhile rem >= b:\n    new = rem // b\n    total += new\n    rem = rem % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.\n- **Initial Burn**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for an hour.\n- **Recycling Loop**: The loop continues converting burned-out candles into new ones as long as there are enough to form at least one new candle.\n- **Updating Variables**: In each iteration, the number of new candles is calculated, added to the total hours, and the remaining burned-out candles are updated.\n- **Output**: Finally, the total number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated is printed.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures optimal use of resources, making it both correct and efficient.",
