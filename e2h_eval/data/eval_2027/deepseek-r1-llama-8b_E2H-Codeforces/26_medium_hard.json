    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, z. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is: Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. The triangle is non-degenerate if x + y > z.\n\nHmm, so the conditions are:\n\n1. x is between A and B (inclusive)\n2. y is between B and C (inclusive)\n3. z is between C and D (inclusive)\n4. Also, x ≤ y ≤ z, but wait, no: the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts from B and goes up to C, and z starts from C up to D. But within these ranges, x can be anything in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D], but also x must be ≤ y and y ≤ z? Wait, no. Because the condition says A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be any value in [A,B], but y has to be >= B and <= C. So x can be less than or equal to y, because x is at most B, and y is at least B. So x ≤ y. Similarly, y is at most C, and z is at least C, so y ≤ z. So overall, x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet (x, y, z) satisfying those ranges, we need to check if x + y > z. And count all such triplets.\n\nBut since A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, a brute force approach is impossible. So we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the constraints:\n\n- x ∈ [A, B]\n- y ∈ [y_min, y_max], where y_min = B, y_max = C\n- z ∈ [z_min, z_max], where z_min = C, z_max = D\n\nBut also, x ≤ y ≤ z. So y can't be less than x, and z can't be less than y.\n\nWait, but y is already >= B, and x is <= B, so x <= y automatically. Similarly, y <= C, z >= C, so y <= z automatically. So the main conditions are:\n\nx ∈ [A, B]\ny ∈ [B, C]\nz ∈ [C, D]\n\nBut for the triangle condition, x + y > z must hold.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of triplets (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D], and x + y > z.\n\nBut directly iterating through all possible x, y, z is O(N^3), which is way too slow for N=5e5.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Since x is bounded by B, which could be up to 5e5, and y similarly, perhaps we can find a way to precompute some prefix sums or similar structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can fix y and then count the valid x and z for each y.\n\nWait, for each y, what are the possible x and z?\n\nx can be from A to B, but x ≤ y. Since y is at least B, x can range from A to min(y, B). But since y is ≥ B, x can be up to B, which is ≤ y (since B ≤ y).\n\nSo for a given y, x can be in [A, B], because x is always ≤ y.\n\nSimilarly, z must be ≥ y (since z ≥ C and y can be up to C), but also z must be < x + y.\n\nWait, no: z can be as low as C, but when y is fixed, z must be ≥ C and ≤ D, but also z < x + y.\n\nWait, but z is also ≥ y, so the lower bound for z is max(C, y). But wait, C is ≥ y? Because y is up to C. So yes, z starts from C, which is ≥ y.\n\nWait, no: C can be larger than y, but y can be up to C, so for a given y, z can be from C up to min(D, x + y - 1). Because z must be ≥ C and ≤ x + y - 1.\n\nSo for each y, the possible z's are in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nBut x varies from A to B, and for each x, the upper limit for z is x + y - 1, but z cannot exceed D.\n\nSo maybe for each y, we can compute the total number of (x, z) pairs that satisfy x + y > z, with x in [A, B] and z in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nHmm, but even that might not be efficient enough because y can be up to 5e5, and for each y, x ranges up to 5e5, and for each x, z can be up to another 5e5.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each y, we can find the valid x's and compute the corresponding z's efficiently.\n\nLet's think differently: For a fixed y, what is the range of x and z that satisfies x + y > z.\n\nSince z must be ≥ C and ≤ D, and z < x + y.\n\nSo for each y, the z can be as high as min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nBut x can be from A to B.\n\nSo for each y, the z's are in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)] for each x.\n\nBut considering all x's for a single y is expensive. Maybe we can find for each y the total number of (x, z) pairs where z >= C, z < x + y, and z <= D.\n\nWait, for a given y, let's consider the minimum possible z, which is C, and the maximum possible z is min(D, x + y - 1). But x varies, so for each x, the maximum z is x + y - 1, but it can't exceed D.\n\nSo the idea is, for each y, find all x in [A, B], and for each x, find the range of z that is valid.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally heavy.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's fix y and think about x and z.\n\nFor each y, the x can vary from A to B.\n\nThe z must satisfy two conditions: z >= C, and z < x + y.\n\nAdditionally, z must be <= D.\n\nSo for each x, the z can be from C to min(x + y - 1, D).\n\nBut for each y, the x can be in [A, B], so for each y, the x's contribute a certain number of z's.\n\nBut again, it's unclear how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express z's for a given y as:\n\nz must be >= C, and < x + y, and <= D.\n\nSo for a given y, the possible z's are in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)] for each x.\n\nBut how do we count this across all x?\n\nHmm, perhaps for a fixed y, we can find the total number of (x, z) pairs where x is in [A, B], z is in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nz >= C and z <= min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nBut for each x, the upper limit for z is x + y - 1, but not exceeding D.\n\nSo the sum over x is the sum from x = A to B of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nBut that's still O(B) per y, which is 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nWe need a better approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's precompute for each possible y the contribution to the total count.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps we can find the range of x where x + y - 1 >= C.\n\nBecause if x + y - 1 < C, then there are no z's for that x.\n\nSo for x to contribute, x must be >= C - y + 1.\n\nWait, because x + y - 1 >= C → x >= (C - y + 1).\n\nSo x must be >= max(A, C - y + 1).\n\nBut x can't exceed B.\n\nSo for each y, the x's that contribute are in [max(A, C - y + 1), B].\n\nIf the lower bound is higher than B, then no x contributes for this y.\n\nOtherwise, the x's are from L = max(A, C - y + 1) to R = B.\n\nNow, for each x in [L, R], z can be from C to min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo the total number of z's for this x is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nWe can sum this over x from L to R.\n\nBut even this approach may be too slow because for each y, we have to loop through x, which is O(R-L+1) steps.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a mathematical expression for this sum.\n\nLet's denote for a fixed y:\n\nlow = max(A, C - y + 1)\nhigh = B\n\nif low > high → no contribution.\n\nElse, for x in [low, high], the number of z's is:\n\nmax(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nmin(D, x + y - 1) >= C → x + y - 1 >= C → x >= C - y + 1, which is already satisfied.\n\nSo for each x, the count is:\n\nnumber_of_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 )\n\nWhich is:\n\nif x + y -1 >= D → then the count is D - C + 1.\n\nElse, the count is (x + y -1) - C + 1 = x + y - C.\n\nSo the count is:\n\nnumber_of_z = min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nif x + y - 1 < C → 0.\n\nelse:\n\nif D >= x + y -1 → D - C + 1.\n\nelse → (x + y -1) - C +1 = x + y - C.\n\nSo for each x, the number of z's is:\n\nif x + y -1 < C → 0.\n\nelif x + y -1 < D → x + y - C.\n\nelse → D - C + 1.\n\nBut x is >= low = max(A, C - y + 1), so x + y -1 >= C.\n\nSo the first condition is always false.\n\nThus, the count is either x + y - C or D - C + 1, depending on whether x + y -1 <= D.\n\nSo now, for each y, the x's are in [low, high], and for each x, the count is:\n\nif x + y <= D +1 → x + y - C.\n\nelse → D - C + 1.\n\nWait, x + y -1 <= D → x + y <= D +1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each x in [low, high], the count is:\n\nif x + y <= D +1 → x + y - C.\n\nelse → D - C +1.\n\nSo now, the total for this y is the sum over x in [low, high] of the count.\n\nSo, how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet's find the point where x + y crosses D +1.\n\nLet s = D +1.\n\nx0 = s - y.\n\nSo, x >= x0 will have x + y > s → count is D - C +1.\n\nx < x0 → count is x + y - C.\n\nBut x must be >= low and <= high.\n\nSo, for each y, we can compute x0 = s - y = (D +1) - y.\n\nNow, the x's are in [low, high].\n\nWe need to find the split point x_split where x < x_split → count1, x >= x_split → count2.\n\nx_split is the maximum between low and x0.\n\nSo, the x's are divided into two regions: x < x_split and x >= x_split.\n\nBut wait, x_split could be greater than high, meaning all x's fall into the second case.\n\nOr x_split could be less than low, meaning all x's fall into the first case.\n\nSo:\n\nCompute x_split = max(low, x0).\n\nThen:\n\nCase 1: x_split > high → all x in [low, high] are >= x_split → all counts are D-C+1.\n\nCase 2: x_split <= low → all x in [low, high] are < x_split → all counts are x + y - C.\n\nCase 3: x_split is between low and high → part of x's are in first case, part in second.\n\nSo, for each y, we can compute the number of x's in [low, x_split -1] and [x_split, high].\n\nSo, for each y, the process would be:\n\n1. Compute low = max(A, C - y + 1)\n\n   If low > high (B) → continue.\n\n2. Compute s = D + 1.\n\n   x0 = s - y.\n\n   x_split = max(low, x0)\n\n3. Check if x_split > high:\n\n   a. If yes → all x in [low, high] have x >= x_split → count for each x is D - C + 1.\n\n      So total += (high - low + 1) * (D - C +1).\n\n   b. Else if x_split < low → all x in [low, high] are < x_split → count for each x is x + y - C.\n\n      So the sum is sum_{x=low}^{high} (x + y - C).\n\n      Which is sum x from low to high → (high*(high+1)/2) - (low-1)*low/2) → plus (y - C) * (high - low +1).\n\n   c. Else:\n\n      i. Split the x's into [low, x_split-1] and [x_split, high].\n\n      ii. For the first part, x < x_split → count is x + y - C.\n\n          The sum is sum_{x=low}^{x_split-1} (x + y - C) = sum x from low to x_split-1 → (x_split-1)(x_split)/2 - (low-1)low/2) + (y - C)*(x_split - low).\n\n      iii. For the second part, x >= x_split → count is D - C + 1.\n\n          The sum is (high - x_split + 1) * (D - C +1).\n\n      iv. Total for y is the sum of parts ii and iii.\n\nSo, putting this together, for each y, we can calculate the contribution in O(1) time after computing the necessary terms.\n\nNow, the next question is: What is the range of y?\n\ny is in [B, C]. So for each y from B to C, inclusive, we need to compute this.\n\nBut B and C can be up to 5e5, so looping through all y's from B to C is O(5e5) steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over y from B to C:\n\n   For each y:\n\n      low = max(A, C - y + 1)\n\n      if low > B → continue.\n\n      high = B\n\n      s = D + 1\n\n      x0 = s - y\n\n      x_split = max(low, x0)\n\n      if x_split > high:\n\n          count += (high - low + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n\n      elif x_split < low:\n\n          # All x in [low, high] contribute x + y - C.\n\n          # sum x from low to high: (high*(high+1) - (low-1)*low) // 2\n\n          sum_x = (high * (high +1) - (low-1) * low ) // 2\n\n          sum_total = sum_x + (y - C) * (high - low +1)\n\n          count += sum_total\n\n      else:\n\n          # Part 1: x from low to x_split-1\n\n          part1_sum_x = ( (x_split-1) * x_split - (low-1)*low ) // 2\n\n          part1_sum_y = (y - C) * (x_split - low)\n\n          part1 = part1_sum_x + part1_sum_y\n\n          # Part 2: x from x_split to high\n\n          part2_count = high - x_split +1\n\n          part2 = part2_count * (D - C + 1)\n\n          count += part1 + part2\n\nSo this would handle each y in O(1) time.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where D < C? Because z must be >= C and <= D. So if D < C, then z can't exist, meaning no triangles for such y. So we need to handle that.\n\nAh, right! So before proceeding, for a given y, if C > D, then z can't be in [C, D], because C > D. So in that case, no z exists, so contribution is zero.\n\nSo in code, for each y, first check if C > D → if so, skip.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo adding that condition at the beginning of processing each y.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So C ≤ D is always true. So no, that condition can't happen. So no need to check.\n\nSo the code can proceed without that check.\n\nAnother edge case: when D < C → but according to the input constraints, it's not possible. So no problem.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nPossible y values are 2 and 3.\n\nFor y=2:\n\nlow = max(1, 3 - 2 +1) = max(1, 2) → 2.\n\nhigh = 2.\n\ns = 4+1=5.\n\nx0 = 5-2=3.\n\nx_split = max(2,3)=3.\n\nBut high is 2 → x_split > high → case 3a.\n\nSo all x's in [2,2], which is just x=2.\n\ncount += (2-2+1) * (4-3 +1) = 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nWait, but according to the sample explanation, for y=2, the triangles are (2,2,3) and (2,2,4)?\n\nWait no, the sample output is 4, which includes four triangles.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through each y and see.\n\nWait, let's take sample input 1: '1 2 3 4'.\n\nSo y can be 2 or 3.\n\nLet's process y=2:\n\nlow = max(1, 3-2+1)= max(1, 2)=2.\n\nhigh=2.\n\ns=4+1=5.\n\nx0=5-2=3.\n\nx_split = max(2,3)=3.\n\nBut high is 2 → x_split>high.\n\nSo all x in [2,2] → 1 x.\n\nEach x contributes z in [3, min(4, x+2-1)].\n\nx=2: z can be 3,4.\n\nSo 2 z's.\n\nSo for y=2, the count is 2.\n\nNow for y=3:\n\nlow = max(1, 3-3+1)= max(1,1)=1.\n\nhigh=2.\n\ns=5.\n\nx0=5-3=2.\n\nx_split = max(1,2)=2.\n\nSo x ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nCheck x_split <= high (2):\n\nPart 1: x from 1 to 1.\n\ncount is x +3 -3 = x.\n\nsum_x = 1.\n\nsum_total_part1 = 1 + (3-3)*(1) → 1 +0=1.\n\nPart 2: x from 2 to 2.\n\ncount is 4-3+1=2.\n\nSo part2 is 2.\n\nTotal for y=3: 1+2=3.\n\nSo overall, 2+3=5. But the sample output is 4.\n\nWait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, the sample expects 4, but according to my calculation, it's 5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, for y=3, x can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\nz must be >=3, <= min(4, 1+3-1)=3.\n\nSo z=3.\n\nSo one z.\n\nFor x=2:\n\nz must be >=3, <= min(4, 2+3-1)=4.\n\nSo z can be 3 or4 → 2 options.\n\nSo for y=3, total is 1+2=3.\n\nSo for y=2, it's 2, for y=3, it's 3. Total 5.\n\nBut sample output is 4.\n\nWait, so something is wrong with my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial problem statement was misunderstood.\n\nLooking back: the problem says the triangle is non-degenerate if x + y > z.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the triangles are (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4).\n\nWait, why is (1,3,3) valid? 1+3>3 → 4>3 → yes.\n\nBut in my calculation for y=3, x=1 contributes 1 z (z=3), which is correct.\n\nSo why is the sample output 4 instead of 5?\n\nAh, because in the problem statement, the ranges are x ≤ y ≤ z. So for (1,3,3): x=1, y=3, z=3.\n\nIn my approach, for y=3, x=1 is allowed because x is in [1,2].\n\nBut the sample lists this triangle as part of the count.\n\nSo why does the sample output say 4?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the sample output is 4, but according to my approach, it's 5.\n\nSo I must have made a mistake in the logic.\n\nWait, let's list all possible (x, y, z) triplets:\n\nFor y=2:\n\nx can be 2.\n\nz can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo two triplets: (2,2,3) and (2,2,4).\n\nBut in the sample, they are included.\n\nFor y=3:\n\nx can be 1 and 2.\n\nx=1:\n\nz can be 3.\n\n→ (1,3,3)\n\nx=2:\n\nz can be 3 or4.\n\n→ (2,3,3), (2,3,4).\n\nSo four triplets.\n\nTotal of 2+3=5.\n\nBut the sample says 4.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nWait, looking back: the problem requires x, y, z to satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D.\n\nWait, no. It's A ≤ x ≤ B, and B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D.\n\nBut the order is x ≤ y and y ≤ z, but the problem statement says \"such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D holds\".\n\nWait, the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D, and x ≤ y and y ≤ z.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's possible that x can be ≤ y and y can be ≤ z, but the way the ranges are set up, x can be up to B, y starts at B, so x is ≤ y.\n\nSimilarly, y is up to C, and z starts at C, so y ≤ z.\n\nSo the ordering is x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the triplet (1,3,3) is allowed because x=1 ≤ y=3, and y=3 ≤ z=3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo why is the sample output 4?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that in the sample, x can't be 1 when y is 3 because B is 2. Wait, no. In the first sample, B is 2, so y can be 2 or 3. For y=3, x is in [A, B] → [1,2].\n\nSo x=1 is allowed.\n\nSo why is the sample output 4 instead of 5?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement requires that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which is when x + y > z.\n\nBut in the sample, for (1,3,3): 1+3>3 → 4>3 → yes.\n\nSo why is this not counted?\n\nWait, the sample output is 4, but according to my approach, it's 5.\n\nSo perhaps I'm making a mistake in the code logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is incorrect.\n\nWait, the sample says:\n\nIn the first example, the triangles are:\n\n(1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). So four triangles.\n\nBut according to my approach, there's five.\n\nSo where is the fifth?\n\nAh, perhaps (1,3,4) is not a valid triangle.\n\nWait, 1+3>4 → 4>4 is false, so it's invalid.\n\nSo (1,3,4) is not counted.\n\nWait, but in my approach for y=3, x=1, z can be 3 or 4?\n\nWait, no: x=1, y=3.\n\nz must be >=3 and <1+3=4 → z can be 3 only.\n\nBecause z must be <4.\n\nSo for x=1, z can be 3 only.\n\nSo for y=3, x=1 contributes 1.\n\nx=2 contributes 2.\n\nSo 3 for y=3.\n\nPlus 2 for y=2: total 5.\n\nBut sample says 4.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscounting somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the problem statement, the condition is x ≤ y ≤ z, but perhaps the original condition is that x <= y <= z, but in the code, I'm considering all x and y and z that satisfy the ranges, but perhaps some triplets are not being considered correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the triplet (1,3,3) is considered as x=1, y=3, z=3.\n\nBut for this, x is 1, which is within [A,B] = [1,2].\n\ny is 3, which is within [B,C] = [2,3].\n\nz is 3, which is within [C,D]=[3,4].\n\nSo it's a valid triplet.\n\nBut according to the sample, it's counted as one of the four.\n\nSo why is the sample output 4?\n\nWait, perhaps the triplet (1,3,3) is not considered because x is not allowed to be 1 when y is 3.\n\nWait, no, because x can be up to B=2.\n\nSo x=1 is allowed.\n\nSo why is the sample output 4?\n\nI'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the code approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the code approach is correct, but the sample is wrong.\n\nBut that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible z, count the number of (x,y) pairs such that x ≤ y ≤ z and x + y > z.\n\nBut z is in [C, D].\n\nBut again, this may not be more efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent the problem as:\n\nWe need to count the number of triplets (x, y, z) where:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\n\nx ≤ y ≤ z,\n\nand x + y > z.\n\nSo perhaps the code needs to account for all possible x, y, z in their ranges, and x <= y <= z, and x+y > z.\n\nAnother idea: precompute for each possible y, the x can be in [A, B], and z can be in [C, min(D, x + y -1)].\n\nBut the same problem arises.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the sample is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample input.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nInput is '1 2 3 4', which is A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nSo the possible triplets:\n\ny can be 2 or 3.\n\nFor y=2:\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nBut wait, in the code approach, for y=2:\n\nlow = max(1, 3-2+1)=2.\n\nhigh=2.\n\nSo x can only be 2.\n\nz can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo two triplets: (2,2,3) and (2,2,4).\n\nFor y=3:\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nx=1: z can be 3.\n\nx=2: z can be 3 or4.\n\nSo three triplets.\n\nTotal 5.\n\nBut sample output is 4.\n\nSo why is this discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because in the problem statement, the triangle is non-degenerate if and only if x + y > z.\n\nWait, in the triplet (1,3,3): 1+3=4>3 → yes, it's valid.\n\nSo it should be counted.\n\nBut sample output says 4. So why is it not counted?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement requires x, y, z to be distinct.\n\nNo, the note says that the third example is a single equilateral triangle, which implies that x=y=z is allowed.\n\nSo that's not the issue.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the sample.\n\nLooking back at the sample explanation:\n\nIt says the triangles are (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). So four triangles.\n\nBut according to my approach, it's five.\n\nSo where's the fifth?\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps the triplet (2,3,3) is considered, but in the code approach, it's being counted.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, it's listed as one of the four.\n\nSo perhaps I'm double-counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triplet (2,3,3) is allowed but another triplet is not.\n\nWait, perhaps the triplet (1,3,3) is valid, but in the problem statement, the sample explanation includes it as one of the four, but according to the code approach, it's five.\n\nSo perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the code approach is correct and the sample is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in thinking about the ranges.\n\nWait, for y=3, x can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1, z can be 3.\n\nFor x=2, z can be 3 or4.\n\nSo four triplets for y=3.\n\nPlus two for y=2: total 6.\n\nWait, but sample output is 4.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the sample is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z, but not necessarily in the same order as the ranges.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D.\n\nSo x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nSo, for x=1, y=3, z=3: x ≤ y and y ≤ z.\n\nSo it's allowed.\n\nBut the sample explanation doesn't include it. So perhaps the sample is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is correct, and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that x ≤ y and y ≤ z, but x must be ≤ y, and y must be ≤ z, but also x must be ≥ A, y must be ≥ B, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering that y can be less than C.\n\nNo, because y is in [B, C].\n\nSo, perhaps the code approach is correct, but the sample is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code approach is missing some constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that x <= y <= z, but z must be strictly greater than y.\n\nNo, because in the sample, (2,2,3) is allowed, which is a valid triangle.\n\nSo I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps I should try to implement the code as per the initial approach and see.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps I should proceed with writing the code according to the initial approach, but adjust for any possible mistakes.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the code approach is correct, but I have a mistake in the way I'm calculating the sum.\n\nIn the case of y=3, x=1, z can be 3.\n\nWhich is 1 triplet.\n\nx=2, z can be 3 or4 → 2.\n\nSo total 3 for y=3.\n\nPlus 2 for y=2 → 5.\n\nBut sample says 4.\n\nSo perhaps the code approach is overcounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the code approach is considering (x, y, z) where x can be less than B, but in the problem statement, x is in [A, B], but in the code approach, for y=3, x can be 1, but perhaps the condition is that x can't be less than B, which is 2.\n\nWait, no: x is allowed to be 1 because x is in [A, B] = [1,2].\n\nSo x=1 is allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that x <= y and y <= z, but x can be less than or equal to y, but not greater than.\n\nBut that's already handled.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with implementing the code as per the initial approach, and see if it passes the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps for y=3, x can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1: z can be 3.\n\nWhich is 1.\n\nx=2: z can be 3 and4 → 2.\n\nSo total 3.\n\nPlus for y=2: 2.\n\nTotal 5.\n\nBut sample says 4.\n\nSo perhaps the code approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code approach is allowing x to be in [A, B], but x can't be larger than y.\n\nBut in the code approach, x is in [A, B], and y is >= B, so x <= y.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo perhaps the code approach is correct, but the sample is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement requires that x + y > z, but x + y > z must be strictly greater.\n\nWhich it is.\n\nBut in the sample, (2,3,4) is allowed: 2+3>4 →5>4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo why is the sample output 4 instead of 5?\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the sample is correct, and I'm missing a constraint.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that x, y, z are strictly increasing, i.e., x < y < z.\n\nNo, because in the third example, all are 500000, which is allowed.\n\nSo that's not the case.\n\nI'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the code approach and see.\n\nBut perhaps I should think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Precompute for each z, the number of (x, y) pairs such that x + y > z, x <= y, x in [A,B], y in [B,C], and y <= z.\n\nBut z is in [C, D], and y <= z.\n\nSo for each z, y can be in [B, min(C, z)].\n\nFor each such y, x can be in [A, min(B, y)].\n\nAnd x + y > z.\n\nSo for each z, compute the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, min(B, y)], y in [B, min(C, z)], and x + y > z.\n\nBut this seems complex, but perhaps can be optimized.\n\nBut again, for large D,",
