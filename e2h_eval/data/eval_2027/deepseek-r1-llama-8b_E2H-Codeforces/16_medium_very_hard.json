Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about moving between blocks in Crazy Town. Each block is a region divided by roads, which are lines on the plane. Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, but the movement is only allowed if they share a border of non-zero length. So each step is crossing one road.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from my home's block to the university's block.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model how each road affects the possible path. Since each step is a cross over a single road, maybe the minimal steps correspond to the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nWait, but how do I determine which roads separate them? Because some roads might not affect the path at all if they don't enclose the points or something like that.\n\nLet me think: each road divides the plane into two halves. For a point, the road either separates the home and the university or not. If a road does separate them, then that road must be crossed when going from home to university.\n\nBecause if the road doesn't separate them, then their blocks are on the same side of the road, so you don't need to cross it.\n\nSo the minimal steps would be equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nWait, yes! Because for each such road, you have to cross it once. And since you can't cross multiple roads in a single step, each requires a separate step. So the minimal number is just the count of roads that separate the two points.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each road (line), determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides of it.\n2. Count how many such roads there are.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nBut wait, how do I check if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nEach line is given by ax + by + c = 0. For a point (x0, y0), substituting into the equation gives f(x0, y0) = a*x0 + b*y0 + c.\n\nIf f(home) and f(university) have opposite signs, then the line separates them. Otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nBut we have to be careful with zero cases. However, the problem statement says that neither home nor university lie on any road, so f will never be zero for either point.\n\nSo the plan is straightforward:\n\n- For each line, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n- If f1 and f2 have opposite signs (i.e., f1 * f2 < 0), then this line contributes to the count.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nRead home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2).\n\nFor each of the n roads:\n    Read a, b, c.\n    Compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    Compute f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    If f1 * f2 < 0, increment count.\n\nReturn count as the minimal steps.\n\nThat seems simple enough. Now, let's test this logic with the example provided.\n\nIn the sample input, the first case is:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads.\n\nFirst road: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. So for home, 1*1 + 0*1 +0=1>0. For university, 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1<0. So they are on opposite sides. So this road counts.\n\nSecond road: 1x + 0y +0=0 → x=0. Home: 1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0. University: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1<0. Opposite sides again. So count is 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample. The second case in the sample has 3 roads, and the output is 2. Let's see:\n\nWait, no, in the sample input, the second case is:\n\nThe third line is 3, meaning 3 roads.\n\nThe roads are:\n\n1x + 0y +0 → x=0. Home is (1,1): 1>0. University is (-1,-1): -1<0. Opposite, count +=1.\n\nThen 0x +1y +0 → y=0. Home is 1>0, university is -1<0. Count becomes 2.\n\nThird road: 1x +1y -3=0. Let's compute for home: 1*1+1*1 -3= -1. For university: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3= -5. Both negative, same sign. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. So output is 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, considering the constraints: n can be up to 300, which is manageable.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nWe need to read the input correctly.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, for large inputs, it's better to read all at once, but for 300 lines, it's manageable.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read home coordinates: x1, y1. But wait, the input is given as strings. So perhaps:\n\nhome = list(map(int, input().split()))\nx1, y1 = home[0], home[1]\n\nSame for university.\n\nThen read n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nFor each line:\n\na, b, c = map(int, line.split())\n\nCompute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\nf2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nif f1 * f2 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nFinally, print(count).\n\nBut wait, what about integer overflows? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nAlso, make sure that the initial lines for home and university are read correctly. Sometimes, input may have leading or trailing spaces, but using split() should handle that.\n\nAnother thing: the home and university points are guaranteed not to lie on any road. So f1 and f2 can't be zero, so no division by zero issues.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nRead home:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nSame for university:\n\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if f1 * f2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is written as '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n...' — so perhaps the input is read as lines, but in the actual code, each line is processed correctly.\n\nWait, no, because the way the input is presented is as three separate lines, but when reading via input(), each call reads a line. So the code above should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nLine 1: 0 1 0 → a=0, b=1, c=0.\n\nf1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1\n\nf2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1\n\nf1*f2 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nLine 2: 1 0 0 → a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\nf1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1\n\nf2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 → product <0 → count=2.\n\nThus output is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, the second case in the sample:\n\nAfter processing, count is 2.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads in Crazy Town are represented as lines on a plane. These lines divide the plane into regions (blocks). Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. The key insight is that each road can be checked to see if it separates the home and university points. If a road separates them, it must be crossed once.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), substitute the coordinates of the home and university into the equation. If the results have opposite signs, the road separates the two points, meaning you must cross it.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of the home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the values of the line equation at both points.\n   - Check if these values have opposite signs, indicating the road separates the points.\n   - Count the number of such roads, which gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if f1 * f2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Line Equation Check**: For each road, the values of the line equation at the home and university coordinates are computed. If these values have opposite signs, the road separates the two points.\n- **Count Separating Roads**: The total count of such roads is the answer, as each separating road must be crossed exactly once to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their ability to separate points on a plane.",
