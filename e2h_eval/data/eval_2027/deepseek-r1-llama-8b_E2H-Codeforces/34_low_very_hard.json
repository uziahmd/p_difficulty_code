And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is probably not going to work because that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved. For each possible window of size k, I need to sum the values in that window and then compute the average over all windows.\n\nWait, but adding each window from scratch every time would take O(k) per window, which when multiplied by O(n) windows gives O(nk) time—this would be 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to calculate the sums of all sliding windows. Oh right! That's where a sliding window technique or using a prefix sum array comes into play.\n\nYes, the prefix sum approach seems suitable here. Let me outline how that would work.\n\nFirst, I'll compute the prefix sum array. Then, for each window starting at index i, the sum is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i]. This way, I can get each window's sum in O(1) time after the prefix sum is computed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the list of a's.\n3. Compute the prefix sum array.\n4. Iterate over all possible windows (from 0 to n-k), calculate each sum using the prefix array.\n5. Sum all these window sums to get the total.\n6. Divide the total by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n7. Output the result with sufficient precision.\n\nWait, but how to handle the prefix sum? Let me think.\n\nThe prefix sum array can be built as follows: prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. So for each i, prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements.\n\nThen, the sum of the window from index j to j + k - 1 is prefix[j + k] - prefix[j].\n\nRight, so for each window starting at j (where j ranges from 0 to (n - k)), the sum is prefix[j + k] - prefix[j].\n\nSo once the prefix array is built, I can loop through all j and accumulate the total sum.\n\nNow, considering the constraints:\n\n- n can be up to 2e5, so the prefix sum needs to be handled efficiently.\n- Each a_i is up to 1e5, but that's fine since we're dealing with sums.\n\nLet's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nTake the third example:\n\nInput:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nn=8, k=2, so there are 7 windows.\n\nThe prefix sum array would be:\n\nprefix[0] = 0\nprefix[1] = 1\nprefix[2] = 3\nprefix[3] = 7\nprefix[4] = 100007\nprefix[5] = 100130\nprefix[6] = 100586\nprefix[7] = 100576\nprefix[8] = 100577\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step:\n\na = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nprefix[0] = 0\nprefix[1] = 1\nprefix[2] = 1+2=3\nprefix[3] = 3+4=7\nprefix[4] = 7 + 100000 = 100007\nprefix[5] = 100007 +123=100130\nprefix[6] = 100130 +456=100586\nprefix[7] = 100586 +789=100586 + 789 is 101375? Wait no, wait 100586 +789 is 101375?\nWait 100586 + 700 is 101286, plus 89 is 101375. Yes.\n\nprefix[8] = 101375 +1=101376.\n\nSo for each window:\n\nwindow 0-1: sum 1+2=3\nwindow 1-2: 2+4=6\nwindow 2-3:4+100000=100004\nwindow 3-4:100000+123=100123\nwindow4-5:123+456=579\nwindow5-6:456+789=1245\nwindow6-7",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on given data. Each week is defined as k consecutive days, and we need to consider all such windows in the given n days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks of k consecutive days from n days of data. Given the constraints, an efficient approach is necessary to avoid excessive computation time.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique with Prefix Sum**: To efficiently compute the sum of each window of size k, we use a prefix sum array. This allows us to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time after the prefix sum array is built.\n3. **Prefix Sum Construction**: The prefix sum array is constructed such that each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the input array. This helps in quickly determining the sum of any subarray using the formula: `sum = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]`.\n4. **Summing All Windows**: Using the prefix sum array, we iterate over all possible windows, compute their sums, and accumulate the total sum of all windows.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average is obtained by dividing the total sum by the number of windows, which is `n - k + 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sum\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total = 0\n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    for j in range(num_windows):\n        start = j\n        end = j + k\n        total += prefix[end] - prefix[start]\n    \n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and parsed into integers and the array of sleep times.\n- **Prefix Sum Array**: This array is built to allow quick calculation of subarray sums. Each element at index i in the prefix array is the sum of the first i elements of the input array.\n- **Summing Windows**: For each window starting at index j, the sum is computed using the prefix sum array, and these sums are accumulated to get the total sum of all windows.\n- **Computing Average**: The total sum is divided by the number of windows to find the average sleep time per week, which is then printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average in O(n) time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
