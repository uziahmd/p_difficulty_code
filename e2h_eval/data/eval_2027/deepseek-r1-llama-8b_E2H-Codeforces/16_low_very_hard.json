Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about moving between blocks in Crazy Town. Each block is a region divided by roads, which are lines on the plane. Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, but the movement is only allowed if they share a border of non-zero length. So each step is crossing one road.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from my home's block to the university's block.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model how each road affects the possible path. Since each step is a cross over a single road, maybe the minimal steps correspond to the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nWait, but how do I determine which roads separate them? Because some roads might not affect the path at all if they don't enclose the two points in different regions.\n\nLet me think: for each road, we can check whether the home and the university lie on opposite sides of the road. If yes, then this road contributes to the minimal path.\n\nBecause, suppose there are k such roads that separate the two points. Then, the minimal steps would be k, as each step crosses one such road.\n\nThat makes sense because each such road must be crossed exactly once. So the minimal number of steps is the count of these separating roads.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, determine if the home and university are on opposite sides.\n2. Count the total number of such roads.\n3. Output this count.\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, how to implement this.\n\nEach road is given by ax + by + c = 0. For a point (x0, y0), substituting into the equation gives a value S = a*x0 + b*y0 + c. The sign of S tells us which side of the line the point is on.\n\nIf S for home and S for university have opposite signs, then the road separates them. Otherwise, they are on the same side, or on the line, but since neither point is on any road, the latter is not possible.\n\nSo for each road, compute S1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and S2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If S1 * S2 < 0, then it's a separating road.\n\nWait, wait. Because if S1 is positive and S2 negative, the points are on opposite sides. Similarly, if S1 is negative and S2 positive. If either is zero, but the problem states that neither home nor university is on any road, so S1 and S2 can't be zero for any road. So, no need to worry about that.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n- Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n- Read n\n- For each of n roads:\n   - Read a, b, c\n   - Compute S1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   - Compute S2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   - If S1 * S2 < 0, increment the count\n- Output the count\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, let's see the example.\n\nIn the example input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads.\n\nFirst road: 0 1 0 → equation is y=0. Compute S for home: 0*1 +1*1 +0=1. For university: 0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0= -1. So product is -1, so they are on opposite sides. So count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x=0. Home: 1*1 +0*1 +0=1. University:1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1. Product is -1, so count +=1. Total 2.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nAnother test case: what if a road doesn't separate them?\n\nSay, third road in the sample: 1 1 -3. For home:1+1-3= -1. For university: -1-1-3= -5. Both negative, so product is positive. So no count.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly is important. The input format is:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\nSecond line: x2 y2\nThird line: n\nThen n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nSo in Python, I'll read the first two lines, split into integers, then read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut wait, sometimes the input may be read via standard input, which can be tricky if there are spaces. Using input().split() should handle that.\n\nPotential issues: large numbers? But the constraints say that x1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a road defined by a line equation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The town is divided into blocks by roads (lines). Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. If two points lie on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed exactly once. Thus, the minimum number of steps is determined by counting how many such roads exist between the home and the university.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), we can determine which side of the road a point lies on by substituting the point's coordinates into the equation. If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of the home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the values of the home and university when substituted into the road's equation.\n   - Count the number of roads where the home and university lie on opposite sides (i.e., their computed values have opposite signs).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1 = int(input[idx])\n    y1 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    x2 = int(input[idx])\n    y2 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        c = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string and split into manageable parts. The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Checking Each Road**: For each road, we compute the value of the home and university when substituted into the road's equation. If these values have opposite signs, it means the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, and thus this road must be crossed.\n- **Counting Crossings**: The total number of such roads is counted and printed as the result, representing the minimum number of steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation of points, ensuring an optimal solution.",
