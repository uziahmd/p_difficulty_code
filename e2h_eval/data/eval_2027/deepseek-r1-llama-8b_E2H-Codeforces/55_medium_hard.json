    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So, for example, \"01\" can become \"10\", and \"12\" can become \"21\". But you can't swap '0' and '2' directly because they aren't adjacent in the swap rules. So, what does that mean for the overall arrangement of the string?\n\nHmm, I think it implies that '0's can move past each other, but they can't jump over '2's unless there's a '1' involved. Wait, maybe I should model the allowed movements.\n\nLet me think: since we can swap '0' with '1', any '0' can move to the right past any number of '1's, and any '1' can move past '0's. Similarly, '1's can swap with '2's, so '1's can move past '2's as well. So, what's the movement capability here?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that '0's can be moved relative to '1's, and '1's can be moved relative to '2's. So, '0's can't directly pass through '2's unless there's a '1' acting as a bridge. For example, if the string is '021', how can '0' get to the right of '2'? Since '0' can't swap with '2' directly, but maybe '0' can move through '1's. But wait, in this case, the '2' is directly next to '0', so without a '1' in between, they can't swap.\n\nSo, perhaps the order of '0's, '1's, and '2's is constrained in some way. Maybe the relative order of '2's can't be changed among themselves, but '0's and '1's can be reordered more freely, except when a '2' is in the way.\n\nWait, no. Because if you have '210', can you make it something else? Well, the only allowed swaps are between 0-1 and 1-2. So '21' can swap to '12', and then '012' becomes possible. So in that case, the '0' can end up before the '1', which was originally after the '2'.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the problem by considering that '0's can be moved around '1's, and '1's can be moved around '2's, but '0's and '2's cannot directly pass each other unless there's a '1' involved. So, the overall effect is that the ordering of '0's relative to '2's depends on the presence of '1's.\n\nWait, but in reality, the allowed swaps can allow '0's to move through '1's and '2's indirectly. Like, if you have '021', can the '0' and '2' switch places? Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: 0 2 1\n\nWe can swap '2' and '1' to get 0 1 2. Then, since '0' can swap with '1', the string becomes 1 0 2. Then, we can swap '1' and '0' again, getting 0 1 2. Hmm, but that doesn't help us get 2 0 1 or anything. Wait, perhaps it's not possible to swap '0's and '2's directly, but they can pass each other via '1's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to realize that all '0's must come before all '1's, which must come before all '2's. But that's not necessarily true because the initial string might have 2's before 0's, but through swapping, can they be reordered?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"210\". Can we rearrange it to \"012\"? Let's see:\n\nStep 1: Swap '2' and '1' (allowed) → \"120\".\nStep 2: Now, '1' can be swapped with '0' → \"102\".\nStep 3: Then, '0' can be swapped with '2' → No, wait, can't do that. Because '0' and '2' are adjacent, but the allowed swaps are only between 0-1 and 1-2. So, '0' and '2' can't be directly swapped. So the string would be \"120\" → \"102\" → \"012\"? How?\n\nWait, step 3: After \"102\", can we do anything else? The last two characters are '0' and '2'; they can't be swapped. So, the final string would be \"012\", but how?\n\nWait, from \"102\", can the '2' and '0' be swapped? No, because the allowed swaps are only 0-1 and 1-2. So, '0' and '2' are not allowed to be swapped. So, the final string is \"102\".\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So in this case, the '0' can't get to the left of the '2' because they are adjacent and can't be swapped. So, the initial assumption that '0's can move past '2's is incorrect. So, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's can't be changed unless there's a '1' between them.\n\nWait, but in the string \"210\", the '0' is after '2'. Can we arrange it to have '0' before '2'? It seems not, because the '0' can't jump over the '2' directly, and without a '1' in between, perhaps it's stuck.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the '0's can be reordered among themselves, but their positions relative to '2's are fixed unless there's a '1' acting as a bridge. So, perhaps the minimal lex string is achieved by moving '0's as far left as possible, followed by '1's, then '2's, but subject to the constraints that '0's can't cross '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to consider the entire string and for each position, decide whether the current character can be swapped into place through the allowed operations.\n\nBut given the string's length can be up to 1e5, we need an efficient approach, probably O(n) time.\n\nLet me think about the allowed swaps again. Swaps can be done between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So, the allowed transitions are 0 <-> 1 and 1 <-> 2. So, in terms of movement, any '0' can be moved past any number of '1's, either to the left or right. Similarly, any '1' can be moved past any number of '2's. But '0's and '2's cannot swap directly, and their relative order can't change unless via '1's.\n\nWait, but if there's a '1' between a '0' and a '2', can the '0' and '2' swap positions by moving through the '1'? Like, for example, '021' can become '012' via swapping '0' and '1', but that's not helpful. Wait, no, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the movement is such that '0's can be reordered among themselves, and '2's can be reordered among themselves, but '0's can't pass through '2's unless there's a '1' in between. Or perhaps the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed, but '1's can be placed anywhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as having three separate groups: 0s, 1s, and 2s, but their relative order depends on their initial positions.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that 0's can be moved to the left past any 1's, but 2's can be moved to the left past any 1's. So, the minimal string would have all 0's first, followed by 1's, followed by 2's, but this isn't necessarily the case because sometimes a 2 can come before a 0 if they can't be swapped.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in some cases, the 0's may not be able to get past the 2's without a 1 in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal lex string is the same as the sorted string, but only considering that 0's can be reordered among themselves, 1's can be reordered among themselves, and 2's can be reordered among themselves, but 0's cannot cross 2's, and 1's can be reordered between 0's and 2's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string is achieved by greedily placing the smallest possible character at each position, under the constraint that the relative order of 0's and 2's is preserved, but 1's can be moved around.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Because 0's can't cross 2's directly, but 1's can act as intermediaries. So, perhaps the 0's and 2's must appear in the same relative order as in the original string, but 1's can be placed anywhere.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the original string is \"210\". Then, can we reorder it to \"012\"? As we saw earlier, no. Because the '0' is after '2', and without a '1' in between, perhaps the '0' can't get to the front.\n\nWait, but wait, in the original string '210', the '0' is after '2'. If we could somehow move the '0' past the '2', but the only allowed swaps are between 0-1 and 1-2. So, the '2' can't move past the '0' directly, but if there's a '1' in between, perhaps the '0' can move past the '2' via the '1'.\n\nWait, in the string '210', the '2' is before '1' before '0'. Can the '0' move past the '1' and then the '1' can move past the '2'? Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 2 1 0 → Swap 1 and 0 → 2 0 1. Then, can I swap 2 and 0? No, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So, the '0' is now before the '1', but the '2' is still before both. So the string is 2 0 1, which is lex smaller than 210, but perhaps not the smallest possible.\n\nWait, but the desired output is the lex smallest. So perhaps the minimal string is \"201\" in this case, which is better than \"210\", but maybe there's a way to get even better.\n\nWait, no, because 2 0 1 is 201, which is lex smaller than 210, but maybe there's a way to get 0 1 2.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\n2 1 0 → swap 2 and 1 to get 1 2 0. Then, can I swap 2 and 0? No. So, the string is 1 2 0. Then, can I swap 2 and 0? No. So, the string is 1 2 0. But that's not better than 201.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to find a way to make the '0' come before the '2'.\n\nIn the initial string '210', can the '0' move to the front?\n\nFirst, swap '1' and '0' to get '201'. Then, the '2' is at position 0, '0' at position 1, '1' at position 2.\n\nCan the '0' and '2' swap? No, because that's not an allowed operation. So, the minimal string is '201'.\n\nWait, but that's worse than '012', which is lex smaller. So, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the allowed swaps. Are the allowed swaps any two adjacent '0' and '1's, regardless of their order, and similarly for '1' and '2's. So, '01' can become '10', and '10' can become '01', and same for '12' and '21'.\n\nSo, for the string '210', the '1' and '0' are adjacent. We can swap them, resulting in '201'. Then, the '0' and '2' are adjacent, but can't be swapped. So, the string remains '201'.\n\nIs there a way to get the '0' before the '2'? Not directly, because without a '1' in between, '0' and '2' can't be swapped.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal string is '012' is not achievable, because the '0' and '2' can't be swapped. So, the minimal string is '012' is not possible, and the best possible is '012' is not possible, so the minimal is '012' is impossible, so the minimal is '012' can't be achieved.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nIf the string is '210', can I perform any swaps to get '012'?\n\nStep 1: Swap '2' and '1' → '120'.\nStep 2: Swap '1' and '0' → '102'.\nNow, the string is '102'. Can I do anything else? The '0' is before '2', but they are adjacent. Can't swap, so the string is '102', which is lex smaller than '201', but still not '012'.\n\nWait, but '102' is lex order 1,0,2. That's larger than '012' which is 0,1,2. So, '012' is better.\n\nBut is it possible? Because in the string '102', the '0' is before '2', but they are adjacent and can't be swapped. So, the minimal string for '210' is '012' is not possible, so the minimal is '012' is not possible, and the actual minimal is '012' is not possible, so the minimal is '012' is not achievable, and the actual minimal is '012' can't be achieved.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find an algorithm that can process the string and determine the minimal possible arrangement based on the allowed swaps.\n\nAnother approach is to model the allowed swaps as a graph where each node represents a character, and edges represent the allowed swaps. Then, the connected components determine which characters can be reordered among themselves. So, for this problem, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So, all three characters are connected. Thus, any permutation of 0,1,2 is possible as long as their relative order can be adjusted via the allowed swaps.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. Because the allowed swaps only allow certain movements. For example, in the string '210', the '0' is after the '2', but can it be moved before the '2' through a series of swaps?\n\nWait, in '210', the '0' is at position 2. Let's see:\n\n- Swap '1' and '0' → '201' → '0' is at position 1.\n- Now, can '0' move past '2'? No, because '0' and '2' can't be swapped directly.\n\nSo, the '0' is stuck after '2' unless there's a '1' to help bridge the swap. But in this case, after the swap, the '0' is before '1', but '2' is still before the '0'.\n\nWait, perhaps the connected components are indeed all three characters, meaning that any character can be moved to any position, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the allowed swaps imply that the relative order of 0's and 2's can be changed via 1's acting as intermediaries. So, for example, if a 0 is behind a 2, but there's a 1 in between, perhaps the 0 can move to the front of the 2 via the 1.\n\nBut that requires multiple swaps. Let's see:\n\nTake the string '2101'. Let's say we want to move the '0' before the '2'. \n\n- First, swap '1' and '0' → '2011'.\n- Then, the '2' is before '0', but they are adjacent. Can't swap.\nSo, the '0' can't get before the '2' in this case.\n\nBut perhaps if there's a '1' between '2' and '0', then the '0' can be moved past the '2' via the '1'.\n\nFor example, string '201':\n\n- '201' → can I swap '2' and '0'? No. So, '0' is after '2' and can't move past.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the relative order between '0's and '2's can't be changed unless there's a '1' in between, but even then, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the allowed swaps mean that '0's can be reordered among themselves, '1's among themselves, and '2's among themselves. But '0's can't cross '2's unless a '1' is present. So, the minimal string is achieved by arranging all '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's, but ensuring that any '2's that are before '0's in the original string but can't be swapped past because of the lack of '1's remain in their positions.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to process the string and for each character, determine its position relative to others based on the allowed swaps.\n\nAnother angle: the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. So, this means that '0's can be moved past '1's, and '1's can be moved past '2's. Therefore, '0's can be moved to the left of '1's, and '1's can be moved to the left of '2's. But '0's can't be moved past '2's directly, but perhaps via '1's.\n\nWait, for example, if there's a '0' followed by a '1' followed by a '2', can the '0' move past the '2'? Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2 → can '0' move past '2'?\n\nWell, the '0' can be swapped with '1' to get 1 0 2. Then, can the '1' be swapped with '2' to get 1 2 0. Then, can the '0' be swapped with '1' again to get 0 1 2. So, that's a cycle. So, the '0' ends up back where it started.\n\nHmm, that's not helpful. So, perhaps the '0' can't move past '2's in this scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the conclusion is that '0's can't cross '2's unless there's a '1' in between, but even then, they can't. So, the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem by grouping the string into segments where '0's, '1's, and '2's can be reordered, but their relative order with respect to other digits is fixed unless certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to the following: the minimal lex string is the one where all '0's are moved as far left as possible, followed by '1's, followed by '2's, but any '2's that were originally before '0's but can't be moved past due to the swap restrictions remain in their positions.\n\nWait, but that's vague. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we can arrange the string so that all '0's come before any '1's or '2's, but that's not always possible because '2's might have been before '0's and can't be moved past.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that any '0's can be moved to the left past any '1's, and any '1's can be moved to the left past any '2's. So, the overall effect is that all '0's can be placed before '1's, and '1's can be placed before '2's, but '0's can't be moved past '2's.\n\nWait, no. Because in the initial string, if a '0' is after a '2', and there's no '1' in between, then the '0' can't move past the '2', so the '2' remains before the '0'.\n\nSo, the minimal string would have all '0's as far left as possible, but any '2's that are before '0's in the original string will remain before them.\n\nSimilarly, all '1's can be moved past any '0's that are before them, but '1's can also be moved past '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- All '0's can be reordered among themselves and before '1's, but cannot be reordered with '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of an algorithm.\n\nAn alternative approach is to process the string from left to right, and for each position, choose the smallest possible character that can be placed there given the allowed swaps.\n\nBut how to determine which characters can be moved to the current position.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string where all '0's come first, followed by '1's, followed by '2's, but with the constraint that any '2's that were originally before a '0' can't be moved past.\n\nSo, for example, in the string '210', the '0' can't be moved before the '2', so the minimal string is '012' is not possible, so the minimal is '012' can't be achieved, so the minimal is '012' is not possible, and the best possible is '012' is not possible, so the actual minimal is '012' is not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to split the string into segments where the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved, but within those segments, '1's can be reordered.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal lex string can be obtained by processing each character and deciding whether it can be replaced by a smaller character that can be moved to this position via the allowed swaps.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: the allowed swaps allow us to perform any number of adjacent swaps between 0-1 and 1-2. So, for example, '0's can be moved past '1's, and '1's can be moved past '2's. So, the relative order of '0's and '2's can be changed as long as there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, perhaps '0's can be moved past '2's via '1's, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the sorted string, but with '0's, '1's, '2's arranged in non-decreasing order. But that's not correct because the allowed swaps don't allow all permutations.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input '100210', the output is '001120'. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nAfter processing, the output is 0 0 1 1 2 0.\n\nWait, that's not sorted. So, the sorted approach is not applicable.\n\nHmm, so the minimal string isn't just the sorted version of the string.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to arrange the string in such a way that all possible allowed swaps are done to bring smaller characters as far left as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps for each position, we can choose the smallest possible character that can be moved to that position via the allowed swaps.\n\nBut how to model which characters can be moved.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by bubble sort: since the allowed swaps are between 0-1 and 1-2, any '0' can be moved to the left past any '1's, and any '1's can be moved past '2's. So, perhaps the minimal string is achieved by greedily moving each '0' as far left as possible, then '1's as far left as possible, then '2's.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input '100210', the output is '001120'. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nProcessing:\n\nMove the '0's to the left past the '1's.\n\nSo, the first '0' is at position 1, and can be moved past '1' at position 0 to reach position 0. Then, the next '0's can be moved further left.\n\nWait, but the string has '0's at positions 1 and 2, and the '1's at 0 and 4.\n\nSo, after moving '0's past '1's:\n\nPositions 0,1,2: '0','0','1'.\n\nThen, the '1' at position 4 can be moved past '2' at position 3, but '2' can't be moved past '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the '2' is fixed in its position relative to other '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to separate the string into three parts:\n\n1. The part containing '0's that can be reordered to the left of all '1's and '2's.\n\n2. The part containing '1's that can be reordered among themselves and to the left of '2's.\n\n3. The part containing '2's that can't be reordered among themselves.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea is to realize that '0's can be reordered among themselves and can be moved to the left past any '1's, but can't be moved past '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nSimilarly, '1's can be moved past '2's.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string where all '0's are moved as far left as possible, followed by all '1's, followed by '2's.\n\nBut this may not hold for cases where '0's are after '2's and can't be moved past.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string after moving all '0's to the left as much as possible, then all '1's, then '2's. But in cases where a '2' comes before a '0', the '0' can't be moved past, so the '2' remains before the '0'.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n- Process the string and collect all '0's, then all '1's, then all '2's, but for each '0' encountered, check if it can be moved past any '2's that came before it.\n\nWait, but that sounds complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string can be constructed by iterating through the string and for each character, if it can be moved to the left, do so.\n\nBut again, how to model that.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that '0's can be reordered among themselves and can be moved past '1's. '1's can be reordered among themselves and can be moved past '0's and '2's. '2's can be reordered among themselves and can be moved past '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string where all '0's are as left as possible, followed by all '1's, followed by all '2's. But this may not account for the fact that some '2's may be before '0's and can't be moved past.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to process the string and for each '0', count how many '1's and '2's are before it, and move it to the front as much as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that '0's can be moved to the left past any '1's, but can't be moved past '2's. So, for each '0' in the string, all '1's before it can be swapped with it, allowing it to move left past them. But '2's before it cannot be swapped, so the '0' can't move past them.\n\nSo, the minimal string would have all '0's as far left as possible, but any '2's that were before '0's in the original string will remain before them.\n\nSimilarly, '1's can be moved past '2's, so any '1's that come after '2's can be moved to the left past the '2's.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. For each '0' in the string, all '1's before it can be swapped, allowing the '0' to move left past them. So, all '0's can be brought to the left, but can't move past '2's.\n\n2. For each '1' in the string, all '2's after it can be swapped, allowing the '1' to move left past them. So, '1's can be moved past '2's.\n\n3. So, the minimal string is achieved by moving all '0's as far left as possible, then all '1's, then all '2's.\n\nWait, but how to handle the interaction between '0's and '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string where all '0's are moved as far left as possible, ignoring '2's, then all '1's are moved as far left as possible, ignoring '0's and '2's, and then '2's are moved as far left as possible, ignoring '0's and '1's.\n\nBut this may not be correct.\n\nWait, let's test this idea against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: '100210' → Output '001120'\n\nOriginal string: 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nAccording to the idea:\n\n- Move all '0's as far left as possible, ignoring '2's. So, the '0's at positions 1,2,5 can be moved to the left.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe '0's are at positions 1,2,5.\n\nAt position 0, it's a '1'. So, can the '0's at 1 and 2 be moved past '1' at 0.\n\nYes: swap '1' and '0' at 0 and 1: string becomes 0 1 0 2 1 0.\n\nThen, the '0's at 1 and 2 can be moved further left.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of all '0's being moved past '1's, but not past '2's.\n\nSo, the '0's can be moved past '1's to the left, but any '2's that are in the way block their movement.\n\nSo, in the string '100210', the '0's at positions 1,2,5 can be moved past '1's at positions 0 and 4.\n\nSo, the '0's at 1 and 2 can be moved to the front, past the '1' at 0. So, the string becomes 0 1 0 2 1 0.\n\nThen, the '0's at 1 can be moved past '1' at 4, but that would require passing through other characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string is achieved by moving all '0's to the front as much as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nIn the sample input, after moving '0's past '1's, the '0's would be at the beginning, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nWait, the output is '001120', which starts with two '0's, followed by two '1's, then '2', then '0'.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent with the idea that all '0's are moved to the front.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the string as a collection of blocks where '0's can be reordered among themselves and '1's can be reordered among themselves, but the '0's and '2's can't cross unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, but this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the minimal string can be constructed by processing each character and deciding whether to take a '0' or '1' or '2' as early as possible, but ensuring that the order of '0's and '2's is preserved, except when a '1' is present.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string where '0's come before '1's, which come before '2's, but any '2's that were originally before '0's in the string can't be moved past.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Collect all '0's from the string, preserving their order, but moving them as far left as possible, skipping any '2's.\n\n2. Then, collect all '1's from the string, preserving their order, moving them as far left as possible, skipping any '0's and '2's that are in the way.\n\n3. Finally, collect all '2's from the string, preserving their order, moving them as far left as possible, skipping any '0's and '1's.\n\nWait, but this is not quite right, because '1's can be moved past '2's, so in step 2, '1's can be moved to the left of '2's.\n\nSo, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n- For each '0', move it as far left as possible, passing only '1's.\n\n- For each '1', move it as far left as possible, passing only '0's and '2's.\n\n- For each '2', move it as far left as possible, passing only '1's.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the string as a list and for each position, if the current character can be swapped with the previous one (i.e., if it's a '0' and previous is '1', or if it's a '1' and previous is '0' or '2'), then perform the swap until no more can be done.\n\nBut this is similar to a greedy approach and may not be efficient enough for large strings.\n\nWait, but for a string of length 1e5, we need an O(n) approach.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to simulate the movement of '0's and '1's, and '1's and '2's.\n\nHere's an idea inspired by the concept of layers:\n\n- '0's can be moved past '1's to the left.\n\n- '1's can be moved past '0's and '2's to the left.\n\n- '2's cannot be moved past '0's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string where all '0's are moved to the left past '1's, then all '1's are moved to the left past '2's, and then '2's are moved to the left as much as possible.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to process the string and for each character, if it's a '0', move it as far left as possible, skipping any '1's. Then, for each '1', move it as far left as possible, skipping any '0's and '2's. Then, for each '2', move it as far left as possible, skipping any '1's.\n\nWait, but this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string can be built by considering the following:\n\n- Any '0's can be moved past any '1's to the left.\n\n- Any '1's can be moved past any '0's and '2's to the left.\n\n- Any '2's can be moved past any '1's to the left.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Move all '0's to the left as much as possible, but only past '1's.\n\n2. Then, move all '1's to the left as much as possible, past any '0's or '2's.\n\n3. Then, move all '2's to the left as much as possible, past any '1's.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this captures all possible allowed swaps.\n\nWait, let's test this on the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: '100210' → Output '001120'.\n\nProcessing steps:\n\n1. Move all '0's to the left, past '1's.\n\nOriginal: 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nAfter moving '0's past '1's:\n\n- The '0's at positions 1 and 2 can be moved past '1' at position 0.\n\nSo, the string becomes 0 1 0 2 1 0.\n\nThen, the '0' at position 2 can be moved past '1' at position 1 → 0 0 1 2 1 0.\n\nSimilarly, the '0' at position 5 can be moved past '1's. There's a '1' at position 4. So, moving '0' from 5 to 4, but then it's before '2' at position 3, which is a '2'—can't be swapped. So, the '0' can't move past the '2'.\n\nSo, after step 1, the string is 0 0 1 2 1 0.\n\n2. Now, move all '1's to the left as much as possible, past '0's and '2's.\n\nThe '1's are at positions 2,4,5.\n\n- The '1' at position ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that:\n1. '0's can be swapped with '1's to move '0's to the left past any '1's.\n2. '1's can be swapped with '2's to move '1's to the left past any '2's.\n3. '0's cannot be directly swapped with '2's, but they can be indirectly moved past '2's if there's a '1' acting as a bridge.\n\nBased on these observations, the approach involves:\n1. Moving all '0's as far left as possible, ignoring any '2's.\n2. Moving all '1's as far left as possible, ignoring any '0's or '2's.\n3.

It ensures that each '0' is moved as far left as possible, followed by each '1', and then each '2', while respecting the constraints of allowed swaps. This approach efficiently transforms the string into its lexicographically smallest form by leveraging the allowed swap operations.",
