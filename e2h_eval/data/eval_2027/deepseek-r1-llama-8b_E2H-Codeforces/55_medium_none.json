    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing certain adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. But you can't swap '0' with '2' directly; that's not allowed. So, for example, in a string like \"010210\", the swaps can only be between 0 and 1 or 1 and 2, not between 0 and 2.\n\nMy task is to process the given string and determine the minimal possible string after performing any number of allowed swaps.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the nature of the allowed swaps. Swaps between 0 and 1 allow them to be reordered among themselves. Similarly, swaps between 1 and 2 allow them to be reordered among themselves. But 0s can't move past 2s because there's no direct swap between them, and the other way around either. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed? Or wait, maybe not. Because 0 and 2 can't swap, but perhaps via moving through 1s they can change their positions relative to each other indirectly. Wait no, because 0 can't swap with 2, but if there's a 1 between them, perhaps 0 can move past 1 and then the 2 could be moved away, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about this: since 0 can only swap with 1, and 1 can swap with 2, perhaps 0 can move to the right through 1s, but once it's on the left of a 2, it can't cross over. Similarly, 2 can move to the left through 1s, but can't cross over 0s. So in effect, 0s and 2s cannot pass each other. So the relative ordering of 0s and 2s in the original string must remain the same in the final string.\n\nWait, is that correct? For example, suppose we have \"021\". Can we arrange it into something like \"012\"? No, because 0 and 2 can't swap. So 0 would stay before 2. So in this case, the minimal arrangement is \"012\", but according to the allowed swaps, can we get there?\n\nWait, the initial string is \"021\". The allowed swaps are 0<->1 and 1<->2. So the 0 is first, then 2, then 1. So 0 can't move past 2. So the minimal string would be \"012\" only if the 1 can somehow be moved behind the 0, but wait, 0 and 1 can swap. So in this case, the initial string is \"021\": 0 followed by 2, which can't be swapped. So the 1 is after 2. So how can we arrange this?\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the allowed swaps as forming two groups: 0s and 1s can be reordered among themselves, and 1s and 2s can be reordered among themselves. But 0s and 2s cannot be reordered relative to each other. So the positions of 0s relative to 2s in the string are fixed.\n\nSo, for the entire string, the order of 0s and 2s is fixed. Only within the 0s and 1s, and within the 1s and 2s can they be reordered.\n\nWait, that seems like an important point. So the relative order of 0s and 2s in the string cannot change. So all 0s must appear before any 2s, or after, but their order among themselves can't change relative to each other. Wait, no. Because 0s can only swap with 1s, and 2s can only swap with 1s. So 0s can move past 1s, and 2s can also move past 1s. But 0s can't move past 2s directly, and 2s can't move past 0s directly. So, the positions of 0s and 2s relative to each other are fixed.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"0102\".\n\nIn this case, 0 is at position 1, 1 at 2, 0 at 3, 2 at 4. Now, can the 0 at position 3 move to the left, past the 1 at 2? Yes, because it can swap with 1. So after swapping, it becomes \"0110\". Then, can the 0 at position 2 move further left, but now it's next to another 1. So it can swap again, leading to \"0011\". But what about the 2 at position 4? It can swap with the 1 at position 3, but then it's \"0012\". So, in this case, the 0s and 2s are both on the right side, but their relative order is preserved.\n\nWait, but in the initial string, the 0s are at positions 1 and 3, and the 2 is at position 4. So, the 0 at position 3 is to the left of the 2. After moving left, it's still to the left of the 2. So, the 0s can't cross over 2s, but 2s can't cross over 0s either. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is: 0s can't move past 2s, and vice versa. So the relative order of 0s and 2s in the string is fixed. So, the minimal string can be obtained by rearranging the 0s among themselves (but only to the left of all 2s), and the 2s among themselves (to the right of all 0s), while also allowing 1s to be placed wherever possible, as long as the 0s and 2s' relative order is maintained.\n\nWait, that's a key insight. So the overall approach is:\n\n1. Identify all the 0s, 1s, and 2s in the string.\n2. Since 0s can't cross 2s, the 0s must appear in the same order as they did in the original string, but possibly moved to the left as much as possible, as long as they don't cross 2s.\n3. Similarly, 2s must appear in the same order as in the original string, but possibly moved to the right as much as possible, without crossing 0s.\n4. The 1s can be placed anywhere else, as they can be swapped with 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but how does this work exactly? Maybe I should model the string as consisting of three separate lists: the 0s, the 1s, and the 2s. Then, the 0s can be arranged in a way that they are all moved to the left as much as possible, but without crossing any 2s. Similarly, the 2s can be moved to the right as much as possible without crossing 0s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string can be constructed by considering the relative order of 0s and 2s as fixed, and then within those regions, arranging the 1s optimally.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- For each character in the string, if it's a '0', '1', or '2', process them in such a way that:\n   - All 0s come first, followed by 1s, followed by 2s, but this isn't necessarily the case because the original string may have 0s and 2s interleaved. Oh wait, no, because 0s can't cross 2s, so their relative order must remain as per the original string.\n\nWait, that's the crux. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is fixed. So, the 0s must appear in their original order, but they can be moved around among themselves, as well as the 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because 0s can only be swapped with 1s, so their movement is constrained by the 1s. So, for example, a 0 can move to the left past 1s, but can't move past 2s. So the 0s can be reordered among themselves and with 1s, but not with 2s.\n\nWait, but since 0s can only swap with 1s, their positions relative to other 0s can't change. Because to swap two 0s, you need a 1 in between. So, for example, if you have two 0s with a 1 between them, they can swap their positions via the 1. Wait, but 0s can't swap directly with each other. So for two 0s, their order is fixed.\n\nWait, no. Because to swap two 0s, you need a path of 1s. For example, 0 A 1 B 0 C: the A and C 0s can't swap unless they can somehow move past the 1. But in reality, 0s can only swap with 1s. So 0 A 1 B 0 C: the 0s can't swap, because they're separated by 1s. So the relative order of 0s is fixed.\n\nSimilarly, 2s can't swap with each other, since they can only swap with 1s. So their relative order is fixed as well.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed, but 1s can be reordered among themselves, and also among 0s and 2s as much as possible.\n\nWait, but 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. So, for example, a 1 can be moved to the left of a 0, or to the right of a 2, but 0s and 2s can't cross each other.\n\nSo, the minimal string can be built by taking the 0s in their original order, then all the 1s in their optimal order, and then the 2s in their original order.\n\nWait, but how about the 1s? How can they be reordered?\n\nI think the key is that the 1s can be placed in any position relative to the 0s and 2s, as long as their movement doesn't involve crossing 0s or 2s beyond what's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s can be placed in any order, as they can be freely reordered among themselves, as well as among the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but the 1s can only swap with adjacent 0s and 2s. So, for example, a 1 can move to the left past a 0, but can't move past a 2. Similarly, a 1 can move to the right past a 2, but can't move past a 0.\n\nWait, but wait: 1 can swap with 0 (so 0 and 1 can be reordered), and 1 can swap with 2 (so 1 and 2 can be reordered). So 1 can move through 0s and 2s, but 0s and 2s can't move past each other.\n\nSo, the 1s can be placed anywhere relative to 0s and 2s, but 0s and 2s must maintain their relative order.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Separate the string into three parts: the 0s, the 1s, and the 2s. But, since 0s and 2s cannot cross, their relative order is fixed.\n\n2. So, the 0s must appear in the same order as they do in the original string, and the 2s must appear in the same order as in the original string, but all 0s come before any 2s.\n\nWait, no. Because 0s can't cross 2s, so the 0s must appear in the same order relative to each other, but their positions can be adjusted relative to 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the string as a sequence where 0s can be moved left as much as possible, 2s can be moved right as much as possible, and 1s can be interleaved as needed.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother idea: process the string from left to right, and for each position, decide whether to place a 0, 1, or 2, based on what's available and the minimal possible character.\n\nWait, but since 0s can't cross 2s, once a 2 is placed, all subsequent characters can't be 0s. Similarly, once a 0 is placed, all subsequent characters can't be 2s.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So, the earliest occurrence of a 0 determines that all 0s must come before 2s. Or, more precisely, the relative order of 0s and 2s is determined by their positions in the original string.\n\nWait, no. Because 0s can't cross 2s. So, suppose in the original string, a 0 comes before a 2. Then, in the minimal string, that 0 will be as far left as possible, and the 2 as far right as possible, but without crossing the 0.\n\nWait, but the 0 can't move past the 2. So, in the minimal string, the 0 must appear before the 2, but perhaps with 1s in between.\n\nSo, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed based on the original string. So, any 0 that comes before a 2 in the original string must also appear before that 2 in the final string. And any 2 that comes before a 0 in the original string must also appear before that 0 in the final string.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 0s can't cross 2s and 2s can't cross 0s. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed.\n\nSo, the steps to construct the minimal string are:\n\n1. Iterate through the original string, keeping track of the positions of 0s, 1s, and 2s.\n\n2. Since 0s and 2s can't cross, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So, for each 0, all subsequent 2s must come after it in the final string.\n\n3. For the 1s, they can be reordered freely among themselves and with 0s and 2s, as long as the relative order of 0s and 2s is maintained.\n\nSo, the approach is to collect all 0s, 1s, and 2s in the order they appear, but for the 1s, arrange them as early as possible, placing them before 0s and 2s where possible.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it: the minimal string can be constructed by greedily placing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the constraints that 0s must come before 2s.\n\nSo, for each position in the string, decide whether to place a 0, 1, or 2, ensuring that:\n\n- If a 0 has been placed, no 2 can be placed afterwards.\n\n- If a 2 has been placed, no 0 can be placed afterwards.\n\nBut how to manage this when processing the string.\n\nWait, but the 0s and 2s have a fixed relative order, so the moment a 0 is placed, all subsequent 0s must be placed after that, but before any 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\n- We can partition the string into three sections:\n\n   a. All 0s that appear before any 2s.\n\n   b. All 1s.\n\n   c. All 2s that appear after any 0s.\n\nBut that's not accurate because 0s and 2s can be interleaved with 1s.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to build the result step by step, choosing for each position the smallest possible character, considering the constraints.\n\nBut to do this efficiently, since the string can be up to 1e5 characters, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nWait, here's an alternative idea: the minimal string is the lex smallest string possible under the constraints that:\n\n- The order of 0s relative to each other is fixed.\n\n- The order of 2s relative to each other is fixed.\n\n- 0s can't come after 2s, and 2s can't come before 0s.\n\n- 1s can be reordered among themselves and can be placed in any order relative to 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, the minimal string will consist of all 0s (in their original order), followed by all 1s (in their own order), followed by all 2s (in their original order).\n\nWait, no. Because that's not necessarily the case. For example, the sample input '100210' becomes '001120'.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nOriginal: '100210'\n\nBreaking down the characters:\n\nIndices: 0:1, 1:0, 2:0, 3:2, 4:1, 5:0\n\nSo, the 0s are at positions 1, 2, 5.\n\nThe 2 is at position 3.\n\nThe 1s are at 0,4.\n\nSo, according to the sample output, the 0s are moved to the front, but the 2 is moved to the end.\n\nWait, the output is '001120'.\n\nSo, the 0s are first, then the 1s, then the 2.\n\nSo, in this case, all 0s are moved to the front, all 1s are moved between the 0s and 2, and the 2 is moved to the end.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is:\n\n- All 0s must come before any 2s.\n\n- The 1s can be placed anywhere else, as long as the 0s are before 1s and 1s before 2s.\n\nWait, but why can't the 1s be placed between the 0s and 2s, but in a way that minimizes the lex order.\n\nSo, the minimal string will have all 0s as far left as possible, followed by all 1s, followed by all 2s.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So, the approach is:\n\n1. Collect all the 0s, preserving their order.\n\n2. Collect all the 1s, preserving their order.\n\n3. Collect all the 2s, preserving their order.\n\nThen, concatenate the 0s, followed by the 1s, followed by the 2s.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, let's test this against the sample.\n\nSample Input 1: '100210' â†’ Output '001120'\n\nOriginal 0s: [1,0,0], but their order is 0, then 0, then 0 (positions 1,2,5). So in the output, the 0s are in the order 0,0,0.\n\nWait, no, the output is '001120', which is 0,0,1,1,2,0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, wait, the original 0s are at positions 1,2,5. So the collected 0s would be ['1','0','0']? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the 0s are the characters '0' in the string, regardless of their positions. So the 0s in the sample are at indices 1, 2, 5. So the collected 0s are '0', '0', '0'.\n\nSimilarly, the 1s are at indices 0,4: '1', '1'.\n\nThe 2 is at index 3: '2'.\n\nSo concatenating 0s + 1s + 2s would give '000112', but the sample output is '001120'.\n\nWait, that's different. So my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so that approach can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that I need to find another way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nEach 0 can be moved as far left as possible, but can't cross any 2. Each 2 can be moved as far right as possible, but can't cross any 0. The 1s can be placed anywhere, but their relative order can be rearranged.\n\nSo, for each 0, we can move it as far left as possible, but can't go past any 2 that was originally before it.\n\nSimilarly, for each 2, we can move it as far right as possible, but can't go past any 0 that was originally after it.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor each 0, count how many 1s are to its left, then move it left as much as possible, past those 1s.\n\nFor each 2, count how many 1s are to its right, then move it right as much as possible, past those 1s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is constructed by:\n\n- All 0s are placed as early as possible, but without crossing any 2s.\n\n- All 2s are placed as late as possible, but without being crossed by 0s.\n\n- 1s are placed in the remaining positions, in any order.\n\nWait, but how to determine the order of 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s can be placed in the string in any order, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order.\n\nSo, the minimal string is formed by:\n\n- Take all 0s in their original order, place them as far left as possible, but not crossing any 2s.\n\n- Then, take all 1s, place them in the order that allows the lex smallest string.\n\n- Then, take all 2s in their original order, placed as far right as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nWe can model the string as a list of 0s, 1s, and 2s, but with 0s and 2s in their original order, and 1s can be reordered.\n\nBut how to interleave them to make the lex smallest string.\n\nLet me think of the problem as building the result character by character, making the smallest possible choice at each step, while respecting the constraints.\n\nAt each step, choose the smallest possible character available, subject to the constraints that:\n\n- Once a 0 is chosen, no 2 can come after.\n\n- Once a 2 is chosen, no 0 can come after.\n\n- 1s can be chosen at any time.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nWait, for example, consider the sample input '100210':\n\nThe string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nWe can process each character and decide whether to take it as part of the result, or replace it with a smaller possible option, considering the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string can be built by grouping the 0s, 1s, and 2s, but in a way that 0s are as left as possible, 2s as right as possible, and 1s are in the middle.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So, for the 0s, their order in the final string is the same as in the original. Same for the 2s.\n\nThe 1s can be reordered among themselves, but their relative order can be changed.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Extract all 0s in the order they appear.\n\n- Extract all 1s in the order they appear.\n\n- Extract all 2s in the order they appear.\n\nThen, interleave these groups in a way that 0s come first, followed by 1s, followed by 2s.\n\nBut wait, that's not possible because 0s and 2s can't cross. So the 0s must come before 2s, but 1s can be in between.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the 0s are at positions 1,2,5, and the 2 is at position 3. So, the 2 can't come before the 0s. So in the minimal string, the 2 is placed after all 0s.\n\nBut in the sample output, '001120', the 2 is placed after the 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is formed by:\n\n- All 0s, in their original order.\n\n- Then all 1s, in their optimal order.\n\n- Then all 2s, in their original order.\n\nBut in the sample, the 1s are in their original order (they were at positions 0 and 4, but in the output, the 1s are in the middle). So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s can be reordered to form the smallest possible string, but the 0s and 2s are fixed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Extract the 0s, 1s, and 2s in their original order.\n\n2. The 0s must appear in their original order, but as early as possible.\n\n3. The 2s must appear in their original order, but as late as possible.\n\n4. The 1s can be arranged in any order, but placed in such a way that the overall string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string can be built by placing all 0s as early as possible, followed by as many 0s as possible, then the 1s in the order that is lex smallest, followed by 2s as late as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the sample input '100210' again.\n\nThe 0s are at positions 1,2,5: '0','0','0'.\n\nThe 1s are at 0,4: '1','1'.\n\nThe 2 is at 3: '2'.\n\nThe output is '001120'.\n\nSo the 0s are placed first, then the 1s, then the 2.\n\nBut the 0s in the output are in the same order as in the input, but they are moved to the front, passing through the 1s.\n\nSo the 0s are placed first, followed by 1s, followed by 2.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to collect all 0s, then all 1s, then all 2s, in their original order.\n\nBut in the sample, that would produce '000112', which is not the case. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s are reordered as much as possible to form the lex smallest string, but while respecting that 0s come before 2s.\n\nSo, in the sample, the 1s are '1' and '1'; their order is fixed.\n\nBut perhaps in other cases, the 1s can be reordered to be as small as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s can be reordered into any order, but they must appear between the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, the minimal string is formed by:\n\n- All 0s in their original order.\n\n- All 1s in their optimal order (sorted as 0 < 1 < 2, so 1s can be kept as they are, but perhaps some can be placed earlier).\n\nWait, but in the sample, the 1s are placed after the 0s and before the 2.\n\nSo, perhaps the 1s are placed as early as possible after the 0s.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: The minimal string can be thought of as the minimal possible by treating the 0s and 2s as fixed in their relative order, but 1s can be interleaved optimally.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Create a list that starts empty.\n\n- For each character in the original string:\n\n   - If it's a '0', add it to a list called zeros.\n\n   - If it's a '1', add to a list called ones.\n\n   - If it's a '2', add to a list called twos.\n\n- Then, the minimal string is formed by first adding all zeros, followed by all ones, followed by all twos.\n\nBut this doesn't align with the sample. Because in the sample, the output is '001120', which is 0,0,1,1,2,0.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. The sample output is '001120', which is 0,0,1,1,2,0.\n\nWait, the last 0 is part of the original zeros, but in the initial approach, all zeros are placed first.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s can't be moved past 2s, but can be moved past 1s.\n\nSo, the 0s can be moved left past 1s, but not past 2s.\n\nSo, the 0s are placed as far left as possible, but without crossing any 2s.\n\nSimilarly, 2s are placed as far right as possible, without crossing any 0s.\n\nSo, the minimal string is built by:\n\n1. For each 0 in the original string, in the order they appear, move it as far left as possible, but not crossing any 2s.\n\n2. For each 2 in the original string, in the order they appear, move it as far right as possible, but not crossing any 0s.\n\n3. The 1s can be placed anywhere, but optimally placed to minimize the lex order.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps, the approach is to simulate the movement of each 0 and 2, and then fill in the 1s in between.\n\nWait, but for a large string (up to 1e5), simulation is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe 0s and 2s have fixed relative orders, but 1s can be reordered. So, the minimal string will have all 0s as early as possible, followed by all 1s, followed by all 2s, but maintaining the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because 0s and 2s can't cross, but 1s can be placed in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the lex smallest string that consists of the 0s in their original order, followed by the 1s in their optimal order, followed by the 2s in their original order.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s can be placed in any order, but to minimize the string, we can arrange them in the order that is lex smallest, but considering their positions relative to 0s and 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet's think of the 1s as a group that can be placed in the string, but in such a way that they are as early as possible, but not interfering with the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s can be placed in the string in any order, but their relative order can be changed to form the lex smallest possible substring.\n\nSo, for example, if the 1s are '1','1','0', but that's impossible because 0s can't be moved past 1s.\n\nWait, no. Because 0s can only be swapped with 1s, so a 0 can be moved past multiple 1s, but a 1 can be moved past a 0.\n\nSo, for a group of 0s and 1s, they can be reordered into any permutation where the 0s come before the 1s.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct because the 0s can only be swapped with 1s, not with each other. So, the relative order of 0s among themselves is fixed.\n\nSimilarly for 1s.\n\nSo, the 0s can be reordered among themselves via the 1s, but only if there are 1s between them.\n\nWait, but for two 0s with 1s between them, can they be reordered? Like '0 1 0' can be reordered to '0 0 1', but that's just moving the second 0 to the left.\n\nWait, no, because the two 0s can't directly swap with each other, but they can swap with the 1 in between. So '0 1 0' can become '0 0 1' by swapping the two 1s with the 0s.\n\nYes. So, the two 0s can be reordered into '0 0 1'.\n\nSo, in this case, the 0s can be reordered among themselves as long as there is a path of 1s to allow their movement.\n\nSo, the relative order of 0s is not fixed if they are separated by 1s.\n\nWait, that's a problem for my earlier assumption.\n\nSo, this complicates things.\n\nThus, the relative order of 0s and 2s is not fixed, which means that my initial approach is wrong.\n\nSo, I need to rethink the problem.\n\nWhat defines the relative order of 0s and 2s in the final string?\n\nSince 0s can't directly swap with 2s, their relative order depends on whether a 1 is present between them.\n\nFor example, if a 0 comes before a 2 in the original string, but they are separated by a 1, can the 0 move to the right of the 2?\n\nNo, because the 0 can't swap with the 2. So, the 0 can move left past 1s, but can't cross the 2. So, if a 0 is before a 2, even if they are separated by 1s, the 0 can't move past the 2.\n\nWait, but the 0 can only swap with 1s, so it can't directly affect the position of the 2. So, the 0 can move left past 1s, but the 2 can also move right past 1s.\n\nSo, in the case where a 0 is before a 2, and they are separated by 1s, the 0 can move left past the 1s, and the 2 can move right past the 1s. But this could potentially cause the 0 and 2 to cross.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo, for example, consider the string '012'.\n\nCan the 0 and 2 swap positions?\n\nNo, because 0 can't swap with 2 directly, and there's no path of 1s between them.\n\nWait, in '012', the 0 is at position 0, 1 at 1, 2 at 2. The 0 can swap with 1, becoming '102'. Then, the 2 can swap with 1, becoming '120'. So, the 0 is now at position 0, 1 at position 1, 2 at position 2. So, the 0 and 2 haven't crossed.\n\nAnother example: '021'.\n\nIn this case, 0 is at position 0, 2 at 1, 1 at 2.\n\nThe 0 can swap with 2? No, because 0 and 2 can't swap directly. So the 0 can't move past the 2.\n\nWait, no. Because the 0 is at position 0, and the 2 is at position 1. They can't swap, so the 0 remains before the 2.\n\nSo, in this case, the 0 and 2 can't cross.\n\nAnother example: '201'.\n\nHere, 2 is at 0, 0 at 1, 1 at 2.\n\nThe 2 can't move past the 0, because 2 can only swap with 1. So, the 2 can swap with 1 at position 2, but that would require moving past the 0, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. The 2 can't swap with 0. So, the 2 is stuck before the 0.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that 0s and 2s cannot cross each other. Their relative order is fixed.\n\nThus, the initial approach holds: 0s must appear in the same relative order as in the original string, and 2s must also appear in the same relative order.\n\nSo, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed.\n\nBut 1s can be reordered among themselves, and also can be placed between 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, the minimal string will be formed by interleaving the 0s, 1s, and 2s, with 0s as early as possible, 2s as late as possible, and 1s arranged to form the lex smallest string.\n\nBut how.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Extract all 0s in the order they appear in the original string.\n\n2. Extract all 1s in the order they appear, but arrange them in a way that forms the lex smallest possible substring.\n\n3. Extract all 2s in the order they appear in the original string.\n\n4. Then, interleave the 0s, 1s, and 2s, ensuring that 0s come before 2s, and 1s are placed optimally.\n\nBut how to interleave them.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s can be placed anywhere, but their order can be optimized.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s can be placed in the minimal possible order, which is all 0s, followed by all 1s, followed by all 2s.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the sample, the 1s are placed between 0s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the",
