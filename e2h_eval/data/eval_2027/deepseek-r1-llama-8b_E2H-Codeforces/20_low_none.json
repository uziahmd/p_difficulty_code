For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about binary strings of various lengths from 1 to n. For each such string s, we choose a c_s between 0 and k. Then, the multiset of all these strings (but only those of length exactly n) is considered beautiful if for every possible prefix s', the number of strings in the multiset that start with s' is ≤ c_{s'}.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of ways to choose the c_s values such that the maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be computed modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, that's a bit abstract. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, what's a beautiful multiset? It's a collection of binary strings of length n where, for every possible prefix s (like \"0\", \"00\", \"01\", etc.), the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. So, for each prefix s, the count must be ≤ c_s.\n\nAnd we want the maximum possible size of such a multiset to be exactly f. So, we need to count all possible assignments of c_s's that allow the largest possible beautiful multiset to be size f.\n\nWait, no—wait. The problem says the maximum possible size is exactly f. So, for the given c_s's, the largest beautiful multiset has size f. That implies that there exists a beautiful multiset of size f, and for any larger size (f+1 or more), it's impossible to have a beautiful multiset.\n\nSo, our task is to compute the number of c assignments where the maximum f is exactly f.\n\nHow do we model this?\n\nI think the approach is to model this using dynamic programming. Let's consider the structure of the problem.\n\nEach binary string of length up to n can be thought of as a node in a trie. The trie has depth n, with each level representing the next bit. Each node corresponds to a prefix.\n\nFor each prefix s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. So, for the entire trie, the counts along each path must satisfy these constraints.\n\nThe beautiful multiset's size is the sum over all possible prefixes s of the count of their children (the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a proper prefix). Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. For each s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that are extensions of s. So, for example, if s is \"00\", then the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with \"00\" followed by any bits, but since the multiset contains only length n strings, it's the number of such strings in the multiset.\n\nWait, no. The count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Since all strings in the multiset are of length n, s can't be longer than n. So for each s (of length up to n), the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. This is the same as the number of such strings in the multiset, which can be represented as the product of the counts in the trie nodes.\n\nBut perhaps another way to model this is to think recursively. Each node in the trie represents a certain prefix. The maximum allowed count for a node is its c_s. The count for a node is the sum of the counts of its children. Because each child represents a string that extends this prefix.\n\nWait, yes. For example, the root node (empty string) has a count equal to the total number of strings in the multiset. Its children are single '0' and '1' nodes. Each of their counts is the number of strings in the multiset starting with that bit. And so on.\n\nSo, for each node s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the sum of the counts of all its children.\n\nBut for the multiset to be beautiful, each node's count must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So, for each node s, the count is the sum of the counts of its direct children. Because each child represents the next possible bit, thus extending s.\n\nBut for the multiset to be beautiful, for every s, the count of s's children (sum of children's counts) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because the count for s is the number of strings that have s as a prefix. But s's count is the sum of the counts of its immediate",

Each node in the trie represents a prefix, and the DP table tracks the maximum allowed count of strings extending each prefix.
