Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about moving from home to university in Crazy Town, which is divided into blocks by roads. Each road is an infinite line. The key point is that you can move between two adjacent blocks in one step if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the goal is to find the minimal number of steps needed to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nHmm. The first thing I think is that each road splits the plane into two parts. For any point (like home or university), each road will determine on which side of the road the point lies. So, for each road, we can compute whether home and university are on the same side or not.\n\nWait, but how does that help with the number of steps? Because moving between blocks depends on how the roads intersect around a point.\n\nI remember something about this problem being similar to planar graphs and using the arrangement of lines to model regions. But with n up to 300, maybe there's a smarter way than building a graph with potentially O(n^2) edges.\n\nAnother thought: The minimal number of steps is determined by the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road would require crossing from one side to the other, which might take one step per road. But wait, maybe more accurately, the number of times the home and university are on opposite sides of a road determines the minimal steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line contributes a necessary crossing, and each crossing can be done in one step.\n\nLet me think about that. For example, if two points are on opposite sides of a line, then to get from one to the other, you must cross that line. Each such crossing is a step. But what about when lines are concurrent or form more complex arrangements?\n\nWait, no. Because if multiple lines intersect, the order in which you cross them might affect the path, but the minimal number of crossings should still be the count of lines that separate the two points.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, determine whether the home and university are on the same side or different sides.\n2. Count the number of roads where they are on different sides. That count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nBut wait, let me test this idea against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: (1,1)\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\nn=2\nRoad 1: 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0\nRoad 2: 1x +0y -3=0 → x=3\n\nFor Road 1: home is at y=1 (positive), university at y=-1 (negative). So different sides.\nFor Road 2: home is x=1 <3, university x=-1 <3. Same side. So only one separating road. Wait, but the sample output is 2.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm. So what's going on here.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nAfter roads, the home and university are in different regions. How many steps are needed?\n\nIn the sample, the output is 2. So according to the initial approach, there's one separating road, which would suggest one step. But the correct answer is 2. So that approach is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal steps are not just the count of separating lines, but something else.\n\nWait, maybe the number of separating lines plus some function of the arrangement, like their intersections. Or perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of times the two points are separated by a line, but in some cases, each such line requires a step, but sometimes you can traverse multiple lines with a single step if they are arranged in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of separating lines, but in the sample, two lines are involved.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample:\n\nIn the first case, the home and university are on different sides of road 1 (y=0). They are on the same side of road 2 (x=3). So according to the initial idea, only 1 step is needed. But the sample output is 2. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is missing something. Because perhaps the way the lines are arranged, you can't cross them in a single step.\n\nWait, perhaps the roads form a sort of barrier between the two points. Like, if two roads cross, then to get from one side to another across both, you have to cross each road, but they may be crossed in sequence.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal steps are equal to the number of lines that separate the two points, regardless of their arrangement. So why is the sample requiring 2 steps when only one line separates the points?\n\nWait, let's look at the sample again.\n\nSample Input:\n\nHome: (1,1)\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\nRoads: 2\nRoad 1: 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0\nRoad 2: 1x +0y -3=0 → x=3\n\nSo, Road 1 is the x-axis. Home is above it, university is below. Road 2 is a vertical line at x=3. Both home and university are to the left of it.\n\nSo, the two points are on opposite sides of Road 1, but same side of Road 2.\n\nSo, according to initial idea, minimal steps should be 1. But the sample output is 2.\n\nWait, that suggests that the initial approach is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal number of steps is not just the number of separating lines, but also depends on the arrangement of the lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of separating lines, but in the sample, there are two roads that are perpendicular, and the two points are in a region that is cut by both roads, but perhaps you need to cross each road once.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the home and university are in regions that are separated by Road 1 but lie on the same side of Road 2. So, to get from home to university, you have to cross Road 1, but since Road 2 is in a way that doesn't separate them, perhaps the minimal path is just one step.\n\nBut the sample output says 2, so that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Maybe the minimal steps are equal to the number of roads that separate the two points, but considering whether the regions are connected via other roads.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are the number of times the home and university are on opposite sides of the same line.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to determining how many lines lie between the two points, but in a way that each such line contributes to a necessary step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the arrangement of the lines and how the regions are formed.\n\nEach line divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are in some regions, and to move between them, you have to cross all the lines that separate their regions.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. Because each such line requires a step to cross.\n\nBut in the sample, that's just one line, but the output is 2. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are determined by the number of lines that separate the two points, but each step can cross multiple lines as long as they are connected in a way that allows it.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points, but in the sample, two lines are needed because the two points are in a convex region bounded by two lines, requiring two crossings.\n\nWait, let me try to visualize the sample:\n\nThe home is at (1,1), university at (-1,-1).\n\nRoad 1 is y=0, Road 2 is x=3.\n\nSo, Road 1 runs horizontally, Road 2 vertically.\n\nThe home is in the region y>0, x<3.\n\nThe university is in y<0, x<3.\n\nSo, to go from home to university, you need to cross Road 1 (from y>0 to y<0), and Road 2 doesn't separate them because both are on the same side.\n\nWait, but why is the sample output 2 steps?\n\nWait, maybe the roads are arranged such that the regions are in a way that you have to cross both Road 1 and Road 2. But in this case, Road 2 is not a separator between the two points. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the home and university are in regions that are separated by two roads, but those roads are not necessarily in a way that requires crossing both.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem differently. Maybe the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the two points, but when the two points are on opposite sides of a line, that contributes one step. So, in the sample, it's one line, but why the output is 2?\n\nThis suggests that my initial approach is wrong. So, I must think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of the problem in terms of how the home and university are separated by the arrangement of lines. The minimal steps would be the number of lines that separate them, but perhaps each line can only be crossed once, and their arrangement adds to the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines that the two points are on opposite sides of. Because each such line must be crossed, and each crossing is a step. So in the sample, that's one line, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the two points are on the same side of Road 2 but on opposite sides of Road 1. So, to move from home to university, you have to cross Road 1. But how? Since Road 1 is a straight line, perhaps the movement is possible in one step. But in the sample, the output is 2. So that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the roads form a polygon around the two points, and the number of steps is equal to the number of edges of the polygon that the path must cross.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem by considering the arrangement of the lines and the regions. For each line, we can assign a value indicating whether the home and university are on the same side or not.\n\nThen, the minimal number of steps is the number of such lines where they are on opposite sides. Because each such line must be crossed once.\n\nBut again, in the sample, that would give 1, but the output is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that each time two lines cross, the two points are in a region that requires crossing both lines, thus adding to the step count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points plus the number of lines that are crossed in a way that requires a detour.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the arrangement of the lines and the relative positions of the two points. Each separating line contributes one step, but the order in which they are crossed may matter. However, the minimal steps would still be the count of separating lines.\n\nWait, but in the sample, only one line separates the two points. So why is the output 2?\n\nAh! Oh right, because the home and university are on different sides of Road 1, but Road 2 is another line that may not separate them. So, perhaps the two points are in a quadrant defined by two roads, requiring two steps.\n\nWait, perhaps each line that the two points are on opposite sides of must be crossed, but sometimes the order in which you cross them affects the total steps. But the minimal steps would be the count of such lines.\n\nSo, why is the sample output 2?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the sample.\n\nLet me re-calculate for the sample:\n\nHome: (1,1)\n\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\n\nRoad 1: y=0.\n\nSo, home is above, university is below.\n\nRoad 2: x=3. Both are to the left.\n\nSo, the home is in the region y>0, x<3.\n\nThe university is in y<0, x<3.\n\nSo, to get from home to university, you have to cross Road 1. But Road 2 is not a separator between them.\n\nSo, the minimal steps should be 1. But the sample output is 2.\n\nHmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating whether Road 2 separates them.\n\nWait, Road 2 is x=3. The home is at x=1, which is less than 3. The university is at x=-1, also less than 3. So they are on the same side of Road 2. So Road 2 doesn't separate them.\n\nSo, according to this, the minimal steps should be 1. But the sample output is 2.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial understanding of the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the step count is based on the number of lines that the two points are on opposite sides of, but each line can be crossed only once, and the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut in the sample, that's 1 line, so steps should be 1, but sample output is 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of lines that the two points are on opposite sides of, plus the number of lines that are 'between' them in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are determined by the number of lines that the two points are on opposite sides of, but each line must be considered in a certain order, leading to more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a planar arrangement and compute the number of lines that the two points are on opposite sides of. The minimal steps would be the size of the symmetric difference of the two sets of half-planes.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: for each line, compute the sign of (a*x0 + b*y0 + c) and (a*x1 + b*y1 + c). If the signs are different, the line separates the two points. The minimal number of steps is the count of such lines.\n\nBut in the sample, that's 1 line, but the output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's movement rules. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nIn one step, you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero. So, adjacency requires sharing a non-zero boundary segment.\n\nSo, if two blocks share only a single point (an intersection), that's not considered adjacent. So, moving from one to another in one step requires that they share a boundary of positive length.\n\nSo, the movement is along the connected regions formed by the roads.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the minimal path through these regions, where each step moves to an adjacent region.\n\nBut modeling this for 300 lines seems computationally expensive.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nBecause each such line acts as a barrier that you have to cross, and each crossing takes one step.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample's output is 2 because the home and university are on opposite sides of two lines.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the second line.\n\nLooking back, the second line is 1x + 0y -3=0 → x=3.\n\nWait, home is at (1,1): 1*1 + 0*1 -3 = -2 <0. So home is on x<3 side.\n\nUniversity is at (-1,-1): 1*(-1) +0*(-1) -3= -4 <0. So same side as home.\n\nSo Road 2 doesn't separate the two points.\n\nSo, in the sample, only Road 1 separates them, so steps should be 1.\n\nBut the sample output is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of separating lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recalculate for the sample.\n\nWait, the third line in the sample input is 3 roads.\n\nWait, no, the first sample input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, the first sample has n=2 roads:\n\nRoad 1: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0.\n\nRoad 2: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0.\n\nWait, wait no, the second line of the sample input is 3, meaning n=3 roads?\n\nNo, the first sample input is:\n\nFirst part:\n\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nSecond part:\n\n1 1\n-1 -1\n3\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 1 -3\n\nSo, the first sample has n=2 roads, the second sample has n=3 roads.\n\nWait, no, the second line after the home and university is n=2 for the first sample.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says that the third line is n, which is the number of roads. So, in the first sample, the third line is 2, so n=2.\n\nSo, for the first sample:\n\nRoad 1: 0 1 0 → y=0.\n\nRoad 2: 1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nWait, that changes everything.\n\nSo, home is at (1,1), university is (-1,-1).\n\nRoad 1: y=0.\n\nRoad 2: x=0.\n\nSo, home is at x>0, y>0.\n\nUniversity is at x<0, y<0.\n\nSo, for Road 1: home is above, university is below → different sides.\n\nFor Road 2: home is right of x=0, university is left → different sides.\n\nSo, both roads separate the two points.\n\nThus, the count is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAh, okay, that makes sense now. So the initial mistake was in reading the roads correctly.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each line, check if home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such lines is the minimal number of steps.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- For each of the n roads, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\n- Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\n- If s1 and s2 have opposite signs (i.e., s1*s2 < 0), then this line contributes to the step count.\n\n- Sum all such lines.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute this count.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, the steps would be:\n\nRead the home coordinates, university coordinates, read n, then read each line as a road.\n\nFor each road, compute s1 and s2.\n\nIf s1 * s2 < 0 → increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nWait, but wait: the line equation is a*i x + b*j y + c =0. So, for a point (x,y), plug into the equation.\n\nSo, for each road, ai, bi, ci are given. The equation is ai * x + bi * y + ci =0.\n\nSo, for a point (x, y), compute val = ai * x + bi * y + ci.\n\nIf val >0, the point is on one side; if <0, the other.\n\nSo, for home and university, if their values for a particular road have opposite signs, they are on opposite sides of the road, which means the road is a separator.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's see about handling the data.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as three lines, but in the user's message, it's shown as ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', ...]. So, in the actual input, it's three lines: home, university, n, then n lines of roads.\n\nSo, the code should read these lines.\n\nIn Python, we can read from stdin, perhaps using sys.stdin.read().split(), but care must be taken to parse correctly.\n\nBut for the problem, the code can be written as:\n\nRead home_x, home_y.\n\nRead uni_x, uni_y.\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nFor each of the next n lines:\n\n   Read a, b, c.\n\n   Compute s1 = a * home_x + b * home_y + c.\n\n   Compute s2 = a * uni_x + b * uni_y + c.\n\n   If s1 * s2 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nPrint count.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=2.\n\nRoad 1: a=0, b=1, c=0 → equation y=0.\n\nCompute s1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\n\ns2= 0*(-1)+1*(-1) +0= -1<0.\n\nSo s1*s2= -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: a=1, b=0, c=0 → x=0.\n\ns1=1*1+0*1 +0=1>0.\n\ns2=1*(-1)+0*(-1) +0= -1 <0.\n\ns1*s2= -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nTotal count=2 → which matches sample output.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3.\n\nRoads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3=0.\n\nCompute for home (1,1):\n\nroad1: 1*1 +0*1 -3=1+0-3= -2 <0.\n\nroad2: 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\n\nroad3: 1*1 +1*1 -3= 2-3= -1 <0.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nroad1: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) -3= -1 -3 = -4 <0.\n\nroad2: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0= -1 <0.\n\nroad3: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3= -2-3= -5 <0.\n\nSo for each road:\n\nroad1:\n\ns1= -2, s2= -4 → same sign → no count.\n\nroad2:\n\ns1=1, s2= -1 → opposite → count +=1.\n\nroad3:\n\ns1= -1, s2= -5 → same → no.\n\nThus, total count=1. But sample output is 2.\n\nWait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the third road.\n\nWait, the third road is 1 1 -3.\n\nFor home (1,1): 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3= -1.\n\nFor university (-1,-1): 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3= -1-1-3= -5.\n\nSo, s1 = -1, s2 = -5 → same sign. So, no contribution.\n\nSo, in sample 2, only road 2 contributes → count is 1. But sample output is 2.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the line equation wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says the line is aix + biy + ci =0.\n\nSo, for the third road, a=1, b=1, c=-3 → 1x +1y -3=0 → x + y =3.\n\nSo, home is (1,1) → 1+1=2 <3 → 2-3= -1 → s1= -1.\n\nUniversity is (-1,-1) → -1 + (-1) = -2 <3 → s = -5.\n\nSo, same side.\n\nSo, only road 2 contributes, count is 1.\n\nBut sample output is 2.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the sample input.\n\nWait, in the user's message, the sample input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, the first sample has n=2 roads:\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nWhich gives count 2, correct.\n\nThe second sample has n=3 roads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 1 -3 → x+y-3=0.\n\nSo, home is (1,1):\n\ns1 for road 1: 1*1+0*1 -3= -2 → s1= -2.\n\ns2 for road 1: 1*(-1)+0*(-1) -3= -4 → same sign as s1 → no count.\n\nroad 2: 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\n\ns2: 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1 <0 → s1*s2 <0 → count +=1.\n\nroad3: 1*1 +1*1 -3= -1 <0.\n\ns2: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3= -5 <0 → same sign → no.\n\nSo, count is 1. But sample output is 2.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the result is 2 for both cases.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the third road.\n\nWait, wait: perhaps the line is 1 1 -3 → x + y -3=0.\n\nFor home (1,1): 1+1=2 → 2-3= -1 → s1= -1.\n\nFor university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1)= -2 → -2-3= -5 → s2= -5.\n\nSame sign, so no contribution.\n\nSo, only road 2 contributes, count is 1.\n\nBut sample output is 2. So, that suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the line equations. Perhaps the line is aix + biy + ci =0, but perhaps the direction is different. Or perhaps the sign is inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps the line is aix + biy + ci =0, but when evaluating for a point, the value is (a x + b y + c). So, if the value is positive, the point is on one side, negative on the other.\n\nBut perhaps the way I'm calculating s1 and s2 is reversed.\n\nWait, maybe I should reverse the comparison.\n\nFor example, if s1 and s2 have the same sign, then the points are on the same side.\n\nBut perhaps the way the line divides the plane is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the sign correctly.\n\nWait, for the line ax + by +c =0, points on one side will have ax+by+c >0, others <0.\n\nSo, the condition for two points being on opposite sides is s1*s2 <0.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut why in the sample, the count is 1 but the output is 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the sample's second case has n=3 roads, but I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the sample's second case.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=3.\n\nRoad 1: 1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nRoad 2: 0 1 0 → y=0.\n\nRoad 3: 1 1 -3 → x+y-3=0.\n\nSo, home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1).\n\nCompute for each road:\n\nRoad 1: home is x=1>0 → s1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0.\n\nuniversity is x=-1<0 → s2=1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0= -1 <0.\n\nSo, s1*s2= -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: home is y=1>0 → s1=0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\n\nuniversity is y=-1<0 → s2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1 <0 → s1*s2 <0 → count +=1.\n\nRoad3: home is 1+1-3= -1 <0 → s1= -1.\n\nuniversity is -1 + (-1) -3= -5 <0 → same sign → no count.\n\nSo, total count is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAh, I see. Earlier, I made a mistake in the calculation for the second sample.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code should count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead home x, y.\n\nRead university x, y.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount =0.\n\nfor each of n lines:\n\n   read a, b, c.\n\n   s1 = a * home_x + b * home_y + c.\n\n   s2 = a * uni_x + b * uni_y + c.\n\n   if s1 * s2 <0 → count +=1.\n\nprint(count).\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nNow, the edge cases.\n\nWhat if a road is exactly passing through home or university? But the problem states that neither home nor university lie on any road. So, s1 and s2 cannot be zero.\n\nThus, no division by zero or anything.\n\nAnother edge case: when n=0 → but according to input constraints, n≥1.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the third line is n, which is 1 ≤n≤300.\n\nSo, n can be 1.\n\nWhat if home and university are on the same side of all roads except for one? Then, the count is 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, in Python, handling large numbers is fine, as Python supports big integers.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead the home and university coordinates.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead each of the n lines, split into a, b, c.\n\nCompute s1 and s2.\n\nIf s1*s2 <0, increment count.\n\nFinally, print the count.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    home = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    uni = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count =0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        s1 = a * home[0] + b * home[1] + c\n        s2 = a * uni[0] + b * uni[1] + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count +=1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first sample is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n\nWhich translates to home (1,1), uni (-1,-1), n=2.\n\nRoads:\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nWhich, as before, the code would compute s1 and s2 correctly.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nTesting with sample 2:\n\nn=3.\n\nRoads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3=0.\n\nSo, home is (1,1):\n\ns1 for road 1: 1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0.\n\ns2 for road1: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nroad2: home s1=0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\n\ns2=0*(-1)+1*(-1) +0= -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nroad3: 1*1 +1*1 -3= -1 <0.\n\ns2=1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3= -5 <0 → same sign → no count.\n\nThus, count=2 → correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road that separates the two blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: Each road in Crazy Town is an infinite line defined by the equation \\(aix + biy + ci = 0\\). The goal is to find the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves crossing a road that separates the two points.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides. If they are, this road must be crossed, contributing one step to the total count.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of the home and university.\n   - Read the number of roads and their coefficients.\n   - For each road, compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates.\n   - If the signs of these values are different, the road separates the home and university, and thus contributes one step.\n   - Count the number of such roads and print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    home = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    uni = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        s1 = a * home[0] + b * home[1] + c\n        s2 = a * uni[0] + b * uni[1] + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the home and university coordinates, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n- **Line Evaluation**: For each road, the code evaluates the line equation at the home and university coordinates to determine if they lie on opposite sides of the road.\n- **Counting Steps**: Each road that separates the home and university is counted as a step. The total count is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of steps by leveraging the geometric properties of the lines and their impact on the positions of the home and university.",
