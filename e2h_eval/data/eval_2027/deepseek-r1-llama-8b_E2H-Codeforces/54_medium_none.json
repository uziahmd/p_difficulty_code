Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any will do.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, given a regular polygon with n sides, we need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 are on the sides adjacent to v2. The angle at v2 should be as close to 'a' as possible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the description says that v1 and v3 lie on its sides. Oh right, because in a regular polygon, each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices. So for any vertex v2, the sides are the edges from v2 to v2+1 and from v2 to v2-1 (modulo n). So when considering an angle at v2, the points v1 and v3 must lie on those two sides. So the angle is formed by two lines: one going from v2 to v1 and the other from v2 to v3. But since the polygon is regular, the positions of v1 and v3 on the sides determine the angle.\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, all sides are equal and the angles between consecutive sides are fixed. So perhaps the possible angles can only take certain values, depending on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nLet me think about the regular polygon. For a given v2, the possible angles are determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon. For example, in a square, the angle between two adjacent vertices from the center is 90 degrees. But wait, the internal angle of a square is 90 degrees, but the angles formed by selecting non-adjacent points would vary.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps the angle in question is the angle at v2 formed by the two chords connecting v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So the angle is determined by the arcs between v1 and v3 as seen from v2.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angles between consecutive vertices are 360/n degrees. So, the angle at v2 between two points on the same side can be computed based on the number of steps between those points.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the polygon on a circle. Since a regular polygon can be inscribed in a circle, all its vertices lie on a circle. So, for any three points, the angle at v2 can be calculated using the properties of the circle.\n\nIn a circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference. So, if we have points A, B, C on the circle, the angle at B between points A and C is half the measure of the arc AC not containing B.\n\nSo, for our problem, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 as viewed from the center. The angle is half the measure of that arc.\n\nBut wait, in our case, v1 and v3 are on the sides adjacent to v2. So, they are consecutive vertices. Hmm, no, not necessarily. Because in a regular polygon, the sides are consecutive, but for any v2, the two adjacent vertices are v_prev and v_next. So, v1 could be any step before v_prev, and v3 could be any step after v_next, or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe for each possible v2, I can compute all possible pairs of points (v1, v3) such that v1 is on one side of v2 and v3 is on the other side. Then, for each such pair, compute the angle at v2 and see how close it is to 'a'.\n\nBut considering all possibilities might be time-consuming, especially since n can be up to 105. However, the constraints are manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over each possible v2 (from 1 to n).\n2. For each v2, find all possible pairs (v1, v3) where v1 is on one side of v2, and v3 is on the other.\n   - One side is the edge from v2 to v2+1 (mod n), and the other is v2 to v2-1 (mod n).\n   - So, v1 can be any vertex in the range v2-1, v2-2, ..., v2-1 - k steps before, but wait, no— the side is just the two edges connected to v2. So v1 can be any vertex in the polygon, but for the angle, it's determined by their positions relative to v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon, considering the position of v2.\n\nLet me think: for a given v2, let's say the polygon is arranged in order 1, 2, 3, ..., n. So v2 is somewhere in this list.\n\nThe two adjacent vertices are v2-1 and v2+1 (assuming 1-based indexing, and wrapping around). So, for v1 and v3, they must be on the two sides coming out of v2. So, v1 is either on the left side (v2-1, v2-2, etc.) or the right side (v2+1, v2+2, etc.). Wait, no, because any v1 and v3 can be chosen, but they must lie on the two sides adjacent to v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the sides are considered as the two edges connected to v2. So, the two edges are between v2 and v2-1, and between v2 and v2+1. So, for v1, it can be any vertex in the polygon, but it must be on one of these two edges. Similarly for v3.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because any two points on the polygon that are on different edges from v2 would form an angle at v2. So, for example, if v1 is the vertex before v2 (v2-1) and v3 is the next vertex (v2+1), then the angle is the internal angle of the polygon, which is (n-2)*180 / n degrees.\n\nWait, no. The internal angle of a regular polygon is indeed (n-2)*180 / n. But that's the angle between two adjacent edges. So, in that case, the angle formed by v2, v1, and v3 is exactly the internal angle of the polygon.\n\nBut wait, what if v1 is not adjacent? For example, in a square, v2 is 1. Then, v1 could be 4 (the previous vertex) and v3 could be 3 (the next). Then the angle is 90 degrees. But if v1 is 3 and v3 is 4, that's another scenario.\n\nHmm, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2. So, for a regular polygon, the angle is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor a given v2, the positions of v1 and v3 can be thought of as steps away from v2 in both directions. So, for example, v1 could be k steps to the left of v2, and v3 could be m steps to the right. Or vice versa.\n\nThen, the angle between the two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 would be the sum of the angles between those steps. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle can be calculated based on the number of edges between v1 and v3 when passing through the polygon's perimeter. For example, if v1 is k steps to the left of v2, and v3 is m steps to the right, the angle is determined by the sum of those steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is 2 * (d * (180/(n)) ), where d is the minimal number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon. Or maybe it's (d * 180/n), or some variation of that.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the polygon on a circle. Let's imagine that each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. For a regular n-gon, the central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\nSo, for any two vertices u and v, the central angle between them is (k) * (360/n), where k is the minimal number of steps between them along the circle. So, if the polygon is ordered as 1,2,3,...,n in clockwise order, then the distance between 1 and 3 is 2 steps, so the central angle is 2*(360/n).\n\nNow, for a given v2, the angle at v2 between points v1 and v3 can be found using the circle's properties. The angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is θ degrees, then the angle at v2 is θ/2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the angle at v2 is (arc length between v1 and v3 without passing through v2) divided by 2.\n\nSo, for example, in a regular triangle (n=3), each arc is 120 degrees. So if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, the arc between them is 120 degrees, so the angle at v2 is 60 degrees.\n\nIn a square (n=4), the arc between v1 and v3 (if they are two steps apart) is 180 degrees. So the angle at v2 is 90 degrees.\n\nSo, for any v2, the possible angles are determined by the possible distances between v1 and v3. The key is that for each v2, the possible angles are multiples of (360/(n)), but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the angle can be computed as (k * (180/n)) degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that doesn't include v2.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible pair (v1, v3) such that they are on the two different sides of v2, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between them.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal way to approach this is to precompute for each possible v2 all possible angles and find the one closest to 'a'. Then, among all v2s, find the overall best solution.\n\nBut for n up to 105, this approach could be feasible.\n\nSo, the steps I can think of are:\n\n1. For each v2 in 1..n:\n   a. For each possible k, where k is the number of steps from v2 to v1 on one side and m steps on the other side, compute the angle.\n   b. Find the combination of k and m that gives the angle closest to 'a'.\n   \nBut how do I represent the steps?\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the maximum possible angle is 180 degrees (when v1 and v3 are directly opposite each other, but for even n, that's not always possible). Wait, no. For a regular polygon, the maximum possible angle at v2 is less than 180 degrees. For example, in a square, the maximum angle is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when v1 is the vertex before v2, and v3 is the vertex after v2, the angle is the internal angle, which is (n-2)*180/n. For example, in a square, that's 90 degrees. But for a regular pentagon, that's 108 degrees.\n\nWait, so the internal angle of a regular n-gon is (n-2)*180/n. So, for a given v2, if v1 is immediately before and v3 is immediately after, the angle is that internal angle.\n\nIf v1 is further away, the angle may be larger or smaller depending on the positions.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the possible angles can be represented as multiples of (180/n) degrees, varying based on how far v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is (d * 180/n), where d is the number of steps between v1 and v3, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a given v2, the angle can be calculated based on the minimal number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving clockwise or counter-clockwise around the polygon, but that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the polygon as a circle and use the central angles to calculate the angle at v2.\n\nLet me think: For a regular polygon, each vertex is at angle (i-1)*360/n degrees, assuming the first vertex is at 0 degrees.\n\nSo, for v2 = i, its position is (i-1)*360/n degrees.\n\nv1 is at (v1_num - 1)*360/n degrees, and v3 is at (v3_num - 1)*360/n degrees.\n\nThe angle at v2 is the angle between the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\nUsing the circle's properties, the angle between these two vectors is half the measure of the arc that doesn't contain v2.\n\nWait, yes. So, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't pass through v2.\n\nSo, the measure of that arc is |theta1 - theta3|, where theta1 and theta3 are the angles of v1 and v3 respectively. But since the polygon is regular, the positions are known.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (arc_length)/2, where arc_length is the absolute difference between the angles of v1 and v3, modulo 360 degrees, but considering the minimal path.\n\nWait, no. Because in the circle, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that does NOT contain v2. So, the arc between v1 and v3 can be measured in two ways: the shorter way and the longer way. The angle at v2 is the half of the shorter arc.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is (min( |theta1 - theta3|, 360 - |theta1 - theta3| )) / 2.\n\nBut wait, since the polygon is regular, theta1 and theta3 can be expressed in terms of their indices.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor a given v2, which is at index i, the angle is (delta) / 2, where delta is the minimal arc between v1 and v3, measured in degrees.\n\nBut how to compute delta.\n\nEach vertex j is located at (j-1)*360/n degrees.\n\nSo, for v1 and v3, their angles are (v1_num-1)*360/n and (v3_num-1)*360/n degrees.\n\nThe delta is the minimal angular distance between them, which is min(|theta1 - theta3|, 360 - |theta1 - theta3|).\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (delta)/2.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal arc is the one that doesn't include v2. So, perhaps the minimal arc is the one that's on the other side of the circle.\n\nWait, no. Because the angle at v2 is determined by the arc that is opposite to v2. So, for example, if v1 and v3 are on the same side of v2, the arc that doesn't pass through v2 is the small one. But if they are on opposite sides, then the arc that doesn't pass through v2 is the large one.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let's consider an example.\n\nTake a square (n=4), and v2 is vertex 1.\n\nVertex 1 is at 0 degrees.\n\nVertex 2 is at 90 degrees.\n\nVertex 3 is at 180 degrees.\n\nVertex 4 is at 270 degrees.\n\nSuppose v1 is vertex 4 (270) and v3 is vertex 2 (90). The angle at vertex 1 is the angle between the lines from 1 to 4 and 1 to 2.\n\nThe arc between 4 and 2 is 180 degrees (from 270 to 90 is 180 degrees if you go the short way). So the angle at 1 is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier formula, the angle is (delta)/2, where delta is 180. So 180/2 is 90, which matches.\n\nAnother example: n=4, v2=1. Suppose v1 is vertex 3 (180) and v3 is vertex 4 (270). The angle at v2=1 is the angle between 1-3 and 1-4.\n\nThe arc between 3 and 4 is 90 degrees. So the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nWhich makes sense because the angle is the smaller part.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nFor each v2, iterate over all possible pairs of (v1, v3) such that v1 is on one side of v2 and v3 is on the other side. Compute the angle at v2 for each pair, find the one closest to 'a', and track the best solution across all v2.\n\nWait, but considering all possible (v1, v3) pairs for each v2 would be O(n^2) per v2, which for n=105 is 105^2=11025 iterations per v2, and since there are 105 v2s, that's 1,157,625 iterations. That's manageable.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for each v2, the possible (v1, v3) pairs are limited. Because v1 and v3 must be on different sides of v2. So for each v2, the possible v1s are on one side, and v3s are on the other.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, v1 and v3 can be any vertices as long as they are on the two sides adjacent to v2. So, for each v2, v1 can be any vertex that is not equal to v2, but it has to be on one of the two edges connected to v2. Or perhaps, any vertex except v2, but that's not correct because v1 and v3 can be any vertices, but for the angle calculation, their positions relative to v2 determine the angle.\n\nWait, no. Because for the angle calculation, the exact positions of v1 and v3 matter. So, the angle is determined by their positions relative to v2.\n\nSo, for each v2, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the positions of v1 and v3. So, to find the minimal angle, perhaps for each v2, we can precompute all possible pairs (v1, v3) where v1 and v3 are not equal to v2, and compute the angle for each pair.\n\nBut that's O(n^2) for each v2, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop over each v2 (from 1 to n):\n\n   For each possible v1 (from 1 to n, v1 != v2):\n\n      For each possible v3 (from 1 to n, v3 != v2 and v3 != v1):\n\n          Compute the angle at v2.\n\n          Keep track of the minimal difference between the angle and 'a'.\n\n          Also, keep track of the v1, v2, v3 that gives the minimal difference.\n\nOnce all possibilities are checked, output the best v1, v2, v3.\n\nBut wait, that's O(n^3), which for n=105 is 105^3 = 1,157,625, which is manageable, but perhaps it's a bit tight. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the minimal angle is achieved when the arc between v1 and v3 is as close as possible to 2a. Because the angle is (arc length)/2, so to get the angle as close as possible to a, the arc should be close to 2a.\n\nWait, because angle = arc / 2, so arc = 2*angle.\n\nSo, for each v2, the goal is to find v1 and v3 such that the minimal arc between them is as close as possible to 2a degrees.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal arc between v1 and v3 for each v2?\n\nWell, for a regular polygon, each vertex is at position (v-1)*360/n degrees.\n\nSo, for v1 and v3, their positions are (v1-1)*360/n and (v3-1)*360/n.\n\nThe minimal arc between them is min(|theta1 - theta3|, 360 - |theta1 - theta3|).\n\nWe want this minimal arc to be as close as possible to 2a degrees.\n\nSo, for each v2, we can compute the desired minimal arc as target_arc = 2a.\n\nBut wait, 2a can be larger than 360 degrees. For example, a=180, 2a=360. So, in that case, the minimal arc would be 0, but that's impossible because v1 and v3 are distinct.\n\nWait, but a is given as 1<=a<=180. So 2a can be up to 360.\n\nBut for a=180, 2a is exactly 360. So the minimal arc between v1 and v3 is 360, which would imply that v1 and v3 are the same point, which is not allowed because they must be distinct.\n\nSo, perhaps for a=180, the minimal possible angle is 180 degrees, which is achieved when v1 and v3 are diametrically opposite to v2.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case for all v2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for each v2 all possible pairs of v1 and v3, compute the angle, and track the minimal difference.\n\nBut for n=105, that's 105 * (104)^2 = about 1 million operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nAnother observation: for a given v2, the minimal angle is achieved when the arc between v1 and v3 is as close as possible to 2a degrees. But the minimal arc is in [0, 180] because beyond that, the minimal arc is the other way.\n\nWait, no. Because the minimal arc is the smallest possible, so it's between 0 and 180 degrees.\n\nWait, but 2a could be larger than 360, but for a=180, 2a=360. So the minimal arc would be zero, but that's only possible if v1 and v3 are the same, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor each v2:\n\n   Compute the target minimal arc as target = 2a mod 360.\n\n   Then, for each possible step k (number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon), compute the corresponding angle, and find the k that brings the angle as close as possible to a.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each v2, we can compute all possible steps between v1 and v3 that could result in an angle close to a.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nMaybe the initial approach is manageable, even though it's O(n^3). Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and a.\n\n2. For each possible v2 in 1..n:\n\n   a. Compute the current v2's position on the circle: pos_v2 = (v2-1)*360/n.\n\n   b. For each possible v1 in 1..n, v1 != v2:\n\n      i. Compute theta1 = (v1-1)*360/n.\n\n      ii. Compute the angle between v2 and v1: this is the minimal arc between pos_v2 and theta1, divided by 2.\n\n         So, delta1 = min( |theta1 - pos_v2|, 360 - |theta1 - pos_v2| )\n\n         angle_v1 = delta1 / 2\n\n      c. Similarly, for each possible v3 in 1..n, v3 != v2 and v3 != v1:\n\n         i. Compute theta3 = (v3-1)*360/n.\n\n         ii. Compute the angle between v2 and v3: delta3 = min( |theta3 - pos_v2|, 360 - |theta3 - pos_v2| )\n\n         angle_v23 = delta3 / 2\n\n         iii. Wait, no. Because the angle at v2 is between the two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\n         So, the angle is the angle between these two vectors, which is equal to the minimal arc between v1 and v3 divided by 2.\n\n         So, the correct approach is:\n\n             compute theta1 and theta3, then compute the minimal arc between them, then divide by 2 to get the angle.\n\n             So, delta = min( |theta1 - theta3|, 360 - |theta1 - theta3| )\n\n             angle = delta / 2\n\n   d. For each pair (v1, v3), compute the angle, and track whether this angle is closer to a than the current best.\n\n3. After checking all possible (v1, v2, v3), output the triplet that has the minimal absolute difference between angle and a.\n\nBut this is O(n^3), which for n=105 is 105^3 = 1,157,625 operations. That's acceptable, as Python can handle that quickly.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can optimize this by precomputing for each v2 all possible pairs (v1, v3) and compute the angle quickly.\n\nBut perhaps it's manageable.\n\nNow, the next question is: how to compute the minimal arc between v1 and v3.\n\nGiven that the polygon is regular, the positions are (v-1)*360/n degrees.\n\nSo, for v1 and v3, theta1 = (v1-1)*360/n\n\ntheta3 = (v3-1)*360/n\n\nThe difference is diff = theta3 - theta1.\n\nBut since the circle wraps around, the actual difference could be diff or 360 - diff, whichever is smaller.\n\nWait, the minimal arc is min(diff, 360 - diff).\n\nBut wait, theta1 and theta3 are modulo 360, so their difference can be computed as (theta3 - theta1 + 360) % 360.\n\nNo, perhaps not. Let me think: the difference between two angles is the minimal of |theta1 - theta3| and 360 - |theta1 - theta3|.\n\nSo, the minimal arc is min( (theta3 - theta1) % 360, (theta1 - theta3) % 360 ), but perhaps the minimal is the smallest of the two.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to compute the difference as (theta3 - theta1) mod 360, and if it's greater than 180, subtract it from 360 to get the minimal arc.\n\nWait, no. Because the minimal arc is the smallest possible, so if the difference is 190 degrees, the minimal arc is 170 degrees.\n\nSo, the minimal arc is min(d, 360 - d), where d is the absolute difference between theta1 and theta3.\n\nThus, for any pair (v1, v3), the minimal arc is:\n\nd = abs(theta3 - theta1)\n\narc = min(d, 360 - d)\n\nangle = arc / 2\n\nSo, that's the formula.\n\nNow, in code, how to represent this?\n\nWe can represent the polygon as a list of angles, but perhaps it's not necessary. Instead, for each v1 and v3, compute their theta1 and theta3, compute the angle, and compare to 'a'.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n, a.\n\nbest_diff = infinity\n\nbest_triplet = []\n\nfor v2 in 1 to n:\n\n    pos_v2 = (v2 - 1) * 360 / n\n\n    for v1 in 1 to n:\n\n        if v1 == v2: continue\n\n        theta1 = (v1 - 1) * 360 / n\n\n        # compute angle between v2 and v1\n\n        d = abs(theta1 - pos_v2)\n\n        arc = min(d, 360 - d)\n\n        angle_v1 = arc / 2\n\n        # but wait, this is the angle between v2 and v1, but the angle at v2 is the angle between v2, v1, and v3.\n\n        # So, for a given v3, the angle at v2 is determined by the minimal arc between v1 and v3.\n\n        for v3 in 1 to n:\n\n            if v3 == v2 or v3 == v1: continue\n\n            theta3 = (v3 - 1) * 360 / n\n\n            d_arc = abs(theta1 - theta3)\n\n            arc = min(d_arc, 360 - d_arc)\n\n            angle = arc / 2\n\n            current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n\n            if current_diff < best_diff or \n\n               (current_diff == best_diff and ... ):\n\n                best_diff = current_diff\n\n                best_triplet = (v1, v2, v3)\n\nBut this is O(n^3), which for n=105 is 105*104*103 = 1,092,105, which is about a million, manageable.\n\nWait, but 105^3 is 1,157,625, which is about a million. Python can handle that.\n\nBut wait, for each v2, the inner loops are for v1 and v3. For each v2, the number of possible v1 and v3 is (n-1)*(n-2) combinations. For n=105, that's 104*103=10,732 per v2. Multiply by 105 v2s: 1,125,240. So it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this by precomputing for each v2 the possible angles and storing the best for that v2, then comparing across v2s.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed with the triple loop.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each v2, for each v1, and for each v3, we compute the angle at v2, and track the best.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the next thing is to make sure that the triplet (v1, v2, v3) is unique. Because v1 and v3 can be any distinct vertices not equal to v2.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the triplet must consist of three distinct vertices.\n\nSo, in the code, we have to ensure that v1, v2, v3 are all distinct.\n\nWhich is handled by the conditions v1 != v2 and v3 != v2 and v3 != v1.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, the main issue is to compute the angle correctly.\n\nWait, but in the code outline above, for each v1 and v3, it's calculating the angle between v1 and v3 as seen from v2. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nWe'll have to handle floating points, but for comparison, we can compare the differences.\n\nBut since a is an integer, and the angle can be a float, we need to compute the minimal difference.\n\nBut the code can proceed with floats.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 15\n\nSample Output:\n\n1 2 3\n\nIn this case, for a regular triangle, each angle possible is 60 degrees. So, regardless of the triplet, the angle is 60, which is 45 away from 15, but wait, 60 is 45 away from 15? No, wait 60-15=45. But since it's the only possibility, it's the best.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 67\n\nOutput is 2 1 3.\n\nIn the square, the internal angle is 90 degrees. So the difference is 23. But perhaps another triplet has a 45-degree angle, which is 22 away, which is better.\n\nWait, no, in the note, it says that in the second sample, 45 was chosen because it's closer than 90.\n\nSo, for v2=1, v1=3, v3=2: the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nHow is that computed?\n\nv2 is 1.\n\nv1 is 3, which is two steps away in the counter-clockwise direction.\n\nv3 is 2, which is one step away in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, let me compute theta1 and theta3.\n\ntheta_v2 = (1-1)*360/4 = 0 degrees.\n\nv1 is 3: (3-1)*360/4 = 180 degrees.\n\nv3 is 2: (2-1)*360/4 = 90 degrees.\n\nThe minimal arc between v1 and v3 is 90 degrees.\n\nSo, angle is 45 degrees, which is 22 away from 67.\n\nWait, 67 -45 is 22, but 90 is 23 away. So choosing 45 is better.\n\nSo, the code would find this triplet and select it.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nAnother sample is the third input:\n\n4 68\n\nThe output is 4 1 2.\n\nWhich implies that the angle is 90 degrees, which is 22 away from 68 (since 68-90 is -22, absolute is 22). But why not 45 again, which is 22 away as well (68-45=23). So 90 is closer.\n\nWait, wait: 68-45=23, 90-68=22. So 90 is closer. So the code would pick 90.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to output the triplet as v1 v2 v3, but the order of v1 and v3 matters? Or is the triplet considered unordered in terms of v1 and v3?\n\nIn the problem statement, the triplet is three distinct vertices, and the angle is at v2. So, the order of v1 and v3 doesn't affect the angle, but the code may consider both orders.\n\nBut in the code, for each v1 and v3, it's computing the angle, but perhaps swapping v1 and v3 would yield the same angle. So, in the code, perhaps it's redundant to consider both.\n\nBut for the purpose of finding the minimal difference, it's not necessary to track both, as the angle is the same.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as is.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, dealing with floating points can have precision issues. So, perhaps we can represent the angle with a certain precision, but since the problem allows any solution, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut for the comparisons, we can compare the absolute differences as floating points.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and a from input.\n\nInitialize best_diff to a very high value, say infinity.\n\nbest_v1, best_v2, best_v3 = None, None, None.\n\nFor each v2 in 1..n:\n\n    pos_v2 = (v2 - 1) * 360.0 / n\n\n    for v1 in 1..n:\n\n        if v1 == v2: continue\n\n        theta1 = (v1 - 1) * 360.0 / n\n\n        d = abs(theta1 - pos_v2)\n\n        arc = min(d, 360 - d)\n\n        angle = arc / 2\n\n        for v3 in 1..n:\n\n            if v3 == v2 or v3 == v1: continue\n\n            theta3 = (v3 - 1) * 360.0 / n\n\n            d_arc = abs(theta1 - theta3)\n\n            arc = min(d_arc, 360 - d_arc)\n\n            angle = arc / 2\n\n            current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n\n            if current_diff < best_diff:\n\n                best_diff = current_diff\n\n                best_v1 = v1\n\n                best_v2 = v2\n\n                best_v3 = v3\n\n            elif current_diff == best_diff:\n\n                # To find the lex smallest triplet, perhaps, but the problem allows any.\n\n                # So, we can skip this part, or just leave it as is.\n\n                pass\n\nAfter processing all, print best_v1, best_v2, best_v3.\n\nBut wait, for each triplet, the code is checking all possible v1 and v3, but perhaps there's a way to find the best triplet more efficiently.\n\nBut perhaps it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 15\n\nProcessing v2=1:\n\nv1 can be 2 or 3.\n\nFor v1=2:\n\ntheta1 = (2-1)*120=120 degrees.\n\npos_v2 is 0.\n\nd = 120.\n\narc is 120, angle 60.\n\nThen for v3=3:\n\ntheta3 = 240.\n\nd_arc = 120.\n\narc is 120, angle 60.\n\nSo, angle is 60.\n\ncurrent_diff is 45.\n\nSimilarly, for all other v1 and v3, the angle is 60.\n\nThus, the best_diff is 45.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 67.\n\nLooking for a triplet where the angle is 45.\n\nWhen v2=1:\n\nv1=3, v3=2.\n\ntheta1= (3-1)*90=180.\n\ntheta3= (2-1)*90=90.\n\nd_arc=90.\n\narc is 90, angle 45.\n\ncurrent_diff is 22.\n\nWhich is better than 90.\n\nThus, this triplet is selected",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves iterating over all possible triplets of vertices and calculating the angle at each vertex to find the optimal triplet.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Polygon and Angles**: A regular polygon can be inscribed in a circle, where each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference. The angle at any vertex formed by two other vertices can be determined using the properties of circles.\n2. **Calculate Angles Using Circle Properties**: For each vertex `v2`, consider all pairs of other vertices `v1` and `v3`. The angle at `v2` is determined by the minimal arc between `v1` and `v3` when viewed from the center of the circle.\n3. **Iterate Over All Possible Triplets**: For each possible vertex `v2`, iterate over all pairs of other vertices `v1` and `v3` to compute the angle at `v2`. Track the triplet that minimizes the absolute difference between the computed angle and the target angle 'a'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v1, best_v2, best_v3 = 0, 0, 0\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n + 1):\n    pos_v2 = (v2 - 1) * 360.0 / n\n    for v1 in range(1, n + 1):\n        if v1 == v2:\n            continue\n        theta1 = (v1 - 1) * 360.0 / n\n        d = abs(theta1 - pos_v2)\n        arc = min(d, 360 - d)\n        angle = arc / 2\n        for v3 in range(1, n + 1):\n            if v3 == v2 or v3 == v1:\n                continue\n            theta3 = (v3 - 1) * 360.0 / n\n            d_arc = abs(theta1 - theta3)\n            arc = min(d_arc, 360 - d_arc)\n            angle = arc / 2\n            current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n            if current_diff < best_diff:\n                best_diff = current_diff\n                best_v1 = v1\n                best_v2 = v2\n                best_v3 = v3\n\nprint(f\"{best_v1} {best_v2} {best_v3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n- **Initialization**: We initialize variables to track the best triplet found so far based on the smallest difference between the computed angle and 'a'.\n- **Iterate Over Vertices**: For each vertex `v2`, calculate its position on the circle.
