    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of nodes required for a p-reachable directed graph and also determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, understanding what a p-reachable graph is. From the problem statement, a p-reachable graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, u and v are reachable from each other. So each such pair is an edge that forms a bidirectional path between u and v. But wait, no, because if u can reach v and v can reach u, then they form a strongly connected component. However, the definition here is about ordered pairs where u < v, so it's about unordered edges but considering their order.\n\nWait, no, the pairs (u, v) with u < v and reachable from each other contribute to p. So each such pair adds 1 to p. So the total p is the count of such unordered pairs that are mutual reachable.\n\nHmm, perhaps the structure of the graph needs to be such that the number of mutual reachable unordered pairs is p.\n\nI think the minimal graph would probably be a collection of components where each component contributes as much as possible to p. But since we want the minimal number of nodes, perhaps we arrange the components optimally.\n\nLet me think about the minimal number of nodes first.\n\nFor example, when p=0: Then the graph must have zero such pairs. That means there are no two nodes u and v with u < v and reachable both ways. So each node can't have any outgoing edges that form a mutual pair. How? Maybe each node is isolated. So the minimal number of nodes is 0? Or wait, no, because for a graph with zero nodes, there are no edges. Wait, but the problem says \"the graph must contain exactly p ordered pairs\". So for p=0, the graph must have zero such pairs. The minimal nodes would be 1, because with one node, there are no u != v, so no pairs. So output is 1 0.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input, when p=0, the output is 0 0. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let's see the sample:\n\nIn the sample, for p=0, the output is '0 0'. So the minimal number of nodes is 0. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing because 0 nodes can't have any edges. So the answer is correct because for p=0, the graph is empty, hence no pairs.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the directed graph is called p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\" So for 0 nodes, since there are no nodes, there are zero such pairs. So the minimal number of nodes is indeed 0 for p=0.\n\nSo for general p, how do I compute the minimal number of nodes?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of nodes is the smallest n such that the maximal number of pairs (u, v) with u < v, u and v reachable, is at least p. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal graph is a collection of chains or something else that allows us to have exactly p such pairs.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure that maximizes the number of such pairs given a certain number of nodes. Because for minimal nodes, perhaps the structure is the most efficient in terms of p per node.\n\nWait, for example, when you have a complete DAG where every pair of nodes is connected in one direction, but none in the reverse. But that's not possible because in a DAG, there are no cycles. So each node can be part of some edges, but only in one direction.\n\nWait, but in such a case, for any pair (u, v), either u can reach v or v can reach u, but not both. So each such pair contributes 1 to p. Wait no, because p counts the pairs where u can reach v and v can reach u. So if the graph is a DAG, then for any u and v, exactly one of u can reach v or v can reach u, but not both. So in that case, the number of such pairs is zero. So for a DAG, the p is zero.\n\nBut we're trying to get a p equal to some value, so the graph can't be a DAG unless p is zero.\n\nHmm, so to get p>0, the graph must have some cycles, i.e., strongly connected components.\n\nWait, yes. Because if the graph has a cycle, then any two nodes in the cycle can reach each other via the cycle. So any pair of nodes in the same strongly connected component (SCC) will have u < v, and reachable from each other, contributing to p.\n\nMoreover, for two",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and also find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachability**: A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v`, and both `u` can reach `v` and `v` can reach `u`.\n\n2. **Minimum Number of Nodes**:\n   - For `p = 0`, the graph must have zero such pairs, which is achieved with zero nodes.\n   - For `p > 0`, the minimal structure is a complete bipartite graph where each node points to every other node in the opposite partition, forming a chain-like structure. The number of nodes required is `2 * p + 1`.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**:\n   - In a complete bipartite graph, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved by ensuring each edge from one partition to another is unidirectional, leading to `n * m` pairs where `n` and `m` are the sizes of the two partitions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\np = int(input().split()[0])\n\nif p == 0:\n    print(\"0 0\")\nelse:\n    min_nodes = 2 * p + 1\n    # For the maximum unidirectional pairs, it's when the graph is a complete bipartitioned into two parts\n    # One part has size k, the other has size l, such that k + l = min_nodes\n    # To maximize the product, the sizes should be as equal as possible.\n    # Wait, no, actually, for a complete bipartite graph K_{k,l}, the number of edges is k*l. But since all edges are unidirectional, it's the same as the number of edges in a complete bipartite.\n    # So the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (k) * (l), where k + l = min_nodes.\n    # To maximize k*l, given k + l = s, the product is maximized when k and l are as equal as possible.\n    # So let's split min_nodes into two parts as equally as possible.\n    s = min_nodes\n    k = s // 2\n    l = s - k\n    max_uni = k * l\n    print(f\"{min_nodes} {max_uni}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Minimum Nodes Calculation**: For `p > 0`, the minimal number of nodes required is derived from a structure that allows each new pair to contribute to `p`. This results in `2 * p + 1` nodes.\n- **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: By structuring the graph as a complete bipartite graph, we ensure that the number of unidirectional pairs is maximized, which is given by the product of the sizes of the two partitions. Splitting the nodes as evenly as possible between the two partitions maximizes this product.",
