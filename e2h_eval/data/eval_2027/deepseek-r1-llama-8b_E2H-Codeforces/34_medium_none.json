And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So doing something O(n^2) would probably be too slow.\n\nWait, let's think about what a week is. A week is any k consecutive days in the list of n days. For example, if n=3 and k=2, there are two weeks: days 1-2 and 2-3.\n\nSo the total number of weeks is (n - k + 1). For each week, we sum the sleep hours and then divide by the number of weeks.\n\nBut calculating each week's sum individually and adding them all would take O(n*k) time, which for 2e5 is 4e10 operations—way too slow. That won't work.\n\nI need a more efficient way. Oh right, prefix sums! That's the way to go. Because prefix sums allow us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time after preprocessing.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array of the given list. This will allow me to get the sum of any consecutive k elements quickly.\n\n2. Iterate through each possible window of size k, calculate its sum using the prefix sums, add it to a running total.\n\n3. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Read n and k from input.\n- Read the array a of size n.\n- Compute the prefix sum array s, where s[0] = 0, s[i] = a[0] + ... + a[i-1].\n- Then, for each window starting at index i (from 0 to n-k), the sum is s[i+k] - s[i]. Sum all these values.\n- The average is total_sum / (n -k +1).\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Because the prefix sum is cumulative. For example, the sum from a[p] to a[q-1] is s[q] - s[p]. So yes, for a window starting at i, the end is i + k -1. So the sum is s[i +k] - s[i].\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and k from the first line. Then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum:\n\ns = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    s[i+1] = s[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, compute the total sum:\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(n - k + 1):\n    total += s[i + k] - s[i]\n\nFinally, the average is total / (n -k +1).\n\nWait, but what about when k is equal to n? Then n -k +1 is 1, which is correct since there's only one week.\n\nSo that covers all cases.\n\nNow, regarding the output. The problem says to output the average with enough decimal digits. It's required that the absolute or relative error is <= 1e-6. So we need to output at least six decimal places, but perhaps more accurately.\n\nIn Python, printing with format string like \"{:.10f}\" would give 10 decimal digits. But wait, looking at the examples:\n\nIn the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857, which has 10 decimal digits. So probably, we need to print with exactly 10 decimal digits, but perhaps trailing zeros are acceptable.\n\nSo, in code, after computing the average, we can print it with 10 decimal places.\n\nBut wait, how to handle floating points correctly? Because sometimes the average might not be an exact decimal, so we need to represent it accurately.\n\nPython's floating point arithmetic should suffice here as it's precise enough for the required precision. Since the numbers are up to 1e5 and multiplied by n (2e5), the total can be up to 2e10. Divided by up to 2e5, the maximum average is around 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead the input lines.\n\nWait, the input is given as strings. For example, the first sample input is ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', etc.]. So the code needs to read these lines, split them into integers.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nCompute prefix sum:\n\ns = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    s[i+1] = s[i] + a[i]\n\nCompute total:\n\ntotal = 0\nwindow_count = n - k + 1\nfor i in range(window_count):\n    total += s[i + k] - s[i]\n\naverage = total / window_count\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the sample outputs, the first example's output is 9.0000000000. Which is exactly 9, so the code would print 9.0000000000.\n\nSimilarly, the third example: 28964.2857142857 is 10 digits after the decimal, but wait, 10 digits? Or is it 10 fractional digits? Hmm, let me see.\n\nLooking at the sample output:\n\nThird example output is '28964.2857142857' which has 10 digits after decimal. So the code should format the output to 10 decimal places.\n\nBut wait, sometimes the average may require more than 10 decimal digits. So we need to ensure that at least 10 are printed, but perhaps truncating or rounding is needed.\n\nWait, in Python, when you use the .10f format, it rounds to the 10th decimal place. So for the third sample, the average is (sum of all weeks)/7.\n\nLet me calculate the third example:\n\nInput is 8 2, and the array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1].\n\nWait, wait, the input is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'.\n\nSo n=8, k=2. So n-k+1=7 weeks.\n\nEach week is two consecutive days. So the weeks are:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nSumming these:\n\n3 + 6 =9\n\n+100004 → 100013\n\n+100123 → 200136\n\n+579 → 200715\n\n+1245 → 201960\n\n+790 → 202750.\n\nTotal is 202750. Divided by 7, 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... So when we format with .10f, it becomes 28964.2857142857, which is 10 digits after decimal.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input is 1 1 and 10. So n=1, k=1. So one week, average is 10.\n\nSo the code should print 10.0000000000.\n\nAnother case: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]. The weeks are [3,4], [4,7]. Sums are 7 and 11. Total 18, divided by 2 → 9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nWhat about when n=k? Like n=5, k=5. Then the sum is the entire array, and the average is that sum.\n\nWhat about when k is 1? Then each day is a week. So the average is the same as the average of all a_i.\n\nBut in code, it's handled correctly.\n\nPotential issues: What if the sum is very large, leading to integer overflows? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not a problem.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1:\nn=1, k=1. a=[5]. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nTest case 2:\nn=2, k=2. a=[1,2]. Only one week, sum is 3. Output 3.0000000000.\n\nTest case 3:\nn=5, k=3. a = [1,2,3,4,5]. Weeks are [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5]. Sums 6,9,12. Total 27. Average 9.0.\n\nSo code should handle all these.\n\nThus, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nI think that's all. Now, time to write the code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks of k consecutive days from a given list of sleep times for n days. The solution must be efficient and handle large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to compute the average sleep time over all windows of size k in a list of n integers. Each window represents a week, and the goal is to find the average sum of these windows.\n2. **Efficiency Consideration**: Directly computing the sum of each window would result in an O(nk) time complexity, which is too slow for large n. Instead, we use a prefix sum array to allow constant time sum computation for any subarray.\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array helps quickly compute the sum of any subarray using precomputed sums. The prefix sum array `s` is constructed such that `s[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the input list.\n4. **Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, we efficiently compute the sum of each window of size k by subtracting the appropriate prefix sums.\n5. **Average Calculation**: After computing the total sum of all valid windows, we divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    k = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2 + n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    s = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        s[i+1] = s[i] + a[i]\n    \n    # Calculate total sum of all windows\n    total = 0\n    window_count = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(window_count):\n        total += s[i + k] - s[i]\n    \n    # Compute average and print with 10 decimal places\n    average = total / window_count\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string split into parts. The first two values are n and k, followed by the list of sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array `s` is built where each element at index `i` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep times list. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n3. **Total Sum Calculation**: For each valid window of size k, the sum is computed using the prefix sums and added to the total sum.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week, which is then printed with 10 decimal places to ensure precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the maximum constraints effectively.",
