The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot. My task is to calculate how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm, right. So each round, both choose their move based on their respective sequences. The key is that each uses a cyclic sequence: for example, if A is \"RPS\", then the moves go R, P, S, R, P, S, etc. Similarly for B.\n\nSo for each round i (from 0 to n-1), we need to determine who wins, and increment their red spot count accordingly.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. And the sequences can be up to 1000 characters each. So, we need an efficient way to compute this without doing O(n) operations per step, because 2e5 * 1000 is 2e8, which might be a bit tight for Python.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each round, we need to find the current move of both players. So the moves cycle through their sequences. So for each round, the index for A is i mod m, where m is the length of A. Similarly for B, it's i mod k.\n\nSo for each round i, the moves are A[i % m] and B[i % k], respectively.\n\nThen, for each such pair of moves, we determine the winner. If A's move beats B's, then B gets a red spot. Otherwise, if B's move beats A's, then A gets a red spot. If it's a draw, nothing happens.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read n, A string, B string.\n2. For each i from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get a_move = A[i % len(A)]\n   b. Get b_move = B[i % len(B)]\n   c. Determine if a_move beats b_move.\n   d. If yes, add 1 to the loser's count (B's count if a beats b)\n3. After processing all rounds, output the counts.\n\nBut wait, for n up to 2e5 and each step being O(1), it's manageable. Because 2e5 steps are okay in Python.\n\nSo the next question is how to represent the moves and determine the winner efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\nRock (R) beats scissors (S)\nScissors (S) beat paper (P)\nPaper (P) beats rock (R)\n\nSo for a given a_move and b_move, we can determine the outcome.\n\nWe can represent this as a dictionary or a function that returns whether a_move beats b_move.\n\nAlternatively, create a mapping for each possible a_move to the move it beats.\n\nLike:\n\nbeats = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\nSo, for a given a_move, the move it beats is beats[a_move]. If b_move is equal to that, then a_move beats b_move, else check if b_move beats a_move.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to write a helper function that returns True if a_move beats b_move.\n\nYes, that would work.\n\nSo let's define a function:\n\ndef does_a_win(a, b):\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return True\n    elif (b == 'R' and a == 'S') or (b == 'S' and a == 'P') or (b == 'P' and a == 'R'):\n        return False\n    else:\n        # it's a draw\n        return None\n\nWait, perhaps a more efficient way is to create a lookup table. But for three possibilities, it's manageable.\n\nAnother approach: for each a_move and b_move, determine the result.\n\nAlternatively, assign each move a value, like R=0, S=1, P=2. Then, (a - b) mod 3 gives the outcome.\n\nWait, because:\n\nIf a beats b, then a - b should be 1 mod 3. Because R(0) beats S(1): 0-1 = -1 mod 3 is 2? Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps another arrangement.\n\nWait, maybe think in terms of (a + 1) mod 3 == b mod 3?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nR (0) beats S (1). So if a is R, b is S: 0 +1 =1, which is same as b. So that doesn't fit.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on each player after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors rounds. Each round is played based on cyclic sequences chosen by each player.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each use cyclic sequences to determine their moves in each round. The goal is to count the number of times each player loses a round, which results in the loser getting a red spot.\n2. **Cyclic Sequences**: Each player's sequence is used cyclically. This means that after the last move in the sequence, the next move starts from the beginning of the sequence.\n3. **Determine Winners**: For each round, we compare the moves of both players to determine the winner. The winner is the one whose move beats the other according to the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock).\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Given the constraints, we need an efficient way to determine the outcome of each round without exceeding time limits. Using modulo operations to cycle through the sequences efficiently and checking the outcome directly ensures that each round is processed in constant time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\na_len = len(A)\nb_len = len(B)\n\nr = 0  # count for Polycarpus (since he's the B player)\np = 0  # count for Nikephoros (A player)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % a_len]\n    b_move = B[i % b_len]\n    \n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n       (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n       (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n        r += 1  # A wins, so B gets a spot\n    elif (b_move == 'R' and a_move == 'S') or \\\n         (b_move == 'S' and a_move == 'P') or \\\n         (b_move == 'P' and a_move == 'R'):\n        p += 1  # B wins, so A gets a spot\n\nprint(p, r)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B` used by each player.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize counters `r` and `p` to keep track of the red spots for Polycarpus and Nikephoros, respectively.\n3. **Processing Each Round**: For each round, we determine the current move of each player using modulo operations to cycle through their sequences.\n4. **Determine Outcome**: We check if the current move of one player beats the other. If so, the losing player's counter is incremented.\n5. **Output Results**: After processing all rounds, we print the counts of red spots for each player.\n\nThis approach ensures that each round is processed efficiently, making the solution suitable for large input sizes.",
