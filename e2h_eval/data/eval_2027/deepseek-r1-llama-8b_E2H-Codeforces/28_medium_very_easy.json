String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of beautiful strings based on certain criteria. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, a beautiful string is a binary string (only 0s and 1s) that has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's more to it: we can modify the string through some operations, and the resulting string after modifications must be equal to g. Wait, no—wait, the problem says that the string can be obtained by modifying some (possibly zero) number of modifications such that the resulting string is g. Oh, right, so the original string must be modifiable into a string consisting entirely of g's. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me re-read.\n\nAh, the problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So, the string s must be modifiable into a string where all characters are g. So, for example, if g is 0, then after some modifications, the entire string becomes all 0s. Similarly for g being 1.\n\nWait, but how does the modification work? Each modification replaces the last two characters with a single character. If the two are both 0, replace with 0. If both are 1, replace with 1. Otherwise, like 0 and 1, replace with 0. Or wait, according to the note: one modification transforms \"01010\" into \"0100\", and two modifications make it \"011\". Hmm, let's see:\n\nOriginal string: 0 1 0 1 0\nAfter one modification: replace last two (1 and 0) → replace with 0 → becomes 0100.\nThen another modification: replace last two (0 and 0) → replace with 0 → becomes 011.\n\nSo each modification reduces the length by 1. Because you take two characters and replace them with one. So each operation reduces the length by 1.\n\nThe initial string can be modified any number of times, including zero. So, the question is: for a string s which consists of exactly n 0s and m 1s, is there a way to perform a series of modifications so that the resulting string is all g's?\n\nWait, but the initial string can have any arrangement of 0s and 1s, as long as it has exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the problem reduces to counting the number of such binary strings of length n + m that can be reduced to all g's via some modifications.\n\nBut how do we model the possible transformations?\n\nHmm. Let's think about what it takes for a string to be reducible to all g's.\n\nEach modification reduces the length by 1, and also changes the string in a specific way. But perhaps the key is to find the conditions under which a string can be reduced to a single g.\n\nLet me consider when g is 0. For a string to be reducible to all 0s, it must satisfy certain properties.\n\nWait, think recursively. Suppose I have a string s of length k. After one modification, it becomes a string of length k-1. The process continues until the string is reduced to a single character. So, for a string to be reducible to all 0s, perhaps the entire string must have an even number of 1s or something like that. Or maybe not. Maybe it's better to model this in terms of parity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the number of 1s in the string must be congruent to 0 modulo something.\n\nWait, let's consider the process of modifying the string. Each modification step combines two characters at the end into one. So, the order in which we perform the modifications affects the outcome. But perhaps for the purpose of determining whether a string can be reduced to all g's, there's a certain invariant.\n\nSuppose I want the final string to be all 0s. What needs to be true about the original string?\n\nEach modification replaces two characters with a new one. Let's think about the effect on the count of 1s.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If I combine two 0s: 00 → 0. The count of 1s remains the same.\n- If I combine two 1s: 11 → 1. The count decreases by 1.\n- If I combine a 0 and a 1: 01 → 0 (since it's replacing two different characters with 0). So the count of 1s decreases by 1.\n\nSo, each modification can either leave the count of 1s the same, or decrease it by 1, depending on which pair is chosen.\n\nWait, but the choice of which pair to combine is ours. So, to reach a string of all 0s, the count of 1s must be reducible to zero. But how?\n\nBecause each modification can reduce the number of 1s by 0 or 1. So, the initial number of 1s must be such that it can be reduced to zero by a series of steps where each step can subtract 0 or 1.\n\nWait, but the initial number of 1s is m. To reach zero, we need m ≥ 0, but more importantly, since each step can only decrease the count by 0 or 1, the total number of 1s must be less than or equal to the number of steps taken. Or wait, no: because each step can choose to subtract 0 or 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: each modification can reduce the count by 1 (if combining two 1s or a 0 and 1), or leave it as is (combining two 0s). So, the minimal number of 1s after a series of modifications is m - t, where t is the number of steps that chose to subtract 1. But t can vary.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because each step is a binary choice: whether to subtract 1 or not. So, over k steps, t can be any number between 0 and k. So, the final count of 1s would be m - t. We need this to be zero, so t = m.\n\nBut wait, the total number of steps is (n + m - 1) - 1 = n + m - 2. Because each step reduces the length by 1, starting from (n+m) down to 1. So the number of steps is (n + m - 1) steps.\n\nWait, no: the initial length is len = n + m. Each step reduces len by 1. So to reach len=1, you need len-1 steps. So the number of steps is (n + m) - 1.\n\nSo, during these steps, the number of times we choose to subtract 1 is t. Then, the final count of 1s is m - t. We require m - t = 0, so t must be equal to m.\n\nBut t can't exceed the number of steps. Because each step can contribute at most 1 to t.\n\nSo, t = m ≤ (n + m - 1). Which is always true since n + m -1 >= m (since n >=0, but n +m >=1).\n\nSo, the condition is that m must be achievable as t, but t can be up to (n + m -1) steps.\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where g is 0, the final string is all 0s, which implies that the count of 1s is zero. So, for the initial string to be reducible to all 0s, it must be possible to choose t = m steps where each step subtracts 1. But each step can only subtract 1 if the current string ends with either two 1s or a 0 followed by a 1.\n\nHmm, but this seems too vague. Perhaps there's a better way to model this.\n\nAlternative approach: think about the problem in terms of the parity of the number of 1s.\n\nWait, each time we perform a modification, the number of 1s can change by 0 or -1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nCase 1: combine two 0s → the number of 1s remains the same.\n\nCase 2: combine two 1s → the number of 1s decreases by 1.\n\nCase 3: combine 0 and 1 → the number of 1s decreases by 1.\n\nSo, in cases 2 and 3, the count decreases by 1. In case 1, it stays the same.\n\nSo, the parity of the number of 1s can change or stay the same.\n\nWait, suppose initially the number of 1s is m. After each modification, the parity can either stay the same or flip.\n\nWait, no: because in cases 2 and 3, the count decreases by 1, so the parity flips. In case 1, the count doesn't change, so the parity remains.\n\nSo, when you choose to perform a modification that changes the count, the parity flips; otherwise, it remains.\n\nSo, the parity of m determines whether it's possible to reach zero.\n\nBecause, in order to reach zero (which has even parity?), no, zero is even. So, the initial m must be even if the number of steps that change the parity is such that it ends on zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the number of 1s must be reducible to zero by a series of steps where each step can choose to reduce by 1 or not.\n\nBut for the final count to be zero, the initial count must be able to reach zero through a series of subtractions. Since each subtraction is optional, the minimal condition is that m must be less than or equal to the number of steps plus the initial count.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as the ability to merge the string in such a way that all 1s are eliminated.\n\nBut to eliminate all 1s, each 1 must be paired with another 0 or 1, but in a way that allows their reduction.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the number of 1s in the string is such that they can be completely removed through a series of merges. So, for the string to be reducible to all 0s, the number of 1s must be such that m <= (number of steps) and the parity of m is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the parity of m must be such that m can be reduced to zero, considering that each modification can change the parity of m by 0 or 1.\n\nWait, no, because each step can choose to change the parity or not. So, for example, if m is even, can I arrange the steps so that I subtract exactly m times, thus making the parity even minus m steps (each step changes the parity). Or perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the number of 1s must be <= the number of steps, and the parity of m is such that m ≡ t mod 2, where t is the number of steps that cause a change in the parity.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWhat's the minimal condition for the string to be reducible to all 0s?\n\nEach 1 must be paired with a 0 in some way, so that when we perform the merges, they can be reduced.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 1s must be less than or equal to the number of 0s. Because each 1 needs to be combined with a 0.\n\nNo, wait. Let's think about the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n1 1 0\n\nSo, n=1, m=1, g=0.\n\nThe beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Both have exactly 1 zero and 1 one. When modified, they can become \"0\".\n\nHow? Let's see:\n\nFor \"01\": modify the last two characters (0 and 1) → replace with 0. So the string becomes \"0\". So yes.\n\nSimilarly for \"10\": modify last two (1 and 0) → replace with 0. So becomes \"0\".\n\nIn this case, m=1, which is equal to the number of steps available. Because the initial length is 2, so one step is needed. So m=1, steps=1. So t=1, which equals m.\n\nSo the condition holds.\n\nAnother sample input: 2 2 0.\n\nThe output is 4. So the beautiful strings are those that can be reduced to \"00\".\n\nLet's see: each string has 2 0s and 2 1s. How can they be reduced?\n\nFor example, \"0011\" can be modified as follows: first, combine the last two 1s → becomes 00. So after one modification, it's \"00\". So yes.\n\nSimilarly, \"1001\" can be modified by combining the last two 1s → \"100\" → then combine last two 0s → \"10\" → then combine again to get \"0\"? Wait, no. Wait, the initial string is \"1001\". Length is 4.\n\nFirst step: combine last two (0 and 1) → becomes 0. So the string becomes \"100\" (length 3). Now, the count of 1s is 2.\n\nNext step: combine last two 0s → becomes 0. String is \"10\" (length 2). Count of 1s is 1.\n\nNext step: combine 1 and 0 → becomes 0. So the string is \"0\".\n\nSo yes, it can be reduced to all 0s.\n\nWait, but in this case, m=2, and the number of steps is 3 (since initial len is 4, steps needed are 3). So t can be 2, which is less than 3.\n\nWait, but why did that work? Because we could choose two steps that subtract 1 each.\n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is that m can be achieved through any number of steps, regardless of the order, as long as the total number of 1s is reduced by t, and t is m.\n\nWait, but t is the number of steps where we choose to subtract 1. So, in order to reach zero, we must have t = m. But the number of steps available is (n + m - 1). So, m must be ≤ (n + m - 1).\n\nWhich is always true because n ≥0 and m≥0, so n + m -1 ≥ m.\n\nSo, the condition is that m can be reduced to zero, but perhaps the other constraint is that the number of 1s is such that it can be fully eliminated, possibly considering the parity.\n\nWait, perhaps the parity of m must be even if the number of steps is even, or something like that.\n\nWait, let's think about the number of steps. The number of steps is (n + m - 1). Each step can choose to subtract 1 or not.\n\nSo, the maximum number of 1s that can be subtracted is (n + m - 1). So, m must be ≤ (n + m -1), which is always true.\n\nBut the key is whether the initial number of 1s is such that it's possible to subtract exactly m times (each step subtracting 1) to reach zero.\n\nWait, but each step can choose to subtract 1 or not. So, the total number of times we choose to subtract 1 can be any value from 0 to (steps).\n\nWait, no. Because each step can contribute 0 or 1 to t. So, t can be any integer between 0 and steps.\n\nSo, to have m - t = 0 → t = m.\n\nThus, t must be equal to m, and m must be ≤ steps.\n\nWhich is always the case since steps = n + m - 1 ≥ m.\n\nSo, the condition is that m can be written as t, where t is the sum of steps where we choose to subtract 1.\n\nBut that's always possible because t can be anything up to steps.\n\nWait, that suggests that for any m, as long as m ≤ steps, the condition is satisfied. But that's not the case.\n\nWait, let's take the third sample input: n=1, m=1, g=1.\n\nSo, the initial string must have 1 zero and 1 one. The target is to reduce to all 1s.\n\nBut let's see: to get all 1s, we need to eliminate all 0s. So, the number of 0s is n=1.\n\nEach modification can affect the 0s.\n\nHow does each modification affect the count of 0s?\n\nCase 1: combine two 0s → count remains same.\n\nCase 2: combine two 1s → count remains same.\n\nCase 3: combine a 0 and 1 → count decreases by 1.\n\nSo, the count of 0s can be reduced by 1 if we choose to combine a 0 and 1.\n\nSo, in order to reduce the count of 0s to zero, we need to perform exactly n steps where we combine 0 and 1.\n\nIn this sample, n=1. So, the number of steps is (1+1-1) =1.\n\nSo, to reduce 0s to zero, we need to perform t=1 steps where we subtract 1.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nYes, because the initial string is \"01\" or \"10\".\n\nTake \"01\": perform the modification → becomes \"0\" → but that's not all 1s. Wait, that's the opposite. So, to reach all 1s, perhaps the string must be modifiable to eliminate all 0s.\n\nWait, but in this sample, the target is g=1. So, the string after modifications must be all 1s.\n\nSo, for the string \"01\", can it be modified to \"1\"?\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial string: \"01\".\n\nWe need to perform one step: combine 0 and 1 → becomes 0. So the result is \"0\", which is not all 1s.\n\nThus, it's impossible to reach all 1s.\n\nSimilarly for \"10\": same result.\n\nThus, the answer is zero.\n\nSo, in this case, m=1, which is equal to steps=1, but the target is to reach all 1s, which requires that n=1 0s are eliminated, which is possible only if the steps allow it.\n\nBut in this case, it's not possible.\n\nWait, but why? Because the initial string has exactly 1 zero. So, to eliminate it, we need to perform exactly 1 step that reduces the count of 0s by 1.\n\nBut when you perform that step, the string becomes \"0\", which is not all 1s.\n\nHmm. So, the problem isn't just about the count of 1s or 0s, but also their arrangement.\n\nThis suggests that my earlier reasoning was incomplete. It's not sufficient to have m ≤ steps; the arrangement of the bits matters as well.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is more complex and requires considering the positions of 0s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming, considering the count of 0s and 1s and the current state.\n\nWait, but given the constraints (n and m up to 105), a DP approach might be feasible.\n\nLet me think about the state variables.\n\nThe state can be represented by the current count of 0s and 1s, and the current length of the string.\n\nWait, but the length is determined by the counts: length = n_0 + n_1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the state is (a, b), where a is the current count of 0s and b is the current count of 1s, and the current length is a + b.\n\nBut we can have a transition where each step reduces the length by 1.\n\nWait, but each step depends on the current last two characters. So, the transitions are not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the string can be reduced to g's only if the count of the non-g character is zero.\n\nWait, no, because the target is a single character.\n\nWait, perhaps for the string to be reducible to all g's, the count of the opposite character must be reducible to zero, given the number of steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's say we're targeting g=0. So, the count of 1s must be reducible to zero. Similarly, if g=1, the count of 0s must be reducible to zero.\n\nEach step can reduce the count of the non-g character by 1, or leave it as is.\n\nWait, no. Because when combining two g's, the count remains the same. When combining a g and a non-g, the count of the non-g decreases by 1. When combining two non-g's, the count may remain the same or decrease by 1, depending on their combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the count of the non-g character must be reducible to zero, considering that each step can choose to subtract 1.\n\nSo, the minimal condition is that the count of non-g is ≤ the number of steps, and the parity of non-g is compatible.\n\nWait, for example, if non-g is 0 (g=1), then the count of 0s is n. We need to reduce it to zero. Each step can subtract 1 or not. So, to reach zero, n must be ≤ steps, and the parity of n must be such that n can be reduced by t steps, where t is the number of steps that subtract 1.\n\nWait, but in each step, the choice is whether to subtract 1 or not. So, the total number of times we subtract 1 can be any number from 0 to steps. So, as long as the count of non-g is ≤ steps and the count is achievable via subtraction steps, which is always possible.\n\nWait, but for example, in the third sample input: n=1, m=1, g=1. So, non-g is 0, count is 1. Steps are 1. So, 1 ≤ 1, and 1 can be subtracted once. So, why is it impossible?\n\nBecause when you subtract 1, you combine a 0 and 1, turning them into 0. So, the count of 0s decreases by 1, but the resulting string has a 0, not a 1.\n\nAh, right. So, the problem is that the process of reducing the count of non-g may not lead to all g's because the remaining part may still have non-g characters.\n\nWait, so perhaps the condition is that the count of non-g is exactly the number of steps, and that the non-g can be eliminated in the last step.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently.\n\nEach step reduces the length by 1. To reach a single character, all prior steps must have been done correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the crucial point is that the last step must eliminate the last non-g character.\n\nWait, for example, in the third sample input: the initial string has one 0 and one 1. To reach all 1s, the last step must combine the 0 and 1 into a 0, leaving a single 0. Which is not all 1s.\n\nThus, the problem is that the final step can't turn the last two into 1 unless both are 1.\n\nSo, the issue is that during the process of elimination, the order in which the steps are performed determines whether the final character is g.\n\nThus, the initial arrangement of the string is important. Not just the counts, but the positions.\n\nSo, this complicates things because now the arrangement matters.\n\nTherefore, the problem isn't just about the counts of 0s and 1s, but also their positions.\n\nHmm. So, how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the string can be reduced to a single character g if and only if the count of non-g is less than or equal to the number of steps, and the number of non-g is such that it can be paired with g in a way that allows their elimination.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: the only way to eliminate all non-g characters is to have all of them adjacent to g's in such a way that they can be combined with g's.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nWait, perhaps the necessary condition is that the number of non-g is <= the number of steps, and that the number of non-g is such that it can be completely eliminated by choosing to pair each non-g with a g in some step.\n\nBut this feels vague.\n\nWait, let's think about the process. To eliminate a non-g, it has to be paired with a g in a step. Each such step reduces the count of non-g by 1.\n\nThus, the number of steps required to eliminate all non-g is exactly equal to the count of non-g.\n\nSo, the count of non-g must be <= the number of steps.\n\nBut the number of steps is (n + m - 1).\n\nSo, for the case where g is 0, the count of non-g is m (the number of 1s). So, the condition is m <= (n + m - 1), which is always true.\n\nBut in the third sample, m=1, steps=1. So, m=1 <= 1. So, why can't it be done?\n\nBecause the last step would require that the last two characters are non-g and g, but in the third sample, after eliminating the 1, you're left with 0, which is g=1? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, in the third sample, g is 1. So, the target is to have all 1s.\n\nSo, the non-g is 0, count is 1.\n\nThus, steps is 1.\n\nSo, the step would be to combine the 0 and 1 into 0, which leaves a single 0, which is not all 1s.\n\nThus, the condition is not met because after all steps, the string is not all 1s.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition is that the count of non-g must be <= steps, and the count of non-g is such that when subtracted from the total steps, the remaining steps can be used to eliminate any remaining non-g.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem using combinatorics. Let's think about the number of ways to arrange the 0s and 1s such that the string can be reduced to all g's.\n\nBut this seems challenging due to the dependence on the arrangement.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the string can be reduced to all g's if and only if the number of non-g characters is less than or equal to the number of steps, and the number of non-g is such that it can be eliminated by pairing with g's in each step.\n\nWait, but in the third sample, non-g is 1, steps is 1. So, it should be possible, but it's not.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition is that the count of non-g must be less than or equal to the number of steps, and the count of non-g must be less than or equal to the count of g.\n\nWait, that's another angle. Because to eliminate each non-g, you need to pair it with a g.\n\nSo, the number of non-g must be ≤ the number of g.\n\nIn the third sample, non-g is 1, g is 1 (count of 0 is 1). So, 1 ≤1. So condition is met, but it's still impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that the count of non-g is ≤ (number of steps) AND the count of non-g is ≤ (count of g).\n\nBut in the third sample, both conditions are met, but it's still impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps there's another condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the count of non-g must be ≤ the count of g.\n\nBecause, each time you eliminate a non-g, you must pair it with a g.\n\nSo, for each non-g, there must be at least one g to pair it with.\n\nThus, the count of non-g must be ≤ the count of g.\n\nIn the third sample, non-g is 1, g is 1. So 1 ≤1: condition is met, but it's impossible because after pairing, you get a 0, not a 1.\n\nWait, so that suggests that this condition is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should model this as a dynamic programming problem where I track the number of 0s and 1s, and the current state of the string.\n\nBut given the problem constraints, this could be manageable.\n\nWait, the state can be (a, b), where a is the number of 0s and b is the number of 1s remaining, and the current length is a + b.\n\nBut the transitions would depend on the last two characters, which is difficult to model.\n\nAlternative idea: the order in which the modifications are applied can be considered as merging pairs from the end. So, perhaps the string can be reduced to a single character if and only if the number of non-g is ≤ the number of steps, and the number of non-g is ≤ the number of g.\n\nBut this is not sufficient, as seen in the third sample.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the string can be reduced to all g's only if the count of non-g is ≤ the count of g, and the count of non-g is ≤ (number of steps).\n\nBut again, in the third sample, both conditions are met, but it's not possible.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm missing another condition.\n\nAlternative approach: think about the minimal number of steps required to eliminate all non-g.\n\nEach non-g must be eliminated by pairing with a g.\n\nThus, the number of steps required is exactly equal to the count of non-g.\n\nBut the number of steps available is (n + m -1). So, the count of non-g must be ≤ (n + m -1).\n\nAnd also, the count of non-g must be ≤ the count of g.\n\nBecause each non-g must be paired with a g.\n\nSo, the two conditions are:\n\n1. non_g ≤ steps_available → non_g ≤ (n + m - 1)\n\n2. non_g ≤ count_g → non_g ≤ (n if g is 0 else m)\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, then the string can be reduced to all g's.\n\nElse, it cannot.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn sample 1: n=1, m=1, g=0.\n\nnon_g is m=1.\n\nsteps_available is 1+1-1=1.\n\ncount_g is n=1.\n\nSo, 1 ≤1 and 1 ≤1: condition holds. So, possible.\n\nIn sample 2: n=2, m=2, g=0.\n\nnon_g is 2.\n\nsteps_available is 3.\n\ncount_g is 2.\n\nSo, 2 ≤3 and 2 ≤2: condition holds. So, possible.\n\nIn sample 3: n=1, m=1, g=1.\n\nnon_g is 1.\n\nsteps_available is 1.\n\ncount_g is 1.\n\nSo, 1 ≤1 and 1 ≤1: condition holds. But in reality, it's not possible. So, this condition is insufficient.\n\nHmm. So, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that non_g ≤ count_g, and non_g ≤ steps_available.\n\nBut in sample 3, these conditions are met, but it's impossible.\n\nThus, there's another factor at play.\n\nWait, perhaps the last step must be a step that combines two g's, which is allowed.\n\nWait, in the third sample, the initial string is \"01\".\n\nStep 1: combine 0 and 1 → becomes 0. So, the string is \"0\", which is not all 1s.\n\nSo, the problem is that the last step reduces the string to a non-g.\n\nThus, the last step must be a step that combines two g's.\n\nSo, to ensure that the final step results in g, the last step must combine two g's.\n\nWhich means that in the penultimate step, the string must end with two g's.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be reduced to all g's only if the count of non-g is such that it can be completely eliminated before the last step, which is a step that combines two g's.\n\nThus, the number of non_g must be ≤ (steps_available - 1).\n\nBecause, the last step must combine two g's.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n1. non_g ≤ (steps_available -1)\n\n2. non_g ≤ count_g\n\nAdditionally, the steps_available must be ≥1.\n\nSo, let's test this.\n\nSample 3: non_g=1, steps_available=1.\n\nCondition 1: 1 ≤ 0 → false.\n\nThus, condition fails, so it's impossible.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample 1: non_g=1, steps_available=1.\n\nCondition 1: 1 ≤0 → false.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, sample 1 has steps_available=1. So, steps_available-1=0.\n\nCondition 1: non_g=1 ≤0 → false.\n\nBut sample 1 is possible.\n\nHmm, so this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe last step must be a step that combines two g's. So, before the last step, the string must end with two g's.\n\nThus, in the penultimate step, the string must have at least two g's at the end.\n\nWhich implies that the count of g's must be at least 2 before the last step.\n\nBut the last step reduces the count of g's by 1 (since it combines two g's into one).\n\nSo, the initial count of g's must be at least 2.\n\nWait, but in sample 1, the count of g (for g=0) is 1, which is less than 2.\n\nSo, the last step cannot be a step that combines two 0s.\n\nThus, the string can't be reduced to all 0s unless the initial count of 0s is at least 2.\n\nBut wait, sample 1's output is 2, meaning that it's possible.\n\nHmm, this suggests that this condition is not correct.\n\nWait, sample 1's initial string is \"01\" or \"10\". Let's see:\n\nAfter one modification, it becomes \"0\" for \"01\" → which is not all 0s. Wait, no, wait: in sample 1, the target is to reach all 0s. So, the initial string is \"01\". After one modification, it becomes \"0\" which is all 0s.\n\nWait, no, because the modification is combining the last two characters (0 and 1) into 0. So, the resulting string is \"0\".\n\nWait, but that is all 0s. So, the condition is satisfied.\n\nThus, the count of g (0) in the initial string is 1, but the last step can be a step that combines a 0 and 1, leading to a 0.\n\nThus, the count of g doesn't need to be at least two in the initial string.\n\nSo, the previous condition is incorrect.\n\nThus, I'm back to square one.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the only way the string can be reduced to all g's is if the count of non-g is exactly the number of steps, and the count of non-g is ≤ the count of g.\n\nBut again, this doesn't hold for sample 1.\n\nWait, sample 1: non_g is 1, steps is 1.\n\nnon_g = steps.\n\nThus, condition holds.\n\nBut the count of g is 1, which is equal to non_g.\n\nSo, the condition non_g ≤ count_g is satisfied.\n\nThus, it's possible.\n\nIn sample 3: non_g is 1, steps is 1.\n\nnon_g = steps.\n\nThus, condition holds.\n\nBut count of g is 1, so non_g ≤ count_g.\n\nThus, condition holds.\n\nBut it's not possible.\n\nThus, this condition is not sufficient.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that the count of non-g can be reduced to zero, but the way it's reduced leads to a situation where the final character is not g.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to have the count of non-g be such that it's possible to pair them all with g's in the steps, ensuring that the last step combines two g's.\n\nThus, the count of non-g must be less than or equal to (steps - 1), and the count of non-g must be ≤ count_g.\n\nBecause, to have the last step combine two g's, before that step, the string must have at least two g's. So, the count of g's after (steps - 1) steps must be at least two.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nTo have the final character be g, the last step must combine two g's. So, before the last step, the string must have at least two g's.\n\nThus, the count of g's after (steps - 1) steps must be ≥2.\n\nBut each step can affect the count of g's.\n\nWait, this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two cases: when g is 0 and when g is 1.\n\nLet me handle each case separately.\n\nCase 1: g is 0.\n\nWe need to have all 0s in the string after some modifications.\n\nEach modification can combine any two characters, but the goal is to end up with a single 0.\n\nConditions:\n\n- The number of 1s (m) must be reducible to zero.\n\nWhich requires that m ≤ steps and that m can be reduced by t steps, where t is the number of steps that subtract 1.\n\nBut as each step can choose to subtract 1 or not, m can be reduced to zero as long as m ≤ steps.\n\nBut in practice, the arrangement of the string may prevent this.\n\nWait, but perhaps the arrangement doesn't matter because you can choose which pairs to combine",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be modified to a single character `g` using a series of operations. Each operation reduces the string length by one by combining two characters into one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A beautiful string consists of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones.\n   - We can modify the string by combining the last two characters into one, which can either be 0 or 1 based on the characters being combined.\n   - The goal is to determine if we can reduce the string to a single character `g` (either all 0s or all 1s).\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - For the string to be reducible to all 0s, the number of 1s (`m`) must be reducible to zero through modifications.\n   - Similarly, for the string to be reducible to all 1s, the number of 0s (`n`) must be reducible to zero.\n   - Each modification can change the count of 1s or 0s, so we need to consider the parity and the possible reduction steps.\n\n3. **Conditions**:\n   - If `g` is 0, the number of 1s (`m`) must be reducible to zero. This requires that `m` is less than or equal to the number of steps available and that `m` can be paired with 0s in such a way that all 1s are eliminated.\n   - If `g` is 1, the number of 0s (`n`) must be reducible to zero. This requires similar conditions as above.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming**:\n   - Use dynamic programming to count valid strings based on the counts of 0s and 1s, ensuring that the necessary conditions for reduction are met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif g == 0:\n    non_g_count = m\nelse:\n    non_g_count = n\n\nsteps = n + m - 1\n\nif non_g_count > steps or non_g_count > (n + m - g):\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    ways = 0\n    # We need to choose positions for the non-g characters such that they can be eliminated before the last step\n    # The last step must combine two g's\n    # So, the number of non-g must be <= steps - 1 and <= (g_count)\n    # Wait, but this might not capture all cases.
