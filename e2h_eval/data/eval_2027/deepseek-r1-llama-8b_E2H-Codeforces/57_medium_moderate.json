His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have in an Olympiad based on his total points. The teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x points. The input gives us two lists: one for the first tour scores and another for the second tour, but they're not sorted or linked to specific participants. Our task is to determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could achieve.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem: each participant has a score from the first tour and a score from the second tour. The sum of these two determines their rank. If two people have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order, which affects the rank. So, for the best rank, we want as few people as possible to have a higher sum than Vasya's. For the worst rank, we want as many people as possible to have a higher sum.\n\nWait, but since the jury can assign places when sums are equal, the best rank is 1 if Vasya's sum is the maximum. But sometimes, even if it's not the maximum, he might be considered first if others with the same sum are arranged after him. Similarly, for the worst case, he can be placed last among those with higher sums.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let's break it down.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate all possible pairs (a_i + b_j) where i and j are such that a_i is from the first list, and b_j is from the second. But wait, no—each participant is represented by one a and one b, but the lists are given in arbitrary order. So for each possible participant, their a and b are in some permutation.\n\nWait, no. The second line is the first tour points, and the third line is the second tour points. Each participant has exactly one point from each line, but the order is unknown. So, the actual a and b for each participant are a pairing between the two lists, but the way they are paired is unknown.\n\nBut in the problem statement, Vasya is present as one of the participants, so there exists i and j such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\nHmm. So, the key is that the pairing of a's and b's is a permutation. So, for each possible permutation of the b's to the a's, we can compute the total points for each participant, then sort them to find Vasya's position.\n\nBut n can be up to 105, so trying all permutations is impossible. That's 105! possibilities, which is way too big.\n\nSo, brute-forcing all permutations isn't feasible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of considering all possible pairings, we can model the problem differently. Because the order of a's and b's are given, but the way they are matched is arbitrary. So, for any participant, their total is a certain a plus a certain b, but the a and b come from different lists.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the a's and b's are given in arbitrary order. So, for each participant, their a is some element from the a_list, and their b is some element from the b_list, but each a and each b is used exactly once.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all possible ways to match a's and b's into pairs, such that each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa. Then, for each such pairing, compute the total for each participant (a_i + b_j), sort them, and determine Vasya's possible best and worst positions.\n\nBut again, with n=105, enumerating all possible pairings is impossible. So, we need a different approach.\n\nWait, but what defines Vasya's total? It's a_i + b_j, for some i and j. So, for any pairing, Vasya's total is fixed as a_i + b_j, but in different pairings, i and j could be different.\n\nBut our goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks across all possible pairings.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model the best and worst possible ranks without considering all pairings. How?\n\nFor the best possible rank, we want as few participants as possible to have a higher total than Vasya. So, to minimize the number of participants with a higher total.\n\nTo achieve this, in the best case, Vasya's total is as high as possible, and all other participants' totals are as low as possible.\n\nWait, but the way a's and b's are paired affects the participants' totals. So, perhaps for the best case, we should pair the largest a's with the largest b's, but that might not always be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's total is the maximum possible, given that the sum is at least x. Because if Vasya's total is as large as possible, it's more likely that others have lower totals.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we want Vasya's total to be as small as possible, but still at least x. Because then, as many participants as possible will have higher totals.\n\nSo, let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. For each participant, compute all possible a_i + b_j, ensuring that each a and b is used exactly once. But this is computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe best possible rank for Vasya is 1. To check if this is possible, we can see if there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum possible, and all others have less or equal. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum for Vasya is achieved when we take the maximum a and maximum b. But since a and b are separate lists, the maximum a could be paired with the maximum b, giving a total of a_max + b_max.\n\nBut then, other participants could have sums that are as low as possible. So, in this scenario, Vasya's sum is the maximum, so he is first.\n\nBut is this possible? Because in some cases, the a's and b's may not allow this. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is at least x. So, in the best case, he can be first.\n\nWait, maybe not always. Suppose in the a_list, the maximum a is 10, and in the b_list, the maximum b is 10. So, Vasya's sum can be 20. But other participants may also have high sums.\n\nWait, no. Because the other participants' a and b would be from the remaining a's and b's. So, for example, if a_list is [10, 5] and b_list is [10, 5], then Vasya can have 10+10=20, and the other has 5+5=10. So, Vasya is first.\n\nIn that case, yes. So, perhaps the best possible rank is 1. But is this always possible?\n\nWait, no. Suppose that Vasya's a_i is not the maximum. For example, a_list is [3, 5], and b_list is [7, 2]. So, possible pairings:\n\nCase 1: a=3 paired with b=7 (sum 10), a=5 paired with b=2 (sum 7). So, Vasya's sum is 10, which is the maximum. So, he is first.\n\nCase 2: a=5 paired with b=7 (sum 12), a=3 paired with b=2 (sum 5). Again, Vasya can have sum 12, which is the maximum.\n\nWait, so regardless of how you pair, if Vasya's a is 5 and b is 7, then he has the maximum sum.\n\nSo, perhaps, the best possible rank is always 1, provided that Vasya's a and b can be paired such that their sum is the maximum possible.\n\nBut wait, suppose that in the a_list and b_list, the maximum a and maximum b are not both available. Like, suppose a_list is [10, 1], and b_list is [9, 2]. Then, the maximum a is 10, maximum b is 9. So, if Vasya's a is 10 and b is 9, sum is 19. Another participant could have a=1 and b=2, sum 3. So, Vasya is first.\n\nBut what if Vasya's a is 1 and b is 9? Then, sum is 10. The other participant has a=10 and b=2, sum 12. So, Vasya is second. So, in that case, the best possible rank is 2, not 1.\n\nAh, right. So, the best possible rank depends on whether Vasya can get the maximum possible sum. So, perhaps for the best rank, we need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, and then count how many participants can have a sum greater than or equal to that.\n\nWait, but in the above example, if Vasya's a is 10 and b is 9, he can have the maximum sum of 19. So, best rank is 1. But if he is forced to pair a=1 with b=9, then his sum is 10, which is less than 12, so best rank is 2.\n\nSo, the question is: what is the maximum sum Vasya can have across all possible pairings. And then, in the best case, he can have that sum, making his rank as good as possible.\n\nSo, for the best rank, we can compute the maximum possible sum Vasya can have, given that it's >=x, and then see how many participants can have a sum >= that maximum. Then, the best possible rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum > max_vasya_sum).\n\nWait, no. Because if there are multiple participants with sum equal to max_vasya_sum, the jury can arrange them in any order, so Vasya could be first.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the maximum sum Vasya can have is determined by choosing the maximum a_i and maximum b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, but wait: for the best case, we want to maximize Vasya's sum. So, he should have a_i + b_j as large as possible, while ensuring that the sum is >=x.\n\nSo, the maximum possible sum is the maximum of (a_i + b_j) for all possible i,j where a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, no, because it's not just any i and j. They must form a valid pairing, meaning that each a is used exactly once and each b is used exactly once.\n\nSo, the maximum sum Vasya can have is when he takes the maximum possible a plus the maximum possible b, as long as that sum is >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the maximum a plus the maximum b. Because if we can pair those two, then Vasya's sum is a_max + b_max. Then, in that case, the other participants' sums would be a_max - something plus b_max - something else, but possibly lower.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the maximum sum is a_max + b_max, provided that a_max + b_max >=x. Because then, Vasya can be first.\n\nBut wait, suppose a_max is 10 and b_max is 10. So, sum is 20. All other participants have a's <=10 and b's <=10, so their sums are <=20. So, Vasya is first.\n\nBut if a_max is 10, b_max is 8, and another a is 9 and another b is 9. So, pairing a_max (10) with b_max (8) gives 18, but pairing a_max with b_second (9) gives 19, which is better. So, in that case, the maximum sum for Vasya is 19.\n\nWait, but in that case, other participants can have a=9 and b=9, sum 18, which is less than 19. So, Vasya is first.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best possible sum is the maximum possible a + b, such that a is in a_list, b is in b_list, and a + b >=x.\n\nBut how do I find the maximum possible sum for Vasya, given that the a's and b's are paired.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the maximum a plus maximum b. Because regardless of how others are paired, if Vasya can get the maximum a and maximum b, then his sum is the highest possible.\n\nBut wait, perhaps not. Because pairing a_max with b_max may leave other a's and b's that can form higher sums. For example:\n\nSuppose a_list is [10, 9], b_list is [9, 10]. So, a_max is 10, b_max is 10. Sum is 20.\n\nIf Vasya is paired as a_max + b_max (20), then others have 9+9=18, which is less. So, best rank is 1.\n\nBut what if a_list is [10, 8], b_list is [10, 9]. Then, pairing a_max (10) with b_max (10) gives sum 20. The other participant has 8+9=17. So, Vasya is first.\n\nSo, in that case, yes.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum possible sum is a_max + b_max, as long as it's >=x. Otherwise, perhaps the next best option is a_max + b_second_max, etc.\n\nBut wait, what if a_max + b_max is less than x? Then, Vasya cannot have that sum because it's below x. So, in that case, we need to find the next best pair a_i + b_j that's >=x and as large as possible.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the steps would be:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i is from a_list, b_j is from b_list, and a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n2. Among these pairs, find the maximum sum S.\n\n3. Then, in the best case, Vasya's sum is S. Now, to find how many participants can have a sum >= S, and arrange the rest so that Vasya is first.\n\nWait, but how do I find the maximum possible S that Vasya can have, considering that each a and b can be used only once.\n\nBecause when choosing S, the a and b used for S are no longer available for others.\n\nSo, the maximum S is the maximum possible a_i + b_j, under the constraint that the pairing is such that exactly one a and one b is used per participant.\n\nSo, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum a_i + b_j, such that a_i and b_j are in the lists, and a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, but this is not necessarily true. Because if the a and b are paired with others, then Vasya might not be able to get the maximum a and b.\n\nBut for the best case, we can choose any pairing that allows Vasya to have the maximum possible sum. So, perhaps the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum a_i + b_j, where a_i is from a_list, b_j is from b_list, and a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nBecause in that pairing, Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j, and others have smaller sums.\n\nWait, but that's assuming that the other a's and b's are paired in a way that their sums are as small as possible. So, in the best case, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, which is a_max + b_max, provided that this sum is >=x.\n\nBut if a_max + b_max <x, then Vasya needs to have a sum that is >=x, which may require pairing a_max with a b_j that's larger than the current a_max's b.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute all possible a_i + b_j where a_i is in a_list, b_j is in b_list, and a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nThen, find the maximum sum S among these. Then, the best possible rank is 1, because Vasya can have S as his sum, and all others can have sums <= S.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because when you pair a_i and b_j for S, the other a's and b's may be paired in a way that someone else has a sum equal to S.\n\nFor example, suppose a_list = [5,5], b_list = [5,5]. x is 10.\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nVasya could have 5+5=10, others 5+5=10. So, in this case, Vasya can be first, but others could also be first.\n\nBut the problem says that the rank is determined by the jury. So, in this case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, regardless of whether others have the same sum, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the maximum possible sum is the maximum S such that S >=x, and Vasya can achieve S in some pairing.\n\nThus, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but what if a_max + b_max is less than x? Then, Vasya cannot have a sum S = a_max + b_max because it's less than x. So, in that case, he must have a sum >=x, which is possible as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, but the problem says it's guaranteed that there exists a pairing where the sum is >=x. So, in any case, Vasya can have a sum >=x.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the maximum possible sum S is the maximum a_i + b_j where a_i is in a_list, b_j is in b_list, and a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nAnd in this case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nEach participant has 2 points. So, all have sum 2.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=6, x=2\n\na_list:4 3 5 6 4 4\n\nb_list:8 6 0 4 3 4\n\nWe need to find the best and worst possible ranks.\n\nIn the best case, Vasya can have sum 12 (5+7?), but looking at the note:\n\nIn the note, the best case is 12, which is 6 + 6 (from a and b lists?), but the pairing is such that a=4 is paired with 8, a=6 with 4, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum is 5+7=12, but in the a_list, there's a 5 and a 6, and in the b_list, 8,6, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the maximum sum S is the maximum a_i + b_j where a_i is from a_list, b_j is from b_list, and a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nThen, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nNow, for the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimum possible sum S that Vasya can have, such that S >=x. Then, the worst rank is the number of participants who have a sum greater than S, plus 1.\n\nWait, because in the worst case, Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and as many participants as possible have a higher sum.\n\nSo, the steps for worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimum possible sum S that Vasya can have, such that S >=x.\n\n2. Then, count how many participants have a sum > S.\n\n3. The worst possible rank is (count) + 1.\n\nWait, but how do I find this minimal S?\n\nBecause the pairing affects which a and b are used for Vasya.\n\nSo, for the worst case, we want to minimize Vasya's sum, but it must be >=x.\n\nTo minimize S, we need to pair Vasya with the smallest possible a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can pair Vasya's a_i and b_j such that their sum is as small as possible, but >=x.\n\nBut then, the other a's and b's can be paired in a way that maximizes their sums, thus increasing the number of participants with sum > S.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For the worst possible rank, find the minimal S >=x such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is S, and as many others as possible have sums > S.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, the minimal S is the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nSo, for each a_i in a_list, and b_j in b_list, compute a_i + b_j. If it's >=x, then this could be a candidate for S.\n\nBut then, for each possible a_i and b_j where a_i + b_j >=x, we need to see if it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's in such a way that the maximum possible sums are created.\n\nSo, for each possible (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x, we can compute the minimal S as a_i + b_j, and then compute how many participants can have sums > S.\n\nBut how to efficiently compute this?\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe worst possible rank is determined by the minimal possible S that Vasya can have, given that S >=x. Then, the worst rank is the number of participants who can have sums > S, plus one.\n\nSo, the minimal S is the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because, perhaps, if Vasya can have a sum S, but another participant can have a sum higher than S, even when S is the minimal possible.\n\nWait, but the minimal S is the smallest possible sum that Vasya can have (>=x). So, if that's the case, then as many participants as possible can have sums higher than S.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is the number of participants (including Vasya) whose sum is > S, plus one.\n\nWait, but no. Because in the worst case, Vasya's sum is S, and all other participants have sums >S. So, Vasya is the last one.\n\nWait, but if other participants have sums equal to S, then the jury can place them after Vasya, so he could be first.\n\nSo, to maximize his rank, we need to have as many participants as possible with sums > S.\n\nSo, for the worst case, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal S >=x that Vasya can have.\n\n2. Then, for all possible pairings, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S.\n\n3. The worst possible rank is that number plus one.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAn alternative idea: for the worst case, we can pair Vasya with the smallest possible a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that creates as many high sums as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm. Perhaps, for each possible (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x, compute S = a_i + b_j, and then compute how many other participants can have sums greater than S.\n\nThe worst possible rank would be the maximum possible count over all possible S of (number of participants with sum > S).\n\nSo, for each possible (i,j):\n\n- Compute S = a_i + b_j.\n\n- Then, create a new a_list and b_list, excluding a_i and b_j.\n\n- Pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum > S.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWell, to maximize the number of participants with sum > S, we should pair a's and b's in descending order.\n\nSo, for the remaining a's and b's, sort a's in descending order, sort b's in descending order, and pair them in order.\n\nThen, for each pair (a_k, b_l), compute a_k + b_l. Count how many of these sums are > S.\n\nThis would give us the maximum possible participants with sum > S for that particular S.\n\nThen, the worst possible rank is (max_count) + 1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor all possible (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x:\n\n   S = a_i + b_j\n\n   create a list of a's without a_i, and b's without b_j.\n\n   sort a's in descending order.\n\n   sort b's in descending order.\n\n   for k in 0..len(a)-1:\n\n      sum = a[k] + b[k]\n\n      if sum > S:\n\n          count +=1\n\n   keep track of the maximum count across all (i,j)\n\nThen, the worst possible rank is (max_count) + 1.\n\nWait, but what if after pairing, some a's and b's are left unpaired? No, because n is the number of participants, and each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nWait, but in the code, when we exclude a_i and b_j, the remaining a's and b's have len(a) -1 = len(b) -1, so they can be paired.\n\nSo, for each (i,j), the remaining a's and b's are len(a)-1 and len(b)-1, which are equal, so they can be completely paired.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nLoop through all possible (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nFor each, calculate S.\n\nThen, pair the remaining a's and b's in descending order, and count how many of their sums are > S.\n\nThe maximum of these counts across all (i,j) is the worst possible rank minus one.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is (max_count + 1).\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5, x=2\n\na_list: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb_list: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo, for each (i,j), S = 2.\n\nThen, the remaining a's and b's are 4 each.\n\nPairing them as 1+1=2.\n\nSo, for each (i,j), the count is 0, because 2 is not > 2.\n\nSo, the maximum count is 0. So, the worst possible rank is 0+1=1.\n\nBut the sample output shows the worst rank is 5.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, in the first sample, all participants have sum 2. So, in any pairing, Vasya can have sum 2. The worst possible rank is 5, because all participants are tied, and the jury can arrange them in any order, so Vasya could be last.\n\nSo, according to our approach, for each (i,j), S=2, and the remaining a's and b's are 4 each, each pair sums to 2. So, 4 participants have sum 2, which is not >2. So, count is 0. So, the worst possible rank is 1.\n\nBut the sample expects 5.\n\nSo, something is wrong with our approach.\n\nAh, I see. Because when all participants have sum 2, including Vasya, the worst possible rank is 5. But according to our method, the count is 0, leading to a worst rank of 1.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nWhat's the issue here?\n\nBecause, when all participants have sum 2, then in the worst case, Vasya can be placed last. So, the count is 4 participants with sum > S (where S is 2), but no, because their sum is 2, which is not > S.\n\nWait, so in that case, the count is zero.\n\nSo, the method returns 1, but the correct answer is 5.\n\nSo, the approach is missing something.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the method is not considering that when S is 2, all other participants' sums are 2 as well. So, in that case, the count is 4, but none of them have sum > S.\n\nWait, no. Because S is 2, and the others also have sum 2, which is not greater than S.\n\nSo, the count is 4, but none have sum > S. So, the number of participants with sum > S is zero.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is 0 + 1 =1.\n\nBut that's not correct, as the sample shows.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. What's the problem?\n\nI think the mistake is in assuming that the worst rank is determined by the number of participants with sum > S. But when all participants have sum equal to S, the worst possible rank is n, because the jury can arrange them in any order.\n\nSo, in that case, the worst possible rank is n.\n\nThus, the approach needs to account for this scenario.\n\nSo, the revised plan is:\n\nFor each possible S (the sum Vasya can have >=x), compute:\n\n- the number of participants with sum > S.\n\n- plus the number of participants (including Vasya) with sum == S.\n\nWait, no. Because the worst possible rank is determined by the number of participants with sum > S plus the number of participants with sum == S that are placed before Vasya.\n\nBut the problem states that if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order. So, in the worst case, Vasya is placed last among those with sum == S.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is:\n\nnumber_of_participants_with_sum > S + (number_of_participants_with_sum == S) \n\nBecause, in the worst case, all participants with sum == S are placed after Vasya, which is not possible. Wait, no. Wait, if Vasya's sum is S, then the participants with sum > S are definitely before him. For the participants with sum == S, the jury can arrange them in any order, so in the worst case, Vasya is placed last among those with sum == S.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because the jury can arrange them in any way. So, in the worst case for Vasya, all participants with sum > S are before him, and all participants with sum == S are also before him.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is (number of participants with sum > S) + (number of participants with sum == S).\n\nBut wait, that can't be because the total participants is n.\n\nNo, because in the worst case, all participants with sum > S are before him, and all with sum == S are also before him.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is (number_of_participants_with_sum > S) + (number_of_participants_with_sum == S).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is the maximum between:\n\n1. The number of participants with sum > S.\n\n2. The number of participants with sum > S plus the number of participants with sum == S.\n\nBecause, in the worst case, all participants with sum > S are before him, and all with sum == S are also before him.\n\nBut that depends on how many participants are in each category.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > S plus the number of participants with sum == S, because all of them can be arranged to be before Vasya.\n\nBut this can't exceed n.\n\nSo, in the first sample, when all have sum 2, then for S=2:\n\nnumber_of_participants_with_sum > S is 0.\n\nnumber_of_participants_with_sum == S is 5 (including Vasya).\n\nSo, worst rank is 0 +5=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each possible S (Vasya's sum, >=x), compute:\n\ncount_higher = number of participants (excluding Vasya) with sum > S.\n\ncount_equal = number of participants (excluding Vasya) with sum == S.\n\nThen, the worst possible rank is count_higher + count_equal + 1 (for Vasya himself).\n\nWait, because count_higher are before him, count_equal are also before him, and he is last.\n\nSo, total is count_higher + count_equal +1.\n\nBut this is only applicable if count_higher + count_equal +1 <=n.\n\nBut n is the total participants, so it's okay.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each possible (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x:\n\n   a. Compute S = a_i + b_j.\n\n   b. Create the remaining a's and b's.\n\n   c. Pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that maximizes the number of sums > S.\n\n      i. Sort a's in descending order.\n\n      ii. Sort b's in descending order.\n\n      iii. Pair them in order.\n\n   d. For each pair, compute sum and count how many are >S.\n\n   e. Also, for each pair, compute how many are ==S.\n\n   f. The total count is (count_higher + count_equal).\n\n   g. The worst possible rank for this (i,j) is (count_higher + count_equal) +1.\n\n2. Among all possible (i,j), find the maximum of (count_higher + count_equal +1).\n\nThat will be the worst possible rank.\n\nSo, now the plan is:\n\nFor each (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x:\n\n   S = a_i + b_j\n\n   create a_new = a_list without a_i\n\n   create b_new = b_list without b_j\n\n   sort a_new in descending order.\n\n   sort b_new in descending order.\n\n   count = 0\n\n   for k in 0 to len(a_new)-1:\n\n       sum_k = a_new[k] + b_new[k]\n\n       if sum_k > S:\n\n           count +=1\n\n   So, count is the number of participants with sum > S (excluding Vasya).\n\n   Also, for the remaining a's and b's, after pairing all, how many have sum == S.\n\n   Wait, no. Because after pairing, all participants are accounted for.\n\n   So, during the pairing, any pair that sums to S will contribute to count_equal.\n\n   So, during the pairing step, for each pair, if sum_k == S, then count_equal increases by 1.\n\n   So, in code, for each (i,j):\n\n       S = a_i + b_j\n\n       a_rest = a_list without a_i\n\n       b_rest = b_list without b_j\n\n       a_rest.sort(reverse=True)\n\n       b_rest.sort(reverse=True)\n\n       count_higher = 0\n\n       count_equal = 0\n\n       for k in range(len(a_rest)):\n\n           sum_k = a_rest[k] + b_rest[k]\n\n           if sum_k > S:\n\n               count_higher +=1\n\n           elif sum_k == S:\n\n               count_equal +=1\n\n       # Now, the participants are Vasya (S), count_higher (sum >S), count_equal (sum==S)\n\n       # So, the worst possible rank is count_higher + count_equal + 1\n\n       current_rank = count_higher + count_equal +1\n\n       max_rank = max(max_rank, current_rank)\n\n   So, after checking all (i,j), the max_rank is the worst possible rank.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to compute for each possible (i,j) the current_rank as count_higher + count_equal +1, and take the maximum over all (i,j).\n\nNow, let's test this with the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na_list: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb_list: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nFor each (i,j):\n\nS=2.\n\na_rest: 4 elements of 1.\n\nb_rest: 4 elements of 1.\n\nAfter pairing, each pair sums to 2.\n\nSo, for each k:\n\nsum_k=2 ==S.\n\nThus, count_higher=0, count_equal=4.\n\ncurrent_rank=0+4 +1=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: sample 2.\n\nIn the sample, the best case is 1, worst is 5.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nSo, for some (i,j), the current_rank would be 5.\n\nSo, the approach should correctly capture that.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nImplement the above logic.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently, given that n can be up to 105.\n\nConstraints:\n\nn can be up to 105, and for each (i,j) pair, we need to process O(n) steps.\n\nSo, for n=105, the number of (i,j) pairs is 105*105=11,025.\n\nEach processing involves O(105) steps.\n\nSo, 11,025 * 105 = around 1e6 operations, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nRead a_list and b_list.\n\nCheck that a_list and b_list are lists of integers.\n\nNow, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for each j in 0..n-1:\n\n       if a_list[i] + b_list[j] >=x:\n\n           S = a_list[i] + b_list[j]\n\n           a_rest = a_list without a_list[i]\n\n           b_rest = b_list without",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given in arbitrary order, and the teacher knows that Vasya's total points are at least x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each participant has scores from two tours. The sum of these scores determines their rank. If sums are equal, participants can be ranked arbitrarily by the jury. We need to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya.\n\n2. **Best Possible Rank**: To achieve the best rank, Vasya should have the highest possible sum. This is determined by pairing the maximum possible scores from both tours, ensuring the sum is at least x. Thus, Vasya can always achieve the best rank of 1 if he can have the maximum possible sum.\n\n3. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst rank, we consider the minimum possible sum Vasya can have while still being at least x. We then count how many participants can have a higher sum than this minimum, leading to the worst possible rank.\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each possible pair (i, j) where the sum of scores from the two tours is at least x, compute the sum S.\n   - For each valid pair, simulate the remaining scores and count how many participants can have sums greater than S.\n   - Track the maximum count across all pairs to determine the worst possible rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nbest_rank = 1\nworst_rank = n\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if a[i] + b[j] >= x:\n            # Consider this as Vasya's sum S\n            S = a[i] + b[j]\n            \n            # Create the remaining a and b lists\n            a_rest = a[:i] + a[i+1:]\n            b_rest = b[:j] + b[j+1:]\n            \n            # Sort the remaining a and b in descending order\n            a_rest_sorted = sorted(a_rest, reverse=True)\n            b_rest_sorted = sorted(b_rest, reverse=True)\n            \n            count_higher = 0\n            count_equal = 0\n            \n            for k in range(len(a_rest_sorted)):\n                sum_k = a_rest_sorted[k] + b_rest_sorted[k]\n                if sum_k > S:\n                    count_higher += 1\n                elif sum_k == S:\n                    count_equal += 1\n            \n            current_worst = count_higher + count_equal + 1\n            if current_worst > worst_rank:\n                worst_rank = current_worst\n\nprint(best_rank, worst_rank)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of participants, the minimum score Vasya has, and the scores from the two tours.\n- **Iterating Over Pairs**: For each possible pair of scores from the two tours, we check if their sum is at least x.\n- **Simulating Remaining Scores**: For each valid pair, we simulate the remaining scores and sort them to maximize the number of participants with higher sums.\n- **Counting Higher and Equal Sums**: We count how many participants can have sums higher than or equal to Vasya's sum, determining the worst possible rank.\n- **Output**: The best rank is always 1, and the worst rank is determined by the maximum count of participants who can have higher sums than Vasya's minimum possible sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the best and worst possible ranks by leveraging sorting and iteration over possible score pairs.",
