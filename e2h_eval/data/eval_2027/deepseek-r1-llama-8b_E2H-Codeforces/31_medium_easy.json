Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But he can't find some, so we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. The input gives us n, the number of found cards, and x, the maximum absolute value any card can have. Then there's a list of n integers which are the numbers on the found cards. The goal is to find the smallest number of missing cards (each with an integer between -x and x) that, when added, make the total sum zero.\n\nSo, what's the approach here?\n\nFirst, I think we need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that S. We want to add some cards such that the new sum becomes zero. So the sum of the added cards must be equal to -S. \n\nBut each added card can contribute at most x towards this sum. Because each card's value is between -x and x, inclusive.\n\nWait, no. Each added card can contribute up to x in absolute value. So for example, if you add a card with value x, it contributes +x; if you add one with value -x, it contributes -x. So the maximum positive contribution per card is x, and the maximum negative is -x.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards required would depend on how much we need to adjust the sum.\n\nLet me think: the current sum is S. We need to reach 0, so the required sum from the added cards is -S. Let's denote required = -S.\n\nIf required is zero, then we don't need any additional cards.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the minimal number of cards whose values sum to required, and each value is between -x and x.\n\nWait, but since we're adding cards, their values can be anything in that range, right? So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal k such that required can be expressed as a sum of k integers, each between -x and x.\n\nBut wait, the sum of those k integers should be exactly required. And we need the minimal k possible.\n\nSo, the question is: given a target sum T (which is required), what is the smallest number of terms (k) where each term is between -x and x, inclusive, such that the sum of these terms equals T.\n\nWhat's the minimal k for that?\n\nLet me see. So T could be positive or negative. Let's assume T is positive for now.\n\nThe maximum possible sum per card is x. So, the minimal number of cards needed is ceil(T / x). Because each card can contribute up to x towards the sum.\n\nWait, but what if T is not divisible by x? For example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then 5/2 is 2.5, so we'd need 3 cards: 2 + 2 +1.\n\nWait, but 2+2+1 sums to 5, but 1 is allowed because it's within the x limit.\n\nWait, but in our case, the added cards can be any value between -x and x. So for each added card, its value can be as high as x or as low as -x.\n\nSo, for a positive T, the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x), because each card can contribute up to x. Similarly, for a negative T, the minimal number is ceil(abs(T)/x). Because each card can contribute at least -x towards the sum.\n\nWait, let's think with examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 3 2\nCards: -1, 1, 2 → sum is (-1)+(1)+(2) = 2.\nSo required is -2.\n\nSo the minimal k is 1, because we can add a -2 card. Which is allowed because |-2| ≤ 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 2 3\nCards: -2, -2 → sum is -4.\nRequired is 4.\n\nWe need to find the minimal k such that 4 can be achieved with k cards, each contributing at most 3.\n\n4 divided by 3 is 1.333, so ceil(4/3) is 2. So two cards: 3 +1, which sum to 4. Or 2+2, etc.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nAnother example: Suppose T is 5 and x is 2. Then 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2*2=4 is less than 5. So 2+2+1=5.\n\nWait, but 1 is less than 2, so that's allowed.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nWait, but what if T is negative?\n\nSay T is -5 and x is 2. Then the minimal k is 3, because each card can contribute at most -2. So, -2 *3 =-6, which is less than -5. Wait, but that's not correct. Because the sum of three -2s is -6, which is less than -5. So that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me restate the problem.\n\nWe need the sum of the added cards to be exactly T. So for a negative T, each card can contribute at most -x (but they can also contribute higher, like -x+1, etc.)\n\nSo for T = -5, x=2. We need the sum of the added cards to be -5.\n\nEach card can contribute a maximum of -2 (so, each card is at least -x, but can be any in between).\n\nSo how many cards do we need to get a sum of -5.\n\nWe can model this as finding the minimal k such that:\n\nsum_{i=1}^k a_i = T, where each a_i is in [-x, x].\n\nWe need to minimize k.\n\nSo for T positive, each a_i can be up to x. So the minimal k is ceil(T/x).\n\nFor T negative, each a_i can be as low as -x. So the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nCase 1: T=5, x=2 → 5/2 = 2.5 → ceil is 3.\n\nWhich works because 2+2+1=5.\n\nCase 2: T=-5, x=2 → |T|=5 → 5/2=2.5 → ceil is 3.\n\nSo the sum of three cards: each can be -2, but that's -6, which is too low. But wait, maybe we can have some cards with higher values.\n\nWait, for T=-5, the sum of three cards is -5.\n\nEach card can be as high as -2, but we can have some cards being more than -2, like -1. So let's see: -2 + (-2) + (-1) =-5. So yes, that's possible. So with three cards, it's achievable.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nAnother example: T=7, x=3. So 7/3 is about 2.333, so ceil is 3. 3*3=9, which is larger than 7. So 3 cards can sum to 7: 3+3+1, but wait, 1 is less than 3, but allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 3+2+2=7.\n\nYes, so 3 cards.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nCompute the sum S of the found cards.\n\nCompute required = -S.\n\nIf required is zero, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal k as the ceiling of |required| / x.\n\nWait, no: wait, for required positive, it's required / x, rounded up.\n\nSimilarly for required negative, it's |required| / x, rounded up.\n\nSo in code, regardless of the sign of required, the minimal k is ceil(abs(required) / x).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. What if required is 6 and x is 2. Then 6/2=3 → k=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat if required is 4 and x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333 → ceil is 2. So 3+1=4. Yes.\n\nSo yeah, the formula is:\n\nk = ceil( |T| / x )\n\nwhere T is the required sum.\n\nBut wait, wait. What if T is zero? Then we don't need any cards, right.\n\nSo the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n\n2. Compute T = -S.\n\n3. If T is zero, output 0.\n\n4. Else, compute k = ceil( |T| / x )\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, the question is, how to handle the input.\n\nThe input is given as two lines: first line has n and x, second line has n space-separated integers.\n\nSo in Python, I can read the input as follows.\n\nRead the first line, split into n and x. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute S = sum of those integers.\n\nThen compute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute k as the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nBut wait, how to compute the ceiling in Python?\n\nWell, for a positive number, ceiling(a/b) can be computed as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for example, 5/2 is 2.5 → 5+2-1=6 → 6//2=3.\n\nSimilarly, 4/3=1.333 → 4+3-1=6 →6//3=2.\n\nSo yes, for a positive numerator, that works.\n\nSo in code:\n\nabs_T = abs(T)\nk = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\nSo that gives us the minimal k.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S = (-1+1+2)=2 → T=-2.\n\nabs_T=2 → 2+2-1=3 → 3//2=1 → k=1.\n\nOutput 1.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4 → T=4.\n\nabs_T=4 → 4+3-1=6 →6//3=2 → k=2.\n\nOutput 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card is 3.\n\nSum S=3 → T=-3.\n\nabs_T=3 → (3+5-1)//5 →7//5=1.\n\nSo one card with -3 is needed.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=3, card is 3.\n\nSum S=3 → T=-3.\n\nabs_T=3 → (3+3-1)/3=5/3=1 → k=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=0? Wait, no, the constraints say n>=1.\n\nWait, the input says n is at least 1.\n\nSo no, n is at least 1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of integers.\n\nCompute S = sum.\n\nT = -S.\n\nif T ==0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\nabs_T = abs(T)\n\nk = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\nprint(k)\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nTesting edge cases.\n\nCase where sum is zero: n=3, x=2, cards are 1, -1, 0 → sum is 0. So output is 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 10, x=3.\n\n10/3 is 3.333 → ceil is 4. So 3+3+3+1=10. So 4 cards.\n\nAnother case: sum is -7, x=2.\n\nabs(7) is 7 → (7+2-1)/2=8//2=4.\n\nSo four cards, each can be -2: sum is -8, which is less than -7. But that's not allowed. Wait, wait, no—wait, the sum of the added cards must be exactly -7.\n\nSo 4 cards sum to -7.\n\nEach can be up to -2.\n\nWait, -2 *4 = -8. That's less than -7. So we need some cards to be more than -2.\n\nLike, three -2 and one -1: sum is -7.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo with four cards.\n\nSo the code correctly computes k=4.\n\nSo I think the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code must read from standard input, and output to standard output.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the input is provided as two lines: first line is n and x, second line is the list of numbers.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nS = sum(cards)\n\nT = -S\n\nif T == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n\n    k = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the first example is presented as ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2'], but in reality, the input is two lines. So the code should read the first line as n and x, then the second line as the list.\n\nSo the code above is correct.\n\nTesting with sample input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2 → T=-2.\n\nabs_T=2 → (2+2-1)/2=3/2=1 → print 1.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2 3 → sum is -4 → T=4.\n\nabs_T=4 → (4+3-1)/3=6//3=2 → print 2.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card is 3 → sum 3 → T=-3.\n\nk= (3+5-1)/5=7/5=1 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=1, card is 1 → sum 1 → T=-1 → k=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=5 → cards are 5 and 5 → sum 10 → T=-10.\n\nk= (10 +5-1)/5=14//5=2.8 → no, wait, 14//5 is 2. Wait, no:\n\nWait 10 +5-1=14, 14//5 is 2. So k=2.\n\nBut 5+5 is 10, which is the sum. So two cards each of -5: sum is -10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nI think this covers all cases. So the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero.
