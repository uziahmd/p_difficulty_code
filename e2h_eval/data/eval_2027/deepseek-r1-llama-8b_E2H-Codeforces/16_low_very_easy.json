Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about moving from home to university in Crazy Town, which is divided into blocks by roads. Each road is an infinite line. The key point is that you can move between two adjacent blocks in one step if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the goal is to find the minimal number of steps needed to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nHmm. The first thing I notice is that each road is a straight line, and these lines divide the plane into regions. The home and university are in some regions, and we need to find how many such regions (blocks) separate them, but only via the roads.\n\nWait, but how do the roads affect the blocks? Each road is a line, and each new road can potentially split existing regions into more regions. But for our problem, perhaps the key lies in determining on which side of each road the home and university lie. Because, the minimal number of steps would correspond to the number of roads that separate the home and university in such a way that you have to cross each of them once.\n\nSo here's an idea: For each road, check whether the home and university are on the same side or different sides. If they're on different sides, then crossing this road is necessary. The minimal number of steps required would be the number of such roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nThat makes sense because each such road adds a boundary that must be crossed once. So the total number of such roads is the answer.\n\nLet me think about why that works. Each time a road separates the home and university, you have to cross it. Since the roads are lines, each crossing can be done in one step—each step can take you across a single road.\n\nFor example, if there are two roads that both separate home and university, you'd need to cross each one, leading to two steps.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each road (line), determine the sign of the equation when evaluated at home and university.\n2. If the signs are different, this means home and university are on opposite sides of the road, so this road contributes to the count.\n3. Sum all such roads where the signs differ. That sum is the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nThat seems straightforward. So the plan is to compute for each line whether the home and university lie on the same or opposite sides.\n\nHow to compute the sign? For a given line ax + by + c = 0, plugging in (x1, y1) gives a value s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c. Similarly, for (x2, y2), s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nIf s1 and s2 have opposite signs (i.e., their product is negative), then the points are on opposite sides of the line. So, for each line, we check if s1 * s2 < 0. If yes, increment the count.\n\nWait, but what if the line is something like x=0, and home is at (1,0), university at (-1,0). Then the line x=0 is exactly in the middle. Both points are on opposite sides, so s1 would be 1, s2 -1, product is -1, which is negative. So the condition holds.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read home coordinates (x1, y1).\n- Read university coordinates (x2, y2).\n- Read n, the number of roads.\n- For each of the n roads:\n   - Read a, b, c.\n   - Compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n   - Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n   - If s1 * s2 < 0, then increment the count.\n- Output the count as the minimal steps.\n\nThat should work.\n\nNow, let's test this with the example provided.\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0 --> line y = 0.\n1 0 0 --> line x = 0.\n\nSo the home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1).\n\nFor the first line (y=0):\ns1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0.\ns2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 < 0.\nProduct is -1 < 0. So count +=1.\n\nSecond line (x=0):\ns1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1>0.\ns2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1<0.\nProduct is -1 <0. Count +=1.\n\nTotal count is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town, where each step allows crossing a road that is defined by an infinite line.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The town is divided into regions (blocks) by roads, which are infinite lines. Each road can be represented by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\). Your home and university are located in two different blocks, and you can only move between blocks if they share a common border segment. The goal is to find the minimal number of such segments you need to cross.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, determine if your home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, crossing this road is necessary. The total number of such roads gives the minimal number of steps required.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both home and university coordinates.\n   - If these values have opposite signs, it means the points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n   - Count such roads as they contribute to the number of steps needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read home and university coordinates\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads.\n- **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are read. The values of the line equation at home and university are computed.\n- **Checking Opposite Sides**: If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that home and university are on opposite sides of the road, necessitating a step across this road.\n- **Counting Steps**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimum steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging the geometric property of line equations and their signs relative to given points.",
