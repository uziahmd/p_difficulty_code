    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How?\n\nFor each ring, the perimeter is calculated. But since the plate is a grid, the number of cells in a ring is the perimeter minus the corners, but wait, no. Wait, for a rectangle of a certain width and height, the perimeter in terms of cells is (2*(width + height) - 4). Because each corner is counted once.\n\nWait, let's see: for a rectangle with width w and height h, the perimeter (number of cells) is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because each row contributes w cells, but the top and bottom are fully covered. For the sides, each column contributes h-2 cells (excluding the top and bottom already counted). So total is 2*w + 2*(h-2) = 2w + 2h -4, which is the same as 2*(w + h) -4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i, we calculate the current width and height as:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nThen, the number of cells in that ring is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, but only if current_w >=3 and current_h >=3. Otherwise, perhaps the ring can't be formed? Or wait, according to the input constraints, k is such that it's possible to have k rings.\n\nBecause the input constraints say that k is at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if w and h are both 3, min is 3, (3+1)/4=1, so k can be 1. Then for the second ring, the current_w would be 3-4= -1, which isn't possible. So the problem must stop adding rings once either current_w or current_h drops below 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the i-th ring is based on an inner rectangle of (w-4(i-1)) x (h-4(i-1)). So for i starting at 1, 2, ..., k.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to k, we compute the current_w and current_h, then compute the perimeter, but only if current_w and current_h are >=3. Otherwise, perhaps the ring is not added? No, because the input ensures that k is valid.\n\nSo in our code, for each i in 1..k, we compute current_w and current_h, then compute 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, and sum all these values.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Read w, h, k.\n2. Initialize a total variable to 0.\n3. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. If current_w < 3 or current_h < 3, break (but according to the problem statement, this won't happen)\n   d. Add 2*(current_w + current_h -2) to total (because 2*(w + h) -4 is equal to 2w + 2h -4, which is 2(w + h -2))\n4. Output the total.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation for the perimeter.\n\nSuppose current_w is 3 and current_h is 3. Then 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Which matches",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by cells that border the inner rectangle of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w` rows and `h` columns of cells. Each ring forms a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one. The width and height of each subsequent ring decrease by 4 cells (2 cells on each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of cells in the perimeter can be calculated using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`. This accounts for the top, bottom, left, and right borders, avoiding double-counting the corners.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: Starting from the outermost ring, we calculate the number of cells for each subsequent ring until we reach the `k`-th ring. We sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n    if current_w < 3 or current_h < 3:\n        break  # As per problem constraints, this shouldn't happen\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height by reducing the original dimensions by 4 cells for each preceding ring.\n- **Perimeter Calculation**: For each valid ring, compute the perimeter and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n- **Output the Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all `k` rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
