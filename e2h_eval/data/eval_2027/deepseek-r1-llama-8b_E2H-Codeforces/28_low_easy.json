String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of beautiful strings based on certain criteria. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, a beautiful string is a binary string (only 0s and 1s) that has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's more to it: we can modify the string through some operations, and the resulting string after modifications must be equal to g. Wait, no—wait, the problem says that the string after modifications must consist of either 0 or 1 as g. So, for example, if g is 0, the final string after any number of modifications should consist of all 0s. Similarly, if g is 1, it should consist of all 1s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me re-read the problem statement. Oh right: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So the string s is considered beautiful if, after some modifications, it becomes a string consisting entirely of g's. Because the modifications change the string, but in the end, the entire string must be all 0s or all 1s depending on g.\n\nBut wait, how do the modifications work? Each modification is replacing the last two characters with one. For example, if the last two are 00, they become 0. If they're 11, they become 1. If they're 01 or 10, what happens? Wait, the problem says: the replacement is exactly one other character. So, for 01 or 10, the replacement would be 0 or 1 respectively? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at the example given: transforming \"01010\" into \"0100\"—that's one modification. The last two were '0' and '10'? Wait, the initial string is \"01010\", which is five characters long. After one modification, it becomes four characters. The last two are replaced by one, so the new string is \"0100\". So, the last two were '1' and '0' (positions 4 and 5), which are '10'. They are replaced by '0' because the rule is: replace two last characters with one. So, the replacement depends on the two characters. If both are 0, replace with 0; both 1, replace with 1; else, what? Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: a modification replaces two last characters by exactly one other character, which equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise zero. Wait, no: \"it equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So, if the two last characters are both 0, they become 1. If they are anything else (like 1s or a mix), they become 0. So, for 00 → 1, 01 → 0, 10 → 0, 11 → 0, etc. Because the condition is: if the two are 0s, replace with 1. Otherwise, replace with 0.\n\nThat's an important point. So each modification reduces the length by 1, because two characters are replaced by one. So starting from a string of length L, each modification reduces it by 1, until it's less than 2, which can't be modified anymore.\n\nNow, the problem is: for a beautiful string s (which has exactly n 0s and m 1s), after some number of modifications (possibly zero), the resulting string is all 0s (if g=0) or all 1s (if g=1). We need to count the number of such s.\n\nWait, but how? Because the modifications can only be done on the last two characters. So the process is similar to building the string by adding new characters to the front, but the way you modify affects the possible transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as looking for all possible binary strings of length (n + m) that can be reduced to all 0s or all 1s via a series of these modifications.\n\nWait, but the order in which the modifications are applied can affect the outcome. So, perhaps it's easier to think recursively or find a pattern.\n\nLet me consider the example given:\n\nFirst sample input:\nn=1, m=1, g=0.\n\nThe beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Why? Let's see:\n\nFor \"01\":\nAfter zero modifications, it's already a string of length 2, which can't be further modified. To get to all 0s, we need to apply one modification: since the last two are '0' and '1', which are not both 0, so they become 0. So the string becomes \"00\". But wait, but wait: the problem says that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string consisting entirely of either '0's or '1's after a series of allowed modifications. The modifications involve replacing the last two characters of the string with a single character based on specific rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: A beautiful string is defined as a binary string with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones. The string can be modified by replacing the last two characters with one character, which becomes '1' if both are '0's, otherwise '0'. The goal is to determine how many such strings can be transformed into a string where all characters are the same (either all '0's or all '1's).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The transformation process can only reduce the string length by 1 each time a modification is applied. The result of each modification depends on the last two characters of the string. If both are '0's, they become '1'; otherwise, they become '0'.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use dynamic programming to keep track of possible transformations. The state of our DP will be determined by the current length of the string, the count of '0's and '1's remaining, and whether the string ends in a certain way that allows further transformations.\n\n4. **State Transition**: For each state, we consider the possible results of applying a modification. If the last two characters are '00', they transform into '1'; otherwise, they transform into '0'. This helps us transition between states efficiently.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we take modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) at each step to ensure the numbers remain manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif g == 0:\n    target = '0'\nelse:\n    target = '1'\n\nmax_len = n + m\ndp = [[0] * (max_len + 1) for _ in range(max_len + 1)]\n\n# Initialize base cases\nfor i in range(1, max_len + 1):\n    dp[i][i] = 1 if i == 1 else 0\n\nfor length in range(2, max_len + 1):\n    # Consider the last two characters\n    for zero_count in range(n + 1):\n        for one_count in range(m + 1):\n            if zero_count + one_count != length - 2:\n                continue\n            current = dp[length - 2][zero_count][one_count]\n            # Apply the modification: replace last two with one\n            if zero_count >= 2:\n                new_zero = zero_count - 2\n                new_one = one_count\n                if new_zero + new_one == length - 1:\n                    dp[length][new_zero][new_one] += current\n                    dp[length][new_zero][new_one] %= MOD\n            else:\n                new_zero = zero_count\n                new_one = one_count - 2\n                if new_zero + new_one == length - 1:\n                    dp[length][new_zero][new_one] += current\n                    dp[length][new_zero][new_one] %= MOD\n\n# Now calculate the total for each possible ending condition\ntotal = 0\nfor z in range(n + 1):\n    for o in range(m + 1):\n        if z + o == (n + m):\n            if g == 0:\n                if z == n and o == m and (z + o) % 2 == 0:\n                    total += dp[max_len][z][o]\n            else:\n                if o == m and z == n and (z + o) % 2 == 0:\n                    total += dp[max_len][z][o]\n            total %= MOD\n\nprint(total % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by initializing a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a string of length `i` with `j` zeros and `i-j` ones.\n- **Base Cases**: For strings of length 1, there is exactly one way to form them.\n- **State Transitions**: For each possible string length, we consider the effect of applying a modification. Depending on whether the last two characters are '00' or not, we update the DP table accordingly.\n- **Result Calculation**: After filling the DP table, we sum up all valid configurations that can be transformed into the target string (all '0's or all '1's) and print the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).",
