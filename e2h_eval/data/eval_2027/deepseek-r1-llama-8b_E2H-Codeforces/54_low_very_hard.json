Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any will do.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, given a regular polygon with n sides, we need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on the sides adjacent to v2. The angle at v2 should be as close to 'a' degrees as possible. And among all possible angles, we need the one that's closest, and if there's a tie, any solution is acceptable.\n\nWait, but how is this angle formed? Oh right, in a regular polygon, each internal angle can be calculated. For a regular n-gon, the internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the internal angle of the polygon itself. However, when considering angles formed by three points in the polygon, the angle might be different.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The angle in question is the angle at v2 between the two lines connecting v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So, v1 and v3 must be consecutive to v2 along the edges of the polygon.\n\nWait no, not necessarily consecutive. Because in a polygon, each vertex is connected to two others (its previous and next in the polygon). So for any vertex v2, the two adjacent vertices form the sides of the polygon. But when choosing v1 and v3, they can be any other vertices, but the angle is determined by the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this. Let's imagine the regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle. Each vertex can be represented as a point on the circumference. Then, the angle at v2 between two other points depends on the arcs between those points as seen from v2.\n\nSo, the angle between v1 and v3 at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but only if that arc is less than 180 degrees. Wait, no, because in a circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle at the circumference. But since the polygon is regular, the central angles are equal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the possible angles that can be formed by selecting three vertices. For a regular polygon, the possible angles can be determined based on the steps between the vertices.\n\nLet me think about this: for a regular n-gon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\nNow, for a given v2, the positions of v1 and v3 determine the angle at v2. The angle will depend on the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon. Let me denote k as the number of edges between v1 and v3, measured in the minimal path. Since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 is determined by the chord between v1 and v3, which corresponds to a certain step size.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the angle at v2 is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2. So, let's say v2 is at position i. Then, v1 could be at i + d and v3 at i + e, where d and e are the steps from v2. But the angle at v2 would be determined by the arc between v1 and v3 as viewed from v2. So, the angle is (e - d) * (360 / n) degrees, but considering the shorter arc.\n\nWait, no. Because in a circle, the angle at a point is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. So, if the arc from v1 to v3 (as seen from the center) is x degrees, then the angle at v2 is x/2.\n\nBut wait, that's only if the polygon is inscribed in a circle and considering the central angle. But in a regular polygon, the points are placed on the circumference, so yes, the angle at v2 would be half the central angle between v1 and v3.\n\nBut wait, this depends on the direction. So, for example, if v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps clockwise, the central angle between v1 and v3 is |k - m| * (360/n) degrees. Then, the angle at v2 would be half of that, but only if that arc is the minor arc. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently calculating the possible angles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular n-gon has its vertices equally spaced around a circle. Each vertex can be connected to form sides and diagonals.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For any vertex \\( v2 \\), the angle at \\( v2 \\) formed by two other vertices \\( v1 \\) and \\( v3 \\) depends on the arc between them. The angle at \\( v2 \\) is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the arc between \\( v1 \\) and \\( v3 \\).\n3. **Possible Angles**: The possible angles at each vertex \\( v2 \\) can be determined by considering the steps between \\( v1 \\) and \\( v3 \\). The central angle between consecutive vertices is \\( 360/n \\) degrees, so the angle at \\( v2 \\) will be a multiple of this value.\n4. **Finding Closest Angle**: For each vertex \\( v2 \\), calculate the possible angles formed by pairs of other vertices. Track the closest angle to 'a' and the corresponding vertices.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef compute_angle(n, k):\n    return (k * 180) // n  # since it's integer division for degrees\n\nmin_diff = float('inf')\nbest = None\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    # Try all possible pairs of v1 and v3 relative to v2\n    for d in range(1, (n-1)//2 + 1):\n        v1 = (v2 - d - 1) % n + 1\n        for e in range(d+1, n-d):\n            v3 = (v2 + e - 1) % n + 1\n            if v1 == v3:\n                continue\n            current_angle = compute_angle(n, abs(e - d))\n            diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n            if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and best is None):\n                min_diff = diff\n                best = (v1, v2, v3)\n                # Also check the reverse pair if not same as above\n                current_angle_rev = compute_angle(n, abs((e - d) - (d - e)))\n                rev_diff = abs(current_angle_rev - a)\n                if rev_diff < min_diff or (rev_diff == min_diff and best is None):\n                    min_diff = rev_diff\n                    best = (v3, v2, v1)\n    # Check the case where k is more than n/2\n    for k in range(n//2 + 1, n):\n        if k > n - k:\n            continue\n        v1 = (v2 - k - 1) % n + 1\n        v3 = (v2 + k - 1) % n + 1\n        current_angle = compute_angle(n, 2*k)\n        diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and best is None):\n            min_diff = diff\n            best = (v1, v2, v3)\n            # Also check the reverse\n            current_angle_rev = compute_angle(n, 2*(n - k))\n            rev_diff = abs(current_angle_rev - a)\n            if rev_diff < min_diff or (rev_diff == min_diff and best is None):\n                min_diff = rev_diff\n                best = (v3, v2, v1)\n\n# Ensure that the best is not None\nif best is None:\n    # This should not happen as per problem constraints\n    pass\nelse:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, best)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Angle Calculation Function**: `compute_angle` calculates the angle at a vertex based on the number of steps between the other two vertices.\n3. **Iterating Over Vertices**: For each vertex \\( v2 \\), consider all possible pairs of other vertices \\( v1 \\) and \\( v3 \\) to determine the angle at \\( v2 \\).\n4. **Tracking Minimum Difference**: Keep track of the smallest difference between the calculated angle and the target angle `a`, along with the corresponding vertices.\n5. **Output**: Print the vertices that form the closest angle to `a`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible angles in the polygon and find the optimal solution.",
