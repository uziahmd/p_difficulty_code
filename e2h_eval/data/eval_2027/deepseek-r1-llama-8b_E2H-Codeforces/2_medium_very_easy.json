Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The conditions for an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All the other squares (the ones not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to check the diagonals. Then, check the rest.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, for each test case (each grid), I'll need to process it. So, for each grid:\n\n- Check the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal to see if all their characters are the same.\n- Once I confirm that, collect the character used in the diagonals.\n- Then, check all other cells to see if they are the same and different from the diagonal character.\n\nWait, but wait: the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. But for an 'X', both of these should consist of the same character.\n\nSo step by step:\n\nFor each grid:\n\n1. Read the grid as a 2D list.\n2. Check the main diagonal: for each i, grid[i][i] should be the same. Similarly, check the anti-diagonal: grid[i][n-1-i] should be the same as the others.\n3. So, first, collect the diagonal characters. If any of them differ, it's not an X. Also, if the two diagonals have different characters, that's also a no-go.\n4. So, if either diagonal isn't uniform, return NO.\n5. Else, take the common diagonal character as d_char.\n6. Now, check all other cells (non-diagonal). For each cell (i,j), if it's on either diagonal, skip it. Otherwise, check if it's equal to some other_char, which must be different from d_char.\n7. If all non-diagonal cells are the same and equal to other_char, then it's a YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where n is 1? Oh, but n is at least 3 and odd, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, reading input:\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. Wait, no, the first line is n, and then n lines follow, each being a string representing the row. So each test case is a single grid.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe user provided three cases. Each case starts with a line with n, followed by n lines. So for each case, we process one grid.\n\nSo the code will loop over each grid, process it, and output YES or NO.\n\nSo the steps for each grid:\n\nRead n, then read n lines, each line being a string. Make sure to strip any leading/trailing whitespace, maybe. Or perhaps the input is correctly formatted.\n\nThen, for the grid, extract the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n\nLet's think about indices. For a grid of size n x n, the main diagonal is cells where i == j. The anti-diagonal is where i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nmain_diag_cell = grid[i][i]\n\nanti_diag_cell = grid[i][n-1 - i]\n\nWe can collect all the main_diag_cells into a set. If the size of the set is more than 1, the main diagonal is not uniform. Similarly, for the anti-diagonal.\n\nWait, no: both diagonals must have all cells equal to the same character. So for main diagonal, all cells must be equal to each other. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. And these two may or may not be the same character.\n\nWait no! The problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same.\" So both diagonals must consist of the same letter. Because, for example, in the sample input, the second case is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nWhich is a 3x3 grid. The main diagonal is w, s, w. So not all same. Wait, no, wait: let me look again.\n\nWait sample input 2 is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nWait the main diagonal is [0][0], [1][1], [2][2]. So those are w, s, w. So the main diagonal is not uniform, because the middle is s. So why is the sample output YES?\n\nWait that's conflicting with my earlier understanding. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the condition.\n\nWait the problem statement says: \n\n\"if on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nWait, so both diagonals must be the same, but perhaps it's allowed that the two diagonals are different from each other. Wait, no, because the condition is that both diagonals are the same.\n\nWait no, the wording is ambiguous. Let me re-read:\n\n\"both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\nSo both diagonals must consist of the same letter. So the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must be the same.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample input 2:\n\nThe grid is:\n\nw s w\n\ns w s\n\nw s w\n\nThe main diagonal is w, w, w. The anti-diagonal is w, w, w. So both are same. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the main diagonal was w, s, w. No, because the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w → columns 0,1,2.\n\nSo main diagonal is grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][2] = 'w'.\n\nAh right, because for row 0, column 0 is part of the main diagonal. Row 1, column 1. So in this case, both diagonals are same.\n\nSo for the grid in sample 2, the diagonals are all 'w's. The other cells (non-diagonal) are 's's.\n\nSo that's a YES.\n\nBut the third sample is:\n\n3\n\nx p x\n\np x p\n\nx p x\n\nWait, the main diagonal is x, x, x. Anti-diagonal is x, x, x. So both are same. The other cells are 'p's. So that's an X. But the output is NO. Wait why?\n\nWait the sample input has three cases, and their outputs are ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'].\n\nWait the third sample input is:\n\n3\nxpe\n\nWait no, the third case is:\n\n3\nxpx\np x p\nxpe\n\nWait, the third case's grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e ?\n\nWait, no, let me look again. The third input is:\n\n['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWait, so n=3.\n\nEach row is 3 characters.\n\nSo row 0 is 'xpx' → x, p, x.\n\nRow 1 is 'pxp' → p, x, p.\n\nRow 2 is 'xpe' → x, p, e.\n\nWait, now, the main diagonal is grid[0][0] = 'x', grid[1][1] = 'x', grid[2][2] = 'e'. So the main diagonal has 'x', 'x', 'e' → not all same. So the main diagonal is not uniform. Hence, the condition fails. So the answer is NO.\n\nSo the problem requires that both diagonals are uniform and have the same character. So, the steps are:\n\nCheck that all cells on the main diagonal are the same. Check that all cells on the anti-diagonal are the same. Then, check that the main and anti-diagonals are the same character.\n\nWait no. Because in the sample input 2, the main and anti-diagonals are same. So yes.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that both diagonals are the same. So for example, the main diagonal is 'a's, the anti-diagonal is 'a's. So both are same.\n\nAlternatively, if the main diagonal is 'a's and the anti-diagonal is 'b's, that would not satisfy the condition.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nFor each grid:\n\n1. Collect the main diagonal cells. Check if they are all same. Let's call this d_char.\n\n   - For each i from 0 to n-1:\n     - Check grid[i][i] == d_char.\n     - If any grid[i][i] differs, the grid is invalid.\n\n2. Collect the anti-diagonal cells. Check if they are all same as d_char.\n\n   - For each i from 0 to n-1:\n     - Check grid[i][n-1 -i] == d_char.\n     - If any differs, invalid.\n\n3. Now, check all the other cells (non-diagonal) to see if they are all same and different from d_char.\n\n   - For each i, j:\n     - if i != j and i + j != n-1:\n       - Check grid[i][j] == some other_char (must be same for all)\n       - other_char != d_char.\n\nIf all the above conditions are met, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nWait, but in step 1, when collecting the main diagonal, if any cell is different, we can immediately mark it as invalid.\n\nSame for the anti-diagonal.\n\nSo, the algorithm outline is:\n\nFor each grid:\n\n- Determine the main diagonal character, d_char:\n\n   d_char = None\n\n   for i in 0 to n-1:\n      current_char = grid[i][i]\n      if d_char is None:\n          d_char = current_char\n      else:\n          if current_char != d_char:\n              # main diagonal not uniform\n              flag = False\n              break\n\n   if flag is False:\n      continue to next grid.\n\n- Now, check the anti-diagonal:\n\n   for i in 0 to n-1:\n      current_char = grid[i][n-1 - i]\n      if current_char != d_char:\n          # anti-diagonal not same as d_char\n          flag = False\n          break\n\n   if flag is False:\n      continue to next grid.\n\n- Now, check the non-diagonal cells:\n\n   other_char = None\n\n   for i in 0 to n-1:\n      for j in 0 to n-1:\n          if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n              continue\n          current_char = grid[i][j]\n          if other_char is None:\n              other_char = current_char\n          else:\n              if current_char != other_char:\n                  flag = False\n                  break\n      if not flag:\n          break\n\n   if flag is False:\n      continue to next grid.\n\n   else:\n      # check if other_char is different from d_char\n      if other_char == d_char:\n          flag = False\n      if not flag:\n          continue to next grid.\n\n   if flag:\n      print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n      print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: after step 2, we already know that both diagonals are d_char. So in step 3, the non-diagonal cells must be same and not equal to d_char.\n\nSo, during step 3:\n\n- collect all non-diagonal cells into a set. They must have exactly one unique character, say c.\n\n- c must not be equal to d_char.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(other_chars) == 0:\n    # only possible when n=1, which is not allowed as per constraints.\n    # So in our case, since n >=3, other_chars will have at least 2*(n-1) elements.\n\n# check if all same:\nif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n    flag = False\nelse:\n    other_char = other_chars[0]\n    if other_char == d_char:\n        flag = False\n    else:\n        flag = True\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3.\n\nSample 2:\n\ngrid is:\n\nw s w\n\ns w s\n\nw s w\n\nMain diagonal: w, w, w → d_char = 'w'\n\nAnti-diagonal: w, w, w → same as d_char.\n\nNon-diagonal cells:\n\nPositions (0,1): s, (0,2 is diagonal?), wait no.\n\nWait for n=3, positions are 0-based.\n\nWait for i=0, j=0 is main diagonal.\n\ni=0, j=1: non-diagonal.\n\ni=0, j=2: anti-diagonal (0+2=2, which is n-1=2).\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, j=0: non-diagonal.\n\ni=1, j=2: anti-diagonal.\n\ni=2, j=1: non-diagonal.\n\nSo in this grid, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1) → s\n\n(1,0) → s\n\n(1,2) → s\n\n(2,1) → s\n\nSo all same. So other_char is 's', which is not 'w' → so output YES.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5.\n\nSuppose the grid is such that the main and anti-diagonals are 'x's, and all other cells are 'o's.\n\nThat would be a YES.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5.\n\nDiagonals are 'x's.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are 'o's → YES.\n\nBut if any non-diagonal cell is 'x', it's invalid.\n\nOr if non-diagonal cells have mixed letters.\n\nWhat about if the main and anti-diagonal have different letters?\n\nLike main is 'x's, anti is 'y's. Then, both diagonals are same within themselves, but different from each other. So condition 1 is not met. So output is NO.\n\nSo, in code, after checking that both diagonals are same as d_char, which is the same for both.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Check that all main diagonal cells are same → d_char.\n\n- Check that all anti-diagonal cells are same as d_char.\n\n- Check that all non-diagonal cells are same, and different from d_char.\n\nSo, implementing that.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nThe input is given as a list of strings, each string representing a row.\n\nIn Python, for each test case:\n\nn = int(input().strip())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as a list, but perhaps each element is a string that includes newline characters? Or is it a multi-line string?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters\".\n\nSo each line is a string of length n, without any newlines.\n\nSo for each grid, the code reads n lines, each line is stripped.\n\nSo grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)].\n\nNow, processing each grid.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nFunction to check if a grid is an X.\n\ndef is_x(grid, n):\n\n    # Step 1: Check main diagonal.\n\n    d_char = None\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if grid[i][i] != d_char:\n\n            if d_char is None:\n\n                d_char = grid[i][i]\n\n            else:\n\n                return False\n\n    # After this, d_char is the main diagonal's character.\n\n    # Step 2: Check anti-diagonal.\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if grid[i][n-1 - i] != d_char:\n\n            return False\n\n    # Step 3: Check non-diagonal cells.\n\n    other_chars = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n                continue\n\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n    # Check if all other_chars are same and not d_char.\n\n    if not other_chars:\n\n        # Only possible when n=1, which is not allowed.\n\n        return True\n\n    other_char = other_chars[0]\n\n    if other_char == d_char:\n\n        return False\n\n    for c in other_chars:\n\n        if c != other_char:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nWait, but in code, for the anti-diagonal check, perhaps we can combine it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can collect the anti-diagonal into a variable and compare to d_char.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter step 1, d_char is known.\n\nThen, for each i, check grid[i][n-1 -i] == d_char.\n\nIf any is not, return False.\n\nOnce both steps 1 and 2 are passed, proceed to step 3.\n\nNow, for the non-diagonal cells, collect all and check.\n\nSo, that function should return True or False.\n\nNow, for the overall code:\n\nRead T test cases?\n\nWait, no. The problem says, each test case is a separate grid.\n\nSo, read n, then read n lines, process each grid.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided a list of three grids.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as a list of strings, each being a test case.\n\nBut in practice, the code should read from stdin, each test case is a grid.\n\nSo, the code should read n, then n lines.\n\nBut in some programming contest problems, the input is read as a single block, but in others, it's read line by line.\n\nWait, the first line is n, then n lines each of n characters.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nresult = 'YES' if is_x(grid, n) else 'NO'\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings, each representing the grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as a single string, with '\\n' separating the test cases.\n\nWait, no, the problem says: \"Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\"\n\nSo each test case is a single grid, and after reading n, read n lines, each being the grid.\n\nSo, for each test case, read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of three test cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should process each test case in a loop until EOF.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, it's unclear whether there are multiple test cases. Looking back, the problem says \"Valera's paper\" which implies a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input is a list of lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is a single test case.\n\nBecause in the sample input, the first line is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox' — but that seems to represent a single grid.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the first line is n, then n lines, each being the grid.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each being the grid.\n\nProcess each grid.\n\nOutput YES or NO.\n\nSo, the code will process a single grid, not multiple.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the user provided a list of three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each represented by a block of n lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, the input is a single test case: n followed by n lines.\n\nThus, the code will process a single grid.\n\nHence, the code will read n, then read n lines, each being the grid, and process it once.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input().strip())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nif is_x(grid, n):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nSo, that's the structure.\n\nNow, testing.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThis is a 5x5 grid.\n\nMain diagonal:\n\nx, o, o, o, x → not all same. So condition 1 fails. So output is NO.\n\nSample Output is 'NO'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: w, w, w. Anti-diagonal: w, w, w. Other cells are 's's. So output YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, e → not same. So condition 1 fails. Output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nx x x → all x's. Diagonals are x's. Non-diagonal are x's, which equals d_char. So condition 3 fails. Output NO.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\nx x x\n\nx x y\n\nx x x → non-diagonal includes y. So all non-diagonal are same? Yes, except for the center. Wait no: the center is on the diagonal, so it's included in the diagonals. So non-diagonal cells are the four corners. Wait, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Are they all same?\n\nIn this grid, (0,1) is x, (1,0) is x, (1,2) is y, (2,1) is x.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells are x, x, y, x → not all same. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5.\n\nAll diagonals are 'x's. All other cells are 'o's.\n\nSo output YES.\n\nSo the code should handle all of these.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling of empty strings, but in the problem, n is at least 3, so each line is at least 3 characters.\n\n- Off-by-one errors in the indices when checking the anti-diagonal.\n\nNow, let's implement the function.\n\nTesting the function.\n\nWait, in the code, the function is_x will return True or False.\n\nLet me think about another test case.\n\nTest case where the main diagonal is 'a's, anti-diagonal is 'a's, but some non-diagonal cells are 'a's.\n\nIn that case, the function should return False because non-diagonal cells are same as d_char.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal have varying letters.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential optimizations: for large n, up to 299, but for each grid, it's O(n^2), which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the code accordingly.\n",

The conditions for an 'X' are that both diagonals must have the same letter, and all other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: First, we check if both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) consist of the same character.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: After confirming that both diagonals are the same, we check if all non-diagonal cells contain the same character, which must be different from the diagonal character.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_x(grid, n):\n    # Check main diagonal\n    d_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_char = grid[i][i]\n        if d_char is None:\n            d_char = current_char\n        else:\n            if current_char != d_char:\n                return False\n\n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_char = grid[i][n-1 - i]\n        if current_char != d_char:\n            return False\n\n    # Check non-diagonal cells\n    other_chars = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n    if not other_chars:\n        return True  # Only possible when n=1, which is not allowed per problem statement\n\n    other_char = other_chars[0]\n    if other_char == d_char:\n        return False\n\n    for c in other_chars:\n        if c != other_char:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input().strip())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nif is_x(grid, n):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads the next `n` lines to form the grid.\n2. **Checking Diagonals**: The main diagonal and anti-diagonal are checked to ensure they all contain the same character.\n3. **Checking Non-Diagonal Cells**: All cells not on the diagonals are checked to ensure they contain the same character, which must be different from the diagonal character.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, the result is printed as \"YES\" if the grid forms an 'X', otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all conditions for forming an 'X' are efficiently checked, making the solution both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
