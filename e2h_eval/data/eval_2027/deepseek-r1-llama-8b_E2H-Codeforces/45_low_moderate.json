There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, so for example, when n=2, there's only one game, so the output is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games: first against someone, then against another. But wait, how does that work exactly?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So starting with n players, each round halves the number of players (assuming it's a binary elimination tree). But the way the matches are arranged affects how many games the winner plays.\n\nThe rule about the difference in the number of games played between two opponents is crucial. So the winner must have a path in the tournament such that each step allows the next game according to that rule.\n\nI remember something about Fibonacci sequences appearing in similar problems. Oh right! Because each time the winner plays a new match, the opponent could have played either the same number or one less than the winner's current count.\n\nSo maybe the maximum number of games is the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to some function of n.\n\nWait, let's think about how the Fibonacci sequence comes into play. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each game after the first adds an opponent that has either played k-1 games or k-2 games. But since each opponent must have at least as many wins as their previous games, perhaps the number of required players is related to Fibonacci numbers.\n\nFor example, to have a sequence of games where each step allows the next opponent, the number of players needed is the sum of certain Fibonacci terms.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let f(k) be the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Then:\n\nf(1) = 2 (needs one opponent)\nf(2) = 3 (opponent has 0 games, then winner has 1, which is allowed)\nWait, no. Wait, for k=2 games, the first opponent has 0 games, and the second opponent must have either 1 or 0 (since the winner has 1 after the first game). So for the second game, the opponent could have 0 or 1. But to allow the maximum chain, perhaps we need to find the minimal players.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus 1 or something like that. Or maybe it's based on the Fibonacci sequence but shifted.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the examples given:\n\nIn the sample input where n=10, the output is 4.\n\nSo for n=10, the maximum games possible is 4. How does that fit into a Fibonacci-like approach?\n\nLet's compute Fibonacci numbers up to, say, 10:\n\nF(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, etc.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's more about the sum of previous Fibonacci numbers. For k games, the minimal number of players is F(k+2), or something similar.\n\nLet me see. For k=1, minimal players is 2. For k=2, it's 3 (because you have the winner, then two opponents). For k=3, the minimal players would be 5, because the winner plays a first game (against someone who has 0), then in the second game, the opponent could have 1 (so the winner has 1 now), then the third game requires the opponent to have 1 or 2 games. Wait, but the minimal number of players for k=3 would be 4? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) represents the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games. So let's build f(k):\n\nf(1) = 2\nFor f(2), the winner needs to play two games. The first game is against someone (f(1)=2). The second game's opponent must have played either 1 or 0 games. To maximize the number of games, the second opponent could have 0, but that might not require more players. Alternatively, maybe f(2) is 3 because in the first round, the winner plays one game, and then in the second, the opponent has played once before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a pattern or recurrence relation.\n\nLooking online, I recall that the maximum number of games a winner can play in a knockout tournament where each opponent can differ by at most one game is the largest k such that f(k+2) ≤",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing a pattern related to Fibonacci numbers. The key insight is that the maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to the number of players minus 1. This is because each game the winner plays can only be against an opponent who has either played the same number of games or one fewer than the winner. This structure mirrors the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    # Generate Fibonacci sequence up to the point where fib exceeds n-1\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val >= n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n    # The maximum k is the length of the sequence minus 2 (since fib starts with F(1) and F(2))\n    return len(fib) - 2\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: We generate the Fibonacci sequence starting from 1, 1 until the next value exceeds the number of players minus one.\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: The length of the generated Fibonacci sequence minus 2 gives the maximum number of games the winner can play, as each term in the sequence represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play that many games.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring that we find the maximum number of games in logarithmic time relative to the input size.",
