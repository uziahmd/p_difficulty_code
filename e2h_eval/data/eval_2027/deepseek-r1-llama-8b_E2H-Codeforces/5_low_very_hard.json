Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And also, output these pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem better.\n\nSo, each left boot has a color (a lowercase letter or '?'), same for right boots. Two colors are compatible if they're the same or one is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the description: an indefinite color (i.e., '?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color. So, when either is '?', they are compatible. Otherwise, their colors must be exactly the same.\n\nSo, for example:\n- 'f' and 'f' are compatible.\n- '?' and 'z' are compatible.\n- 'a' and '?' are compatible.\n- '?' and '?' are compatible.\n\nBut 'f' and 'g' are not, and 'a' and 'z' aren't.\n\nSo, the task is to pair each left boot with a right boot, without reusing any, such that the number of compatible pairs is maximized.\n\nI need to compute the maximum possible k, and then list all such pairs.\n\nThe output requires the count and then each pair in some order. It's important that the left indices are unique and the right indices are unique in the pairs.\n\nNow, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. n can be up to 150,000. So, O(n^2) approaches are definitely out of the question. We need something efficient, probably O(n log n) time.\n\nWhat's the strategy here? It seems like we need to match left and right boots in a way that as many as possible pairs are compatible.\n\nLet's consider each possible left boot and see which right boots it can pair with. But doing this naively is too slow.\n\nAnother idea: For each character c, count the number of left boots of c and the number of right boots of c. Then, the minimum of those two counts can contribute to the maximum possible pairs.\n\nBut wait, because '?' can match anything, including other '?'s. So, perhaps we should handle '?' separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem, but again, with n up to 1.5e5, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp would be manageable, but the implementation might be tricky.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any matching, not necessarily a perfect one. So, maybe there's a way to model the maximum matching without using a full-fledged algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible to group the left and right boots by their colors and then compute how many pairs can be formed based on the counts.\n\nLet me think: Each left boot can potentially be matched with any right boot that is compatible with it. So, for each left boot, the set of compatible right boots includes all '?' and those with the same color as the left.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a maximum bipartite matching where edges exist between left and right nodes if their colors are compatible.\n\nBut computing maximum bipartite matching for n=1.5e5 is impossible with standard algorithms, as the time complexity would be too high.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother idea: For each right boot, collect all left boots that are compatible with it. Then, assign as many as possible.\n\nBut again, for n=1.5e5, this might not be feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a frequency-based problem. Let's count the frequency of each color in left and right, and calculate how many pairs can be formed without considering overlaps.\n\nWait, but this isn't sufficient because some overlaps might cause conflicts. For example, if a left boot is '?', it can match any right boot, including those that have a lot of other options.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal solution involves:\n\n1. Pairing as many same-color pairs as possible, since they are the most restrictive.\n\n2. Then, handle the remaining '?', which can match any.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, for each color c (excluding '?'), the number of possible pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nWe can sum all these for each c, and subtract from left and right the used counts. Then, handle the '?'.\n\nWait, but wait: when we pair a left c with right c, we can only do min(left[c], right[c]). So, for each c, that's a possible contribution.\n\nBut after that, the remaining left and right can be paired via '?'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute for each c (a-z) the min of left_count[c] and right_count[c]. Sum these as the base.\n\n- Subtract these from left and right counts.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right",
