He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or suffix of the original string s. Each string is either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S), and I need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's in the order of the input.\n\nHmm, the input has 2n-2 strings, each of which is either a prefix or a suffix of length 1 to n-1. The goal is to assign each one as P or S correctly.\n\nWait, but how? Because some prefixes might overlap with suffixes, right? So I need to find a way to determine which are prefixes and which are suffixes based on their possible positions in the original string.\n\nLet me think about the structure. For each possible candidate string s, all the prefixes and suffixes must fit into it. But since I don't know s, I have to find a way to group the given strings into prefixes and suffixes such that for some s, all the prefixes are indeed the first k characters and the suffixes are the last k.\n\nBut how do I model this?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps we can build a trie of the given strings and see which ones could be prefixes and which could be suffixes. But I'm not sure if that's the right path.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find the correct order of the prefixes and suffixes. Like, for each possible k, the prefix of length k must be a prefix of all longer prefixes. Similarly, the suffix of length k must be a suffix of all longer suffixes.\n\nSo perhaps we can group the strings by their lengths. For each length l, there are two strings. One of them must be a prefix, and the other a suffix, or vice versa, but wait, no— because for each l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the input contains exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1. And each of these is either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nSo for each l, among the two strings of length l, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1:\n   - Take the two strings of length l.\n   - Determine which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce I have that, I can proceed to build the string step by step.\n\nBut how to determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix for each l?\n\nHmm, perhaps using the fact that the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the prefix of length l+1, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider the prefixes. The prefix of length l is a prefix of all longer prefixes. So for each l, the prefix of l must be a prefix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l must be a suffix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, between the two strings of length l, one must be the prefix and the other the suffix. Then, when considering l+1, the two strings must be compatible with this choice.\n\nSo maybe we can construct the possible candidates for the prefix and suffix at each l, ensuring that they align with the choices made for l-1.\n\nLet me think more concretely.\n\nLet's process the strings in order of increasing length. For each length l, starting from l=1 up to l=n-1, we have two strings, say A and B.\n\nWe need to decide whether A is the prefix and B the suffix, or vice versa.\n\nBut this decision must be consistent with the previous l-1 level.\n\nFor example, suppose for l=1, the two options are 'a' and 'b'. We choose 'a' as the prefix and 'b' as the suffix. Then, for l=2, the two options must be compatible with this. The new prefix (length 2) must start with 'a', and the new suffix (length 2) must end with 'b'.\n\nSo for l=2, the two options are, say, 'ab' and 'ba'. We need to check which one fits.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of length 2 must end with the suffix of length 1. So for l=1, the suffix is 'b', so the suffix of l=2 must end with 'b'. So looking at the two options for l=2, let's see:\n\nIf one option is 'aa' and another is 'ba', then 'ba' ends with 'a', which doesn't match the previous suffix 'b'. So 'ba' can't be the suffix of length 2. So only 'aa' can be considered for the suffix. But wait, wait—the suffix of length 2 must end with the suffix of length 1, which was 'b'. So 'aa' ends with 'a' which doesn't match, so 'ba' ends with 'a' as well. Wait, no—maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, for l=1, the suffix is 'b'. So for l=2, the suffix must end with 'b'. So in the two options for l=2, the suffix must end with 'b'. So if the two options are 'ab' and 'cb', then 'cb' ends with 'b', so that's the suffix for l=2, and 'ab' is the prefix.\n\nSo the key is: for each l, after choosing the prefix and suffix for l-1, the current l's prefix must start with the previous prefix, and the current l's suffix must end with the previous suffix.\n\nThus, for l=2, the two strings must satisfy:\n\nprefix_2 starts with prefix_1\nsuffix_2 ends with suffix_1\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nInitialize the prefix as the first option for l=1, and the suffix as the second option.\n\nThen, for each subsequent l from 2 to n-1:\n\nCheck which of the two options for l can be a prefix (starts with current prefix) and which can be a suffix (ends with current suffix). There should be exactly one prefix candidate and one suffix candidate.\n\nSo for each l, from the two strings, one will be compatible as the new prefix, the other as the new suffix.\n\nWait, but what if both are possible? Or neither? But according to the problem statement, the input is valid, so it's guaranteed that exactly one way exists.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Group the input strings by their lengths. For each l, collect the two strings.\n\n2. Start with l=1. Choose which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n3. For l=2, look at the two strings. One must be a prefix (starts with the previous prefix), and the other must be a suffix (ends with the previous suffix).\n\n4. Proceed inductively until l =n-1.\n\nOnce we have determined for each l whether the corresponding string is a prefix or a suffix, we can create the output string by going through the input list and marking each string as P or S.\n\nBut how to handle the initial step for l=1?\n\nWait, for l=1, there are two options. But which one is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nWait, the prefix of length 1 is the first character of s. The suffix of length 1 is the last character of s. So for l=1, the two strings must consist of the first and last characters of s.\n\nSo for l=1, any choice between the two would affect the rest. But how do I decide which is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nAh, perhaps it depends on the rest of the data. For example, perhaps trying both possibilities and seeing which leads to a consistent solution.\n\nBut this sounds computationally expensive, but since n is up to 100, maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, but for l=1, one of the two strings must be the prefix (first character) and the other the suffix (last character). So, for l=1, the two options are P and S. How to decide which is which?\n\nPerhaps, for l=2, the two strings must be compatible with the choice made for l=1.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each possible assignment of the two l=1 strings (one as P, the other as S), try to build the rest of the structure. If one of them leads to a complete and consistent assignment for all l's up to n-1, then that's our solution.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- For each possible permutation of the two l=1 strings (assigning one as P, the other as S):\n\n   - Try to build the prefix and suffix sequences.\n\n   - For each l from 2 to n-1:\n\n      - Among the two strings for this l, check which can be the next prefix (must start with previous prefix) and which can be the next suffix (must end with previous suffix).\n\n      - If exactly one prefix and one suffix can be assigned, proceed.\n\n      - Else, this permutation is invalid.\n\n   - If the permutation leads to a full assignment for all l's, then record it as a possible solution.\n\n- Once all permutations are checked, select any of the valid assignments.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, and for each l, the number of possibilities is small, this approach should be feasible.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, group the input by their lengths. For each l, we have a list of two strings.\n\nWe'll process the l's in order from 1 to n-1.\n\nNow, for each permutation of assigning the two l=1 strings as P and S:\n\n   Assign p1 as the first string, s1 as the second string.\n\n   Or assign p1 as the second string, s1 as the first string.\n\n   Then, for each l >=2:\n\n      Check the two strings for this l.\n\n      Find which can be the next prefix (must start with current prefix) and which can be the next suffix (must end with current suffix).\n\n      If exactly one of each, proceed.\n\n      Else, this permutation is invalid.\n\nProceed until l reaches n-1.\n\nIf a permutation leads to a full assignment, then we can mark this as a possible solution.\n\nOnce all permutations are tried, pick any valid one.\n\nBut wait, the initial permutation may not be unique. For example, for l=1, if the two strings are the same (but that's impossible because the problem says that for each l, there are exactly two strings, which implies that they're different).\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the input has exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for l=1, the two strings are different.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we have two possibilities.\n\nBut perhaps for some cases, only one permutation will work.\n\nOnce I have the correct assignment for each l, I can map each input string to 'P' or 'S' based on whether it's assigned as a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how to manage the order of the input strings, since the input is arbitrary.\n\nWait, the output needs to be a string where the i-th character corresponds to the i-th input string. So for each input string, regardless of its length, I need to determine if it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nWait, no. Each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s, but not both. So for each string in the input, it's either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because each string is either a prefix (for some l) or a suffix (for some m). But for the output, each string is marked as P or S depending on whether it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input consists of all the prefixes and suffixes of s. So each string is a prefix for some l or a suffix for some m.\n\nSo for the output, each string is either P or S.\n\nSo, after determining for each l, which string is the prefix and which is the suffix, I can go through each input string and check for each l whether it's the prefix or suffix of that l.\n\nWait, but the input may contain multiple strings of the same length. So for each string, I can determine whether it's the prefix for its length or the suffix.\n\nSo, for example, for l=2, if the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba', and in the assignment 'ab' is the prefix and 'ba' is the suffix. Then, the input strings of length 2 are 'ab' and 'ba', so their output will be 'PP' and 'SS' respectively.\n\nWait, no. Because each string is either a prefix or a suffix for its own length. So for l=2, one is the prefix of s, the other is the suffix. So for the output, the two strings of length 2 will be marked as P and S.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- For each l, determine which of the two strings is the prefix (P) and which is the suffix (S).\n\n- For each input string, check its length. Then, for that length l, if the string is the prefix, mark as P; else, mark as S.\n\nThus, the output is built by iterating over each input string in order, checking for their length l, and whether they are the prefix for l or the suffix.\n\nSo the main challenge is correctly determining for each l which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nSo back to the algorithm.\n\nImplementing the initial permutation approach:\n\n- For l=1, the two strings are a and b. We can try two possibilities:\n\n   Case 1: a is the prefix, b is the suffix.\n\n   Case 2: a is the suffix, b is the prefix.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of l=1 is the last character of s, and the prefix is the first. So in case 1, a is the first character, b is the last. In case 2, a is the last, b is the first.\n\nThen, for each case, proceed to l=2.\n\nFor l=2, we have two strings. Let's say the two options are c and d. We need to determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nIn case 1:\n\n- The prefix for l=2 must start with a (the prefix of l=1).\n\n- The suffix for l=2 must end with b (the suffix of l=1).\n\nSo for the two strings c and d, we check:\n\nif c starts with a and d ends with b, then c could be the new prefix, d the new suffix.\n\nOR\n\nif d starts with a and c ends with b, then d is the new prefix, c is the new suffix.\n\nWait, but for l=2, the two strings must be one prefix and one suffix. So in this scenario, only one of the two possibilities above is valid.\n\nSo for each case, we need to see if the two strings can be split into a prefix and suffix that aligns with the previous step.\n\nIf yes, proceed. Else, this permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, the steps for each permutation:\n\nStart with l=1, and two options (prefix_p1 and suffix_p1, or suffix_p1 and prefix_p1).\n\nThen, for each l from 2 to n-1:\n\n   Take the two strings for this l.\n\n   Check for each possible assignment (string as prefix, other as suffix):\n\n      does the prefix string start with previous prefix?\n\n      does the suffix string end with previous suffix?\n\n   If exactly one such pair exists, proceed.\n\n   Else, invalid.\n\nSo, the code can represent this as follows.\n\nBut how to represent the initial permutation? For each of the two possibilities at l=1, we can try to build a chain of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can group the input strings by their lengths. For each l, store the list of two strings.\n\nWe can create a dictionary, where the key is the length l, and the value is a list of the two strings for that l.\n\nSo, for example, in Python:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nstrings = []\nlength_map = defaultdict(list)\nfor _ in range(2*n - 2):\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n    l = len(s)\n    length_map[l].append(s)\n\nNow, for each l, length_map[l] has two strings.\n\nNext, for each permutation of l=1, try to build the possible chains.\n\nEach permutation is a tuple indicating which string is the prefix and which is the suffix for l=1.\n\nThere are two possibilities:\n\nprefix_first = (strings[0], strings[1])\n\nsuffix_first = (strings[1], strings[0])\n\nWait, no. For l=1, the two strings are s1 and s2. So the two permutations are:\n\nCase 1: s1 is the prefix (p1), s2 is the suffix (s1).\n\nCase 2: s2 is the prefix (p1), s1 is the suffix (s1).\n\nWait, but in case 2, the suffix is s1, which is the previous p1 for l=1? No, in case 2, s2 is the prefix for l=1, s1 is the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the current state as (current_prefix, current_suffix), and for each l, try to update this state.\n\nSo, for each permutation of l=1, we can create a state (p1, s1) or (s1, p1), but I think that's not the correct way.\n\nWait, no. For l=1, the prefix is the first character of s, and the suffix is the last.\n\nSo, for the two strings of l=1, one is the prefix (first character) and the other is the suffix (last character).\n\nSo, in case 1: s1 is the prefix, s2 is the suffix.\n\nIn case 2: s2 is the prefix, s1 is the suffix.\n\nSo, for each case, we can attempt to build the chain.\n\nSo, for each case:\n\ncurrent_prefix = case_p1\n\ncurrent_suffix = case_s1\n\nThen, for l=2:\n\nTake the two strings for l=2: s_a and s_b.\n\nWe need to find if one of them is a prefix (starts with current_prefix) and the other is a suffix (ends with current_suffix).\n\nSo, check if s_a starts with current_prefix and s_b ends with current_suffix → then s_a is new prefix, s_b is new suffix.\n\nOR if s_b starts with current_prefix and s_a ends with current_suffix → then s_b is new prefix, s_a is new suffix.\n\nIf exactly one of these is possible, proceed.\n\nElse, this case is invalid.\n\nWe can proceed similarly for higher l's.\n\nSo, the code can represent this with a recursive approach or iterative.\n\nBut for n up to 100, even a recursive approach would be acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read all the input strings and group them by their lengths.\n\n2. For each of the two possible initial assignments (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix; or s2 as prefix, s1 as suffix), attempt to build the chain up to l =n-1.\n\n3. For each assignment, check if all l's up to n-1 can be consistently built.\n\n4. Once a valid assignment is found, mark each string in the input as P or S based on whether it's the prefix or suffix for its length.\n\n5. Output the resulting string.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\nThen, group by length:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nlength_groups = defaultdict(list)\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    length_groups[l].append(s)\n\nThen, for each l from 1 to n-1, we have two strings.\n\nNow, for the initial cases.\n\nWe can generate the two possible initial assignments:\n\ncandidates = []\n# case 1: s1 is prefix, s2 is suffix for l=1\ncase1_p = length_groups[1][0]\ncase1_s = length_groups[1][1]\ncandidates.append( (case1_p, case1_s) )\n\n# case2: s2 is prefix, s1 is suffix for l=1\ncase2_p = length_groups[1][1]\ncase2_s = length_groups[1][0]\ncandidates.append( (case2_p, case2_s) )\n\nWait, no. Because for case 2, the suffix is s1, which is the second string of l=1.\n\nBut in the initial assignment, for l=1, the suffix is the last character of s. So in case 1, the suffix is s2, and in case 2, the suffix is s1.\n\nWait, no. Because in case 1, the prefix is s1 (len 1), suffix is s2 (len 1).\n\nIn case 2, the prefix is s2 (len 1), suffix is s1 (len 1).\n\nWait, but the suffix is the last character of the string. So in case 1, s's last character is s2. In case 2, it's s1.\n\nBut how do I know which is correct? It depends on the rest of the structure.\n\nSo, for each candidate in candidates, proceed to build the chain.\n\nNow, for each candidate, we can try to build the sequence of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFor each candidate, we can have a variable that tracks the current expected prefix and suffix.\n\nWe can represent this as a list, where for each l, we store whether the string is a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut perhaps, for each candidate, we can simulate the process.\n\nLet's write a function to check if a candidate is valid.\n\ndef is_valid_candidate(c_p, c_s, length_groups, n):\n    # c_p is the prefix for l=1, c_s is the suffix for l=1.\n    # We need to build the prefixes and suffixes for l=2 to n-1.\n    # For each l from 2 to n-1:\n    # the two strings must be able to form a prefix and suffix that extend the current chain.\n    \n    # Initialize the current prefix and suffix.\n    current_p = c_p\n    current_s = c_s\n    \n    # For each l from 2 to n-1:\n    for l in range(2, n):\n        # Get the two strings for this l\n        possible_ps = length_groups[l]\n        # The two strings are possible_p and possible_s\n        possible_p = possible_ps[0]\n        possible_s = possible_ps[1]\n        \n        # Check if possible_p can be the new prefix, possible_s the suffix.\n        # Or possible_s can be the prefix, possible_p the suffix.\n        \n        # Check condition for possible_p as prefix:\n        cond1_p = possible_p.startswith(current_p)\n        cond1_s = possible_s.endswith(current_s)\n        # Check if possible_p is a valid prefix and possible_s is a valid suffix.\n        # So, if cond1_p and cond1_s, then possible_p is new prefix, possible_s is new suffix.\n        # Else, check if possible_s is a valid prefix and possible_p is a valid suffix.\n        # So, cond2_p = possible_s starts with current_p\n        # cond2_s = possible_p ends with current_s.\n        cond2_p = possible_s.startswith(current_p)\n        cond2_s = possible_p.endswith(current_s)\n        \n        # Now, check if exactly one of the two options is possible.\n        if (cond1_p and cond1_s) != (cond2_p and cond2_s):\n            # Only one of the two options is valid.\n            # So, proceed with the valid option.\n            if cond1_p and cond1_s:\n                current_p = possible_p\n                current_s = possible_s\n            elif cond2_p and cond2_s:\n                current_p = possible_s\n                current_s = possible_p\n            else:\n                # Neither option is valid. So this candidate is invalid.\n                return False\n        else:\n            # Both options are valid or both are invalid. But according to problem statement, exactly one is valid.\n            # So, if both are valid, then it's ambiguous, but the problem says it's unique.\n            # Thus, this case shouldn't happen.\n            # Or perhaps the problem allows for multiple valid candidates, but the output can be any.\n            # So, in that case, any can be chosen.\n            # Hmm, but according to the problem statement, the input is valid, so for each l, exactly one option is valid.\n            # So, in practice, for each l, exactly one of the two options is valid.\n            # So, the above condition should never be true.\n            # So, if cond1_p and cond1_s == cond2_p and cond2_s, then it's invalid.\n            # So, return False.\n            return False\n    # All l's processed successfully.\n    return True\n\nWait, but in the function, for each l, after checking the two possibilities, we set current_p and current_s accordingly. But what if both possibilities are valid? According to the problem statement, this shouldn't happen, as the input is valid.\n\nSo, for the function, for each l, exactly one of the two possibilities must be valid. So the function can proceed.\n\nNow, the function returns True if the candidate is valid.\n\nSo, the code can iterate over the two possible candidates, and for each, check if the function returns True.\n\nOnce a valid candidate is found, we can proceed to build the output.\n\nSo, let's say for the first candidate (case 1), the function returns True.\n\nThen, for each string in the input, we can determine whether it's a prefix or suffix by checking for its length.\n\nWait, no. Because for each string, it's either a prefix or a suffix for its own length.\n\nWait, for example, for a string of length 3, it's either the prefix of s (so it's the first 3 characters) or the suffix (last 3).\n\nSo, for each string, determine for its length l whether it's the prefix or suffix.\n\nSo, for each string s in the input:\n\nl = len(s)\n\nlook up in the length_groups for l. The two strings are the possible prefix and suffix for that l.\n\nIf s is equal to the current_p for that l, then it's a prefix (P), else it's a suffix (S).\n\nWait, but in the function, the current_p and current_s are built step by step.\n\nWait, no. For each l, the current_p and current_s are determined, and for the l's group, the two strings are known.\n\nSo, for each string s in the input:\n\nl = len(s)\n\ngroup = length_groups[l]\n\nif s == current_p for that l → it's a prefix (P)\n\nelse → it's a suffix (S)\n\nWait, but how do I get the current_p and current_s for each l? Because for each l, the current_p is the one that was selected during the function's processing.\n\nSo, perhaps the function can return not just a boolean, but also the entire chain of current_p and current_s for each l.\n\nBut that's complicating things.\n\nAlternative approach: once a candidate is valid, we can track the current_p and current_s for each l as we process them.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to modify the function to return the entire chain.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to, once a candidate is valid, build the chain step by step.\n\nSo, for the candidate, we can simulate the process, and for each l, track the current_p and current_s.\n\nOnce the function returns True, we can then reconstruct the entire chain.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\ndef get_chain(c_p, c_s, length_groups, n):\n    chain_p = {}\n    chain_s = {}\n    chain_p[1] = c_p\n    chain_s[1] = c_s\n    for l in range(2, n):\n        possible_ps = length_groups[l]\n        possible_p = possible_ps[0]\n        possible_s = possible_ps[1]\n        \n        # Check if possible_p can be the new prefix, possible_s the suffix.\n        cond1_p = possible_p.startswith(chain_p[l-1])\n        cond1_s = possible_s.endswith(chain_s[l-1])\n        if cond1_p and cond1_s:\n            chain_p[l] = possible_p\n            chain_s[l] = possible_s\n            continue\n        \n        # Else, check if possible_s can be the new prefix, possible_p the suffix.\n        cond2_p = possible_s.startswith(chain_p[l-1])\n        cond2_s = possible_p.endswith(chain_s[l-1])\n        if cond2_p and cond2_s:\n            chain_p[l] = possible_s\n            chain_s[l] = possible_p\n            continue\n        \n        # If neither condition is met, this candidate is invalid.\n        # But since the function is called only when is_valid_candidate returns True, this shouldn't happen.\n        return None\n    return chain_p, chain_s\n\nWait, but again, this function is called only when the candidate is valid.\n\nSo, for the candidate that is valid, this function returns the chain_p and chain_s for each l.\n\nOnce we have that, for each input string s, we can determine whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nWait, but for each string s in the input, its length is l, and in the chain for l, the prefix is chain_p[l], the suffix is chain_s[l].\n\nSo, for each s in the input:\n\nif s == chain_p[l], then it's a prefix (P)\n\nelse, it's a suffix (S)\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the two strings in length_groups[l] are the possible prefix and suffix. So, for each string in the input, it's either the prefix or the suffix for that l.\n\nWait, no. Because the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes of s. So for each l, exactly two strings are present: the prefix of l, and the suffix of l.\n\nWait, no. Because the input has 2n-2 strings, which for l=1 to n-1, each has two strings.\n\nWait, for each l, the two strings are the possible prefix and suffix for that l.\n\nBut when building the chain, for each l, we've determined which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nThus, for each string in the input, for its length l, it's either the prefix (chain_p[l]) or the suffix (chain_s[l]).\n\nSo, for each input string s:\n\nl = len(s)\n\nif s == chain_p[l]: output 'P'\n\nelse: output 'S'\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 strings.\n\nGroup by length.\n\nFor each of the two possible initial assignments (case1 and case2):\n\n   simulate the chain.\n\n   if the chain is valid, proceed.\n\nOnce a valid chain is found, for each input string, determine if it's the prefix or suffix of its length.\n\nBuild the output string accordingly.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nlength_groups = defaultdict(list)\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    length_groups[l].append(s)\n\n# Generate the two possible initial cases.\ncase1_p = length_groups[1][0]\ncase1_s = length_groups[1][1]\ncase2_p = length_groups[1][1]\ncase2_s = length_groups[1][0]\n\nvalid = False\nbest_chain_p = {}\nbest_chain_s = {}\n\n# Try case1\ncurrent_p = case1_p\ncurrent_s = case1_s\nvalid_case1 = True\nfor l in range(2, n):\n    possible_ps = length_groups[l]\n    possible_p = possible_ps[0]\n    possible_s = possible_ps[1]\n    \n    # Check if possible_p is prefix, possible_s suffix.\n    cond1_p = possible_p.startswith(current_p)\n    cond1_s = possible_s.endswith(current_s)\n    if cond1_p and cond1_s:\n        best_chain_p[l] = possible_p\n        best_chain_s[l] = possible_s\n        current_p = possible_p\n        current_s = possible_s\n        continue\n    \n    # Else, check if possible_s is prefix, possible_p is suffix.\n    cond2_p = possible_s.startswith(current_p)\n    cond2_s = possible_p.endswith(current_s)\n    if cond2_p and cond2_s:\n        best_chain_p[l] = possible_s\n        best_chain_s[l] = possible_p\n        current_p = possible_s\n        current_s = possible_p\n        continue\n    \n    # Neither condition met: invalid.\n    valid_case1 = False\n    break\n\nif valid_case1:\n    valid = True\n    best_chain_p[1] = case1_p\n    best_chain_s[1] = case1_s\n    # Fill in the rest up to n-1\n    # Wait, in the loop above, we filled up to l =n-1?\n    # Because in the loop, l runs from 2 to n-1.\n    # So, for n=5, l runs 2,3,4.\n    # So, for l=1 to 4, all covered.\n    # So the chain is built correctly.\n\nelif not valid:\n    # Try case2\n    current_p = case2_p\n    current_s = case2_s\n    valid_case2 = True\n    for l in range(2, n):\n        possible_ps = length_groups[l]\n        possible_p = possible_ps[0]\n        possible_s = possible_ps[1]\n        \n        # Check if possible_p is prefix, possible_s suffix.\n        cond1_p = possible_p.startswith(current_p)\n        cond1_s = possible_s.endswith(current_s)\n        if cond1_p and cond1_s:\n            best_chain_p[l] = possible_p\n            best_chain_s[l] = possible_s\n            current_p = possible_p\n            current_s = possible_s\n            continue\n        \n        # Else, check if possible_s is prefix, possible_p is suffix.\n        cond2_p = possible_s.startswith(current_p)\n        cond2_s = possible_p.endswith(current_s)\n        if cond2_p and cond2_s:\n            best_chain_p[l] = possible_s\n            best_chain_s[l] = possible_p\n            current_p = possible_s\n            current_s = possible_p\n            continue\n        \n        # Neither condition met: invalid.\n        valid_case2 = False\n        break\n\nif valid:\n    # Now, for each string in the input, determine if it's a prefix or suffix.\n    output = []\n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if s == best_chain_p[l]:\n            output.append('P')\n        else:\n            output.append('S')\n    print(''.join(output))\nelse:\n    # This should not happen as per problem statement.\n    # But just in case, perhaps try another approach.\n    # Alternatively, perhaps the code can handle other cases.\n    pass\n\nWait, but in the code above, after processing case1, if it's valid, then the code proceeds.

One string could be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n3. **Chain Building**: For each subsequent length from 2 to n-1, check if the current strings can extend the chain consistently with the previous assignments. Each valid string must start with the previous prefix or end with the previous suffix.\n4. **Validation**: Ensure that each assignment is consistent and valid.

We then consider two possible initial assignments for the first character (prefix and suffix). For each subsequent length, we check if the strings can form a consistent chain. If one of the initial assignments leads to a valid chain, we use it to determine the output. Each string is marked as 'P' or 'S' based on whether it matches the determined prefix or suffix for its respective length.",
