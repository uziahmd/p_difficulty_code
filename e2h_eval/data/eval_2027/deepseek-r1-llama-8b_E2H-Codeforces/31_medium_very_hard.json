Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero, but the absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But since some are missing, we need to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, wait. The initial set includes all possible integers from -x to x. So Vanya had infinitely many of each. But now, he only found n of them, and we need to compute the minimal number of more cards he must find such that when added, the sum becomes zero.\n\nSo, the sum S of the found cards is a certain value. We need to find how many additional cards with values in [-x, x] can be added so that the total sum is zero.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero.\" Oh, right, but initially, he had all the cards. Now, he found n of them, and the sum of those n is S. We need to find the minimal number of more cards (each with some integer between -x and x) such that when added to S, the total is zero. So the sum after adding is S + sum_of_added = 0 → sum_of_added = -S.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given a target T = -S, find the minimal number of terms, each between -x and x, whose sum is exactly T.\n\nWhat's the approach here?\n\nLet me think: for each term, the maximum we can contribute in absolute value is x. So to reach T, the minimal number of terms is ceiling(|T| / x), but also considering the sign.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because if T is positive, each term can add up to x, so the minimal number would be |T| / x, rounded up. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 3 terms (2+2+1). But wait, wait. No, because each term can be at most x, but you can choose any values as long as their sum is T.\n\nWait, no. The minimal number of terms is the smallest k such that |T| ≤ k * x. Because each term can contribute up to x towards the sum. So for T=5, x=2: 5 <= k*2 → k ≥ 3. So yes, 3 terms.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? It doesn't matter; the same logic applies.\n\nSo the minimal number of terms k is the smallest integer such that |T| ≤ k * x. So k is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, but let's test this.\n\nCase 1: T = 3, x = 2 → 3/2 is 1.5, so ceiling is 2. So 2 terms, each 2, sum is 4 which is more than 3. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, no— wait, 2 terms can sum to 3. Like 2 and 1. Each is within x. So yeah, 2 is enough.\n\nAnother case: T=5, x=3. 5/3 is ~1.666, ceiling is 2. 3+2=5, yes.\n\nAnother case: T=4, x=3. Ceiling(4/3)=2. 3+1=4, yes.\n\nWhat about T=0? Then no additional cards are needed. So that's a base case.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then sum is already zero, so output 0.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S.\n3. If T is zero, return 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal k where k is the smallest integer such that k >= |T| / x. But since k must be an integer, we take the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, but wait— let's see another example.\n\nIn the sample input 1:\n\nInput is '3 2\\n-1 1 2'. So the sum is (-1) + 1 + 2 = 2. So T = -2.\n\nWe need to find the minimal k where the sum of k terms, each at most 2, adds up to -2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the target is T = -2. So we need the sum of the added cards to be -2. So each added card can be any integer between -2 and 2, inclusive.\n\nWait, but the sum of the added cards needs to be -2. So the minimal number of cards is 1: just pick -2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 1.\n\nAnother sample: second input is '2 3\\n-2 -2'. Sum is -4. So T = 4. x is 3.\n\nSo 4 divided by 3 is approximately 1.333. Ceiling is 2. So two cards, each 2: 2+2=4. So output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCalculate S as the sum of the given cards.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is 0: output 0.\n\nElse, compute |T| / x. If |T| is exactly divisible by x, then k is |T| /x. Otherwise, it's |T|/x + 1, but wait, wait: for example, |T|=5, x=3: 5/3 is 1.666..., so ceiling is 2.\n\nWait, no: 5/3 is approximately 1.666, so the minimal k is 2.\n\nSo in code, how do I compute this?\n\nk = (abs(T) + x -1) // x\n\nYes, because adding x-1 before division effectively rounds up.\n\nFor example:\n\nabs(T) = 4, x=3: 4+2 =6 → 6//3=2.\n\nabs(T)=5, x=3:5+2=7//3=2 (since 7/3 is 2.333, integer division gives 2).\n\nWait, but 5 is 3*1 + 2, so 2 terms.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and x.\n\n- Read the list of n integers.\n\n- Compute S = sum of the list.\n\n- T = -S.\n\n- If T == 0: print 0.\n\n- Else:\n\n   compute abs_T = absolute value of T.\n\n   compute k = ceil(abs_T / x) → which can be done as (abs_T + x -1) // x.\n\n   print k.\n\nWait, but wait: is there any case where even though k is sufficient, the individual terms can't sum up to T?\n\nNo, because each term can be up to x. So for example, T= x*k - something. Wait, no, because you can always distribute the sum across the k terms.\n\nWait, for example, suppose T is 7, x is 3, k is 3: 3*3=9 >=7. So you can have 3,3,1.\n\nBut what if T is 10 and x is 3, k=4: 3*4=12 ≥10. So 3+3+3+1=10.\n\nSo yes, it's always possible.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: All cards sum to zero.\n\nn=2, x=5, cards are 3 and -3. So S=0. T=0. So output 0.\n\nTest case 2: Sum is 5, x=5. So T=-5. So k=1.\n\nBecause 5 is exactly 5, so one card with -5.\n\nTest case3: Sum is 6, x=5. T=-6. So k=2, because 6/5 is 1.2, ceiling is 2. So two cards: 5 and 1. Or 5 and 1, etc.\n\nWait, but 5 is allowed? Because x is 5, yes.\n\nWait, but wait: the added cards can have any value between -x and x. So 5 is allowed if x is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0, output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 4, x=2. So T=-4. So 4/2=2, so k=2. Two cards of -2 each.\n\nAnother case: sum is 7, x=3. T=-7. 7/3 is ~2.333, so k=3. 3+3+1=7. So three cards.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the first line as n and x.\n\nSecond line is the list of n integers.\n\nCompute S as sum of the list.\n\nT = -S.\n\nif T == 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\nabs_T = abs(T)\n\nk = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\nprint(k)\n\nWait, but wait: what if T is negative? Does that affect anything? No, because we take absolute value.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S is (-1+1+2)=2. T =-2.\n\nabs_T=2. x=2.\n\nk = (2 + 2-1)//2 → (3)//2=1. So output 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4. T=4.\n\nabs_T=4. x=3.\n\n(4+3-1)/3 → 6/3=2. Output 2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, x=5. Card is 5. Sum is 5. T=-5. So k=1.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=3. So T=-5.\n\n(5 +3-1)/3 →7//3=2. So 2 cards.\n\nSo 5 can be achieved as 3+2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother edge case: when T is zero. For example, n=2, x=5, cards are 3 and -3. Sum is 0. So output 0.\n\nAnother case: T is very large. For example, n=1000, x=1. Sum is 1000, T=-1000. So k=1000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should be as follows.\n\nNow, implement it.\n\nRead the first line as n and x. Wait, the input is given as a single string, like '3 2\\n-1 1 2', but in code, perhaps read via stdin.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ns = sum(cards)\n\nt = -s\n\nif t ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    k = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the input, the first line is n and x, and the second line is the list. So the code as above is correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample inputs are given as:\n\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\nWait, but in reality, the input is read as two lines. So the code will read n and x from the first line, then the next line as the cards.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting it on the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nFirst line: 3 2.\n\nSecond line: -1 1 2.\n\nSum is 2. T is -2.\n\nabs_t=2.\n\nk=(2+2-1)//2 →3//2=1.\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nFirst line: 2 3.\n\nSecond line: -2 -2.\n\nSum is -4. T=4.\n\nabs_t=4.\n\nk=(4+3-1)//3 →6//3=2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, x=5.\n\ncard is 0. sum is 0. T=0. output 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, x=5. card is 5. sum is 5. T=-5. k=1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, x=5. card is 3. sum is 3. T=-3. k=1.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card has an integer value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Vanya found `n` cards, and each card has an integer value between -x and x. The goal is to find the minimum number of additional cards needed such that the total sum of all cards becomes zero.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum `S` of the found cards. The target sum for the additional cards should be `-S` to make the total sum zero.\n3. **Determine Minimum Cards**: To find the minimum number of additional cards required, we need to cover the absolute value of the target sum `|T|` where `T = -S`. The minimum number of cards is given by the ceiling of `|T| / x`, which can be computed efficiently using integer arithmetic as `(abs(T) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. The second line reads the values of the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum `S` of the found cards.\n3. **Target Calculation**: Calculate the target sum `T` as `-S`.\n4. **Check for Zero Sum**: If `T` is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Compute Minimum Cards**: For non-zero `T`, compute the minimum number of additional cards using the formula `(abs(T) + x - 1) // x` to ensure we round up when necessary.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently determine the minimum number of additional cards needed using simple arithmetic operations, making it both optimal and easy to understand.",
