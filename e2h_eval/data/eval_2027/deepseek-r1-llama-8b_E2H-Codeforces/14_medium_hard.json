He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then count how many such n's and list them.\n\nFirst, I think I need a way to compute Z(n) quickly. But for this problem, perhaps binary search can be used to find the range of n's that give exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, but how do I find the possible n's? Let me think: For a given m, the values of n that give exactly m zeros will form a consecutive range. So I need to find the smallest n where Z(n) = m and the largest n where Z(n) = m. The count will be (largest - smallest + 1), and the numbers from smallest to largest inclusive are the answers.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no such n? Like when m is too small or too large. Oh, but according to the problem statement, m can be as low as 1. Hmm, but for m=0, it's impossible because the minimum n is 1, which gives 0 trailing zeros.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, m starts from 1. So we don't have to handle m=0.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n2. Find the maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n3. If such n exists, then the count is (max_n - min_n + 1). Else, return 0.\n\nWait, but how do I find the min and max n?\n\nLet me think about how Z(n) behaves. As n increases, Z(n) also increases, but not always strictly. It might stay the same for some consecutive n's.\n\nFor example, let's see for m=5 in the sample input. The n's are 5,6,7,8,9. So Z(5)=5, Z(6)=5+1=6? Wait no, wait the sample input says for m=5, the output is 5 6 7 8 9. Wait, but wait, 5! is 120, which has one zero. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, in the note, the first sample input is ['1', '5'], but the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. Wait, that suggests that for m=1, the answer is 5 (since 5! has one zero?), but wait 5! is 120, which has one zero. Wait, but 6! is 720, which has one zero as well? No, wait 6! is 720, which has one trailing zero. Similarly, 7! is 5040, which has one. Wait, no, wait 7! is 5040, which ends with one zero? Or two?\n\nWait, 5! = 120 → one zero.\n6! = 720 → one zero.\n7! = 5040 → one zero.\nWait, no, wait 7 divided by 5 is 1, 25 is 0. So Z(7) is 1.\n\nWait but 10! is 3628800, which has two zeros. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the number of trailing zeros in n! is calculated as the sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... etc.\n\nSo for n=5: 5//5=1, 5//25=0, so total 1 zero.\n\nn=6: same as 5, so 1 zero.\n\nn=10: 10//5=2, 10//25=0, total 2.\n\nAh, right. So for n=5,6,7,8,9: each contributes 1 zero. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. But the sample shows that for m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9? Or wait, the sample input is ['1', '5'], but the output is two lines. The first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' which is the case for m=1. The second line is '0' which is for m=5.\n\nWait, but wait the first sample's output is:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that for m=1, the output is five numbers, but according to the note, in the first sample, 5! has 1 trailing zero. So why does the output include 5,6,7,8,9?\n\nAh, because the function Z(n) remains 1 for these consecutive n's. So for m=1, the n's that satisfy Z(n)=1 are 5,6,7,8,9. That's five numbers. So the output is 5 followed by the five numbers.\n\nWait, but the sample input is written as ['1', '5'] but the output is two lines. So perhaps the input is actually two test cases, but the output is two separate outputs. Or perhaps the input is a single line containing two integers, like m=1 and another m=5, but the output is two separate outputs.\n\nBut regardless, the problem is to process a single m and output the required information.\n\nSo, back to the problem: for a given m, find all n where Z(n) equals m. Then output k, followed by the k numbers.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use binary search to find the minimal and maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n\nBut how to perform this binary search?\n\nWe can precompute the maximum possible n that could have up to m trailing zeros. Since for m up to 1e5, n can be as high as 5*m (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero). So the upper bound for binary search can be something like 5*m.\n\nBut wait, for example, for m=5, the maximum n is 9, which is 5*5 +4=29? No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the upper bound can be set as 5*(m+1), just to cover all possibilities.\n\nWait, the maximum n for a given m is when Z(n) increases by 1 each step. So perhaps the upper bound can be 5*m, but perhaps higher. Alternatively, for binary search purposes, the upper limit can be set as 5*(m+1), which should be sufficient.\n\nSo, for each m, perform a binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of n where Z(n) = m.\n\nWait, but wait, how do I find the minimal n where Z(n) = m? Because Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. So once Z(n) reaches m, it may stay at m for several n's.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n2. Check if Z(n) is exactly m. If not, then no solution exists.\n\n3. Otherwise, find the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Binary search for the lower bound: find the first n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n- Once found, check if Z(n) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find the upper bound: the last n where Z(n) == m.\n\nOnce we have the lower and upper bounds, the count is upper - lower + 1.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search.\n\nImplementing the binary search for lower bound:\n\nWe can perform a binary search between low=0 and high=5*(m+1).\n\nIn each step, compute mid = (low + high)/2.\n\nCompute z = Z(mid).\n\nIf z < m, then we need to search higher. Set low = mid + 1.\n\nElse if z >= m, set high = mid.\n\nContinue until low <= high.\n\nAt the end, the minimal n is low.\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nThe standard binary search for the first occurrence where Z(n) >= m.\n\nSo, initialize low=0, high= some upper limit (like 5*(m+1)).\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   current_z = Z(mid)\n\n   if current_z < m:\n\n       low = mid + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       high = mid -1\n\nAfter the loop, the minimal n is low.\n\nOnce we have the minimal n, we need to check if Z(n) is equal to m.\n\nIf not, then there's no solution, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed to find the upper bound.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound:\n\nWe can binary search for the maximum n where Z(n) == m.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to find the minimal n where Z(n) > m, then subtract 1.\n\nBecause Z(n) increases as n increases, but sometimes jumps by more than 1.\n\nSo, find the first n where Z(n) > m. Then the maximum n is that n-1.\n\nSo, to find this, perform a binary search for the smallest n where Z(n) > m.\n\nThen, the maximum n is that n-1.\n\nBut since Z(n) is non-decreasing, this should work.\n\nAlternatively, during the same binary search as before, after finding the minimal n where Z(n) >= m, then look for the next n where Z(n) > m. The maximum n is between these two.\n\nSo, let's think of it as:\n\nOnce we have the minimal n where Z(n) >= m, we can call it 'start'.\n\nThen, we can find the minimal n where Z(n) > m, call it 'end'.\n\nThe maximum n is end -1.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Find start via binary search.\n\n- If Z(start) != m, output 0.\n\n- Else, find end via binary search where Z(end) > m.\n\n- The maximum n is end-1.\n\nThen, the count is (end - start).\n\nWait, because from start to end-1, inclusive, all have Z(n) = m.\n\nSo, the number of terms is (end-1 - start +1) = end - start.\n\nWait, no: for example, start=5, end=10, then numbers are 5,6,7,8,9,10-1=9. So 5 to9 is 5 numbers, which is 9-5+1=5.\n\nYes, so the count is end - start.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute start: the first n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n2. If Z(start) != m, output 0.\n\n3. Else, compute end: the first n where Z(n) > m.\n\n4. The numbers are from start to end-1.\n\n5. Output end - start as the count, followed by the numbers.\n\nSo, now, the problem is to implement this correctly.\n\nNow, the key part is implementing Z(n) efficiently.\n\nLet me write a helper function count_trailing_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the binary search functions.\n\nImplementing the first binary search for start:\n\ndef find_start(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m +1)\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid -1\n    return low\n\nWait, but after the loop, low will be the minimal n where Z(n)>=m.\n\nThen, check if Z(low) is m.\n\nIf not, no solution.\n\nElse, find end.\n\nTo find end, find the first n where Z(n) > m.\n\nSo, another binary search:\n\ndef find_end(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m +2)\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nWait, but after the loop, low will be the first n where Z(n) > m.\n\nSo, the maximum n is low-1.\n\nBut wait, what if low is 0? Well, in our case, m is at least 1.\n\nWait, let's test with m=1.\n\nCompute find_start(m=1):\n\nhigh is 5*(1+1)=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nmid = (0+10)//2=5.\n\nz=1.\n\nSince z>=m, set high=4.\n\nNext iteration: low=0, high=4.\n\nmid=2.\n\nz=0 <1 → low becomes 3.\n\nmid=(3+4)//2=3.5 → 3.\n\nz=0 <1 → low becomes4.\n\nmid=4: z=0<1 → low becomes5.\n\nNow, loop condition: low=5, high=4 → loop exits.\n\nSo, start=5.\n\nCheck Z(5)=1, which is m.\n\nThen, find_end(m=1):\n\nWe are looking for the first n where Z(n) >1.\n\nStart with low=0, high=5*(1+2)=15.\n\nLoop:\n\nmid=7 → Z(7)=1 ≤1 → low=8.\n\nmid=(8+15)//2=11.5 →11.\n\nZ(11)=2>1 → high=10.\n\nmid=(8+10)//2=9.\n\nZ(9)=1 ≤1 → low=10.\n\nmid=(10+10)//2=10 → Z(10)=2>1 → high=9.\n\nLoop exits, low=10.\n\nSo, end=10.\n\nThus, maximum n is 9.\n\nSo, numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nCompute find_start(m=5):\n\nhigh=5*(5+1)=30.\n\nFind the minimal n where Z(n)>=5.\n\nWait, let's compute Z(20): 20/5=4, 20/25=0 → total 4.\n\nZ(21)=4.\n\nWait, but Z(24)=4.\n\nZ(25)=6.\n\nSo, the minimal n where Z(n)>=5 is 25.\n\nWait, no. Because Z(25)=6>5. Wait, but perhaps earlier n's have Z(n)=5.\n\nWait, perhaps for m=5, the minimal n is 25.\n\nWait, let me compute Z(24): 24//5=4, 24//25=0 →4.\n\nZ(25)=5+5=6. So, wait, no.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me compute Z(25) correctly.\n\nZ(25) = 25//5 + 25//25 =5 +1=6.\n\nSo for m=5, the minimal n is 25.\n\nBut according to the sample, when m=5, the output is 0, meaning no n's satisfy.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the second output is '0' for m=5.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, wait the sample input is given as ['1','5'], but the output is two lines: the first line is 5 followed by 5,6,7,8,9, which is for m=1. The second line is 0, meaning for m=5, there are zero numbers.\n\nWait, that suggests that for m=5, no n satisfies Z(n)=5.\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, Z(25)=6, which is larger than 5. So perhaps there is no n where Z(n)=5.\n\nWait, let's compute Z(n) for n=20,21,22,23,24,25.\n\nn | Z(n)\n20 →4\n21→4\n22→4\n23→4\n24→4\n25→6\n\nSo, for m=5, no n exists. Hence, the output is 0.\n\nSo, the binary search for start would return 25, which has Z=6>5, hence, no solution.\n\nSo, the code would correctly output 0.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nWhat's Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, ..., Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7.\n\nSo, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo, for m=6, the code would return 5, followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nSo, the code needs to correctly find this.\n\nThus, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nImplement the helper function count_trailing_zeros.\n\nImplement the binary searches for start and end.\n\nHandle the case when start exceeds m, but wait, no: after the binary search, start is the minimal n where Z(n)>=m. So, if Z(start) is m, proceed.\n\nElse, output 0.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute start = find_start(m).\n\nif count_trailing_zeros(start) !=m → print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   compute end = find_end(m).\n\n   the numbers are from start to end-1.\n\n   print (end - start) followed by the numbers.\n\nSo, in Python, the code will be:\n\nImplement the helper function.\n\nImplement the two binary search functions.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for handling large numbers, the binary search is efficient enough.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: m=1.\n\nAs in the sample, the code should output 5 numbers:5,6,7,8,9.\n\nEdge case 2: m=0 → but m is at least 1, so no need to handle.\n\nEdge case 3: m=6 → 5 numbers.\n\nEdge case 4: m= a very large value, say 1e5.\n\nBut the code should handle it.\n\nAnother edge case: m=7.\n\nZ(25)=6, Z(26)=6, ..., Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7.\n\nSo, for m=7, the start is 30.\n\nCheck Z(30)=7, yes.\n\nfind_end(m=7) will find the first n where Z(n)>7.\n\nCompute Z(30)=7, Z(31)=7, Z(32)=7, Z(33)=7, Z(34)=7, Z(35)=8.\n\nSo, the end is 35.\n\nThus, the numbers are 30,31,32,33,34 → 5 numbers.\n\nWait, wait, 30 to 34 is 5 numbers, but wait, 30 is included.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should output 5 followed by 30 31 32 33 34.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nNow, implementing the functions.\n\nWait, but in the code, for find_end, the initial high is 5*(m+2). Let's see: for m=6, the high is 5*(6+2)=40.\n\nBut in the case of m=6, the end is 30, because Z(30)=7>6.\n\nWait, no. For m=6, the end is the first n where Z(n)>6.\n\nSo, for n=30, Z(n)=7>6. So, the end is 30.\n\nThus, the maximum n is 29.\n\nWait, no. Because for n=29, Z(n)=6.\n\nWait, no, wait, n=29: 29//5=5, 29//25=1 → total 6.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 →7.\n\nSo, for m=6, end is 30.\n\nThus, the maximum n is 29.\n\nThus, the code correctly returns numbers from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute start = find_start(m).\n\nif Z(start)!=m: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   end = find_end(m).\n\n   print (end - start) followed by the numbers from start to end-1.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut, in Python, reading the input is a bit tricky because the input is read as a string, and we need to split into individual m's.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a single line containing an integer m.\n\nSo, in the code, read the input as a string, split into parts, convert each to integer.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as ['1', '5'], which is a bit confusing. But in reality, the input is a single line, which is read as a string, then split into m.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_start(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m +1)\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid -1\n    return low\n\ndef find_end(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m +2)\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m_list = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    for m in m_list:\n        start = find_start(m)\n        if count_trailing_zeros(start) != m:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        end = find_end(m)\n        count = end - start\n        if count ==0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        print(count)\n        # Now print the numbers from start to end-1\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(start, end))))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output for m=1 is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for m=5, it's '0'.\n\nBut in the code above, for each m in m_list, the code prints 'count' and then the numbers on the same line, but separated by space.\n\nWait, but the sample shows that for m=1, the output is a single line with '5' followed by the numbers, but the code as written would print the count and then the numbers on separate lines.\n\nWait, the sample shows:\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that for the first m=1, the output is a line starting with 5, then a newline, then the next line is '0'.\n\nWait, but the problem expects for each m in the input, to output a line with the count followed by the numbers, separated by spaces, or 0 if none.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\n\"Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\nSo, for each test case, the output is a line with k, followed by the k integers, space-separated.\n\nSo, in the code, for each m, we need to print a line with the count, then the numbers.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is two lines, implying that the input was two m's.\n\nSo, the code should process each m in the input line, and for each, output a line with the required information.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nFor m=1:\n\nstart=5, end=10.\n\nNumbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo, the code will print 5 followed by the 5 numbers.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nstart=25, but Z(25)=6>5. So, no solution, output 0.\n\nSo, code correctly handles.\n\nAnother test case, m=6:\n\nstart=25, which has Z(25)=6.\n\nend is found as 30.\n\nThus, numbers are 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nCount is 5, so output is 5 followed by these 5 numbers.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nCompute Z(n) for various n.\n\nn=10 → 2, n=11→2, n=12→2, etc., up to n=14.\n\nn=15: 3.\n\nSo, for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 →5 numbers.\n\nSo, code should output 5 followed by these.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if m is 0? But the problem states m ≥1, so no.\n\n- Handling very large m, but the binary search is O(log n) which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's implement it.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the case when start is found, and Z(start) is m, then end is found. Then, the code prints end - start, followed by the numbers from start to end-1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n",

The solution involves using binary search to efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy this condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeroes**: The function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions from each power of 5 (i.e., \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots \\)).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Range**: We use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m \\) (denoted as `start`). If this count does not exactly equal \\( m \\), there are no valid \\( n \\) values. Otherwise, we find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count exceeds \\( m \\) (denoted as `end`). The valid range of \\( n \\) values is from `start` to `end - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_start(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return low\n\ndef find_end(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 2)\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m_list = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    for m in m_list:\n        start = find_start(m)\n        if count_trailing_zeros(start) != m:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        end = find_end(m)\n        count = end - start\n        if count == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        print(count)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(start, end))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line, split into individual integers, and processed one by one.\n2. **Finding Start and End**: Using binary search, we determine the smallest \\( n \\) (`start`) where the number of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m \\) and the smallest \\( n \\) (`end`) where the count exceeds \\( m \\).\n3. **Output**: For each \\( m \\), we check if `start` actually gives exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If so, we compute the range of valid \\( n \\) values and print the count followed by the values. If not, we print 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable for large values of \\( m \\).",
