In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, each with a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). The goal is to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu, which is either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, right. So the task is to determine, for each of the three possible sets of starting tiles (since the input is three separate lines), what's the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Looking back, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. So the initial hand consists of exactly three tiles. So for each of these three, I need to compute the minimal draws required, and output those three numbers.\n\nSo the output is three integers, each corresponding to one of the three input lines. For example, in the sample input, each line is a different scenario, and the outputs are 0, 0, 1.\n\nSo first, I'll need to process each of the three initial hands separately.\n\nMy approach should be: for each initial hand, generate all possible ways adding 0,1,2,... tiles such that the total is at least four tiles (since three plus added ones), and check if any of them forms a mentsu. Then find the smallest number of added tiles needed.\n\nBut considering that the number of possibilities could be large, we need an efficient way to check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this by considering all possible triplets or sequences that could be formed with the current tiles and the additional ones.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each of the three initial hands, I'll consider all possible ways of adding tiles, and see if any of the resulting sets includes a mentsu.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, I can represent the tiles as a multiset.\n\nWait, but when adding new tiles, they can be any of the 27 possible (9*3) tiles. So the problem is to find the minimal k such that the union of the initial tiles and k drawn tiles contains a mentsu.\n\nBut trying all possible combinations is computationally expensive because k can be up to, say, a lot. But maybe we can model this differently.\n\nPerhaps, for each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), calculate how many tiles are missing from the initial hand, and then the minimal k is the maximum between 0 and (3 minus the count of tiles in the initial hand for that mentsu).\n\nThen, among all possible mentsus, find the one with the smallest required k, and the overall minimal k is the minimal over all.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for each possible mentsu (each possible triplet or sequence), we can compute how many tiles from that mentsu are already present in the initial hand. The required draws would be the number of tiles needed to complete that mentsu. Then, the minimal required across all possible mentsus is the answer.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Because the initial hand may have more than one mentsu after adding some tiles, but the minimal is the smallest needed for any.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each initial hand:\n\n1. Generate all possible mentsus (triplets and sequences).\n2. For each mentsu, calculate how many tiles from that mentsu are already present in the initial hand.\n3. The required draws for that mentsu is max(0, 3 - count).\n4. Find the minimal required draws across all mentsus.\n5. The answer for this hand is that minimal value.\n\nBut wait, not exactly. Because for a triplet, you need three of the same tile. So for a triplet 'A', the count is the number of A's in the initial hand. So required is 3 - count. But for a sequence, it's a set of three distinct tiles, so the count is how many of the three are present in the initial hand.\n\nWait, no. For a sequence like 1m,2m,3m, the initial hand might have 1m and 2m. So the count is 2. So required is 1 more tile (either 3m).\n\nBut for a triplet, like 3p,3p,3p: if the initial hand has two 3p, then required is 1 more.\n\nSo for each possible mentsu, compute the required draws, then take the minimal across all possible mentsus.\n\nBut wait, another thing: the mentsu can be any possible triplet or sequence. So the initial hand may contribute to multiple mentsus, but we're looking for the minimal required.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each initial hand, we need to:\n\n- Enumerate all possible triplets (all same tiles) and sequences (consecutive in same suit), and for each, compute how many tiles are needed beyond the current hand.\n\nThen, the minimal required is the minimal among all these.\n\nSo, let's structure this.\n\nFirst, for each initial hand, which is a list of three tiles:\n\nWe can represent each tile as a tuple, e.g., ('1', 'm') becomes (1, 'm'). Or perhaps better to convert each tile into a numerical representation for easier processing.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nRead the three input lines. Each line is a single string, e.g., '1s 2s 3s' represents three tiles. So split each string into individual tiles.\n\nFor each of the three initial hands (each being a list of three tiles), process as follows:\n\n1. Preprocess the initial hand into a frequency dictionary. For each tile, count how many times it appears. So for example, if the initial hand has two '9m', the frequency of '9m' is 2.\n\n2. For all possible mentsus, compute how many tiles are needed.\n\nSo, generate all possible mentsus:\n\na) Triplet mentsus: for each suit, each number 1-9, create a triplet consisting of three copies of that tile.\n\nb) Sequence mentsus: for each suit, for each starting number from 1 to 7, create the triplet of consecutive numbers.\n\nSo for each suit, and for each possible start (1<=start<=7), the sequence is (start, start+1, start+2).\n\nEach of these is a possible mentsu.\n\nNow, for each mentsu, calculate how many tiles are present in the initial hand.\n\nFor a triplet mentsu, it's the count of that specific tile in the initial hand. For example, mentsu is [3m,3m,3m]. The count is the number of 3m tiles in the initial hand.\n\nFor a sequence mentsu, like 1m,2m,3m, the count is the sum of the presence of each of these three tiles in the initial hand. For example, if initial hand has 1m and 2m, count is 2.\n\nSo for each mentsu, required tiles = max(0, 3 - count).\n\nBut wait, no. Because for a triplet, the count is the number of that specific tile in the initial hand. For a triplet mentsu, the count can't be more than 3, but since the initial hand only has 3 tiles, that's possible.\n\nWait, but the initial hand has three tiles, but after adding, the total is 3 + k tiles. So for a triplet mentsu, you can have more than three tiles of the same type, but the mentsu requires exactly three. So the count in the initial hand is the number of that tile present. So required is 3 - count.\n\nBut for a sequence mentsu, you need exactly one of each of three consecutive tiles. So the count is the number of unique tiles in the sequence that are present in the initial hand. But since the initial hand may have duplicates, but for the sequence, each is needed once. So for the sequence, the required is 3 minus the number of distinct tiles in the sequence that are present.\n\nWait, that's a bit tricky. Let's see:\n\nExample: initial hand is ['1m', '2m', '3m'].\n\nFor the sequence 1m,2m,3m, the count is 3, so required is 0.\n\nAnother example: initial hand has ['1m', '1m', '2m']. For the sequence 1m,2m,3m, the count is 2 (has 1m and 2m). So required is 1 (needs 3m).\n\nWait, but what if the initial hand has two 1m and one 2m? Then, for the same sequence, the count is 2 (tiles 1m and 2m). So required is 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the sequence requires exactly one of each of 1m, 2m, 3m. So the initial hand may have 1m and 2m, but not 3m. So required is 1 (3m).\n\nBut if the initial hand has two 1m, then the count is 1 (only 1m is present). So required is 2 (needs 2m and 3m).\n\nSo, for a sequence mentsu, the count is the number of distinct tiles in the sequence that are present in the initial hand. So the required is 3 minus this count.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, whether it's a triplet or sequence, we compute the required as 3 minus the count of the mentsu's tiles present in the initial hand.\n\nBut wait, for a triplet mentsu, the count is the number of that specific tile in the initial hand. For a sequence, the count is the number of distinct tiles in the sequence that are present.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each mentsu in all possible:\n\nif mentsu is a triplet:\n\n   count = number of that specific tile in the initial hand.\n\nelse:\n\n   count = number of distinct tiles in the sequence that are present in the initial hand.\n\nrequired = max(0, 3 - count)\n\nWe then collect all required values, and the minimal required is the answer for this initial hand.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to generating all possible mentsus, computing their required, and taking the minimal.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nBut how do I generate all possible mentsus?\n\nWell, for triplets, it's straightforward: for each suit, and for each number 1-9, add the triplet.\n\nFor sequences: for each suit, and for each start from 1 to 7, create a triplet of three consecutive numbers.\n\nSo, in code, I can represent each mentsu as a set of three tiles.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of counting, perhaps it's better to represent each mentsu as a collection of tiles, possibly with duplicates for triplets, but for sequences, just the three distinct.\n\nWait, perhaps for the triplet, the mentsu requires exactly three copies of the same tile. So the mentsu is represented as three identical tiles.\n\nFor the sequence, it's three distinct tiles in sequence.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nGenerate all possible mentsus:\n\nTriplets:\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for num in 1..9:\n\n        triplet_mentsu = {num, suit} * 3\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps as a list: [tile1, tile2, tile3], where tile1 == tile2 == tile3.\n\nAlternatively, as a set for easy checking.\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps it's better to represent each mentsu as a list of three tiles, regardless of whether they are identical or not.\n\nSo, for each triplet mentsu, it's [tile, tile, tile], where tile is like '1m'.\n\nFor each sequence mentsu, it's [tile1, tile2, tile3], where tile1 is '1m', tile2 is '2m', etc.\n\nOnce all mentsus are generated, for each, compute how many tiles are present in the initial hand.\n\nBut wait, the initial hand may have multiple instances of a tile, but for a triplet mentsu, we need exactly three.\n\nWait, no. Because the triplet is a mentsu, which requires three of the same tile. So if the initial hand has two of that tile, and the user adds one more, that's sufficient.\n\nSo, for a triplet mentsu, the required is 3 minus the count of that tile in the initial hand.\n\nBut for a sequence mentsu, the required is 3 minus the number of distinct tiles from the sequence that are present in the initial hand.\n\nWait, but the sequence requires exactly one of each of the three tiles. So even if the initial hand has multiple copies of some tiles in the sequence, but is missing others, the required is the number of missing tiles.\n\nSo for example, initial hand has ['1m', '1m', '2m'], and the sequence is 1m,2m,3m.\n\nIn the initial hand, the count of distinct tiles in the sequence is 2 (1m and 2m). So required is 1 (3m).\n\nSo the required is 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, we can compute the required as 3 minus the number of tiles in the mentsu that are present in the initial hand.\n\nBut wait, for a triplet, the mentsu is three copies of the same tile. So for a triplet mentsu, the count is the number of that specific tile in the initial hand. So for example, if the initial hand has two 3m, then for the triplet mentsu of 3m, the count is 2. Required is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for a sequence mentsu, the count is the number of distinct tiles in the sequence present in the initial hand. So for each tile in the sequence, check if it exists in the initial hand, regardless of quantity.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, the count is:\n\nif it's a triplet:\n\n   count = freq.get(triplet_tile, 0)\n\nelse:\n\n   count = sum(1 for tile in sequence_tiles if tile in freq)\n\nwhere freq is the frequency dictionary of the initial hand.\n\nSo, the required for the mentsu is 3 - count.\n\nBut wait, in the case of a triplet mentsu, if the initial hand has four tiles of that kind, then count is 4. So 3 - 4 is negative, but we take max(0, ...), so required is 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each initial_hand in the three inputs:\n\n   create a frequency dictionary.\n\n   generate all possible mentsus (triplets and sequences)\n\n   for each mentsu:\n\n       if mentsu is a triplet:\n\n           tile = the single tile in the triplet.\n\n           count = frequency.get(tile, 0)\n\n       else:\n\n           count = 0\n\n           for tile in mentsu:\n\n               if tile in frequency:\n\n                   count +=1\n\n       required = max(0, 3 - count)\n\n   find the minimal required across all mentsus.\n\nThat minimal required is the answer for this initial_hand.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead three lines as initial_hands.\n\nFor each initial_hand:\n\n   tiles = split into individual strings.\n\n   freq = {}\n\n   for tile in tiles:\n\n       key = (tile[0], tile[1])\n\n       freq[key] = freq.get(key, 0) + 1\n\n   # Now generate all mentsus\n\n   min_draws = 10000  # some big number\n\n   # Generate all possible mentsus\n\n   # First, all triplets\n\n   for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n       for num in range(1, 10):\n\n           # triplet mentsu: three same tiles\n\n           triplet = [f\"{num}{suit}\" ]\n\n           # but actually, in our model, it's a single tile, but repeated thrice.\n\n           # So for the triplet mentsu, the tile is f\"{num}{suit}\"\n\n           # So for the triplet, the count is how many times this tile appears in the initial hand.\n\n           # Compute required\n\n           cnt = freq.get((num, suit), 0)\n\n           req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\n           if req < min_draws:\n\n               min_draws = req\n\n   # Then, all sequences\n\n   for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n       for start in range(1, 8):  # since start+2 <=9 --> start can be 1 to7\n\n           seq = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n\n           # for each tile in seq, check if it exists in freq\n\n           cnt = 0\n\n           for t in seq:\n\n               if t in freq:\n\n                   cnt +=1\n\n           req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\n           if req < min_draws:\n\n               min_draws = req\n\n   # Now, the minimal draws for this initial_hand is min_draws.\n\n   print(min_draws)\n\nWait, but this will process all possible mentsus and find the one with the minimal required draws.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the initial hand is empty except for the three given tiles, and adding some tiles completes a mentsu.\n\nLike the third sample input:\n\n['3p 9m 2p']\n\nIn this case, the initial tiles are 3p,9m,2p.\n\nLooking for possible mentsus:\n\nPossible triplet mentsus:\n\nFor 3p: initial hand has 1, so required is 2.\n\nFor 9m: initial has 1, required 2.\n\nFor 2p: initial has 1, required 2.\n\nOther triplets: similar.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nLooking for any sequence in any suit.\n\nFor example, in p: 1p,2p,3p. The initial hand has 2p and 3p, so count is 2. Required is 1.\n\nSimilarly, 4p,5p,6p: initial has none.\n\nSo, the minimal required is 1, which is why the output is 1.\n\nSo the code correctly finds that.\n\nAnother test case is the second sample input:\n\n['9m 9m 9m']\n\nThis is already a triplet, so required is 0.\n\nSo the code will find that.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: All three tiles form a sequence.\n\nE.g., 1m,2m,3m.\n\nFor this, the required for the sequence mentsu is 0. So the output is 0.\n\nCase 2: Initial hand has three tiles, but none form a mentsu.\n\nFor example: 1m, 2p, 3s.\n\nIn this case, the minimal required is 0 because she can draw any of the tiles that form a triplet or sequence.\n\nWait, no. Wait, she has three tiles, but none form a mentsu. So she must draw at least one tile.\n\nWait, no. She can choose to draw two tiles to form a triplet or sequence.\n\nWait, but according to the code, it will look for all possible mentsus.\n\nFor example, for the triplet mentsu of 1m: the initial hand has one, so required is 2.\n\nSimilarly, for sequence 1m,2m,3m: initial has 1m, so count is 1. Required is 2.\n\nSo the minimal required is 2.\n\nWait, but wait: is there a mentsu that can be formed with just one additional tile?\n\nNo, because with three tiles, you can't form any mentsu unless you have a triplet or a sequence of three.\n\nWait, no. Because a mentsu requires three tiles.\n\nWait, no, wait: a mentsu is exactly three tiles. So the initial hand is three tiles; she needs to form at least one mentsu. So, if the initial hand is 1m,2p,3s, then she can draw 2m, making four tiles, but that doesn't form a mentsu. So she needs to have at least four tiles to form a mentsu? Or wait, no.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that she has three tiles. She can draw any number of tiles, including zero. She needs to have at least one mentsu in her hand after drawing. So, for example, if she draws zero, the three tiles must include a mentsu.\n\nIf she draws one tile, the four tiles must include a mentsu.\n\nSo, for the initial hand of 1m, 2p, 3s, she can't form any mentsu, so she must draw at least two tiles.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, let's see: suppose she draws two 1m tiles. Then she has 1m, 1m, 1m, 2p, 3s. So the triplet 1m is formed. So she needed to draw two tiles.\n\nWait, but according to the code, for the triplet mentsu of 1m, the required is 3 - count, where count is 1. So required is 2. So the code returns 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut what about if she draws two tiles to form a sequence?\n\nShe has 1m, 2p, 3s. If she draws 2m, 3m, then she has 1m, 2p, 3s, 2m, 3m. Now, the sequence 2m,3m,4m is not formed. But she also has 1m, 2m, 3m: which is a sequence. So yes, by drawing two tiles, she can form a mentsu.\n\nSo the code correctly computes that the required is 2.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother edge case: initial hand has four of a kind, but that's impossible because the initial hand is three tiles.\n\nWait, no. The initial hand is three tiles, but after adding, it can have more.\n\nBut the code is considering all possible mentsus, so it's okay.\n\nAnother edge case: initial hand has two tiles of the same, and one other. For example: 1m, 1m, 2p.\n\nSo, possible mentsus:\n\nTriplet 1m: count is 2, required is 1.\n\nSequence 1m,2m,3m: count is 1 (only 1m is present), required is 2.\n\nBut wait, in this case, she can draw one more 1m to form a triplet. So required is 1.\n\nSo the code correctly picks that.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python, read three lines from stdin.\n\nEach line is a string like '1s 2s 3s'. Split into three tiles.\n\nProcess each initial hand:\n\n- Create a frequency dictionary.\n\n- For each possible mentsu (triplet and sequence), compute required.\n\n- Find the minimal required.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead three lines:\n\ninitial_hands = [input().strip() for _ in range(3)]\n\nFor each hand in initial_hands:\n\ntiles = hand.split()\n\nfreq = defaultdict(int)\n\nfor tile in tiles:\n\n    num, suit = tile[0], tile[1]\n\n    freq[(num, suit)] +=1\n\nCompute min_draws.\n\nInitialize min_draws to something large, like infinity.\n\nGenerate all triplets:\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for num in '123456789':\n\n        tile = num + suit\n\n        cnt = freq.get( (num, suit), 0 )\n\n        req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\n        if req < min_draws:\n\n            min_draws = req\n\nGenerate all sequences:\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for start_num in range(1, 8):\n\n        tiles_in_seq = [str(start_num) + suit, str(start_num +1) + suit, str(start_num +2) + suit]\n\n        cnt = 0\n\n        for t in tiles_in_seq:\n\n            if t in freq:\n\n                cnt +=1\n\n        req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\n        if req < min_draws:\n\n            min_draws = req\n\nAfter processing all mentsus, the minimal req is min_draws.\n\nSo, the code will output min_draws for each initial hand.\n\nWait, but in code, how to represent the tiles?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the tiles as tuples (num, suit), to make it hashable.\n\nBecause in the initial hand, tiles are like '1m', which can be split into '1' and 'm', and stored as a tuple.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\ntiles = hand.split()\n\nfreq = defaultdict(int)\n\nfor tile_str in tiles:\n\n    num = tile_str[0]\n\n    suit = tile_str[1]\n\n    freq[ (num, suit) ] += 1\n\nThen, for the triplet mentsu, it's a single tile, so (num, suit).\n\nFor the sequence, it's three different tiles.\n\nSo, in the code, when checking if a tile is present in the initial hand, we can directly compare the tuple.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor t in tiles_in_seq:\n\n    if t in freq:\n\n        cnt +=1\n\nBecause t is a string like '1m', which is a key in the freq dict.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, the keys are tuples. So comparing a string to a tuple won't work.\n\nWait, that's a bug.\n\nOh right! So in the code, the initial hand is processed into a frequency dictionary where the keys are tuples, e.g., ('1','m').\n\nBut when generating the tiles_in_seq, each tile is a string like '1m'.\n\nSo when checking if t is in freq, it's comparing a string to a tuple, which is False.\n\nSo this will cause the count to be zero for all sequences.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nSo, to fix this, when generating tiles_in_seq, each should be converted into a tuple, like ('1', 'm').\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor t in tiles_in_seq:\n\n    if t in freq:\n\n        cnt +=1\n\nShould be changed to:\n\nfor t in tiles_in_seq:\n\n    if (t[0], t[1]) in freq:\n\n        cnt +=1\n\nOr, better yet, during the initial processing, store the tiles as tuples, not strings.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process all tiles as tuples.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\ntiles = hand.split()\n\nfreq = defaultdict(int)\n\nfor tile_str in tiles:\n\n    num = tile_str[0]\n\n    suit = tile_str[1]\n\n    freq[ (num, suit) ] += 1\n\nThen, for the triplet mentsu, the tile is (num, suit).\n\nFor the sequence mentsu, the tiles are three tuples.\n\nSo, when generating tiles_in_seq:\n\ntiles_in_seq = [ (int(num), suit), (int(num+1), suit), (int(num+2), suit) ]\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because the triplet mentsu is three identical tiles, so the tile is (num, suit), and for the sequence, it's three distinct.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor triplet mentsu:\n\ntile = (num, suit)\n\ncount = freq.get( tile, 0 )\n\nfor sequence mentsu:\n\nseq_tiles = [ (start, suit), (start+1, suit), (start+2, suit) ]\n\ncnt = 0\n\nfor t in seq_tiles:\n\n    if t in freq:\n\n        cnt +=1\n\nreq = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\nSo, that's the correct way.\n\nSo, in code, I need to change the way tiles_in_seq is generated.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor sequence mentsu:\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for start_num in range(1, 8):\n\n        # create the three tiles as tuples\n\n        seq = [ (str(start_num), suit), (str(start_num +1), suit), (str(start_num +2), suit) ]\n\n        # but wait, no. Because start_num is a string.\n\n        # Oh, no. Wait, start_num is an integer.\n\n        # So, in code:\n\n        # for start_num in 1..7:\n\n        #   create the three consecutive numbers as strings.\n\n        # So:\n\n        seq = []\n\n        for n in range(start_num, start_num +3):\n\n            seq.append( (str(n), suit) )\n\n        # Now, for each tile in seq, check if it's in freq.\n\n        cnt = 0\n\n        for t in seq:\n\n            if t in freq:\n\n                cnt +=1\n\n        req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\n        if req < min_draws:\n\n            min_draws = req\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nGenerate for each sequence mentsu the three tiles as tuples, then check each against freq.\n\nSo, the code can be written.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut now, how to represent the triplet and sequence mentsus.\n\nAnother point: in the triplet mentsu, the count is the number of that specific tile in the initial hand.\n\nIn the code, for each triplet mentsu, tile is (num, suit).\n\nSo, the code for triplets is:\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for num in range(1, 10):  # because numbers are 1-9\n\n        tile = (str(num), suit)\n\n        cnt = freq.get( tile, 0 )\n\n        req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\n        if req < min_draws:\n\n            min_draws = req\n\nWait, but in Python, 'range(1,10)' gives 1,2,...,9. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, no. Because in the code, num is a string, but in the triplet mentsu, the tile is (str(num), suit).\n\nWait, no. In the code, for num in 1..9, as integers, but when creating the tile, it's str(num). So, for example, num is 1, so tile is ('1', 'm').\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, for the triplet mentsu, the code loops over num as 1,2,...9, and for each, creates the tile as (str(num), suit).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing this.\n\nLet's take the third sample input:\n\nInput is ['3p 9m 2p']\n\ntiles = ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nfreq is:\n\n('3','p'): 1\n\n('9','m'): 1\n\n('2','p'): 1\n\nNow, for triplet mentsu:\n\nFor each suit:\n\nm: check 1m, 2m, ...,9m.\n\nFor 3p: count is 1, required 2.\n\nFor 9m: count is 1, required 2.\n\nFor 2p: count is 1, required 2.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFor the sequence mentsu:\n\nLooking for sequences in 'p' suit.\n\nFor start_num=1: 1p, 2p,3p.\n\nCheck if each is present.\n\n1p: no.\n\n2p: yes.\n\n3p: yes.\n\nSo, cnt=2. req=1.\n\nSimilarly, for start_num=2: 2p,3p,4p.\n\n2p is present, 3p present, 4p not present. cnt=2. req=1.\n\nStart_num=3: 3p,4p,5p. Only 3p is present. cnt=1. req=2.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo, the minimal req is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: initial hand is ['1m 1m 1m'].\n\nFor triplet mentsu 1m: count is 3. req 0.\n\nSo, output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: initial hand is ['1m 2m 3m'].\n\nTriplet mentsu: none of them have count 3.\n\nSequence mentsu: count 3, req 0.\n\nSo, output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: initial hand is ['1m 1m 2m'].\n\nTriplet 1m: count 2, req 1.\n\nSequence 1m,2m,3m: count 2 (1m and 2m), req 1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will:\n\n- Read three lines.\n\n- For each line:\n\n   - Split into three tiles.\n\n   - Create a frequency dictionary mapping tuples of (num, suit) to counts.\n\n   - Initialize min_draws to a high value.\n\n   - Loop through all triplet mentsus:\n\n      For each suit, for each num 1-9:\n\n          tile = (str(num), suit)\n\n          cnt = freq.get( tile, 0 )\n\n          req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\n          update min_draws.\n\n   - Loop through all sequence mentsus:\n\n      For each suit:\n\n          for start_num from 1 to 7:\n\n              create the three tiles as (str(start_num), suit), (str(start_num+1), suit), (str(start_num+2), suit)\n\n              cnt = number of tiles in this sequence present in freq.\n\n              req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\n              update min_draws.\n\n   - Print min_draws.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead three lines:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    initial_hands = [input().strip() for _ in range(3)]\n    for hand in initial_hands:\n        tiles = hand.split()\n        freq = defaultdict(int)\n        for tile_str in tiles:\n            num = tile_str[0]\n            suit = tile_str[1]\n            freq[ (num, suit) ] += 1\n        \n        min_draws = float('inf')\n        \n        # Check all triplets\n        for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n            for num in range(1, 10):\n                tile = (str(num), suit)\n                cnt = freq.get(tile, 0)\n                req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n                if req < min_draws:\n                    min_draws = req\n        \n        # Check all sequences\n        for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n            for start_num in range(1, 8):\n                seq = []\n                for n in range(start_num, start_num +3):\n                    seq.append( (str(n), suit) )\n                cnt = 0\n                for t in seq:\n                    if t in freq:\n                        cnt +=1\n                req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n                if req < min_draws:\n                    min_draws = req\n        \n        print(min_draws)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the triplet loop, 'num' is from 1 to 9 as integers, but in the code, it's passed as str(num), which is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nFor the first hand:\n\ntiles are 1s, 2s, 3s.\n\nfreq is 1s:1, 2s:1, 3s:1.\n\nTriplet mentsus: each has count 1.
