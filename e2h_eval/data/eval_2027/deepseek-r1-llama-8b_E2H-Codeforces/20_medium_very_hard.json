For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about binary strings and choosing certain values for each string such that a multiset of these strings is 'beautiful'. And we need to count the number of ways to choose these c_s values so that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nWe are given n, k, f. We consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to n. For each such string s, we choose c_s between 0 and k. Then, the multiset is beautiful if for every string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of ways to choose the c_s values such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, it's not just any beautiful multiset; the maximum possible size is exactly f, and we need to count how many such choices of c_s exist.\n\nWait, so for each choice of c_s, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is f. So, the approach is to model this as a combinatorial problem where we're counting the valid assignments of c_s that allow a beautiful multiset of size f, but no more than f.\n\nI think the key here is to model the problem using dynamic programming. Because the constraints are small (n up to 15), maybe a bitmask or state-based DP is feasible.\n\nLet me think about what determines the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset. The size of the multiset is determined by the choices of c_s, and for each s, the number of its extensions in the multiset can't exceed c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: For each binary string s, the number of times s appears in the multiset plus the number of times any of its superstrings (longer strings starting with s) appear must be <= c_s. Because any longer string that starts with s would contribute to the count of s as a prefix.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when you add a string t to the multiset, it contributes to all of its prefixes. So, for each s, the total number of strings in the multiset that are s or any extension of s must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because the count is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So, any string that starts with s (including s itself) will contribute 1 to this count. So, for example, if s is \"00\", then any string like \"000\", \"001\", etc., as well as \"00\" itself, will contribute to the count for s=00.\n\nTherefore, for the multiset to be beautiful, for each s, the sum over all t that are prefixes of s (including s itself) of the count of t in the multiset must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because the condition is for every s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s. So, if t is a prefix of s, then t is also a prefix of s. So, when considering s, the count includes all t that are s's prefixes.\n\nWait, no. For example, consider s = \"01\". Any string that starts with \"01\" will have \"01\" as a prefix. So, the count for s=\"01\" is the number of strings in the multiset that start with \"01\".\n\nBut when considering s=\"0\", the count includes all strings that start with \"0\", including \"00\", \"01\", etc.\n\nSo, the counts are hierarchical. For each string s, its count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s.\n\nThis suggests that the counts for longer strings may affect the counts of their shorter prefixes.\n\nThus, the constraints form a hierarchy. For example, if we have a string \"00\" in the multiset, it contributes to the count of \"0\", but also to the count of \"00\".\n\nSo, when building the multiset, the choices of which strings to include must satisfy all the constraints across all possible prefixes.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose c_s for each string s (length 1 to n) such that when we build the multiset, the maximum possible size is exactly f.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible size depends on the c_s choices. For each assignment of c_s, the maximum beautiful multiset is the largest possible multiset that satisfies all constraints. We need to count the assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm, so for a given assignment of c_s, the maximum size is the size of the largest beautiful multiset possible. Our task is to count the assignments where this size is exactly f.\n\nSo, how do we model this?\n\nPerhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nEach binary string s has a variable c_s. We need to ensure that for each s, the sum of the counts of all strings t that are prefixes of s (including s itself) is <= c_s.\n\nThe maximum possible size of the multiset is the sum over all s of the count of s in the multiset, subject to these constraints.\n\nBut since the maximum is f, we need to find the number of c_s assignments such that the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how does the maximum relate to the c_s? It's a bit tricky because the c_s determine the constraints, and the maximum is the largest possible sum under those constraints.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a problem where each c_s is an upper bound on the number of times any string t that is a prefix of s can appear in the multiset.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the minimal required c_s values to allow a beautiful multiset of size exactly f.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a tree structure, where each node represents a string, and the edges represent adding a bit. Then, the constraints are that for each node s, the sum of the counts of all its descendants (including itself) is <= c_s.\n\nIn this case, the problem reduces to finding a set of counts for each node such that for each node s, the sum of counts for s and its children is <= c_s, and the total sum is f.\n\nBut this seems abstract. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother angle: the maximum size of the multiset is determined by the constraints imposed by the c_s. So, the maximum is the largest possible sum of counts for all strings, subject to for each s, the sum of counts of s and all its supersets (in terms of being a prefix) is <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of s and all its proper supersets (i.e., all t where s is a prefix of t). Or wait, no—because any string that starts with s is a superset in the sense of having s as a prefix. So, the sum of the counts of all t that are >= s (in terms of being longer or equal and starting with s) is the count for s.\n\nSo, the constraints are that for each s, the sum of counts of s and all its longer prefixes (like s followed by any bits) must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, that makes it clear. So, for each s, the count of s in the multiset plus the count of all its immediate superstrings (like s+'0', s+'1') must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because s could be part of longer strings beyond its immediate children. Like, if s is \"00\", then \"000\", \"001\", \"0000\", etc., are all superstrings. So the count for s is the sum of all the counts of s and all longer strings that start with s.\n\nBut for the purpose of the constraints, each s's c_s must be at least the sum of all the counts of its own and all its extensions.\n\nSo, the constraints form a tree-like structure, and the problem is to assign counts to each node in this tree such that for each node s, the sum of counts along its subtree (including s itself) is <= c_s, and the total sum is f.\n\nAh, right! So, the problem is similar to counting the number of ways to assign c_s for each node in a trie such that the sum of the counts in each node's subtree is <= c_s, and the total sum is exactly f.\n\nThis makes it clear that the structure is a trie where each node corresponds to a binary string, and each node has two children (for 0 and 1, unless it's a leaf).\n\nSo, now the problem becomes: for each node s, assign a value c_s. Then, the counts for each node s can be any non-negative integer, but the sum of counts in the subtree rooted at s must be <= c_s.\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all counts across all nodes must be exactly f.\n\nWe need to count the number of such assignments of c_s.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? It's a problem of counting the number of ways to choose c_s for each node in a trie, with the constraints that for each node s, the sum of the counts in its subtree is <= c_s, and the total sum is f.\n\nMoreover, each count for a node can be any non-negative integer, as long as the constraints are satisfied.\n\nHmm, but the variables are the c_s, and the counts for each node. But the counts are dependent on the c_s, so perhaps the problem can be transformed into one where the variables are the c_s, and we express the constraints in terms of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using generating functions, considering each node's contribution.\n\nWait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is not the way to go. Let me think about the constraints again.\n\nFor each node s, the sum of counts in the subtree rooted at s must be <= c_s. Let's denote the sum for node s as x_s. Then, x_s <= c_s.\n\nBut x_s is the sum of x_t for all children t of s, plus the count of the node s itself. Wait, no. Because the count for s is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. The counts for the leaves are the actual counts of the string in the multiset. For internal nodes, the counts are the sum of the counts of their children.\n\nWait, for example, if s is a parent of t and u, then the count of s in the multiset is the sum of the counts of t and u. Because any string that starts with s and is longer will contribute to both t and u, which are the next-level prefixes.\n\nWait, no. That's not correct. Because, for example, if s is \"0\", and t is \"00\", u is \"01\", then the count for s is the sum of the counts of \"00\", \"01\", \"000\", \"001\", etc. So, x_s is the sum of all counts of strings that start with s.\n\nSo, the count for s is equal to the sum of the counts for all its children, their children, and so on.\n\nBut in our problem, the variables are the c_s, and the constraints are that x_s <= c_s, where x_s is the sum of counts of all strings that start with s.\n\nSo, for each s, x_s is the sum of all counts of strings that are s or any extension of s.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? Because x_s depends on the counts of all its extensions.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe we can model this using a recursive approach, considering each node and its children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a product of factors, each corresponding to a node's contribution.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The maximum possible size of the multiset is the sum of all x_s, where x_s is the count of strings starting with s. And the constraints are that x_s <= c_s for each s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of c_s assignments such that the maximum possible sum of x_s is exactly f, with x_s <= c_s for all s.\n\nWait, but the x_s are variables that must satisfy x_s <= c_s for each s, and the sum of all x_s is f. Also, the x_s must satisfy that for any s, x_s is equal to the sum of x_{t} for all t that are immediate children of s.\n\nWait, because the count for s is the sum of the counts of its children. No, that's not correct. Because the count for s is the sum of counts for all its children, which themselves are the sum of their children, and so on. So, x_s is the sum of x_{t} for all t that are direct children of s.\n\nBecause x_s is the count of all strings starting with s, which is the sum of the counts of all its children, which are the strings that start with s followed by a 0 or 1. So, yes, x_s = sum of x_t for t in children(s).\n\nSo, the variables are x_0, x_1, x_{00}, x_{01}, etc., down to the leaves. But since the problem is about the c_s, perhaps we can model this as a system where the x_s are constrained by x_s = sum of x_t for t in children(s), and x_s <= c_s.\n\nBut how to count the number of c_s assignments such that the sum of x_s is exactly f, given that x_s = sum of x_t for children(s) and x_s <= c_s for all s.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a tree where each node contributes a certain factor to the generating function, considering its c_s and the constraints.\n\nLet me think about the root of the trie, which is the empty string. But since the problem considers strings of length 1 to n, perhaps the root isn't considered. Or perhaps it's better to model the trie as including all possible prefixes up to n bits.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that we are considering all binary strings of length from 1 to n. So, the root (empty string) is not part of the strings we're considering. Instead, each node in the trie represents a binary string of length 1, 2, ..., up to n.\n\nSo, the structure is a full binary trie of depth up to n, but only the nodes with depth >=1 are considered.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the trie as all possible binary strings of length up to n, but the leaves are the ones with length n. But no, the leaves are the strings of length n, but the internal nodes correspond to the prefixes.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model the trie as a collection of nodes, each representing a binary string, and each node has children for '0' and '1', except for the leaves (which have no children). The root is the empty string, and its children are '0' and '1'.\n\nEach node in this trie (except the root) represents a binary string of some length. The leaves are the strings of length n.\n\nSo, the variables x_s correspond to each node s. x_s is the count of the string s in the multiset. For each node s, the sum of x_t for all children t of s equals x_s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, x_s is the count of all strings that have s as a prefix. So, for the node s, x_s is equal to the sum of x_t for all children of s. Because any string that starts with s and continues is a child of s.\n\nWait, no. Because x_s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Those strings are s itself and all longer strings that start with s. So, x_s is the sum of the counts of s and all its children (each of which represents a longer string starting with s).\n\nBut in the problem, the counts for the children are their x_children. So, for node s, x_s = count(s) + x_{s0} + x_{s1}, where s0 and s1 are the children of s.\n\nBut since the count(s) is part of x_s, perhaps it's better to model this as x_s is the sum of all x_t for t in the subtree of s (including s itself).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the x_s for a node is the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree rooted at s.\n\nSo, the constraints are x_s <= c_s for each node s.\n\nAnd the total sum of x_s across all nodes is f.\n\nOur goal is to count the number of assignments of c_s to each node s (where 0 <= c_s <=k) such that there exists a multiset where the sum of x_s is f, and for each s, x_s <= c_s, and x_s is the sum of x_t for t in the subtree of s.\n\nHmm. This seems a bit abstract, but perhaps we can model this with a DP approach.\n\nLet's model the problem as a trie, where each node represents a binary string s. For each node s, we need to decide x_s, which is the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree of s. Additionally, x_s <= c_s.\n\nThe total sum of x_s for all nodes is f.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of c_s assignments (each c_s is between 0 and k) such that the maximum sum of x_s across all possible assignments is exactly f. Wait, no, because the x_s are dependent on the c_s, and the sum is f.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a generating function. Each node s contributes a term that represents the possible x_s values, considering that x_s is the sum of x_t for its children, and x_s <= c_s.\n\nWait, but that might get complicated quickly, especially for n=15, which implies a lot of nodes.\n\nWait, n is up to 15, so the total number of nodes in the trie is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2(2^n - 1) - 2 = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's about 2^16-2=65534, which is manageable, but the exponents might make it challenging.\n\nBut perhaps the solution can be approached via a DP that processes each node and keeps track of the current sum and constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a tree where each node's c_s is a variable, and the x_s is the sum of its children's x_t plus its own count, which must be <= c_s. But again, this seems complex.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as a system of equations. For each node s, x_s = sum_{t in children(s)} x_t + x_s_count, where x_s_count is the count of s in the multiset. But since x_s = sum of x_t for all children plus x_s_count, and x_s_count can be any non-negative integer, perhaps this isn't directly helpful.\n\nBut considering that the x_s are determined by the counts of the leaves, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the leaves first.\n\nWait, for the leaves (strings of length n), their x_s is equal to their count in the multiset, since they have no children. For their parents, which are nodes of length n-1, their x_s is the sum of the counts of their children (the leaves) plus their own count. But wait, no. Because the x_s of a parent node s is the sum of x_t for its children t, which are the leaves. So, for a node s of length m, x_s is the sum of x_t for all its children t, which are of length m+1.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, for the leaves (strings of length n), x_s is their count in the multiset. For their parents (length n-1), x_s is the sum of the x_t of the leaves. For their grandparents (length n-2), x_s is the sum of the x_t of their children, which are the leaves and their parents.\n\nSo, the x_s for each node is the sum of the x_t of all its descendants, including itself.\n\nWait, no. Because x_s is the count of all strings that have s as a prefix. So, for s itself, it's counted once, and each of its children (which are longer strings starting with s) are counted as well.\n\nSo, the x_s is the sum of the x_t for all t that are descendants of s in the trie, including s itself.\n\nSo, for the leaves, x_s is their count. For their parent s, x_s is the sum of x_leaf1 + x_leaf2 (assuming two leaves) plus their own count. Wait, no. Because the x_s for the parent is the sum of x_leaf1 and x_leaf2, but the parent's own count is already included in x_leaf1 and x_leaf2? No, wait. No, the x_leaf1 is the count of the leaf, which is a string of length n. The parent's x_s is the sum of all its children (the leaves) plus the parent's own count. Wait, no—no, the parent's x_s is the count of all strings that start with the parent's string. Which includes the parent itself and all its extensions (the leaves and their extensions beyond).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's take an example. Suppose s is \"0\", and its children are \"00\", \"01\". The x_s is the count of all strings starting with \"0\", which includes \"0\", \"00\", \"01\", \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", etc. So, x_s is the sum of the counts of all these strings.\n\nBut for the parent node \"0\", x_0 is the sum of x_{00}, x_{01}, and any other children beyond them, but in the case of n=3, the leaves would be \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the x_s for a node is equal to the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree of s (including s itself).\n\nSo, for the leaves, x_s is the count of the leaf. For their parent, x_s is the sum of the x_t of the leaves plus the parent's own count. Wait, no—because the parent's count is not a separate variable, but rather, the parent's x_s is the sum of x_t for all descendants, including itself.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm conflating the count of the node s and the x_s. Let's clarify:\n\nx_s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So, x_s is the sum of the counts of s, plus the counts of all its children, plus the counts of their children, and so on.\n\nBut in the problem, the c_s is an upper bound on x_s. So, x_s must be <= c_s.\n\nBut each node's x_s is determined by the sum of x_t for all t in its subtree (including itself). So, the constraints are x_s <= c_s for all s.\n\nSo, the variables are the c_s, and the x_s are determined by the structure of the trie.\n\nBut how do we model the number of ways to choose c_s so that the sum of x_s across all nodes is f.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a system where each node contributes a certain amount to the total sum, based on the c_s.\n\nBut this is still vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem recursively. For each node s, when assigning c_s, the x_s can be any value from 0 to min(c_s, f). But since x_s is the sum of the x_t for its children, perhaps we can model this with a DP that tracks the current sum and the constraints.\n\nBut with n up to 15, the trie can have up to 2^15-1 nodes, which is 32767. So, a straightforward approach may not be feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the structure allows us to model the problem with a DP that processes each level of the trie and accumulates the necessary information.\n\nLet me think about the root of the trie, which is the empty string. Its x_root is the sum of all x_s for all s in the trie. But in our problem, we only consider s of length >=1, so the root isn't part of the variables. Hmm, but the root's x_root is the sum of x_s for all s in the trie, which is f.\n\nWait, but the root's x_root is the sum of x_s for all s in the trie, which is exactly f.\n\nBut the root's c_root is not part of our variables because we don't consider the empty string. So, perhaps the root's x_root is f, but the c_root is irrelevant.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be approached by processing each node in the trie, and for each node, considering the possible x_s values that can be assigned, given the constraints from its children.\n\nBut this seems abstract. Let's think about the leaves first.\n\nFor a leaf node s (a string of length n), x_s can be any integer from 0 to c_s, since it has no children. So, for each leaf, x_s can be any value between 0 and c_s.\n\nFor a node s that is not a leaf, x_s is the sum of x_t for all its children t. So, x_s = sum(x_t for t in children(s)). Additionally, x_s <= c_s.\n\nSo, for each internal node s, the sum of x_t for its children must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, but the x_t for the children are variables as well. So, for each node s, we have a constraint that sum(x_t for t in children(s)) <= c_s.\n\nBut the sum of x_t for children(s) is x_s, as x_s is the sum of x_t for all descendants, including s itself. Wait, no. Because x_s is the sum of x_t for all descendants, which includes the children's x_t and their descendants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. Let's clarify:\n\nFor a node s, x_s is the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree rooted at s. So, x_s = sum(x_t for t in children(s)) + x_s_count, where x_s_count is the count of s in the multiset. Wait, no—that's not correct.\n\nNo, x_s is the count of all strings that have s as a prefix. So, it's the sum of the counts of s, plus all strings that start with s and have more bits. So, x_s is equal to the sum of x_t for all t that are in the subtree of s, including s itself.\n\nWait, no. Because x_t is the count of t in the multiset. So, x_s is the sum of x_t for all t that are in the subtree of s (including s itself). So, for a node s, x_s is the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree of s.\n\nSo, for a leaf node s, x_s is the count of s in the multiset. For its parent p, x_p is the sum of x_s (the leaf) plus the count of p in the multiset, plus the x_t for any other children of p.\n\nWait, no. Because p's x_p is the sum of x_t for all t in p's subtree, which includes p itself and all its descendants. So, for p, x_p = x_p_count + x_{p0} + x_{p1}, where p0 and p1 are the children of p.\n\nWait, but x_p_count is the count of p in the multiset, and x_p0 is the sum of x_t for p0's subtree, and similarly for x_p1.\n\nSo, x_p = x_p_count + x_p0 + x_p1.\n\nBut x_p0 is the sum of x_t for p0's subtree, which includes p0's count and its children's counts, etc.\n\nSo, the variables are the x_s for each node s. And the constraints are x_s <= c_s for each s.\n\nThe sum of all x_s is f.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems complex because each x_s depends on the x_t of its children.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system where each node s can contribute a certain amount to the total sum, and the constraints are that the sum of contributions from s and its descendants must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that the x_s for each node s is the sum of x_t for its children, which in turn depends on their x_t.\n\nSo, for a node s, x_s = sum(x_t for t in children(s)), and x_s <= c_s.\n\nBut the x_t for children are also sums of their children, and so on.\n\nSo, the problem can be seen as a system of inequalities, and the total sum is f.\n\nBut how to count the number of solutions to this system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a generating function where each node contributes a factor based on its possible x_s, given the constraints from its children.\n\nWait, but this seems difficult because the variables are interdependent.\n\nAnother idea: Since the constraints are additive, perhaps we can process the nodes in reverse order, from the leaves up to the root.\n\nFor each node s, we can compute the possible range of x_s based on the constraints from its children and its own c_s.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming, where for each node, we keep track of the possible sums contributed by that node and its subtree.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, and the number of nodes is up to 2^15, this approach may not be feasible unless optimized.\n\nWait, but let's consider the fact that the sum of all x_s is f. So, perhaps we can model the problem as a knapsack-like problem, where each node contributes a certain amount to the total sum, and the constraints are that the sum of contributions from a node and its subtree must be <= c_s.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a tree where each node's contribution is a variable, and the constraints are that the sum of the variables in the subtree must be <= c_s.\n\nIn this case, the total sum is f, and we need to count the number of c_s assignments that allow this.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nLet me look at the example provided to see if it gives any clues.\n\nIn the first example, n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nThe three possible ways are:\n\n1. c_0=0: Then, the only string is \"0\", and c_0=0. So, the multiset can have at most 0 occurrences of \"0\", hence the maximum size is 0. But wait, the sample says the maximum is 2? No, wait, the sample says the output is 3, which refers to three ways where the maximum size is exactly 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the first example says that the maximum size is 2. So, in the first case, c_0=0, which allows a multiset of size 0, which is less than 2. So, why is this counted?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the problem wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, for each assignment of c_s, the maximum possible size is f. So, the assignment must be such that f is achievable, but no larger.\n\nSo, in the first example, when c_0=0, the maximum size is 0, which is less than f=2. So, this is not counted.\n\nBut according to the sample, it is counted. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the sample input is ['1 42 2', '2 37 13', ...], and the sample output is ['3', '36871576', ...].\n\nWait, the note explains that for the first case, the three ways have maximum size exactly 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. So, the first example's output is 3 because the maximum beautiful multiset size is 2.\n\nSo, in the first case, for each assignment of c_0 and c_1, the maximum possible size is 2.\n\nWait, but for n=1, there is only one string, \"0\", but wait, n=1 implies that the strings are of length 1. So, the multiset is a subset of binary strings of length exactly 1.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: Consider all binary strings of length from 1 to n. For each such string s, choose c_s from 0 to k.\n\nA multiset is beautiful if for every string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nThe goal is to count the number of assignments of c_s such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nSo, for each assignment of c_s, the maximum possible size is the largest possible sum of counts of all strings in the multiset, given the constraints.\n\nWe need to count the assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nIn the first example, n=1, so the only string is \"0\". So, the multiset can contain 0 or 1 occurrence of \"0\".\n\nFor each c_0, the maximum possible size is:\n\nIf c_0 >= 1, then the maximum size is 1.\n\nIf c_0 < 1, then maximum size is 0.\n\nBut the sample says that f=2, which is larger than n=1. So, this suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Because for n=1, the maximum possible size is 1, since the multiset can contain at most one string of length 1.\n\nSo, if f=2, which is larger than 1, it's impossible. But the sample says that the output is 3, meaning that the maximum possible size is 2.\n\nThis suggests that I have a misunderstanding about the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows the multiset to have multiple copies of the same string. Oh, right! Because it's a multiset, so the same string can appear multiple times.\n\nAh, right! So, the multiset can have multiple copies of the same string. So, for the string \"0\", the count is how many times it appears in the multiset.\n\nSo, for n=1, the maximum size of the multiset is unbounded except by the constraints.\n\nWait, but the constraints are that for each string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix cannot exceed c_s.\n\nSo, for s=\"0\", the count of \"0\" in the multiset plus the count of all longer strings that start with \"0\" must be <= c_0.\n\nBut for n=1, there are no longer strings than \"0\". So, for n=1, the constraint for \"0\" is that the count of \"0\" in the multiset is <= c_0.\n\nSo, the maximum size is the count of \"0\" in the multiset, which can be any integer from 0 to c_0.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nSo, for each assignment of c_0, the maximum size is min(c_0, something else). Wait, no—since for n=1, the only string is \"0\", and the constraint is that the count of \"0\" in the multiset is <= c_0.\n\nSo, the maximum size is c_0, because the count of \"0\" can be up to c_0.\n\nWait, no. Because the count of \"0\" can be any integer from 0 to c_0. So, the maximum possible size is c_0.\n\nSo, for the sample input, f=2. So, we need to choose c_0 such that c_0 >= 2. Because the maximum possible size is c_0.\n\nBut since k=42, which is >=2, c_0 can be any value from 2 to 42.\n\nSo, the number of valid c_0 assignments is 42-2+1=41. But the sample output is 3. So, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, this suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the problem wrong. Let's read the note again.\n\nIn the note, the first example: n=2, but the sample input is n=1.\n\nWait, no, the sample input is n=1, but the note describes a case with n=2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the note.\n\nIn the note, for n=2, c_0=3, c_00=1, c_01=2, c_1=1, c_10=2, c_11=3.\n\nThe multiset is {11, 01, 00, 01}. So, the counts are:\n\n- For \"0\": the count is the number of strings in the multiset that have \"0\" as a prefix. These are \"00\", \"01\", \"01\" again. So, 3.\n\nc_0=3, which is okay.\n\nFor \"00\": the count is 1, which is <= c_00=1.\n\nFor \"01\": the count is 2, which is <= c_01=2.\n\nFor \"1\": the count is 1, which is <= c_1=1.\n\nFor \"10\": the count is 0, which is <= c_10=2.\n\nFor \"11\": the count is 1, which is <= c_11=3.\n\nSo, the maximum size is the sum of all counts in the multiset: 1 (for 00) + 2 (for 01 twice?) Wait, no—the multiset counts each string once. So,",
