The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. The goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the keys. Each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by only one key.\n\nHmm, the condition for a key j to unlock chest i is that a_i + b_j is odd. So that means one must be even and the other odd. Because even plus odd is odd, right?\n\nSo, to rephrase: For a chest with a_i even, we need a key with b_j odd. And vice versa. Wait, no: wait, a_i + b_j mod 2 should be 1. So if a_i is even (0 mod 2), then b_j must be 1 mod 2 (odd). If a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\nSo the problem breaks down into two parts:\n1. Find how many chests have even a_i and how many have odd a_i.\n2. Find how many keys have even b_j and how many have odd b_j.\n3. Then, the maximum number of chests we can open is determined by matching the two groups optimally.\n\nLet me think in terms of counts. Let's say:\n- Even_a = number of chests where a_i is even.\n- Odd_a = n - Even_a.\n- Even_b = number of keys where b_j is even.\n- Odd_b = m - Even_b.\n\nNow, for each even_a chest, we can use an odd_b key. Similarly, for each odd_a chest, we can use an even_b key.\n\nBut the issue is that the total number of such possible pairs is limited by the available keys and chests.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used once. So the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the minimum between the number of even_a chests and the number of odd_b keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd_a chests and the even_b keys. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's think: for even_a chests, we can pair each with an odd_b key. So the maximum possible here is min(Even_a, Odd_b).\n\nSimilarly, for odd_a chests, we can pair each with even_b keys. So the maximum possible is min(Odd_a, Even_b).\n\nBut wait, what if we have more even_a chests than Odd_b keys? Then the extra even_a chests can't be unlocked. Similarly, any remaining odd_a chests after using even_b keys can't be unlocked.\n\nSo the total maximum is the sum of these two minima. Because each key can only be used once, but in the optimal scenario, each key is used to unlock a chest.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a better way. Like, maybe we can maximize the usage by pairing differently. But I don't think so because each key is either used for even_a or odd_a, but not both.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCalculate the number of even and odd a's, and the number of even and odd b's.\n\nThen the answer is min(Even_a, Odd_b) + min(Odd_a, Even_b).\n\nWait, but wait another thing. What if the sum exceeds n? Because maybe you have overlapping or something, but I think that's not possible. Because each chest is either even or odd, and each key is either even or odd, and each key can be used once.\n\nWait, for example, suppose Even_a is 3, Odd_b is 5. So min(3,5)=3. So 3 even_a chests are unlocked with 3 odd_b keys. The remaining 2 odd_b keys can't do anything else.\n\nSimilarly, suppose Odd_a is 4, Even_b is 2. So min(4,2)=2. So 2 odd_a chests are unlocked with 2 even_b keys.\n\nTotal is 3+2=5, but if n is 7, that's fine.\n\nBut what if Even_a is 5, Odd_b is 2. Then min is 2, leaving 3 even_a chests unlocked. But those can't be unlocked with anything else.\n\nSo the maximum is indeed min(Even_a, Odd_b) + min(Odd_a, Even_b).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the a array, count the number of even and odd elements (even_a and odd_a).\n3. Read the b array, count the number of even and odd elements (even_b and odd_b).\n4. Compute the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n5. Output this sum.\n\nBut wait, wait! Wait, in the problem statement, the third line is the keys. Oh right, so the b array is the keys.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first example is:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na: 9,14,6,2,11 → which are [9,14,6,2,11]. So a_i's are 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd).\n\nSo even_a is 3 (14,6,2), odd_a is 2 (9,11).\n\nb:8,4,7,20 → 8 (even),4 (even),7 (odd), 20 (even). So even_b is 3 (8,4,20), odd_b is 1 (7).\n\nSo even_a=3, odd_b=1. So min(3,1)=1.\n\nOdd_a=2, even_b=3. min(2,3)=2.\n\nTotal is 1+2=3, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: second input:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na: 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb:5 → odd. So even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nSo min(even_a, odd_b) is min(5,1) → 1.\n\nmin(odd_a, even_b) is min(0,0) → 0.\n\nTotal is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: n=1, m=4.\n\na:10 → even.\n\nb:20,30,40,50 → all even.\n\nSo even_a=1, odd_b=0.\n\nSo min(1,0)=0.\n\nAnd odd_a is 0, even_b=4 → min is 0.\n\nTotal is 0, as per the sample.\n\nYes, so the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when m is 0? No, constraints say 1<=n,m<=1e5. So no.\n\nWhat if all a's are even and all b's are even? Then even_a =n, odd_b=0. So min is 0. And odd_a=0, even_b=m. So min is 0. Total is 0.\n\nWhich makes sense because a_i + b_j is even, so can't unlock any chests.\n\nAnother case: a has some evens and odds, and b has some evens and odds. So the sum is the sum of the two minima.\n\nSo now, the plan is to process the a and b arrays, count even and odd in each, compute the sum.\n\nImplementation-wise, in Python:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list, count the number of even numbers.\n\nRead b list, count the number of even numbers.\n\nCompute:\n\nmax_chests = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n\nPrint max_chests.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = 0\nodd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_a +=1\n    else:\n        odd_a +=1\n\neven_b = 0\nodd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_b +=1\n    else:\n        odd_b +=1\n\nresult = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but wait, no: the 'b' is the keys. So in the code above, even_b is the count of even keys, which can be used to unlock the odd_a chests.\n\nWait, yes. Because for an odd_a chest, we need an even key. So the number of even keys available is even_b. So min(odd_a, even_b) is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for even_a chests, we need odd_b keys. So min(even_a, odd_b).\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\na has 3 even, 2 odd.\n\nb has 3 even, 1 odd.\n\nSo min(3,1)=1; min(2,3)=2. Sum is 3.\n\nSample 2:\n\na has 5 even, 0 odd.\n\nb has 0 even, 1 odd.\n\nmin(5,1)=1; min(0,0)=0. Sum is 1.\n\nSample 3:\n\na has 1 even, 0 odd.\n\nb has 4 even, 0 odd.\n\nmin(1,0)=0; min(0,4)=0. Sum 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\na: [1,2] → even_a=1, odd_a=1.\n\nb: [3,4] → even_b=1, odd_b=1.\n\nSo min(1,1)=1 for even_a and odd_b. Min(1,1)=1 for odd_a and even_b. Sum 2.\n\nWhich is correct because we can unlock both chests.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nI think that's the solution. It's simple but efficient, O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for the constraints.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using given keys. Each key can unlock a specific type of chest based on whether the key and chest numbers are odd or even.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem revolves around matching keys to chests such that their sum is odd. This happens when one is even and the other is odd.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: For both chests and keys, count how many have even and odd values.\n3. **Matching Strategy**: \n   - Use even-numbered keys to unlock chests with odd numbers.\n   - Use odd-numbered keys to unlock chests with even numbers.\n4. **Optimal Matching**: Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened by summing the minimum counts of the required key types for each chest type.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = 0\nodd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_a += 1\n    else:\n        odd_a += 1\n\neven_b = 0\nodd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_b += 1\n    else:\n        odd_b += 1\n\nmax_chests = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(max_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of chests and keys, followed by the values on each chest and key.\n2. **Counting Evens and Odds**: It counts how many chests have even and odd values separately. It does the same for the keys.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Chests**: Using the counts, it calculates the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by pairing the appropriate keys and chests. The result is the sum of the minimum possible matches between even chests and odd keys, and odd chests and even keys.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, adhering to the constraints and providing an optimal solution.",
