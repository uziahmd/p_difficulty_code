During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the smallest non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest k.\n\nHmm, let's think about what a+k and b+k represent. Since a and b are given, adding the same k to both means their difference remains the same. Wait, yes! Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So the difference between the two numbers doesn't change with k. Interesting.\n\nSo, the two numbers x and y where x = a +k, y = b +k have a fixed difference d = |a - b|. The goal is to find x and y such that their LCM is minimized, with x and y being positive integers and y = x + d or vice versa, depending on which is larger.\n\nWait, right. Because if a > b, then x = a +k and y = b +k, so y = x - (a - b). Or if a < b, then x = b +k and y = a +k, so x = y + (b - a). But in any case, the difference is fixed.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y with x - y = d (fixed), such that their LCM is minimized. And among all possible pairs that achieve this minimal LCM, choose the one with the smallest x (and thus smallest k).\n\nWait, but how do I find such x and y? Let me think about the properties.\n\nThe LCM of x and y is (x * y) / GCD(x, y). To minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD. Because the product x*y depends on their values, but for a fixed difference, perhaps making them as similar as possible in terms of factors would help.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y differ by d, maybe we can express them as x = m, y = m - d, but wait no, because m could be either x or y. Let's see: Let's say d is the absolute difference between a and b. Without loss of generality, assume a >= b, so d = a - b. Then, x = a +k, y = b +k = x - d. So, y = x - d. So, x and y must satisfy y = x -d, and both must be positive.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find x such that x and x-d have maximum GCD. Because LCM(x, x-d) = x*(x-d)/GCD(x, x-d). So, to minimize the LCM, we want to maximize the GCD.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the GCD of x and x-d. Well, GCD(x, x-d) = GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x-d) = GCD(x, d). So, the GCD is the same as GCD(x, d). \n\nSo, to maximize the GCD, we should choose x such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. Because the higher the GCD, the lower the LCM.\n\nSo, the optimal x is such that GCD(x, d) is maximized.\n\nBut how do we find such an x?\n\nWell, the maximum possible value for GCD(x, d) is d itself, but only if d divides x. Because GCD(x, d) can't be larger than d. So, the best case is when x is a multiple of d. Then, GCD(x, d) = d, which would make the LCM (x * (x-d)) / d.\n\nWait, but x has to be greater than d, because y = x -d must be positive. So x must be at least d+1.\n\nWait, let's think about when d=0. Oh, but in the problem statement, a and b are at least 1. So d can't be zero. So, the difference is always at least 1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n2. Find x such that x is a multiple of g, where g is a divisor of d, and as large as possible.\n3. The x that gives the maximum GCD with d will give the minimal LCM.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal x is the minimal x that is a multiple of g, where g is a divisor of d, and x >= something.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nTake the sample input: a=6, b=10. So d=4.\n\nWe need to find x such that x and x-4 have maximum GCD.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible GCD here? It",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The key observation is that adding the same \\( k \\) to both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) does not change their difference. Therefore, we can reduce the problem to finding two numbers with a fixed difference \\( d \\) such that their LCM is minimized.\n2. **Fixed Difference**: Let \\( d \\) be the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).
