    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game where two players, Homer and Marge, take turns picking digits from a number A, which has 2n digits. Each player makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their prizes, which are the numbers S1 and S2 they build during the game. The sequence of moves (H for Homer and M) needs to be determined.\n\nHmm. So each time a player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their number. Then that digit is removed from A. The initial state is both S1 and S2 being empty. The output should be a string of H's and M's indicating who took which digit in each step.\n\nThe task is to find the move sequence that gives the maximum possible total prize. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem because the choices made at each step affect future possibilities, and we need to choose the optimal path.\n\nLet me think about the structure:\n\nAt each step, the current state can be represented by:\n- The remaining digits in A (as a string or some other structure).\n- Which digits each player has taken so far.\nBut considering that n can be up to 18, the string length can be up to 36. That's a lot. So we need an efficient way to represent the state without using too much memory.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to realize that the order in which digits are taken affects the final numbers. To maximize S1 + S2, we need to assign higher digits to the players as early as possible in their respective sequences.\n\nBut wait, S1 is built by Homer, S2 by Marge. Each time a player takes a digit, it's added to their number. So, for example, if the first digit is '9', Homer taking it would give a higher value than Marge taking it. But since each player has to make exactly n moves, perhaps the optimal strategy is to arrange the digits such that the earliest possible digits are assigned to the players in a way that maximizes their overall sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by determining for each position whether it's better for Homer or Marge to take it, based on the sum of all possible digits taken after that point.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal approach is to split the digits into two parts: the first n digits go to one player, and the next n to the other. But that's not necessarily the case because the players take turns, but the order isn't fixed. For instance, it's possible for a high digit to be taken by either player depending on the turn order.\n\nWait no, because the players alternate turns. So the first digit is taken by either H or M, then the next by the other, and so on until all 2n digits are taken, with each player making exactly n moves.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the digits in such a way that when the sum of the digits taken by H is as large as possible, and similarly for M. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the total prize is S1 + S2. Since S1 is the number formed by the digits taken by H in the order they were taken, and S2 similarly for M, the sum is equal to the sum of all digits multiplied by 10^k, where k depends on their positions. So perhaps the sum is maximized when the digits are arranged in a way that larger digits are placed in higher places for both players.\n\nBut how do the turns affect this? Because each player's digits are interleaved with the other's.\n\nWait, maybe the order of selection doesn't matter except for the positions (i.e., which player takes which digit). Because the sum S1 + S2 is the concatenation of H's digits followed by M's digits, but each in their own orders.\n\nWait no, because the order in which the digits are taken affects their place value. For example, if a high digit is taken earlier, it contributes more to the total sum.\n\nSo the key is to assign the highest possible digits to the earliest possible positions, regardless of which player takes them, but also ensuring that each player gets exactly n digits.\n\nBut how can we model that?\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem can be transformed into assigning each digit to either H or M, ensuring that exactly n digits are assigned to each, and that the resulting S1 and S2 are as large as possible in their sum.\n\nBut the order in which they are taken also matters because the earlier digits contribute more to the sum.\n\nWait, the sum S1 + S2 is equal to the sum over all digits, each multiplied by 10^{position} where position is determined by their order in their respective sequences.\n\nFor example, the first digit taken by H is the first digit of S1, contributing d * 10^{n-1 + ...} etc.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead of trying to model the entire process, we can find a way to determine for each digit whether assigning it to H or M would give a better total.\n\nBut the problem is that the choice affects the subsequent choices, as each assignment reduces the available options.\n\nWait, another thought: the order in which the digits are taken affects their contribution to the sum. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to arrange the digits in a certain way, and then decide who takes which digit in that order.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to model this as a game tree, where at each step, the current player (H or M) selects a digit, and then the state transitions accordingly. We can memoize the best possible score from each state.\n\nWait, but the state could be the current position in the string, which player's turn it is, and the counts of digits taken by each player. But with n up to 18, that's a lot of states.\n\nWait, the state would include:\n\n- The current index in the digit string (say, i), indicating that the next digit to take is the ith one.\n- The number of digits taken by H so far (h) and by M so far (m).\n- Whose turn it is next.\n\nBut even with n=18, the state space is 36 (digits) × (19 for h) × (19 for m) × 2 (turns) = about 36×19×19×2 = around 13,732 states. Hmm, that's manageable for a DP approach.\n\nEach state can store the maximum possible sum achievable from that state onwards.\n\nYes! So the DP approach is feasible.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nWe'll define dp[i][h][m][turn], where:\n\n- i: the current position in the digit string (0-based)\n- h: number of digits taken by H so far\n- m: number of digits taken by M so far\n- turn: 0 for H's turn, 1 for M's turn\n\nThe value of dp[i][h][m][turn] is the maximum total sum achievable starting from this state.\n\nThe base case is when i == 2n, meaning all digits are taken. Then, the sum is 0.\n\nFor each state, we can transition to the next states by selecting the next digit (A[i]) and adding it to either H or M's number, depending on whose turn it is.\n\nWait, no. Because the order in which the digits are taken matters. So for the current state, the next digit is A[i], and the current player can take it, adding it to their number, and then the state becomes i+1, with h+1 or m+1, and it's the other player's turn.\n\nSo, for each state, if it's H's turn, he can choose to take the current digit and add it to his number. Then, the next state is i+1, with h+1, m remains, and it's M's turn.\n\nSimilarly, if it's M's turn, she can take the current digit and add to her number, leading to i+1, m+1, H's turn.\n\nWait, but the actual value of the digits depends on the order they are taken. Because the first digit contributes 10^{n-1}, the second 10^{n-2}, etc. So the DP needs to track the current positions in both S1 and S2.\n\nOh, right! Because S1 is the number formed by the digits taken by H in the order they were taken. Similarly for S2. So the contribution of a digit to the total sum depends on its position in their respective sequences.\n\nThis complicates things because the state now must track the current length of S1 and S2. Because, for example, when H takes a new digit, it's added to the end of S1, so the next digit's position in S1 will be one more than the previous.\n\nWait, but the DP state needs to track how many digits each player has taken so far because each new digit adds to the end of their number, thus increasing the exponent for subsequent digits.\n\nSo, for each state, the number of digits taken by H is h, and by M is m. When a player takes a digit, the next digit will be added to their number, which increases their count by 1. So the position in the number is determined by their current count.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the current 'power' of the next digit for each player. For example, when H has taken h digits so far, the next digit he takes will be in the (h+1)th position of S1, contributing d * 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S1 has n digits, so the first digit taken by H is the most significant (10^{n-1}), the next is 10^{n-2}, etc. So the position in S1 is determined by the order in which H takes the digits. So when H takes the k-th digit (in their sequence), it's the (k)th digit, which contributes 10^{n - k} times the digit.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo, to compute the sum correctly, when a digit is taken by a player, it's added to their number with a weight of 10^{remaining_digits} where remaining_digits is the number of digits left to take in their sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP state should also track how many digits each player has already taken, as well as the current positions (like how many digits have been taken before this point).\n\nWait, let's think differently. The sum can be built as the sum of each digit multiplied by 10^{k}, where k is the position's significance in their respective number.\n\nFor example, for S1, the first digit taken by H contributes 10^{n-1} * d, the second 10^{n-2} * d, etc. Similarly for S2.\n\nThus, the total sum is the sum of all digits taken by H multiplied by their respective 10^p, plus the same for M.\n\nSo the problem is to assign each digit to H or M such that each gets exactly n digits, and the sum is maximized.\n\nBut the assignment must be done in a way that follows the turn-based selection.\n\nWait, but the order in which the digits are taken is fixed by the initial arrangement and the players' choices. So the first digit is taken by either H or M, then the next by the other, and so on.\n\nSo the order of the digits in A determines the order in which they are picked. So the digits are processed from left to right, but the assignment of which player picks which digit depends on the sequence of choices.\n\nSo, the problem is to choose, for each position, whether to assign it to H or M, under the constraint that exactly n are assigned to each, and the sum is maximized.\n\nWait, but the assignment isn't arbitrary because the order is determined by the players' turns. For example, the first digit is chosen by either H or M, depending on who starts. Wait, but the initial player is H or M? Or is it determined by the players themselves?\n\nWait, the problem says that before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. So initially, perhaps Homer goes first.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"each player should make exactly n moves.\" So the order of moves is determined by the players, but each player must make exactly n moves. So the total number of moves is 2n, and the players alternate turns.\n\nBut how does this affect the initial move? Does it start with H or M? It seems that it's up to the players to decide, but in the sample input, the output starts with H.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\nSample Output:\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nIn the first case, the digits are '1234'. The output is 'HHMM'—so H takes the first and third digits, M takes the second and fourth.\n\nWait, but the order of selection is H, M, H, M, etc. So the first digit is taken by H, second by M, third by H, fourth by M.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is 'HHMM', which implies that in the first four steps, H and M take digits in the order: H, M, H, M. So the initial move is H.\n\nSo, I think the initial player is H, and the turns alternate.\n\nSo, the initial state is H's turn, and each step alternates between H and M.\n\nSo, the first digit is taken by H, second by M, third by H, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that the players determine who makes the next move before each turn. So, perhaps the initial move can be either H or M. But then, the players can switch turns as they wish, as long as each makes exactly n moves.\n\nWait, but the sample shows that the initial move is H, so perhaps the initial player is H. Or maybe the initial player is determined by the players, but in the sample, they chose H to start.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify. So perhaps the initial player can be H or M, but the solution needs to choose which is better.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the players \"manage to know the number A beforehand\" and \"find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the initial player is H. Or perhaps the initial player can be either, but the solution must choose the best possible starting player.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that each player makes exactly n moves. So the total number of moves is 2n. So the initial player can be H or M, but the order must alternate until all moves are made.\n\nSo, for example, if the initial player is H, then the sequence is H, M, H, M, ..., for 2n steps. But if the initial player is M, the sequence is M, H, M, H, etc.\n\nBut which initial player gives a better sum?\n\nSo, the problem allows the players to decide who starts. So, the initial move can be H or M, whichever leads to a better total prize.\n\nThus, the solution must consider both possibilities.\n\nHmm, that complicates the DP approach, as the initial state can vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial player is always H. Because in the sample, the output starts with H. So perhaps the initial player is H.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the players determine who makes the next move before each turn. So, perhaps they can choose to switch the starting player.\n\nBut for the DP approach, perhaps the initial state is that it's H's turn, but the players can switch, so the DP must account for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial player is H. Because the players can choose to have H go first, which might be optimal.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial player is M, which could yield a better sum.\n\nBut given that the sample starts with H, perhaps the initial player is H.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is 'HHMM', which suggests that H took the first and third digits, but according to the initial order, the first is H, second is M, third is H, fourth is M.\n\nWait, that's consistent with the initial player being H.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial state is that it's H's turn.\n\nSo, moving forward, the initial state is H's turn, and the players take turns in that order.\n\nNow, back to the DP approach.\n\nEach state is defined by:\n\n- i: the current position in the digit string (from 0 to 2n-1)\n- h: number of digits taken by H so far (0 <= h <= n)\n- m: number of digits taken by M so far (0 <= m <= n)\n- turn: 0 for H's turn, 1 for M's turn\n\nThe value of the state is the maximum total sum that can be achieved from this state onward.\n\nThe transitions are:\n\nFrom state (i, h, m, turn), if it's H's turn (turn=0), then H can take the current digit (digit = A[i]), and proceed to state (i+1, h+1, m, 1). The sum added is digit * 10^{(n - (h+1))}.\n\nSimilarly, if it's M's turn, she can take the current digit, and the state transitions to (i+1, h, m+1, 0). The sum added is digit * 10^{(n - (m+1))}.\n\nWe need to compute this recursively, storing the maximum sum for each state.\n\nThe base case is when i == 2n, sum is 0.\n\nWait, but for the exponents, when a player has h digits, the next digit is the (h+1)th, which contributes 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nWait, yes. Because S1 has n digits, the first is 10^{n-1}, second 10^{n-2}, ..., nth 10^0.\n\nSo, when H has taken h digits, the next digit is the (h+1)th, which is 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nSo, in the DP, for each transition, we calculate the contribution of the current digit as digit * 10^{(n - (h+1))} if H is taking it, or digit * 10^{(n - (m+1))} if M is taking it.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the problem is that for each state, the next digits are taken in order, and the exponents depend on how many each player has taken so far.\n\nSo, the DP function will compute for each state the maximum sum achievable.\n\nWe can memoize the results using a memoization table, perhaps a dictionary or a 4-dimensional array.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 18, 2n is 36. So the i can be up to 35.\n\nh can be up to n, m up to n.\n\nturn can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo the total number of states is 36 * (18+1) * (18+1) * 2 = 36*19*19*2 ≈ 139,968. That's manageable.\n\nEach state can be computed in O(1) time with memoization.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the input: n and the string A.\n\n2. Precompute the exponents for each possible position. For each possible h, the next digit contributes 10^{n - (h+1)}. So precompute a list for H and M.\n\n3. Implement a recursive DP function with memoization, which for a given state (i, h, m, turn) returns the maximum sum achievable.\n\n4. The function works as follows:\n\n   a. If i == 2n: return 0.\n\n   b. If the state is already memoized, return the stored value.\n\n   c. Compute the digit at position i: d = A[i].\n\n   d. If it's H's turn (turn=0):\n\n      i. Take the digit, add d * 10^{n - (h+1)} to the sum.\n\n      ii. Recurse into the next state (i+1, h+1, m, 1).\n\n   e. Else (it's M's turn):\n\n      i. Take the digit, add d * 10^{n - (m+1)} to the sum.\n\n      ii. Recurse into the next state (i+1, h, m+1, 0).\n\n   f. Store the maximum of the possible sums (if any) in the memo table.\n\n5. Once the DP is computed, reconstruct the move sequence. How?\n\n   Hmm, that's a challenge. Because the DP only computes the maximum sum, not the path. So we need to keep track of the choices made to reach the maximum sum, and then backtrack from the end.\n\n   So, perhaps we can modify the DP to not only compute the maximum sum but also record the decision made (H or M) at each step.\n\n   Alternatively, we can perform a BFS or another traversal to build the path once the optimal sum is known.\n\n   Alternatively, during the DP computation, we can store the path that leads to the maximum sum.\n\n   But this can complicate the code. So perhaps it's better to first compute the maximum sum, and then find the path that achieves it.\n\n   So, first, compute the maximum sum via DP, then reconstruct the move sequence.\n\n6. Reconstructing the move sequence:\n\n   After computing the maximum sum, we can backtrack from the end of the digit string, deciding at each step whether H or M took the digit.\n\n   For example, starting from i=2n, h=n, m=n, and turn is 0 (but wait, after all digits are taken, it's irrelevant whose turn it is). Hmm.\n\n   Wait, perhaps the last move was made by either H or M, depending on whether 2n is even or odd.\n\n   Wait, for 2n digits, the number of moves is 2n, starting with H if 2n is even or something else? Wait, the initial turn is H, then M, H, M, etc. So the sequence alternates.\n\n   So, for 2n moves:\n\n   Move 0: H\n\n   Move 1: M\n\n   Move 2: H\n\n   ...\n\n   So, the parity of the move index determines whether it's H or M.\n\n   So, the move sequence can be determined by knowing which digits are taken by whom.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the move sequence can be reconstructed by working backward from the DP's decisions.\n\n   So, during the DP computation, we can also keep track of which choices (H or M) lead to the maximum sum. Then, we can backtrack from the end of the digit string, determining for each step whether H or M took the digit, based on the optimal path.\n\n   This requires modifying the DP function to also return the move sequence.\n\n   However, this can complicate the memoization, as each state would have to store both the maximum sum and the path.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps we can use memoization that includes the path.\n\n   But for the sake of efficiency, perhaps it's better to first compute the maximum sum, then perform a separate traversal to find the optimal path.\n\n   Wait, but the path is necessary to output the correct sequence of moves.\n\n   So, perhaps the approach is:\n\n   - Compute the DP to find the maximum sum.\n\n   - Then, perform a BFS or another method to find the move sequence that leads to this sum.\n\n   Alternatively, during the DP computation, we can track the choices made, i.e., for each state, we can remember whether H or M took the digit.\n\n   But this might require more memory.\n\n   So, perhaps the DP function can return a tuple (max_sum, move_sequence). But that's not feasible because the move_sequence is part of the state.\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps after computing the maximum sum, we can simulate the choices.\n\n   For example, after the DP is computed, and the maximum sum is known, we can try to find the path by checking, for each state, what choice (H or M) led to the maximum sum.\n\n   Wait, but this requires storing, for each state, the choice that led to the maximum sum.\n\n   So, perhaps we can create a parent pointer table, which for each state, stores the choice that led to it (H or M).\n\n   So, during the DP computation, when a state is visited, the choice is recorded, and the parent points to the previous state.\n\n   Then, once the maximum sum is found, we can backtrack from the end state (i=2n, h=n, m=n, turn=0 or 1) to build the move sequence.\n\n   Wait, but the end state's turn is irrelevant, as all digits have been taken.\n\n   So, during the backtracking, for each state, we can see whether the digit was taken by H or M, and then move to the previous state.\n\n   Let's outline this:\n\n   1. Compute the DP as before, storing for each state the maximum sum and the choice (H or M) that led to it.\n\n   2. Starting from the end state (i=2n, h=n, m=n), determine whether the last digit was taken by H or M.\n\n   3. Then, for each previous state, determine which choice was made, and append the corresponding letter to the move sequence.\n\n   But how to determine whether the last digit was taken by H or M?\n\n   Because the last digit is the 2n-th digit (since i starts at 0?), wait no. The digits are from 0 to 2n-1, so the last digit is i=2n-1.\n\n   So, when i=2n-1, the next state is i=2n.\n\n   So, in the state (2n-1, h, m, turn), the choice is whether H or M took the digit.\n\n   So, during backtracking, we can start from the state (2n, h=n, m=n, turn=0), and see what the previous state was, and so on.\n\n   Wait, but when i=2n, h and m are both n, and the turn is irrelevant.\n\n   So, the last move was taken at i=2n-1.\n\n   So, to get the last move, look at the state (i=2n-1, h_prev, m_prev, turn_prev).\n\n   Then, the choice is whether H or M took the digit at i=2n-1.\n\n   So, for each state, we can track the choice made.\n\n   So, during the DP, for each state, we can store:\n\n   - max_sum: the maximum sum achievable from this state.\n\n   - prev_choice: 'H' or 'M' indicating who took the digit at this state.\n\n   - parent_state: the previous state.\n\n   Wait, but that's getting complicated.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps for each state, we can store the choice made at that state, and then backtrack from the end.\n\n   So, during the DP, for each state (i, h, m, turn), we can store the choice (H or M) that was made to reach this state.\n\n   Then, when building the move sequence, we can start from the end, and for each step, determine whether the current state's choice was H or M, and prepend that to the result.\n\n   So, let's outline the steps:\n\n   1. Compute the DP as before, storing for each state (i, h, m, turn) the maximum sum and the choice (H or M) that was made to reach this state.\n\n   2. Once the DP is complete, start from the end state (i=2n, h=n, m=n, turn=0) and backtrack.\n\n   3. For each state, if i < 2n, then the choice made was to take the digit at i, and we can add that choice to the move sequence.\n\n   4. Continue backtracking until all digits are processed.\n\n   Wait, but the initial state is i=0, turn=0 (H's turn). So the first move is H, then M, etc.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps during backtracking, the order is reversed, so the first move in the sequence is the last choice made.\n\n   So, for example, when backtracking from the end, the first digit chosen is the last in the move sequence.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the move sequence is built in the order of the moves: the first move is the first character in the output string.\n\n   So, when backtracking from the end state, we collect the choices in reverse order.\n\n   So, during backtracking, the first choice we find is the last digit taken, which corresponds to the last character in the move sequence.\n\n   So, to build the move sequence correctly, we can collect the choices in reverse order and then reverse them at the end.\n\n   Now, how to implement this.\n\n   Let's think about the code.\n\n   So, in Python, the DP can be implemented with memoization using lru_cache. But since the state includes i, h, m, and turn, which are all integers, it's feasible.\n\n   But wait, Python's lru_cache can handle functions with parameters as integers, but for n=18, the state space is manageable.\n\n   So, the plan for the code:\n\n   - Read n and A.\n\n   - Precompute for each h and m the exponents needed for each digit.\n\n   Wait, but during the DP, for each state, the exponent is determined by the current h and m. So perhaps precomputing is not necessary.\n\n   Instead, in the DP function, for a state (i, h, m, turn), when a player takes the digit, the exponent is n - (their count + 1).\n\n   So, for H, if he takes the digit, the exponent is n - (h+1).\n\n   For M, it's n - (m+1).\n\n   So, during the DP, for each choice, calculate the digit's value accordingly.\n\n   Now, let's outline the code.\n\n   First, the code will read n and A.\n\n   Then, the DP function is defined.\n\n   But in Python, for memoization with mutable types, using a decorator like lru_cache is useful, but it's limited to hashable types. So, the function must take immutable parameters, like integers.\n\n   So, the DP function can be written as:\n\n   def dp(i, h, m, turn):\n       # returns the maximum sum achievable from this state.\n\n   But to memoize, we can use lru_cache with parameters as integers.\n\n   So, the code skeleton would be:\n\n   from functools import lru_cache\n\n   n = int(input())\n   A = input().strip()\n\n   @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n   def dfs(i, h, m, turn):\n       if i == 2*n:\n           return 0\n       # digit is A[i]\n       d = int(A[i])\n       res = 0\n       if turn == 0:\n           # H's turn\n           # option 1: H takes it\n           s1 = d * (10 ** (n - (h + 1)))\n           new_h = h + 1\n           next_turn = 1\n           option1 = s1 + dfs(i+1, new_h, m, next_turn)\n           # option 2: no, wait, H can't choose not to take it. Because the player must make exactly n moves. So H must take it if it's his turn.\n\n           # So, H must take it.\n           # So only one option.\n           return option1\n       else:\n           # M's turn\n           s2 = d * (10 ** (n - (m + 1)))\n           new_m = m + 1\n           next_turn = 0\n           return s2 + dfs(i+1, h, new_m, next_turn)\n\n   Wait, wait. No, because the function must make sure that each player makes exactly n moves. So, in the DP, the constraints are that h can't exceed n, and m can't exceed n.\n\n   So, in the function, we must ensure that h <=n and m <=n.\n\n   But in the code above, since the initial call is with h=0, m=0, and turn=0, and each move increases h or m, it's safe.\n\n   Wait, but in the initial code, for the first step, h is 0, so H takes the digit, h becomes 1, and so on.\n\n   So, the code is correct.\n\n   Wait, but wait: the function returns the sum, but the move sequence isn't tracked. So, after computing the maximum sum, we need to find the move sequence.\n\n   So, the code needs to compute the maximum sum, then find the path.\n\n   So, the code would first call dfs(0, 0, 0, 0), which gives the maximum sum.\n\n   Then, to find the move sequence, we can backtrack from the state (i=2n, h=n, m=n, turn=0), but actually, when i=2n, all digits are taken, so the last state is (2n-1, h_prev, m_prev, turn_prev), where h_prev + m_prev == 2n-1.\n\n   Wait, perhaps it's better to have a separate function that reconstructs the path.\n\n   Alternatively, during the DP, for each state, we can track the choice (H or M) that was made to reach it.\n\n   So, perhaps the DP function can return a tuple (max_sum, move_sequence), but that's not feasible because the move_sequence varies for different paths.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps the code can be modified to track the path.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps we can create a parent array that, for each state, records the choice made to reach it.\n\n   So, during the DP, for each state (i, h, m, turn), we can record whether the choice was H or M, and the previous state.\n\n   But this requires additional memory.\n\n   So, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\n   After computing the maximum sum, we can create a dictionary or a 4-dimensional array to track the choice (H or M) and the previous state for each current state.\n\n   Then, starting from the end state (i=2n, h=n, m=n), we can backtrack to find the choices.\n\n   Let's outline this.\n\n   1. Compute the maximum sum using the DP function.\n\n   2. Create a parent structure, say, a dictionary, where for each (i, h, m, turn), we store the choice (H or M) and the previous state (i_prev, h_prev, m_prev, turn_prev).\n\n   3. Start from the end state (i=2n, h=n, m=n, turn=0), and work backwards.\n\n   4. For each step, determine whether H or M took the current digit, and then move to the previous state.\n\n   5. Collect these choices in reverse order and then reverse them to get the move sequence.\n\n   So, the code would look something like this:\n\n   # Compute the maximum sum\n   max_sum = dfs(0, 0, 0, 0)\n\n   # Now, reconstruct the path\n   current_i = 2*n\n   current_h = n\n   current_m = n\n   current_turn = 0  # Doesn't matter, since all digits are taken.\n\n   move_sequence = []\n   while current_i > 0:\n       # Find the previous state\n       # Look up in the parent structure for (current_i-1, ...)\n       # Wait, the previous state was (current_i-1, h_prev, m_prev, turn_prev)\n       # And the choice was whether H or M took the digit at i=current_i-1.\n\n       # Wait, no. The current_i is i, and the previous state is (i-1, ...), but the choice depends on whether H or M took the digit at i-1.\n\n       # So, for the current state (current_i, h, m, turn), the digit taken was at current_i-1.\n\n       # So, the previous state is (current_i-1, h_prev, m_prev, turn_prev).\n\n       # Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that the digit taken at i was the one that led to the current state.\n\n       # So, for the current state (i, h, m, turn), the digit was taken at i-1.\n\n       # So, to find the choice for i-1, we look into the state (i-1, h_prev, m_prev, turn_prev), and see whether H or M took it.\n\n       # But this is getting a bit tangled.\n\n       # Alternative approach: create a dictionary called 'prev' where for each state (i, h, m, turn), we store the choice and the previous state.\n\n       # So, during the DP, for each state, when we compute the maximum sum, we also record the choice and the previous state.\n\n       # So, during the DP, for each state, we can update a dictionary that maps (i, h, m, turn) to (previous_i, previous_h, previous_m, previous_turn, choice).\n\n       # Then, when backtracking, we can follow this chain.\n\n       # So, the code would need to have a way to track this.\n\n       # But perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\n   Another approach: during the DP computation, for each state, we can track the choice made, i.e., whether H or M took the digit at that step. Then, when backtracking, we can collect the choices in reverse order.\n\n   So, let's adjust the DP function to return the choice made.\n\n   So, the DP function can return a tuple (max_sum, choice), where choice is 'H' or 'M'.\n\n   But in Python, returning multiple values is possible, but the lru_cache can't handle it. So, perhaps the function can return a dictionary with 'sum' and 'choice'.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the function can return a tuple, but the lru_cache can't cache it properly.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\n   Maybe it's better to first compute the maximum sum, then perform a separate BFS or iterative approach to find the move sequence",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns picking digits from a given number A. The goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by the digits each player collects, with each player making exactly n moves.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the maximum possible sum achievable from each state. The state is defined by the current position in the digit string, the number of digits taken by each player so far, and whose turn it is next. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Use a recursive function with memoization to compute the maximum sum from each state. Each state transition considers whether the current player takes the next digit and updates the state accordingly.\n2. **Memoization**: Store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: After computing the maximum sum, backtrack from the end state to reconstruct the move sequence that led to the optimal solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dfs(i, h, m, turn):\n    if i == 2 * n:\n        return 0\n    d = int(A[i])\n    res = 0\n    if turn == 0:\n        # H's turn, must take the digit\n        exponent = n - (h + 1)\n        res += d * (10 ** exponent)\n        new_h = h + 1\n        next_turn = 1\n        return res + dfs(i + 1, new_h, m, next_turn)\n    else:\n        # M's turn, must take the digit\n        exponent = n - (m + 1)\n        res += d * (10 ** exponent)\n        new_m = m + 1\n        next_turn = 0\n        return res + dfs(i + 1, h, new_m, next_turn)\n\nmax_sum = dfs(0, 0, 0, 0)\n\n# Now, reconstruct the move sequence\nmove_sequence = []\ncurrent_i = 2 * n\ncurrent_h = n\ncurrent_m = n\ncurrent_turn = 0  # Doesn't matter\n\nwhile current_i > 0:\n    # Move back one step\n    current_i -= 1\n    d = int(A[current_i])\n    if current_turn == 0:\n        # Previous choice was M's turn\n        # Check if previous state had M taking it\n        prev_state = (current_i, current_h, current_m, current_turn)\n        # Wait, perhaps a better way is to track parent pointers\n        # Alternative approach: create a dictionary to store for each state the choice and previous state\n        # But for brevity, let's try to find an alternative way\n        # Alternatively, since the function knows which choice was made, perhaps we can track via the function calls\n        # But this is complicated.
