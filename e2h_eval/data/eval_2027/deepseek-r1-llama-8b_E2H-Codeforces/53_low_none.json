Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap, so that's something to consider.\n\nLet me think about the approach. So the problem is similar to finding the longest repeated substring. I remember that there's a sliding window technique for such problems, especially when dealing with substrings.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with the examples provided.\n\nIn the first example, the input is 'abcd'. Since all characters are unique, the only possible substrings that repeat are single characters, but each appears only once. So the output is 0 because no substring longer than that repeats.\n\nThe second example is 'ababa'. Here, the substring 'aba' appears starting at position 0 and position 2. So the length is 3.\n\nThe third example is 'zzz'. The entire string 'zzz' appears twice (since it's three characters, the substrings starting at 0 and 1 would both be 'zz', but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, in this case, the substring 'zz' appears at positions 0-1 and 1-2. So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the output is 0, 3, 2 respectively.\n\nHmm. So the task is to find the maximum possible k such that there exists a substring of length k that occurs at least two times in the string.\n\nHow do I approach this?\n\nOne way is to check all possible substrings and see if any of them appear more than once. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, this might not be too bad.\n\nBut wait, the maximum possible substring length is 99 (for a string of length 100). For each possible length l, starting from the largest possible down to 1, we check if there exists a substring of length l that occurs more than once. Once we find such an l, we return it.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible lengths l, starting from the largest possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1.\n2. For each l, collect all substrings of length l in the string.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears more than once.\n4. If yes, then return l as the answer.\n5. If none found for a particular l, decrease l by 1 and repeat.\n\nIf after checking all possible l's down to 1, no duplicates are found, then the answer is 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nFor step 2 and 3: for a given l, collect all substrings of length l, and use a set or a dictionary to track their occurrences. If any substring appears more than once, then we have our answer.\n\nWait, but the order matters because the same substring can appear in overlapping positions. So, for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears starting at index 0 and 2. So it's allowed.\n\nSo for each l, generate all possible substrings of length l, store them in a hash set, and if adding a substring already exists in the set, then we know that l is a candidate.\n\nWait, no, because for a given l, we can have multiple substrings. So for each substring, we add it to a set. If during this process, we find a substring that's already in the set, we immediately know that this l is valid, because it means the substring has occurred before.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Because the set is being built as we iterate through the string. So for each substring s of length l starting at position i, we add it to the set. If s is already present, then yes, it's a duplicate occurrence, so we can return l as the answer.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the string 'aaaaa', when l=2, the first substring is 'aa' (i=0), added to the set. Then i=1, substring is 'aa' again. When we try to add it to the set, we find it's already present, so we can return 2 as the answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm would look like this:\n\nmax_length = 0\nfor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    substr_set = set()\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in substr_set:\n            # Found a duplicate, return l\n            return l\n        substr_set.add(substr)\n# After all l, if nothing found, return 0\n\nWait, but wait. The loop for l starts from len(s)-1? Because for a string of length n, the maximum possible l is n-1, since a substring of length n-1 can appear",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking all possible substrings of the given string, starting from the longest possible substrings down to the shortest. For each length, we use a set to track substrings and check for duplicates. If a duplicate is found, we immediately return the current length as the result. This ensures that we find the longest valid substring efficiently.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible length of the substring (which is one less than the length of the string) and decrease down to 1.\n2. **Check Substrings for Each Length**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length and use a set to track them. If a substring is found to be a duplicate, return the current length.\n3. **Return Result**: If no duplicates are found for any length, return 0 as the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = 0\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Loop Through Lengths**: Starting from the longest possible substring length down to 1.\n3. **Track Substrings with Set**: For each length, generate all substrings and add them to a set. If a substring is already in the set, it means it has appeared before, so we print the current length and exit.\n4. **Output Result**: If no duplicates are found after checking all lengths, print 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each possible substring length, ensuring that we find the longest valid substring quickly by leveraging the properties of sets for fast lookups.",
