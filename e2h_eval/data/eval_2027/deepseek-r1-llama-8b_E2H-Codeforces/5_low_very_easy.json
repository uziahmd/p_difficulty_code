Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And also, output those pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem better.\n\nSo, each left boot has a color (a lowercase letter or '?'), same for right boots. Two colors are compatible if they're the same or one is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the description: an indefinite color (i.e., '?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color. So, when either is '?', they are compatible. Otherwise, both must be exactly the same.\n\nSo, for two boots to form a pair, their left and right color must satisfy:\n\n- Both are '?', which is compatible.\n- Or, one is '?', the other is any (including '?').\n- Or both are the same letter.\n\nBut wait, the question says: two specific colors are compatible only if they are exactly the same. So, if l_i is 'a' and r_i is 'a', it's compatible. If either is '?', then it's compatible regardless of the other.\n\nSo, how do we model this?\n\nI think the approach is to find as many pairs as possible, selecting left and right boots, ensuring that each left is used once, each right is used once, and their colors are compatible.\n\nThis sounds like a bipartite graph matching problem. Each left node can connect to right nodes where they are compatible. Then, the maximum matching would give the maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 150,000. So, a standard maximum bipartite matching algorithm like the Hungarian method isn't feasible because it's O(n^3), which is way too slow for n=1.5e5.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. What if we precompute for each left boot, the set of right boots that are compatible with it. But even that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can group the left and right boots in such a way that we can compute the maximum possible pairs efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: since the compatibility condition is symmetric for certain cases, maybe we can find a way to pair left and right without considering all possibilities.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible scenarios between a left and right boot:\n\nCase 1: l is '?'. Then it can pair with any right boot, regardless of r's color.\n\nCase 2: r is '?'. Then it can pair with any left boot, regardless of l's color.\n\nCase 3: Both are specific letters. They can only pair if they are the same.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy is to first handle the cases where either side is '?', and then handle the specific letters.\n\nWait, but the problem is that after using some '?', we might affect the available specific letters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by counting the number of '?' on the left and right, and see how they can be paired.\n\nWait, here's an approach:\n\nLet's separate the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Pairs involving at least one '?'.\n\n2. Pairs where both are specific letters.\n\nWe can calculate the maximum possible pairs from each part and sum them, but we have to ensure that the usage of '?' doesn't overlap.\n\nWait, but the '?' can be in either left or right, so perhaps the order in which we process them matters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to maximize the number of pairs that involve at least one '?', and then handle the remaining specific pairs.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think differently.\n\nEach '?' in the left can be matched to any right boot, including ones with '?'. Similarly for right '?'.\n\nWait, but if a left boot is '?', it can be paired with any right, including a right '?'.\n\nSimilarly, a right '?' can be paired with any left, including left '?'.\n\nBut when a left is '?', and a right is also '?', then this is a compatible pair, but perhaps it's more efficient to pair a left '?' with a right specific, rather than two '?'s.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to find how many '?' are on each side and see how much they can be utilized.\n\nLet me consider the following steps:\n\n1. Count the number of '?' in left and right.\n\nLet L_q = number of '?' in l.\n\nR_q = number of '?' in r.\n\n2. Now, the maximum number of pairs where at least one is '?' is the minimum of L_q + R_q and n.\n\nWait, no. Because each pair requires one left and one right.\n\nWait, actually, the number of such pairs is min(L_q + R_q, n). Because each pair can consist of a left '?' and any right (including another '?'),",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot has a color, which can be a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Two boots are compatible if their colors are the same or if one of them is a question mark.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Count Question Marks**: First, count the number of question marks in both the left and right boot strings. These question marks can form pairs with any other boot regardless of their specific color.\n2. **Calculate Maximum Pairs from Question Marks**: The maximum number of pairs that can be formed using question marks is the minimum of the total number of question marks on both sides and the total number of boots (n). This is because each pair requires one left and one right boot.\n3. **Pair Remaining Boots**: After utilizing all possible pairs involving question marks, we handle the remaining specific color pairs. For each specific color on the left, we look for the same specific color on the right and form pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = input[1]\n    r = input[2]\n\n    # Count question marks in left and right\n    L_q = l.count('?')\n    R_q = r.count('?')\n\n    # Compute maximum possible pairs using at least one '?'\n    max_pairs_with_q = min(L_q + R_q, n)\n    remaining_L = n - max_pairs_with_q\n\n    # Now handle specific pairs\n    # Create a frequency map for left specific colors\n    left_counts = {}\n    for c in l:\n        if c != '?':\n            left_counts[c] = left_counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n\n    # Create a frequency map for right specific colors\n    right_counts = {}\n    for c in r:\n        if c != '?':\n            right_counts[c] = right_counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n\n    # For each left specific color, take as many as possible from right\n    specific_pairs = 0\n    used_right = set()\n    for c in left_counts:\n        if c in right_counts and c not in used_right:\n            take = min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])\n            specific_pairs += take\n            used_right.update([c] * take)\n\n    # Now, construct the answer\n    # Collect all pairs: first those from question marks, then specific ones\n    pairs = []\n\n    # For question marks: assign lefts to rights in some order\n    # Let's collect all left indices where l[i] is '?'\n    left_q_indices = [i+1 for i, c in enumerate(l) if c == '?']\n    right_q_indices = [i+1 for i, c in enumerate(r) if c == '?']\n\n    # We'll match as many as possible\n    matched_q = 0\n    for i in range(len(left_q_indices)):\n        l_idx = left_q_indices[i]\n        for j in range(len(right_q_indices)):\n            r_idx = right_q_indices[j]\n            if matched_q >= max_pairs_with_q:\n                break\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n            matched_q += 1\n        if matched_q >= max_pairs_with_q:\n            break\n\n    # Now add specific pairs\n    specific_list = []\n    for c in left_counts:\n        if c in right_counts and c not in used_right:\n            # Find the right indices that have c and are not used\n            # Iterate through right indices and find those with c\n            for r_idx in [i+1 for i, c_r in enumerate(r) if c_r == c]:\n                if r_idx not in used_right:\n                    specific_list.append((left_counts[c], r_idx))\n                    used_right.add(r_idx)\n                    specific_pairs += 1\n                    break\n\n    # Combine all pairs\n    all_pairs = pairs + specific_list\n\n    print(specific_pairs + matched_q)\n    for pair in all_pairs:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and the respective strings representing left and right boot colors.\n2. **Counting Question Marks**: The number of question marks in both left and right strings is counted.\n3. **Maximizing Question Mark Pairs**: Using the counts of question marks, we determine the maximum possible pairs that can be formed using at least one question mark.\n4. **Handling Specific Colors**: After using up the question marks, we count the frequency of each specific color on both sides and form pairs where colors match.\n5. **Constructing Pairs**: We construct the list of pairs by first using all possible question mark pairs and then adding specific color pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently, even for large values of n.",
