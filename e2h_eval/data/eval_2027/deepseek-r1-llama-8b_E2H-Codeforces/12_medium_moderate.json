The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So the i-th task can only be done after she's handled all earlier ones. My goal is to find the minimum time she needs to finish all her tasks.\n\nHmm, let's think about the example they gave. In the first test case, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks: 3,2,3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. That makes sense because she has to go through each required house in the order that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? It seems like for each task, she needs to reach the required house at the earliest possible time, considering the previous tasks.\n\nI think the key here is to process the tasks in the order of their indices. Since each task depends on the completion of all previous ones, we can sort the tasks in increasing order of their positions. But wait, no, because the problem says that the i-th task must be completed after all j-th tasks where j < i. So the order of processing is fixed as per the original sequence. Or is it?\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, the second line is m integers a1, a2,..., am. These represent the tasks in order. So for task 1, she just needs to be at a1. For task 2, she must be at a2 after completing task 1, and so on.\n\nBut wait, maybe the tasks are processed in the order of their indices. Like, task 1 comes first, then task 2, etc. So she has to process them in the given order, but for each step, she might need to go back if the next task's position is before the current one.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the problem says that the i-th task requires being in ai and has to be done after all j < i. So the order of processing is such that she can't start task i until she's done with all j < i. But the actual movement happens in the sequence of the tasks.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the way to model this is to track the current position and the time taken, and for each task, determine the minimal path from the current position to the new task's position, considering the ring structure.\n\nBut since the ring is circular, moving from a house to the next clockwise is one unit of time. So the distance between two points can be calculated in terms of the minimal steps needed. For example, the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod n, but since the direction is only clockwise, you can't go the other way around. Wait, no. Because the ring is one-way, so you can only move in the clockwise direction. So the movement is always forward, meaning that the distance from a to b is (b - a) if b >= a, else (n - a + b). So for example, from 3 to 2 in a 4-house ring: 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps.\n\nSo the minimal time to get from a to b is (b - a) % n. But wait, (b -a) could be negative. So let's compute the difference as (b - a) % n, but since movement is only clockwise, the minimal steps are (b - a + n) % n.\n\nYes, because for a=3, b=2, (2-3) is -1, adding n=4 gives 3, which is correct.\n\nSo for each task, starting from the current position, calculate the minimal steps to reach the new a_i. Then, add those steps to the total time.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Because once she starts a task, she can't leave until it's done. So for consecutive same tasks, she doesn't need to move again. For example, if the next task is same as current, she's already there, so no movement is needed.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Sort the tasks in the order of their indices. Wait, no, because the order of the tasks matters for the dependencies. Because each task must be done in the order given. So the first task is a1, then a2, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be at a_i and have completed all tasks j < i. So the order of processing the tasks is fixed. So the first task is a1, second is a2, etc., and for each step i, she must be at a_i when she finishes processing all previous tasks.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the order in which she processes the tasks may affect the time. For example, she could choose to process them in any order as long as the dependencies are met. But no, the problem states that the i-th task must be done after all j < i. So the order is fixed as the original sequence. So we have to process a1, then a2, ..., am in that exact order.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1, time = 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to m:\n\n   target = a_i\n\n   distance = (target - current_position) % n\n\n   if distance == 0:\n\n       time += 0\n\n   else:\n\n       time += distance\n\n   current_position = target\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because the movement is along the ring, so for each step, moving from current position to target, considering the ring's one-way direction.\n\nBut wait, perhaps that's exactly what we need to do. Because each task is processed in order, and for each task, we have to move from the current position to the target, taking the minimal steps needed in the clockwise direction.\n\nLet's test this with the first example:\n\nInput: 4 3, 3 2 3.\n\nSo n=4, m=3, a = [3, 2, 3].\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3:\n\ndistance is (3-1) = 2 steps. So time +=2 → time=2.\n\ncurrent_position=3.\n\nSecond task is 2:\n\ndistance is (2-3) mod 4 → (2-3) is -1 → 3 mod4=3. So time +=3 → 5.\n\ncurrent_position=2.\n\nThird task is3:\n\ndistance is (3-2)=1 → time +=1 →6.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother example: input '4 3\\n2 3 3'.\n\nSo a = [2,3,3].\n\nProcess:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task:2. Steps: (2-1)=1 → time=1.\n\nSecond task:3. From 2, (3-2)=1 → time=2.\n\nThird task:3. No steps needed → time remains 2.\n\nWhich is the output given.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nWait, but what about when a task is in the same position as the current position? Then no steps are needed. Which is correct.\n\nWhat about when a task is before the current position? Like, suppose current is 3, next task is 1 in a 4-house ring.\n\nDistance is (1-3) mod4 → (1-3)=-2 mod4 is 2. So movement is 2 steps: 3→4→1.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the tasks in the order they are given, and for each, compute the minimal steps from current position to target, considering the ring.\n\nBut wait, another thought: What if the order of processing the tasks could be changed? For example, maybe processing certain tasks earlier could result in fewer steps overall. But according to the problem statement, the i-th task must be done after all j <i. So the order is fixed as per the input sequence. So we cannot reorder the tasks.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nWe'll read n and m, then the list a.\n\nWe'll process each element in a in the order given.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, time =0.\n\nFor each ai in a:\n\n   compute the distance as (ai - current_pos) % n.\n\n   if distance is 0: continue.\n\n   else: add distance to time.\n\n   set current_pos to ai.\n\nFinally, print time.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial position is 1, right? Yes.\n\nTesting this logic with sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nSteps:\n\ncurrent_pos =1, time=0.\n\nFirst ai=3:\n\ndistance is 2 → time=2.\n\ncurrent_pos=3.\n\nSecond ai=2:\n\ndistance is (2-3) mod4= 3 → time=5.\n\ncurrent_pos=2.\n\nThird ai=3:\n\ndistance is 1 → time=6.\n\nYes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nai=2: distance 1 → time=1.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\nai=3: distance 1 → time=2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\nai=3: 0 → time remains 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,2]. Initial position 1.\n\nFirst step: move to 2 (distance 1, time=1).\n\nSecond step: already at 2 → time remains 1.\n\nSo output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[1,4,5].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nFirst ai=1: no movement.\n\nSecond ai=4: distance is (4-1)=3 → time +=3 →3.\n\nThird ai=5: (5-4)=1 → time=4.\n\nSo total 4.\n\nBut what's the optimal path? She starts at 1, then moves to 2,3,4 (3 steps), then to 5 (1 step). Total 4 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[3, 1,5].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nai=3: distance 2 → time=2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\nai=1: distance is (1-3) mod5 → (-2 mod5)=3 → time +=3 →5.\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nai=5: (5-1)=4 → time=9.\n\nTotal 9.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way? Well, no, because the order is fixed.\n\nShe has to go to 3, then to 1, then to5.\n\nSo steps: 1→2→3 (2 steps), then 3→4→5→1 (3 steps), then 1→2→3→4→5 (4 steps). Total 2+3+4=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nIn Python, reading the input:\n\nFirst line: n and m.\n\nSecond line: m integers.\n\nWe can read using input().split().\n\nThen, process each ai in the list a.\n\nCompute distance as (ai - current_pos) % n.\n\nAdd to time if not zero.\n\nUpdate current_pos.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n    if diff != 0:\n        time += diff\n    current = num\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, but wait: the modulo operation in Python returns a non-negative number. So (num - current) could be negative, but mod n ensures that the difference is in [0, n). So for example, (2-3) mod4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTest case where current is 3, num is 2, n=4.\n\n(2-3) = -1 → mod4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nBut wait, what about the edge case where n=1? Well, the constraints say n>=2, so no problem.\n\nWait, the problem statement says n >=2.\n\nSo no issues.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0? Well, no, m is >=1.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: m is 1<=m<=105. So m can be 1.\n\nSo, code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 4 3 → a = [3,2,3]\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\n3-1=2 → time 2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\n2-3 = -1 → 3 mod4 → time +=3 →5.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\n3-2=1 → time +=1 →6.\n\nPrint 6.\n\nSample 2: a = [2,3,3].\n\ncurrent=1.\n\n2-1=1 → time 1.\n\n3-2=1 → time 2.\n\n3-3=0 → no addition.\n\nTime is 2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,2].\n\ncurrent=1.\n\n2-1=1 → time 1.\n\n2-2=0 → no change.\n\nTime is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a = [3,1,5].\n\ncurrent=1.\n\n3-1=2 → time 2.\n\n1-3 → mod5 is 3 → time 5.\n\n5-1=4 → time 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts from house number 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the given order, and she must be at the specified house when each task is done.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to move clockwise around a ring of `n` houses. Each task specifies a target house that must be reached after completing all previous tasks. The movement between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n2. **Intuition**: Since the movement is restricted to clockwise direction, the distance between two houses `a` and `b` can be computed as `(b - a) % n`. This accounts for the circular nature of the ring.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Start at house 1.\n   - For each task in the given order, compute the minimal clockwise distance from the current position to the target house.\n   - Update the total time with the computed distance.\n   - Move to the target house and repeat until all tasks are completed.\n4. **Complexity**: The solution processes each task exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n    if diff != 0:\n        time += diff\n    current = num\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `time` set to 0.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each target house in the list `a`, compute the clockwise distance from the current position. If the distance is non-zero, add it to the total time and update the current position to the target house.\n- **Output**: After processing all tasks, print the total time required.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia completes each task in the minimum possible time by moving clockwise around the ring, adhering to the problem constraints.",
