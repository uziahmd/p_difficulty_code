His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have in an Olympiad based on his total points. The teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x points. The input gives us two lists: one for the first tour scores and another for the second tour, but they're in arbitrary order.\n\nHmm, the key here is that each participant has a score from both tours, but the lists a and b are given without any correspondence. So for each participant, their total is a[i] + b[j], but we don't know which a corresponds to which b. That makes it a bit tricky.\n\nOur goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings of a and b that sum up to at least x.\n\nWait, but how do I model this? Because the pairing can vary, leading to different possible total sums for each participant. We need to find the best and worst possible rankings based on all possible valid pairings.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, the best possible rank for Vasya. To maximize his rank (i.e., get as high a position as possible), we want as many participants as possible to have a total sum less than or equal to his. So, for the best case, we should pair the a's and b's such that as few other participants as possible have a higher total than Vasya's.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the best possible rank is the smallest possible number of people who have a higher total than Vasya. So to minimize his rank, we arrange things so that as few others as possible have a higher sum than him.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, we want as many participants as possible to have a higher or equal sum than Vasya, thus pushing his rank as low as possible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible pairs where a_i + b_j >= x, because Vasya must have a sum >=x.\n\n2. For each possible way to assign a and b to each participant, compute the sum for each participant.\n\n3. For each such assignment, determine Vasya's rank (best and worst).\n\nBut wait, the number of possible pairings is n! / (n-n)! ), but n can be up to 105, so that's way too big.\n\nThat's not feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the a and b arrays are given, perhaps we can sort them in certain ways to find the optimal scenarios.\n\nWait, but each participant's sum is a permutation of a and b. So, for each participant i, their sum is a_p[i] + b_q[i], where p and q are permutations of the indices.\n\nWait, no, because each a is used exactly once and each b is used exactly once. So the sum for each participant is a permutation of a's and b's.\n\nWait, but the actual way to pair a and b depends on how we arrange the sums. So to find the best possible rank for Vasya, we need to pair the a's and b's such that as few as possible others have a sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For each possible a_i and b_j, their sum is s = a_i + b_j. But since each a can be paired with exactly one b, and each b exactly once, perhaps the problem reduces to finding for each possible a_i and b_j (that form Vasya's sum), the maximum and minimum number of sums that are strictly greater than s.\n\nWait, but Vasya's sum could vary depending on how we pair a and b. So for each possible s (sums a_i + b_j >= x), we can compute how many other pairs (a_k + b_l) are greater than s, and then see what is the minimal and maximal possible.\n\nBut since the pairing must use all a's and b's, it's a matter of choosing a permutation where the sum for each participant is a_i + b_p(i), such that exactly one pair is chosen as Vasya's (sum >=x), and then the rest are arranged accordingly.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x, and for each such pair, calculate:\n\n- What is the maximum possible number of participants whose sum is > current sum (which would give the worst possible rank for Vasya)\n- What is the minimum possible number of participants whose sum is > current sum (to get the best rank)\n\nWait, because for each possible (a_i, b_j) that forms Vasya's sum, we can compute the maximum and minimum number of participants that can have a sum strictly larger than s = a_i + b_j.\n\nThen, for each s in the possible sums (where s >=x), we can find the best and worst possible ranks.\n\nThe best rank for Vasya is 1 plus the number of participants (other than himself) who have a sum strictly larger than s. To minimize this number, we want as few participants as possible to have a sum > s.\n\nSimilarly, the worst rank is 1 plus the maximum possible number of participants with sum > s.\n\nWait, but how do we compute, for a given s, the maximum and minimum possible number of participants that can have a sum > s when pairing the remaining a's and b's.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each possible (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x, we compute s = a_i + b_j. Then, for this s, we need to find:\n\nBest rank: the minimal number of participants (excluding Vasya) that can have sum > s. So, how to arrange the remaining a's and b's to minimize the count of sums >s.\n\nSimilarly, worst rank: the maximal number of participants (excluding Vasya) that can have sum > s. How to arrange the remaining a's and b's to maximize this count.\n\nOnce we have these min and max counts for each possible s, we can compute the best and worst ranks across all possible s's.\n\nWait, but we need to choose the best possible scenario for the best rank (i.e., find the s that gives the smallest possible count of participants >s). Similarly for the worst.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible (i,j) pairs where a_i + b_j >=x. These are the possible s values that Vasya can have.\n\n2. For each such s, calculate:\n\n   a. The minimal possible number of participants (excluding Vasya) that have sum > s. This is the best case for Vasya's rank.\n\n   b. The maximal possible number of participants (excluding Vasya) that have sum > s. This is the worst case.\n\n3. Among all possible s's, find the minimal value of (a) and the maximal value of (b), and determine the corresponding ranks.\n\nBut how to compute a and b for a given s.\n\nLet's think about a) first: minimal number of participants with sum >s.\n\nWe want as few as possible other participants to have sum >s. So, for the remaining a's and b's (excluding a_i and b_j), we need to pair them in a way that as few as possible sums exceed s.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nWe can try to pair the largest a's with the smallest possible b's, to minimize the number of sums exceeding s.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nTo minimize the number of sums > s, for the remaining a and b, we can pair the largest a's with the smallest possible b's, so that their sum is as small as possible.\n\nWait, wait: if a is large, to prevent a + b from being >s, we can pair it with a small b.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that maximizes the number of pairs where a + b <= s.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of sums >s is equal to the maximum between the number of a's larger than (s - b_min) and the number of b's larger than (s - a_max).\n\nNot sure. Maybe it's easier to model this as follows:\n\nFor the remaining a's and b's (after selecting a_i and b_j as Vasya's sum), the minimal possible number of participants with sum >s is the minimal possible count when you optimally pair the a's and b's.\n\nSimilarly, the maximal possible count is when you pair them in a way that maximizes the number of sums >s.\n\nSo, how to compute the minimal count:\n\nThe minimal count is the minimal number of pairs (a_k, b_l) where a_k + b_l > s, after pairing the remaining a's and b's.\n\nTo find this, we can:\n\nSort the remaining a's in ascending order, and the remaining b's in descending order.\n\nThen, pair the smallest a's with the largest b's first. Because pairing small a's with large b's may result in more sums >s.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, to minimize the number of sums >s, we want as few pairs as possible to have a + b >s.\n\nSo, to minimize this, we can pair the largest a's with the smallest possible b's. Because if a is large, adding a small b may keep the sum below s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to do it is:\n\nSort the remaining a's in ascending order, and the remaining b's in descending order. Then, for each a in sorted a's, pair it with the largest possible b that hasn't been paired yet, but only if a + b > s. Or perhaps, the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way to minimize the count is to pair the largest a's with the smallest b's, so that their sum is as small as possible.\n\nWait, let's think: Suppose we have a bunch of a's and b's left.\n\nIf we pair the largest a with the smallest b, the sum could be as small as possible, possibly not exceeding s.\n\nSimilarly, pair next largest a with next smallest b, etc. This way, each a is paired with the smallest possible b to minimize the chance of the sum being >s.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for the minimal count:\n\n- Sort the remaining a's in ascending order.\n- Sort the remaining b's in ascending order.\n- Pair a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], etc., but wait, no. Because if a is sorted ascendingly, and b is sorted ascendingly, pairing a's in ascending order with b's in ascending order might lead to some a's being paired with b's that are too large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to pair a's in ascending order with b's in descending order.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nSort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order.\n\nThen, for each i, check if a[i] + b[i] > s.\n\nThe number of such i's is the minimal possible count.\n\nWait, why?\n\nBecause by pairing the smallest a's with the smallest b's, we are minimizing the chances that their sum exceeds s.\n\nWait, no. Because if a is [1,2,3], and b is [4,5,6], and s is 5.\n\nPairing 1+4=5, 2+5=7, 3+6=9.\n\nNumber of sums >s: 2.\n\nIf I pair 1+6, 2+5, 3+4: 1+6=7, 2+5=7, 3+4=7. All three are >5. So that's worse.\n\nSo in this case, pairing a in ascending with b in ascending gives a lower count.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor the remaining a's and b's, sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order, then pair them one by one, and count how many pairs have sum >s.\n\nThat will give the minimal possible number of participants with sum >s.\n\nSimilarly, for the maximal count, we need to pair a's and b's in a way that as many as possible pairs have sum >s.\n\nSo, to maximize the count, we can sort a in descending order and b in descending order, and pair them, then count how many pairs have sum >s.\n\nThis way, the largest a's are paired with the largest b's, maximizing the chance that their sum exceeds s.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nFor each possible s (a_i + b_j >=x):\n\n- Remove a_i and b_j from the a and b lists.\n- Sort the remaining a's in ascending order and the remaining b's in ascending order.\n- Compute the minimal count: for each k, if a[k] + b[k] > s, increment count.\n- Sort the remaining a's in ascending order and the remaining b's in descending order.\n- Compute the maximal count: same as before.\n\nThen, for each s, the best possible rank is 1 + minimal count, and the worst possible rank is 1 + maximal count.\n\nWait, but for the maximal count, perhaps another approach is needed. Because sometimes, even if a is small, pairing it with a large b might create a sum >s. So, perhaps sorting a in ascending and b in descending and then pairing each a with the largest possible b that hasn't been used yet, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal count is achieved by pairing a's and b's in a way that as many as possible a + b >s. So the way to maximize the count is to pair each a with the largest possible b that, when added, is as large as possible.\n\nSo, for that, perhaps the way is to sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then pair each a[i] with b[i], and count how many a[i] + b[i] >s.\n\nWait, let's test this approach with an example.\n\nExample:\n\na = [1,2,3]\nb = [4,5,6]\ns =5.\n\nFor maximal count:\n\na sorted ascending: 1,2,3\nb sorted descending:6,5,4\n\npair 1+6=7>5 → count 1\n2+5=7>5 → count 2\n3+4=7>5 → count 3.\n\nSo all 3 sums are >s.\n\nIn this case, the count is 3, which is the maximum possible.\n\nAnother example:\n\na = [3,3,3]\nb = [3,3,3]\ns=6.\n\nIf we pair 3+3=6, which is not >s. So count is 0.\n\nBut what if s=5.\n\nAll a + b =6>5. So count is 3.\n\nSo in this case, any pairing gives 3 counts.\n\nSo, the approach seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[1,3], b=[2,4], s=5.\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nOption 1: a1=1, b1=4 → sum 5. Remaining a2=3, b2=2 → sum 5. So, no sum >5. So count is 0.\n\nOption 2: a1=1, b2=2 → sum 3. a2=3, b1=4 → sum 7>5. So count is 1.\n\nSo for s=5, the minimal count is 0, and the maximal count is 1.\n\nSo, according to our approach:\n\nFor maximal count:\n\nsort a in ascending [1,3], sort b in descending [4,2].\n\nPair 1+4=5<=5? No, 5 is not >5. So count remains 0.\n\nThen, 3+2=5<=5. Count is 0. So our approach would say the maximal count is 0, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nHmm, because in reality, the maximal count can be achieved in this case as 1.\n\nSo, our approach is not correctly capturing the scenario where one pair is just equal to s, and another is above.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach needs to be adjusted.\n\nWait, in this case, when s=5, the a's are [1,3], b's are [2,4]. After pairing 1 with 4, sum is 5, and 3 with 2, sum is 5. So no sums >5.\n\nBut if we instead pair 1 with 2 (sum 3 <5), and 3 with4 (sum7>5), then the count is 1.\n\nSo, the maximal count is 1.\n\nBut according to our approach, when we sort a in ascending [1,3], and b in descending [4,2], and pair them, we get 1+4=5, which is not >5, so count is 0. Then 3+2=5, also not >5. So the count is 0.\n\nWhich is not the correct maximum.\n\nSo, the approach is flawed.\n\nWhat's the issue?\n\nI think the problem arises when some a's paired with some b's sum exactly to s. So, when s is exactly equal to a + b, it's not counted as >s.\n\nThus, to maximize the count, we need to find the maximum number of pairs a + b > s.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to pair a's and b's in a way that as many as possible a + b > s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: For the maximal count, to pair a's and b's such that as many as possible a + b > s.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Sort a in descending order.\n- Sort b in descending order.\n- For each i, pair a[i] with b[i], and count how many a[i] + b[i] > s.\n\nBut in the previous example, a sorted descending is [3,1], b sorted descending is [4,2].\n\nPair 3+4=7>5 → count 1.\n\nPair 1+2=3 <5 → count remains 1.\n\nSo, the count is 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, that works.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach gives the correct count.\n\nWait, let's test this method on the previous example.\n\na = [1,3], b = [2,4], s=5.\n\nSorted a descending: [3,1]\n\nsorted b descending: [4,2]\n\nPair 3+4=7>5 → count 1.\n\nPair 1+2=3<5 → count remains 1.\n\nThus, the maximal count is 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\na = [3,3,3], b = [3,3,3], s=6.\n\nEach a + b is 6, which is not >s.\n\nSo, the count is zero, which is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\na = [1,2,3], b = [4,5,6], s=5.\n\nsorted a descending: 3,2,1.\n\nsorted b descending:6,5,4.\n\npairs:\n\n3+6=9>5 → count 1.\n\n2+5=7>5 → count 2.\n\n1+4=5 → not >5 → count remains 2.\n\nThus, count is 2.\n\nBut wait, what's the actual maximum possible?\n\nIf we pair 1+4=5 (not >5), 2+5=7>5, 3+6=9>5 → count is 2.\n\nIs there a way to get a higher count?\n\nNo, because all other pairings would either leave the count the same or lower.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a = [1,1,1], b = [1,1,1], s=2.\n\nEach pair sums to 2, which is not >s.\n\nSo count is zero.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nSo, the conclusion is:\n\nFor a given s, to compute the minimal and maximal possible counts:\n\n- Minimal count is obtained by pairing the remaining a's (sorted ascending) with the remaining b's (sorted ascending), and counting how many a_i + b_i >s.\n\n- Maximal count is obtained by pairing the remaining a's (sorted descending) with the remaining b's (sorted descending), and counting how many a_i + b_i >s.\n\nSo, now the steps are:\n\n1. For each (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n   a. Create a new list of a's excluding a[i], and new list of b's excluding b[j].\n\n   b. For these lists, compute the minimal count and maximal count as per above.\n\n   c. Compute best_rank = 1 + minimal_count.\n\n      Compute worst_rank = 1 + maximal_count.\n\n2. Among all possible s's (all (i,j) pairs that meet a[i]+b[j]>=x), find the minimal best_rank and the maximal worst_rank.\n\nWait, no. Because for each possible s, the best and worst ranks are computed as the minimal and maximal counts respectively, but we need to find the overall best and worst possible ranks across all possible s's.\n\nWait, no. Because for each possible s (each possible (i,j)), we can compute the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, given that his sum is s. Then, the best possible overall rank is the minimal among all possible best_ranks, and the worst possible overall rank is the maximal among all possible worst_ranks.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each possible s, the best possible rank is the minimal possible count plus 1, and the worst possible is the maximal possible count plus 1.\n\nBut wait, for each s, the best_rank is the best possible for that s, and the worst_rank is the worst possible for that s.\n\nSo, for each s, the best_rank can vary, and the worst_rank can vary.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal possible best_rank across all possible s's, and the maximal possible worst_rank across all possible s's.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, the best_rank is the best possible for that s, and the worst_rank is the worst possible for that s.\n\nBut for the overall problem, the best possible rank for Vasya is the minimal possible among all possible best_ranks (since he can choose s to be any possible, and pick the arrangement that gives him the best rank).\n\nSimilarly, the worst possible rank is the maximal possible among all possible worst_ranks.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize the minimal_best as a very high number (like infinity), and the maximal_worst as 0.\n\nFor each possible (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n   Compute s = a[i] + b[j].\n\n   Create a list of a's without a[i], and b's without b[j].\n\n   For the remaining a's and b's:\n\n      Sort a in ascending, sort b in ascending.\n\n      Compute minimal_count: for each index, a[k] + b[k] >s ? count.\n\n      best_rank = 1 + minimal_count.\n\n      Update minimal_best if best_rank is smaller than current minimal_best.\n\n   Now, compute the maximal_count:\n\n      Sort a in descending, sort b in descending.\n\n      Compute how many a[k] + b[k] >s.\n\n      worst_rank = 1 + maximal_count.\n\n      Update maximal_worst if worst_rank is larger than current.\n\nAfter processing all possible (i,j), output minimal_best and maximal_worst.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, so the number of (i,j) pairs is up to 105*105 = 11,025. Which is manageable.\n\nFor each (i,j), we need to process the remaining a and b.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nRead a list.\n\nRead b list.\n\nGenerate all possible (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] >=x.\n\nFor each such (i,j):\n\n   Create a_new = a without a[i].\n\n   Create b_new = b without b[j].\n\n   Now, compute minimal count:\n\n      sort a_new in ascending order.\n\n      sort b_new in ascending order.\n\n      count = 0\n\n      for k in 0..len(a_new)-1:\n\n          if a_new[k] + b_new[k] > s:\n\n              count +=1\n\n      best_rank_candidate = 1 + count.\n\n      compare with current minimal_best, and update if necessary.\n\n   compute maximal count:\n\n      sort a_new in descending order.\n\n      sort b_new in descending order.\n\n      count =0\n\n      for k in 0..len(a_new)-1:\n\n          if a_new[k] + b_new[k] > s:\n\n              count +=1\n\n      worst_rank_candidate = 1 + count.\n\n      compare with current maximal_worst, and update if necessary.\n\nFinally, print minimal_best and maximal_worst.\n\nWait, but in the code, the a_new and b_new are created by removing a[i] and b[j], but the original lists are in the order of the input. So, when we remove a[i], we need to make sure that all other a's are included except a[i], and similarly for b.\n\nSo, in Python, to create a_new and b_new:\n\na_new = a[:i] + a[i+1:]\n\nb_new = b[:j] + b[j+1:]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo, all a are 1, all b are 1. Any (i,j) pair will have s=2>=2.\n\nSo, for each (i,j), a_new is four 1's, b_new is four 1's.\n\nCompute minimal count:\n\na_new sorted ascending: [1,1,1,1]\n\nb_new sorted ascending: [1,1,1,1]\n\nEach pair is 1+1=2, which is not >s=2.\n\nSo, count is 0.\n\nbest_rank_candidate is 1+0=1.\n\nmaximal_count:\n\na_new sorted descending: [1,1,1,1]\n\nb_new sorted descending: [1,1,1,1]\n\nEach pair is 2, not >s=2.\n\ncount is 0.\n\nworst_rank_candidate is 1+0=1.\n\nSo, for all possible (i,j), the best_rank_candidate is 1, and the worst_rank_candidate is 1.\n\nThus, the output is 1 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nIn the note, the second test case:\n\nInput:\n\n6 7\n\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n\n8 6 0 4 3 4\n\nSo, the a list is [4,3,5,6,4,4], the b list is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nWe need to find all (i,j) where a[i]+b[j] >=7.\n\nLet's see:\n\nVasya's sum can be any a[i] + b[j] >=7.\n\nBut in the note, in the best case, Vasya's sum is 12.\n\nSo, let's imagine that i=2 (a=5), j=0 (b=8). s=13.\n\nNow, a_new is [4,3,6,4,4], b_new is [6,0,4,3,4].\n\nSort a_new ascending: [3,4,4,4,6]\n\nSort b_new ascending: [0,3,4,4,6]\n\nPair each:\n\n3+0=3 <13 → no.\n\n4+3=7 <13 → no.\n\n4+4=8 <13 → no.\n\n4+4=8 <13 → no.\n\n6+6=12 <13 → no.\n\nSo, count is 0.\n\nbest_rank_candidate is 1.\n\nFor maximal count:\n\na_new sorted descending:6,4,4,4,3.\n\nb_new sorted descending:6,4,4,3,0.\n\nPair:\n\n6+6=12 <13 → no.\n\n4+4=8 <13 → no.\n\n4+4=8 <13 → no.\n\n4+3=7 <13 → no.\n\n3+0=3 <13 → no.\n\ncount is 0.\n\nThus, best_rank_candidate is 1, which is the minimal possible.\n\nNow, in the worst case scenario, Vasya's sum is 4+3=7.\n\na_new is [4,5,6,4,4], b_new is [8,0,4,4,4].\n\nWait, no, because i is 4 (a=4) and j is 4 (b=3). So a_new is [4,3,5,6,4], b_new is [8,6,0,4,4].\n\nSort a_new in ascending: [3,4,4,5,6]\n\nSort b_new in ascending: [0,4,4,6,8]\n\nPairing:\n\n3+0=3 <7 → no.\n\n4+4=8>7 → count 1.\n\n4+4=8>7 → count 2.\n\n5+6=11>7 → count3.\n\n6+8=14>7 → count4.\n\nSo, count is 4.\n\nThus, best_rank_candidate is 1+4=5.\n\nWait, no, the best_rank_candidate is the minimal count, which is 0 in this case. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, for this particular s=7, the minimal count is 0, which gives best_rank_candidate=1. But the worst_rank_candidate is 4+1=5.\n\nBut in the note, in the worst case scenario, Vasya gets fifth place.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nRead b as list of integers.\n\nGenerate all possible (i,j) pairs where a[i] + b[j] >=x.\n\nFor each pair (i,j):\n\n   a_new = a[:i] + a[i+1:]\n\n   b_new = b[:j] + b[j+1:]\n\n   s = a[i] + b[j]\n\n   # compute minimal count\n\n   a_sorted_asc = sorted(a_new)\n\n   b_sorted_asc = sorted(b_new)\n\n   count_min = 0\n\n   for k in range(len(a_sorted_asc)):\n\n       if a_sorted_asc[k] + b_sorted_asc[k] > s:\n\n           count_min +=1\n\n   best_rank = 1 + count_min\n\n   # update minimal_best if necessary\n\n   if best_rank < current_minimal_best:\n\n       current_minimal_best = best_rank\n\n   # compute maximal count\n\n   a_sorted_desc = sorted(a_new, reverse=True)\n\n   b_sorted_desc = sorted(b_new, reverse=True)\n\n   count_max = 0\n\n   for k in range(len(a_sorted_desc)):\n\n       if a_sorted_desc[k] + b_sorted_desc[k] > s:\n\n           count_max +=1\n\n   worst_rank = 1 + count_max\n\n   # update maximal_worst if necessary\n\n   if worst_rank > current_maximal_worst:\n\n       current_maximal_worst = worst_rank\n\nAfter all pairs:\n\nprint current_minimal_best, current_maximal_worst.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting the sample.\n\nNow, considering the sample:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nAll (i,j) pairs satisfy a[i] + b[j] >=2.\n\nFor each (i,j):\n\na_new is four 1's, b_new is four 1's.\n\nFor minimal count:\n\nsorted a_new is [1,1,1,1], b_new same.\n\nEach pair sums to 2, which is not >2.\n\ncount_min is 0.\n\nbest_rank is 1.\n\nFor maximal count:\n\nsorted a_new desc [1,1,1,1], same for b_new.\n\nEach pair is 2, not >2.\n\ncount_max is 0.\n\nworst_rank is 1.\n\nThus, the code will output 1 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nTest case where a = [3,1], b = [2,4], x=5.\n\nPossible (i,j) pairs:\n\ni=0, a=3; j=1, b=4: s=7 >=5.\n\ni=0, j=0: a=3, b=2 → sum 5 >=5.\n\ni=1, a=1, j=0: sum 3.\n\nNo, 1+2=3 <5.\n\ni=1, j=1: 1+4=5 >=5.\n\nSo, possible (i,j) are:\n\n(0,1), (0,0), (1,1).\n\nProcessing (0,1):\n\na_new = [1], b_new = [2].\n\nCompute minimal count:\n\na_sorted_asc [1], b_sorted_asc [2]. 1+2=3 <7 → count_min 0.\n\nbest_rank 1.\n\nmaximal count:\n\na_sorted_desc [1], b_sorted_desc [2]. 1+2=3 <7 → count_max 0.\n\nworst_rank 1.\n\nProcessing (0,0):\n\na_new = [1], b_new = [4].\n\ns=3+2=5.\n\nminimal count:\n\na_sorted_asc [1], b_sorted_asc [2]. 1+2=3 <5 → count_min 0.\n\nbest_rank 1.\n\nmaximal count:\n\na_sorted_desc [1], b_sorted_desc [2]. 1+2=3 <5 → count_max 0.\n\nworst_rank 1.\n\nProcessing (1,1):\n\na_new = [3], b_new = [2].\n\ns=1+4=5.\n\nminimal count:\n\na_sorted_asc [3], b_sorted_asc [2]. 3+2=5 not >5 → count_min 0.\n\nbest_rank 1.\n\nmaximal count:\n\na_sorted_desc [3], b_sorted_desc [2]. 3+2=5 not >5 → count_max 0.\n\nworst_rank 1.\n\nSo, the minimal_best is 1, and maximal_worst is 1.\n\nBut wait, earlier analysis showed that for s=5, the maximal count is 1.\n\nWait, no, because in this code, for (i=1,j=1):\n\na_new is [3], b_new is [2].\n\nsorted a_desc is [3], sorted b_desc is [2].\n\n3+2=5, which is not >5. So count_max is 0.\n\nThus, the code's output is 1 1.\n\nBut in reality, when s=5, the maximal count is 1.\n\nWait, why?\n\nBecause in this case, the code is considering a_new as [3], b_new as [2].\n\nWhen sorted in descending, a becomes [3], b becomes [2].\n\n3+2=5, which is not >5. So count_max is 0.\n\nBut earlier analysis showed that when pairing 3 with 2, the sum is 5, which is not >5. So count_max is zero.\n\nWait, but earlier in the test case, the maximal count was 1.\n\nAh, because in that case, the a_new and b_new were [3,1], and [2,4].\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.\n\nWait, let me re-examine.\n\nIn the test case where a is [3,1], b is [2,4], and s=5.\n\nWhich (i,j) pair is considered?\n\nIf i=1 (a=1) and j=1 (b=4), then s=5.\n\na_new is [3], b_new is [2].\n\nThus, the code computes for this s:\n\nsorted a_desc: [3], b_desc: [2].\n\nsum is 5, not >5.\n\nThus, count_max is 0.\n\nBut earlier analysis considered a different pairing where a_new is [1,3], b_new is [2,4], but that's not the case.\n\nWait, no. When (i,j) is (1,1), a_new is [3], b_new is [2], not [1,3].\n\nWait, I think I confused the test cases earlier.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle the test cases correctly.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, now, writing the code in Python.\n\nWe'll read n and x, then a and b.\n\nThen, generate all possible (i,j) pairs where a[i] + b[j] >=x.\n\nFor each pair, compute a_new and b_new.\n\nThen, compute minimal and maximal counts.\n\nUpdate the best and worst ranks accordingly.\n\nFinally, output the best and worst.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nCase where n=1:\n\nn=1, x=0.\n\na = [0], b = [0].\n\nOnly possible (i,j) is (0,0), s=0.\n\na_new is empty, b_new is empty.\n\nThus, minimal and maximal count are zero.\n\nbest_rank is 1.\n\nworst_rank is 1.\n\nOutput: 1 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[5,5], b=[5,5], x=10.\n\nPossible (i,j) pairs:\n\n(0,0): s=10.\n\na_new [5], b_new [5].\n\nMinimal count: 5+5=10 not >10 → count_min 0.\n\nBest_rank 1.\n\nMaximal count: 5+5=10 → count_max 0.\n\nWorst_rank 1.\n\nSimilarly, for all other (i,j) pairs, the same.\n\nThus, output is 1 1.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, a=[10,10,10], b=[10,10,10], x=20.\n\nAll possible (i,j) pairs give s=20.\n\na_new has two 10's, b_new has two 10's.\n\nMinimal count:\n\na_sorted_asc: [10,10], b_sorted_asc: [10",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have won in an Olympiad based on his total points. The solution involves analyzing all possible pairs of scores from two tours and determining the optimal rankings considering the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Vasya's total points from both tours must be at least `x`.\n   - The goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve.\n   - Each participant's score from the first tour and the second tour are given in arbitrary order, so we need to consider all possible valid pairings.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For each possible pair of scores `(a[i], b[j])` where their sum is at least `x`, compute the total score `s` for Vasya.\n   - For each such `s`, determine the minimal and maximal number of participants who could have a higher score than `s`.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `a[i] + b[j] >= x`.\n   - For each pair, compute the remaining scores after excluding `a[i]` and `b[j]`.\n   - Sort the remaining scores to compute the minimal and maximal counts of participants with scores higher than `s`.\n   - Track the best and worst ranks across all valid pairs.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - The approach efficiently handles up to `n = 105` participants, ensuring the solution is feasible within reasonable time limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmin_best = float('inf')\nmax_worst = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if a[i] + b[j] < x:\n            continue\n        s = a[i] + b[j]\n        a_new = a[:i] + a[i+1:]\n        b_new = b[:j] + b[j+1:]\n        \n        # Compute minimal count (best rank)\n        a_asc = sorted(a_new)\n        b_asc = sorted(b_new)\n        count_min = 0\n        for k in range(len(a_asc)):\n            if a_asc[k] + b_asc[k] > s:\n                count_min += 1\n        best_rank = 1 + count_min\n        if best_rank < min_best:\n            min_best = best_rank\n        \n        # Compute maximal count (worst rank)\n        a_desc = sorted(a_new, reverse=True)\n        b_desc = sorted(b_new, reverse=True)\n        count_max = 0\n        for k in range(len(a_desc)):\n            if a_desc[k] + b_desc[k] > s:\n                count_max += 1\n        worst_rank = 1 + count_max\n        if worst_rank > max_worst:\n            max_worst = worst_rank\n\nprint(min_best, max_worst)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of participants `n`, the minimum total score `x`, and the scores from the first and second tours.\n- **Iterating Over Pairs**: For each valid pair `(i, j)` where `a[i] + b[j] >= x`, compute the score `s` for Vasya.\n- **Sorting and Counting**: For each valid score `s`, sort the remaining scores to determine the minimal and maximal counts of participants with higher scores.\n- **Updating Ranks**: Track the best and worst ranks across all valid pairs to determine the final result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal ranks by leveraging sorting and counting techniques to handle all possible valid configurations of scores.",
