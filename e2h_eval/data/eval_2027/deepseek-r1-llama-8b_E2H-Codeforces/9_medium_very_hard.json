Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting souvenirs such that their total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is maximized. The constraints are that each souvenir has a weight wi which is either 1, 2, or 3. And n can be up to 10^5, which is 100,000, while m can be up to 3*10^5.\n\nHmm. So, for each item, we have three possible weights, and we need to pick a subset where the sum of weights is <= m, and the sum of costs is as large as possible.\n\nI remember that this kind of problem is similar to the knapsack problem, but with some specific constraints here. Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe there's a way to optimize this without using a standard DP approach, which might be too slow for n=1e5.\n\nWait, the standard 0-1 knapsack DP has a time complexity of O(nm), but with n=1e5 and m=3e5, that's 3e10 operations—way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo what's special here? All the weights are small (only 1,2,3). Maybe we can group the items by their weight and process them in a way that leverages this.\n\nLet me think: For each weight w (1,2,3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each group, we can compute the maximum cost.\n\nBut even then, considering all possibilities might be tricky because the total weight could vary widely.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum weight per item is 3, perhaps we can model the problem by considering how many items we take from each weight group, ensuring that the total weight doesn't exceed m.\n\nWait, but the items themselves can have varying weights within the same group. For example, all weight 1 items, but varying costs.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to:\n\n1. For each weight group (w=1,2,3), sort the items in that group in descending order of cost. This allows us to take the most valuable items first when considering adding to our knapsack.\n\n2. Then, for each possible combination of taking k1 items from weight 1, k2 from weight 2, k3 from weight 3, such that 1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m, find the maximum sum of costs.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the best k1, k2, k3?\n\nThis seems challenging because k1, k2, k3 can each be up to 1e5, making the number of combinations way too big to check directly.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible total weight up to m, keep track of the maximum cost achievable. We can model this with dynamic programming, but again, m is up to 3e5, which is manageable if the transitions are optimized.\n\nWait, but even 3e5 is a lot. Let's think: The standard knapsack approach would require O(nm) time, which is 3e11 operations—completely impossible.\n\nSo, we need a better way. Since the weights are small, perhaps we can represent the state not just as the current weight, but also as how much of each weight type we've used.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the problem in terms of grouping the items by weight and precomputing prefix sums for each group.\n\nFor each group (w=1,2,3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost and compute the prefix sums. So, for each group, the i-th element in the sorted list contributes c_i to the sum, and the weight is i*w.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to choosing how many items to take from each group, such that the total weight is <=m, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nBut how do we model this? It's similar to a multi-dimensional knapsack problem, but with three dimensions (k1, k2, k3), which is still too big.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weights are 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can model the maximum number of items for each weight that can be taken, and then for each possible count, compute the maximum sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to iterate over the possible counts of the heaviest items first. For example, start by taking as many weight 3 items as possible, then weight 2, etc., but that's the greedy approach and won't work because sometimes taking a lighter item with higher value can allow more items overall.\n\nSo, the problem is that the optimal selection isn't straightforward.\n\nAnother thought: Since the maximum weight per item is 3, the maximum possible number of items we can take is m (if all are weight 1). But m is up to 3e5, so any O(m) solution is acceptable, but O(m^2) is not.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the problem using a DP array where dp[j] represents the maximum cost achievable with total weight j. We can initialize dp[0] = 0, and for each item, we update the dp array.\n\nWait, but with n=1e5 and m=3e5, the standard knapsack approach is O(nm) = 3e10, which is way too slow. So that's not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a way to process the items in a way that reduces the number of operations.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the fact that each item has a weight of 1, 2, or 3. So, perhaps for each item, instead of updating the entire dp array, we can find a way to represent the impact of adding this item on the dp.\n\nWait, but the standard knapsack approach for each item is O(m), which is too slow for 1e5 items.\n\nAlternative idea: Group the items by their weight. Then, for each weight group, process all items in that group in a way that can be handled efficiently.\n\nFor example, for weight 1, each item adds 1 to the total weight and its cost. Similarly for others.\n\nWait, but even then, processing each item is O(m), which is still too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps for each weight group, we can precompute the prefix sums and then use some mathematical approach to find the optimal number of items to take from that group given the current state.\n\nWait, perhaps we can process the items in each weight group in a way that allows us to add their contribution to the dp array in batches, rather than one by one.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items: since each adds 1 to the weight, the maximum number of items we can take is up to m. But if we have a list of items sorted in descending order of cost, then for each possible number of items taken, say k, the total cost is the sum of the first k items, and the weight is k. So, for each possible k, we can see if adding k items (with total weight k) improves the dp array.\n\nBut how to integrate this into the DP.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- Sort each weight group in descending order of cost, and compute their prefix sums.\n\nThen, for each possible total weight j, we can try to take t items from the weight 1 group, u from weight 2, and v from weight 3, such that t + 2u + 3v <= j, and maximize the sum of their prefix sums.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to efficiently compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible total weight j, we can find the maximum possible sum by considering all possible numbers of items taken from each weight group, but this seems too broad.\n\nWait, another angle: Let's model the problem as a knapsack where each item is processed in a way that groups them by weight, and for each weight, process the items in a sorted manner.\n\nWe can model the DP as follows:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each weight w in {1,2,3}, process the items in that weight group in order of decreasing cost.\n\nFor each item in this group, we can decide whether to include it or not. But again, processing each item is O(m) which is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each group, instead of processing each item one by one, we can process them in a batch.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, sorted in descending order, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, for any j, the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is min(k, j), where k is the number of items in the group.\n\nSo, for each possible j, the optimal way is to take as many high-value items as possible from each group, subject to the weight limit.\n\nBut how to combine these across groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible j, we can try to take up to s1 items from weight 1, s2 from weight 2, and s3 from weight 3, such that 1*s1 + 2*s2 + 3*s3 <= j. Then, the maximum sum is the sum of the prefix sums for s1, s2, s3.\n\nBut this is computationally expensive because the number of possible (s1, s2, s3) is huge.\n\nHmm. Wait, but perhaps we can iterate through the possible numbers of weight 3 items, and for each, compute the maximum possible number of weight 2 and 1 items that can fit in the remaining weight.\n\nThis might reduce the problem to O(m/3) * O(m/2) operations, which is 3e5 * 1.5e5 = 4.5e10—still way too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the weight 3 items can be handled first, then the remaining weight is used for weight 2 and 1 items. But even then, it's unclear.\n\nWait, another idea: Since the maximum weight is 3e5, perhaps for each possible j, we can find the optimal number of weight 3 items (v) that can be taken, and then for the remaining weight (j - 3v), find the optimal number of weight 2 (u) and 1 (t) items, such that 2u + t = j' = j - 3v.\n\nBut even this approach may not be efficient enough.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each j, the optimal v is bounded. For example, the maximum possible v is j//3. So, for each j, we can loop v from 0 to min(j//3, max_v), where max_v is the total number of weight 3 items.\n\nBut again, for j up to 3e5, this is 3e5 iterations for each j, which is 9e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts: handling the weight 3 items, then the combined handling of weight 2 and 1 items.\n\nSo, for each possible number of weight 3 items (v), we can precompute the best possible sum for that v, and then for the remaining weight, compute the best sum from weight 2 and 1 items.\n\nBut even this approach requires considering all possible v for each j, which is again too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the remaining weight after choosing v, we can model the problem as a standard 0-1 knapsack with items of weight 1 and 2, and total weight j'. But how to compute that quickly.\n\nWait, for the remaining j', which is j - 3v, the maximum sum for items of weight 1 and 2 can be computed using a modified knapsack approach.\n\nBut the issue is that for each j, trying all possible v is too slow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible j, the optimal v is fixed, and we can find it by checking certain possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the weight 3 items contribute a certain amount, and the rest is handled by the other groups.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear path here.\n\nAnother angle: Since the weight is up to 3e5, perhaps the DP can be optimized by using a 1D array and processing the items in a way that allows for quick updates.\n\nWait, here's an alternative plan:\n\nWe can represent the DP as a 1D array, where dp[j] is the maximum cost for a total weight of j.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0, and all other dp[j] = -infinity or something.\n\nFor each item, regardless of its weight, we can iterate through the DP array and update it. However, since the items are processed one by one, and with n=1e5, this is O(n*m) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can process the items grouped by their weight. So, for each weight w, collect all the items with that weight, sort them in descending order of cost, and compute their prefix sums. Then, for each w, process the items in a way that allows us to compute the impact on the DP array quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, sorted in descending order, the prefix sum is s[k] = sum of first k items. The weight added is k*1. So, for any j, the maximum number of items we can take is min(k_max, j), where k_max is the number of items in the group.\n\nSo, for the DP step, for each j, the new dp[j] could be the maximum between the current dp[j] and dp[j-1] + s[t], where t is the number of items taken from this group.\n\nWait, but this approach is similar to the standard knapsack but applied to groups.\n\nWait, perhaps for each weight group, we can process the items in a way that, for each possible j, we can compute the maximum possible sum by taking up to t items from this group, considering that each item takes 1 unit of weight.\n\nSo, for weight 1, the maximum t is j.\n\nSo, the way to process this group is to, for each j, compute the maximum between the current dp[j] and dp[j - t] + s[t], for t from 1 to min(k, j).\n\nBut again, doing this for each j is O(m*k), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm. Another idea: For each weight group, compute the prefix sums, and then for each possible j, find the maximum possible t such that t <= j and t <= len(prefix_sum). Then, dp[j] can be updated by considering adding t items from this group.\n\nWait, but how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each weight group, we can process the items in a way that, for each j, the best possible t is known.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to handle this is to, for each group, process it in a way that for each j, we can determine the optimal t quickly.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the \"knuth's optimization\", but I'm not sure if it applies here.\n\nSince the items in each group are sorted in descending order, adding more items from the group will always be beneficial. So, for each j, the optimal t is as large as possible, but within the constraints of the group's size and j's weight.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, we can compute for each j the best t (number of items taken from this group) that gives the maximum cost.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's model the problem as a unbounded knapsack, but with the constraint that each item can be taken at most once. Wait, no, because each item is unique.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to note that the maximum possible weight is 3e5, and the weights are small. So, for the DP, perhaps we can process each weight group in a way that allows for O(m) operations per group.\n\nLet me outline this approach:\n\n1. Sort each weight group in descending order of cost, and compute the prefix sums.\n\n2. For each weight group w, process the items in that group, and for each possible j, update the dp[j] as follows:\n\n   For each j from w to m:\n\n      for t in 1 to min(k, j - w*t):\n\n          if dp[j - w*t] + sum(t) > dp[j]:\n\n              dp[j] = dp[j - w*t] + sum(t)\n\nBut this is still O(n*m) time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, we can compute the maximum possible contribution for each j in O(1) time, leveraging the fact that the items are sorted.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, the best t is the maximum possible t such that t <= j/w and t <= len(group). So, for each j, the maximum t is min(j//w, len(group)).\n\nThus, for each group, we can precompute the prefix sums and then for each j, the optimal t is min(len(group), j//w). Then, the contribution to dp[j] is dp[j - t*w] + sum(t). Wait, no, because maybe a smaller t could allow for more items from other groups.\n\nBut perhaps, for each group, the optimal t is the maximum possible, given j, because higher t gives higher sum due to the items being sorted.\n\nWait, maybe that's the case. Because the items are sorted in descending order, taking more items from the group will give a higher sum, provided that they fit in the weight.\n\nSo, for each group, the optimal t is the maximum possible given j.\n\nIf that's true, then for each group, when processing j, the optimal t is min(k, j//w), and we can update dp[j] accordingly.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Initialize dp[0] = 0, and the rest as -infinity.\n\n- For each group (sorted in descending order of cost), compute the prefix sums.\n\n- For each j from 1 to m:\n\n   For each group w:\n\n      t = min(k_group, j // w)\n\n      if j >= w * t and dp[j - w * t] + sum_t > dp[j]:\n\n          dp[j] = dp[j - w * t] + sum_t\n\nBut wait, this is not correct because the groups are processed multiple times and may interfere with each other.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to process each group in a way that considers all possible j, but in a way that allows for O(m) processing per group.\n\nWait, here's a more precise plan:\n\n1. Sort each weight group in descending order of cost.\n\n2. Compute the prefix sums for each group.\n\n3. For each group (w, prefix_sum), process the group by iterating through j from w to m, and for each j, take as many items as possible from this group (up to min(k, j//w)), and update dp[j].\n\nBut wait, this is similar to the standard knapsack approach, but grouped by weight. However, since each group can have up to 1e5 items, this approach is still O(m * 3) per group, which is 3e5 * 3 = 9e5 operations, which is manageable.\n\nWait, no. Each group has up to 1e5 items, and for each item, processing it is O(m) steps. That's 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nWait, but if we precompute the prefix sums, then for each group, the maximum t is min(k, j//w). So, for each j, the best t is the maximum possible given j.\n\nThus, for each group, we can compute the maximum possible t for each j, and then see if including t items from this group improves the dp[j].\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, we can perform the following:\n\nFor each j from w to m:\n\n   possible_t = min(k, j // w)\n\n   if j - w * possible_t >= 0 and dp[j - w * possible_t] + prefix_sum[possible_t] > dp[j]:\n\n       dp[j] = dp[j - w * possible_t] + prefix_sum[possible_t]\n\nBut wait, this is not quite right because perhaps taking fewer items allows for a better combination with other groups.\n\nWait, but considering that the items are sorted, taking as many as possible from the current group is optimal for that group, regardless of other groups. So, perhaps this approach is valid.\n\nWait, no. Because taking more items from the current group might prevent taking items from other groups that could give a higher overall sum. So, this approach might not yield the optimal solution.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the initial approach is not sufficient.\n\nAnother idea: The problem can be treated as a 0-1 knapsack with three types of items (weights 1,2,3), each with a value. The standard approach for 0-1 knapsack is O(nm), but n is 1e5, which is way too big.\n\nBut given that the weights are small, perhaps we can find a way to represent the DP in a way that allows for O(m) time per group.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, the items are processed in a way that allows for the DP to be updated in O(m) time.\n\nWait, for a single group of weight w, the standard knapsack processing is O(m) time, as for each j from w to m, you can choose to take the next item or not.\n\nBut for a group of size k, this would be O(k*m) time, which is 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the problem needs to be transformed.\n\nWait, what if we note that the maximum possible sum is achieved by taking some items from each group, and the order in which we process the groups doesn't matter. So, perhaps the optimal solution is to precompute the prefix sums for each group and then find the best combination of t1, t2, t3 such that t1 + 2t2 + 3t3 <= m.\n\nBut even so, finding the best t1, t2, t3 is difficult.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can fix the number of items taken from weight 3, and then for each possible v, compute the maximum possible u and t from the remaining weight.\n\nSo, for each v in 0..max_v:\n\n   rem_weight = m - 3v\n\n   Now, for rem_weight, we have to choose u (weight 2) and t (weight 1), such that 2u + t <= rem_weight.\n\n   The maximum sum is prefix_2[u] + prefix_1[t], where u is as large as possible for rem_weight - 2u, etc.\n\nBut even this approach is O(max_v * (rem_weight / 2)), which is 1e5 * 1.5e5 = 1.5e10 operations—again, way too slow.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps we need another approach.\n\nWait, considering that the weight is 3e5, perhaps we can represent the DP as a 1D array, and for each weight group, process the items in a way that allows for O(1) updates for each j.\n\nWait, let's think differently: For each possible j, we can calculate the maximum number of items that can be taken from each group.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a way to make this efficient.\n\nWait, another observation: The items of weight 3 can be processed first, as they contribute the most weight per item. So, for each possible j, the maximum number of weight 3 items is j//3. Then, for the remaining j', we can process the weight 2 and 1 items.\n\nBut again, this leads to the same problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem in three steps:\n\n1. Process all weight 3 items, and for each j, keep track of the maximum sum possible.\n\n2. Then, process the weight 2 items on top of that.\n\n3. Finally, process the weight 1 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think:\n\n- First, process all weight 3 items. For each j, we can take v items, where 3v <= j. The maximum sum is the sum of the top v items.\n\n- After processing weight 3, for each j, we have the maximum sum up to that point. Then, we process the weight 2 items, which for each j', the maximum sum is the maximum between the current sum and the sum when taking u items of weight 2, plus the sum from weight 3.\n\n- Finally, process the weight 1 items, similarly.\n\nBut again, the problem is that each step is O(m), which is manageable, but how to combine them.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is as follows:\n\nInitialize a DP array where dp[j] is the maximum sum for weight j.\n\nProcess weight 3 items:\n\n- Sort them in descending order of cost.\n\n- Compute the prefix sum s3.\n\n- For each j from 0 to m:\n\n   if j >= 3:\n\n       t = min(s3_count, j // 3)\n\n       if dp[j - 3*t] + s3[t] > dp[j]:\n\n           dp[j] = dp[j - 3*t] + s3[t]\n\nBut no, because for each j, the t can vary, and this approach may not capture all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, the optimal t is the maximum possible, as in, taking as many as possible. Because the items are sorted, taking more is better.\n\nSo, for each j, t = min(s3_count, j // 3). Then, the sum is s3[t]. So, for each j, the maximum possible sum from weight 3 items is s3[t], and then the remaining weight is j - 3t.\n\nBut then, for the remaining weight, we can process the weight 2 and 1 items.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAfter processing the weight 3 items, for each j, the maximum sum is dp[j], which includes the best possible sum for j, considering weight 3 items.\n\nThen, for each j, we can add the best possible sum from weight 2 items, considering the remaining weight (j - 3t), and so on.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to structure this.\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the fact that the weights are small:\n\nWe can model the problem using a 1D DP array, and for each item, regardless of its weight, we can update the DP array in reverse order (from m down to the item's weight).\n\nBut this is the standard 0-1 knapsack approach, which is O(nm), which is way too slow.\n\nSo, unless we can find a way to process all items of a certain weight in O(m) time, it's not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps for each weight group w, we can process all items in O(m) time.\n\nYes! Because for each weight group w, the items are sorted in descending order of cost. So, for each possible j, the optimal t is the maximum number of items that can be taken from this group, given the remaining weight.\n\nSo, for each group w, sorted in descending order:\n\nCompute the prefix sums s.\n\nFor each j from m downto w:\n\n   t = min(k, (j) // w)\n\n   if j - w * t >= 0 and dp[j - w*t] + s[t] > dp[j]:\n\n       dp[j] = dp[j - w*t] + s[t]\n\nWait, but this is O(m) per group, because for each j, we're considering adding t items from the group.\n\nBut if the group has k items, and for each j, t can be up to k, then the total operations would be O(m) per group.\n\nWait, no, because for each group, the inner loop runs m times, but t is determined for each j.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, for each group, we process the DP array in reverse order, and for each j, we take as many items as possible from this group.\n\nThis is similar to the unbounded knapsack approach, but for 0-1 knapsack.\n\nWait, but for each group, the items are processed in a way that for each j, the maximum possible t is considered, which might be optimal.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach can work. Because for each group, the items are processed in a way that, for each j, the best possible t is chosen, which can be done in O(m) time per group.\n\nYes, because the group's items are sorted in descending order, so taking as many as possible is optimal.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize dp[0] = 0, and the rest as -infinity.\n\n- For each weight group (w=1,2,3):\n\n   a. Sort the items in descending order of cost.\n\n   b. Compute the prefix sums s, where s[k] is the sum of the first k items.\n\n   c. For each j from m downto w:\n\n       t = min(len(s)-1, j // w)\n\n       if j >= w*t and dp[j - w*t] + s[t] > dp[j]:\n\n           dp[j] = dp[j - w*t] + s[t]\n\n- After processing all groups, the maximum value in dp[0..m] is the answer.\n\nWait, but this approach may not be correct because processing each group in this way could overwrite earlier, better choices from other groups.\n\nFor example, suppose processing weight 3 first, and then processing weight 2. When processing weight 2, some j's could have been improved by taking some items from weight 2, but the way we process it may not account for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the order in which the groups are processed doesn't matter, because each group is processed in a way that for each j, the best possible t is considered.\n\nWait, no, because the processing is done sequentially, and the DP is updated as each group is processed. So, the order matters.\n\nWait, for example, suppose group A is processed before group B. Processing group A first allows group B to build upon the state after group A. But if the optimal solution requires taking items from both groups, the processing order may affect the outcome.\n\nBut in reality, the order shouldn't matter because each group is processed in a way that takes the maximum possible items from that group for each j, given the current state of the DP.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process each group in any order, as long as each group's items are processed in a way that allows the maximum possible t to be considered for each j.\n\nIn that case, the approach is:\n\n- Initialize dp[0] = 0.\n\n- For each weight group w:\n\n   a. Sort the items in descending order of cost.\n\n   b. Compute the prefix sums s.\n\n   c. For j from m downto w:\n\n       max_t = min(len(s)-1, j // w)\n\n       if dp[j - w*max_t] + s[max_t] > dp[j]:\n\n           dp[j] = dp[j - w*max_t] + s[max_t]\n\nBut this may not capture all possible combinations. Because when processing group A, you might have j where taking t items from A and u items from B would give a better sum than just taking t items from A.\n\nWait, but the approach is designed to take as many as possible from each group, which should be optimal because the items are sorted. So, the order of processing the groups may not matter.\n\nWait, for example, suppose you have two groups, A and B. If you process A first, then for each j, you take as many as possible from A, then from B. If you process B first, you take as many as possible from B, then from A. Which one is better?\n\nIt depends on the specific items, but perhaps the overall maximum is captured in one of the two orders.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps processing all groups in a single pass is sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because when processing a group, the DP is being updated based on the previous state, which may have included other groups.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to process the groups in a way that, for each j, all possible t from each group are considered. But I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should test this approach on the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\nWait, the input is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.\n\nWait, the input is given as lines, each line representing a souvenir.\n\nSo, the first souvenir is '1 1' → weight 1, cost 1.\n\nSecond line: '2 2' → weight 2, cost 2.\n\nThird line: '1 3' → weight 1, cost 3.\n\nFourth line: '2 2' → weight 2, cost 2.\n\nFifth line: '4 3' → weight 4, which is beyond the allowed weight limits, but wait, no—wait, no, because in the sample input, m is 3, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the input.\n\nWait, the sample input is written as:\n\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\nWhich seems like three separate cases, each with multiple lines. Or perhaps it's a typo, and the actual input is as follows:\n\nn = 6, m = 3.\n\nEach of the six souvenirs is:\n\n1: 1 1\n\n2: 2 2\n\n3: 1 3\n\n4: 2 2\n\n5: 4 3 → but weight is 4, which exceeds m=3, so can't be taken.\n\n6: 3 10 → weight 3, cost 10.\n\nSo, the souvenirs are:\n\nItem 1: w=1, c=1\n\nItem 2: w=2, c=2\n\nItem3: w=1, c=3\n\nItem4: w=2, c=2\n\nItem5: w=4, c=3 → cannot be taken.\n\nItem6: w=3, c=10.\n\nSo, the groups are:\n\nw=1: items 1,3 → sorted by cost: 3,1 → prefix sum [0,3,4]\n\nw=2: items 2,4 → sorted by cost: 2,2 → prefix sum [0,2,4]\n\nw=3: item6 → cost 10, prefix sum [0,10]\n\nProcessing each group in turn.\n\nLet's process w=1 first.\n\nFor each j from 3 down to 1:\n\nj=3: t = min(2,3//1)=2. So, 2 items, sum 4. Check j -1*2=1. dp[1] is initially 0 (since we haven't processed anything else yet). So, dp[3] becomes max(0, 0+4) =4.\n\nj=2: t=2, j -2=0 → dp[0]=0 +4=4>dp[2], so set to4.\n\nj=1: t=1, j-1=0 → 0+3=3>0, set dp[1]=3.\n\nNow, process w=2:\n\nprefix sum [0,2,4].\n\nFor j from 3 downto 2:\n\nj=3: t = min(2,3//2)=1. sum is 2. j-2=1. dp[1]=3. 3+2=5> current dp[3]=4 → set to5.\n\nj=2: t=1 → sum 2. j-2=0 → 0+2=2> current dp[2]=4? No, 2<4. So no change.\n\nNow, process w=3:\n\nprefix sum [0,10].\n\nj from 3 downto3:\n\nj=3: t=1. sum10. j-3=0 → dp[0]=0 +10=10>5 → set to10.\n\nSo, the final dp is:\n\ndp[0]=0, dp[1]=3, dp[2]=4, dp[3]=10.\n\nSo, the maximum is 10, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, this approach works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when m=0, the output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: when all items are weight 3, and m is 3.\n\nWait, but let's think about another scenario.\n\nSuppose we have items:\n\nw=1: cost 5,4,3,2,1.\n\nw=2: cost 6,5,4,3,2.\n\nw=3: cost 7,6,5.\n\nm=5.\n\nWhat is the optimal selection?\n\nWe need to choose items such that their total weight is <=5.\n\nPossible options:\n\nTake w=3 items: 7,6,5 → total weight 3+3+3=9>5 → no.\n\nSo, take one w=3 item: 7.\n\nThen, rem_weight=2.\n\nTake w=2 items: 6.\n\nTotal cost 13.\n\nAlternatively, take 5 (w=1) → 5, and 6 (w=2) → 2+1=3. Total cost 11.\n\nOr, take 6 (w=2) and 5 (w=1): cost 6+5=11.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal is 7 (w=3) +6 (w=2) = 7+6=13.\n\nBut according to the approach:\n\nProcess w=3 first.\n\nFor j=5:\n\nt can be 1 (since 3*1=3<=5). So, sum is7.\n\nThen, rem_weight is 2.\n\nProcessing w=2:\n\nfor j=2: t=1, sum 6. dp[2] =6.\n\nThen, j=5: after processing w=2, for j=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit. Each souvenir has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3, and the goal is to find the optimal subset of these souvenirs.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem is a variation of the knapsack problem where each item can be taken at most once. Given the constraints, a direct application of the standard knapsack algorithm would be too slow. Instead, we leverage the fact that the weights are small (1, 2, or 3) and use a dynamic programming approach optimized for this specific case.\n\n1. **Sort and Prefix Sums**: For each weight group (1, 2, and 3), sort the items in descending order of their cost and compute prefix sums. This allows us to efficiently consider taking the most valuable items first.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP array where `dp[j]` represents the maximum cost achievable with a total weight `j`. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 and all other entries to negative infinity.\n\n3. **Process Each Weight Group**: For each weight group, update the DP array by considering the maximum number of items that can be taken from that group without exceeding the weight limit. This is done in reverse order to avoid overwriting values that are yet to be processed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n\n    groups = {1: [], 2: [], 3: []}\n    for _ in range(n):\n        w = int(input[idx])\n        c = int(input[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        groups[w].append(c)\n\n    # Initialize DP\n    dp = [-float('inf')] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    # Process each group\n    for w in [1, 2, 3]:\n        # Sort in descending order and compute prefix sums\n        lst = sorted(groups[w], reverse=True)\n        prefix = [0]\n        s = 0\n        for c in lst:\n            s += c\n            prefix.append(s)\n        k = len(prefix) - 1  # number of items in this group\n\n        # Update DP for this group\n        for j in range(m, w - 1, -1):\n            if j >= w:\n                t = min(k, j // w)\n                if dp[j - w * t] + prefix[t] > dp[j]:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j - w * t] + prefix[t]\n\n    # Find the maximum value in dp\n    max_cost = max(dp[:m+1])\n    print(max_cost if max_cost != -float('inf') else 0)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Each weight group is sorted by cost in descending order. This allows us to efficiently compute the maximum cost for each possible number of items taken from that group using prefix sums.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The DP array `dp` is initialized to store the maximum cost for each possible total weight from 0 to `m`. We start with `dp[0]` set to 0 (no weight, no cost) and all other entries initially set to negative infinity.\n\n3. **Processing Each Group**: For each weight group (1, 2, 3), we update the DP array in reverse order. For each possible weight `j`, we determine the maximum number of items that can be taken from the current group without exceeding the weight limit. This is done by checking the prefix sum of the sorted items and updating the DP value accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible cost while respecting the weight constraints, leveraging the sorted order of items to maximize value.",
