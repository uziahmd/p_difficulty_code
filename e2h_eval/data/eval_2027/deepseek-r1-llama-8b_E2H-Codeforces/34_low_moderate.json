And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So doing something O(n^2) would probably be too slow.\n\nWait, let's think about what a week is. A week is any k consecutive days in the list of n days. For example, if n=3 and k=2, there are two weeks: days 1-2 and 2-3.\n\nSo the total number of weeks is (n - k + 1). For each week, we sum the sleep hours and then divide by the number of weeks.\n\nBut calculating each week's sum individually and adding them all would take O(n*k) time, which for 2e5 is 4e10 operations—way too slow. That won't work.\n\nI need a more efficient way. Oh right, prefix sums! That's the way to go. Because prefix sums allow us to compute subarrays quickly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array. The prefix sum at index i is the sum of the first i elements. So sum from a1 to ai.\n\n2. Then, for each possible window of size k, the sum is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i]. So for each starting index i from 0 to (n-k), we can compute the sum in O(1) time.\n\n3. Sum all these k-length windows and then divide by the number of windows.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is to compute the prefix sum, then iterate through each possible window, calculate the sum for each, add to a total, and then compute the average.\n\nNow, how do I handle the prefix sum? Let's say the input is 0-based or 1-based? Well, in Python, it's easier to make it 0-based.\n\nWait, the array a has elements a_1 to a_n. So in code, it's better to read it as a list starting from index 0, but the first element is a_1. Or maybe not—maybe just adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the prefix sum. Let's create an array s where s[0] = 0, s[1] = a1, s[2] = a1+a2, etc. Then for a window starting at index i (0-based in the original array) and ending at i + k - 1, the sum is s[i + k] - s[i].\n\nWait, no. Because if the array is 0-based, then the first window is a[0..k-1], which is sum s[k] - s[0]. The next window is a[1..k], sum s[k+1] - s[1], etc.\n\nSo the number of windows is (n - k + 1), which aligns with the number of weeks.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n- Read n and k.\n- Read the array a as a list of integers.\n- Compute the prefix sum array s, where s[0] = 0, s[i] = s[i-1] + a[i-1].\n- Then, for each i from 0 to (n - k):\n   - current window starts at i, ends at i + k -1.\n   - sum is s[i + k] - s[i]\n   - add to total_sum\n- Finally, average = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n- Output with enough decimal precision.\n\nWait, let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nPrefix sum s is [0, 3,7,14]\n\nThen, the windows are:\ni=0: sum is s[2] - s[0] =7-0=7\ni=1: sum is s[3] - s[1] =14-3=11\nTotal sum is 18, average 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\nInput is '1 1\\n10' → n=1, k=1. So one week, sum is 10, average is 10.\n\nThird sample:\nn=8, k=2\na = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nWait, wait, the third sample's input is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'. So n=8, k=2.\n\nCompute the prefix sum:\n\ns[",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks of k consecutive days from a given list of sleep times for n days. The solution must be efficient to handle large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum array helps in efficiently determining the sum of any k consecutive days in O(1) time.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use the prefix sum array to slide a window of size k across the input array, calculating the sum for each window and accumulating these sums.\n3. **Average Calculation**: After computing the total sum of all valid windows, divide by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required sums without resorting to nested loops, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n\n    # Compute prefix sum\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\n    total = 0.0\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(num_weeks):\n        end = i + k\n        current_sum = prefix[end] - prefix[i]\n        total += current_sum\n\n    average = total / num_weeks\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the potentially large size.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is built such that each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n3. **Summing Windows**: Using a sliding window approach, we iterate through each possible starting point of a window of size `k`. For each window, we use the prefix sum array to quickly compute its sum and accumulate this into the total sum.\n4. **Computing the Average**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to obtain the average sleep time per week.\n\nThis method ensures that the solution is both efficient and easy to understand, handling all edge cases and constraints effectively.",
