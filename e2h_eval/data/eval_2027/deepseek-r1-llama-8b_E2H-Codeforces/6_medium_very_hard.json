Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x and they don't overlap. Also, the total cost should be as minimal as possible. If it's impossible, we return -1.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j (i != j) where their durations sum to x. Also, they must not intersect. So either voucher i ends before voucher j starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe goal is to find the pair with the minimal total cost. If no such pair exists, output -1.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nI think the first thing is to process each voucher and calculate its duration. Then, for each possible pair of vouchers, check if their durations add up to x, and if they are non-overlapping. But wait, n can be up to 2e5, so a brute force O(n^2) approach isn't feasible. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to do this.\n\nLet me think: For each voucher, say with duration d, I need to find another voucher with duration x - d. Then, among all such pairs, find the one with the minimal cost, ensuring that they don't overlap.\n\nBut even that might be tricky because for each voucher, I have to find all vouchers of duration x - d and check if they are compatible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can pre-process the vouchers by their duration. So I'll create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of all vouchers with that duration along with their cost and other details.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Then, for each voucher, I can look up the required complement duration and check compatible vouchers.\n\nBut even then, for each voucher, checking all possible compatible vouchers could be time-consuming if not optimized.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary mapping duration to a list of (li, ri, costi).\n\n2. For each voucher in the list, get its duration d. Then, look for vouchers with duration x - d. \n\n3. For each such voucher j in the x-d group, check if vouchers i and j are non-overlapping.\n\n4. Among all valid pairs, keep track of the minimum total cost.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if two vouchers are non-overlapping? Because for each pair, comparing their intervals can take O(1) time, but if the number of pairs is high, it's still O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but the number of vouchers per duration could vary. Maybe we can sort them in a way that allows us to quickly find compatible vouchers.\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher, when looking for another voucher of duration x-d, we can process those vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly find ones that don't overlap.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's think about the two cases where vouchers don't overlap:\n\nCase 1: voucher i ends before voucher j starts. So, ri_i < li_j.\n\nCase 2: voucher j ends before voucher i starts. So, ri_j < li_i.\n\nSo, for a given voucher i, when looking for vouchers j of duration x - d_i, we can categorize them based on whether they end before i starts or after i ends.\n\nBut how to efficiently find such vouchers?\n\nAnother idea: For each duration, we can sort the vouchers in two different ways. One sorted by their end times, and another sorted by their start times.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, for each duration, we can split the vouchers into two groups: those that end early (so their end is small) and those that start late (start is large). Then, when looking for a voucher j that doesn't overlap with i, we can query the appropriate group.\n\nWait, perhaps for each duration, we can maintain two lists:\n\n- A list sorted by end time, so for a given voucher i, any voucher j in this list that ends before i's start can be considered.\n\n- Another list sorted by start time, so any voucher j that starts after i's end can be considered.\n\nBut how to structure this.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration, we can have a list sorted by end time. Then, for a voucher i, to find all j's in the x-d duration group whose end is <= li_i - 1. Similarly, for j's whose start >= ri_i + 1.\n\nWait, yes. So for each voucher i, when looking for j's of duration x - d_i, we can:\n\n1. Find all j's in the x-d group where j ends before i starts: j's ri < i's li.\n\n2. Find all j's in the x-d group where j starts after i ends: j's li > i's ri.\n\nSo, for each x - d_i, we can have two separate lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time.\n\n- Sorted by start time.\n\nThen, for case 1: perform a binary search in the end-sorted list to find all j's with ri <= li_i -1.\n\nFor case 2: perform a binary search in the start-sorted list to find j's with li >= ri_i + 1.\n\nThis way, for each i, we can quickly find all possible j's that don't overlap with it, without having to check every j.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Preprocess: group vouchers by their duration. For each group, sort the vouchers by end time and also by start time.\n\n- For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute the required duration d_j = x - d_i.\n\n   b. If d_j is not in the duration groups, skip.\n\n   c. Else, for the group d_j:\n\n      i. In the end-sorted list, find all j's where ri_j <= li_i -1. For each such j, check if i and j are compatible (non-overlapping). Keep track of the minimal cost.\n\n      ii. In the start-sorted list, find all j's where li_j >= ri_i +1. For each such j, same as above.\n\nBut wait, the end-sorted list is sorted by ri_j. So for a given li_i, any j with ri_j < li_i can be found via binary search.\n\nSimilarly, the start-sorted list is sorted by li_j. So for a given ri_i, any j with li_j > ri_i can be found.\n\nBut in each case, the minimal cost can be tracked.\n\nNow, the question is, how to represent these sorted lists for each duration.\n\nFor each duration, we can store two versions of the list:\n\n- One sorted by end time (ri), so for case 1.\n\n- Another sorted by start time (li), for case 2.\n\nEach list will contain tuples of (ri, cost), and (li, cost), respectively.\n\nWait, but when you sort by end time, you can just have the list ordered by ri. Similarly for start time.\n\nSo, for each duration, during preprocessing:\n\n- Create a list sorted by ri.\n\n- Create another list sorted by li.\n\nThese can be done once for each duration.\n\nThen, for each voucher i, we compute d_j = x - d_i. Check if d_j exists.\n\nIf it does, for that duration, access the two sorted lists.\n\nFor the end-sorted list, find all j's where ri_j <= li_i -1. Since the list is sorted, we can find the largest index where ri_j <= (li_i -1), and then consider all j's up to that index.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the list is sorted in increasing order of ri_j. So, for a given value, say target = li_i -1, we can use binary search to find the rightmost position where ri_j <= target. All elements before that position (inclusive) satisfy ri_j <= target.\n\nFor each such j in that sublist, we can record the cost and see if it's a candidate for the minimal total cost.\n\nBut wait, how do we iterate through all j's in that sublist efficiently? Because in the worst case, for each i, we have to loop through a lot of j's.\n\nBut perhaps, for each j in the sublist, since the list is sorted, we can find the earliest possible j that allows for a minimal cost.\n\nWait, but the minimal total cost is what we're looking for. So perhaps, for each j in the sublist, we can keep track of the minimal cost.\n\nWait, but it's possible that multiple j's in the sublist could form a valid pair with i. We need to select the j with the smallest cost.\n\nWait, but since we're looking for the minimal sum, perhaps for each i, among all valid j's, the minimal cost is the minimal between the current minimal and the j's cost.\n\nBut to find this efficiently, perhaps for each duration d_j, we can precompute the minimal cost for all possible ranges.\n\nWait, that's a thought. For example, for the end-sorted list of d_j, for each position in the list, we can precompute the minimal cost up to that point. Similarly, for the start-sorted list, precompute the minimal cost from a certain point onward.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search, once we find the range of j's that are compatible with i, we can scan through them in a way that finds the minimal cost quickly.\n\nBut that might not be efficient enough.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can precompute for each duration d_j's end-sorted list, a prefix minimum. That is, for each position k in the end-sorted list, we store the minimal cost among the first k+1 elements (0-based). Similarly, for the start-sorted list, we can store a suffix minimum.\n\nThat way, when we find the range of j's in the end-sorted list where ri_j <= li_i -1, we can quickly find the minimal cost in that subset.\n\nYes! That sounds promising.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nFor each duration d in the duration map:\n\n   a. Sort the vouchers in the d group by ri in ascending order, and create a list of (ri, cost). Also, compute a prefix_min array where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost among the first k+1 elements (from 0 to k). So, for any j's in the end-sorted list up to position k, the minimal cost is prefix_min[k].\n\n   b. Similarly, sort the vouchers in the d group by li in ascending order, creating a list of (li, cost). Compute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost among elements from k to the end. So, for any j's in the start-sorted list starting at position k, the minimal cost is suffix_min[k].\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute d_i = ri_i - li_i + 1.\n\n   b. d_j = x - d_i.\n\n   c. If d_j is not present in the duration map, continue.\n\n   d. Get the end-sorted list and prefix_min for d_j.\n\n      i. Find the largest index k where ri_j <= li_i - 1.\n\n      ii. If such an index exists, the minimal cost for this part is prefix_min[k], provided that k >=0.\n\n   e. Get the start-sorted list and suffix_min for d_j.\n\n      i. Find the smallest index m where li_j >= ri_i + 1.\n\n      ii. If such an index exists, the minimal cost for this part is suffix_min[m], provided that m < len(list).\n\n   f. Now, for each part (case 1 and case 2), compute the minimal possible cost, and add it to i's cost. Keep track of the overall minimal total cost.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the minimal cost for the compatible j's in both cases?\n\nFor case 1: Any j in the end-sorted list up to index k can be paired with i. The minimal cost is the minimal cost among those j's. So, in the prefix_min array, the minimal cost is prefix_min[k]. So, the total cost for this case is i's cost + min_cost_case1.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: Any j in the start-sorted list from index m onwards can be paired. The minimal cost is suffix_min[m]. So, the total cost is i's cost + min_cost_case2.\n\nWe can compare both cases and update the global minimal cost accordingly.\n\nBut wait, for case 1, the j's must end before i starts. So, their end is <= li_i -1. So, the binary search in the end-sorted list returns the maximum index where ri_j <= li_i -1.\n\nIf such j's exist, the minimal cost is prefix_min[k], and adding to i's cost gives a candidate for the solution.\n\nSame for case 2: j's must start after i ends, so li_j >= ri_i +1. So, in the start-sorted list, we find the first index m where li_j >= target. All elements from m onwards are candidates. The minimal cost is the suffix_min[m], and adding to i's cost is another candidate.\n\nSo, the steps for each i are:\n\n- Compute d_i, then d_j = x - d_i.\n\n- If d_j not in the map, skip.\n\n- Else, get the end-sorted list and prefix_min.\n\n   - Binary search for li_i -1 in the end-sorted ri's.\n\n   - If found, the index is k. The minimal cost is prefix_min[k].\n\n- Similarly, get the start-sorted list and suffix_min.\n\n   - Binary search for ri_i +1 in the start-sorted li's.\n\n   - If found, the index is m. The minimal cost is suffix_min[m].\n\n- Now, for each case, compute the sum (i's cost + min_cost_case) and update the global minimal.\n\nIf any of the cases yields a valid j, add it to the possible solutions.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures needed.\n\nWe'll need for each duration d:\n\n   - end_sorted: list of tuples (ri, cost), sorted by ri.\n\n   - end_prefix_min: list where end_prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost in end_sorted[0..k].\n\n   - start_sorted: list of tuples (li, cost), sorted by li.\n\n   - start_suffix_min: list where start_suffix_min[m] is the minimal cost in start_sorted[m..end].\n\nSo, for each voucher, when processing, we can quickly find the required min costs.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut before that, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n1. x is less than the minimal possible duration sum. For example, each voucher has a duration of 1, and x is 2. But if no two vouchers exist, then output is -1.\n\n2. Vouchers may have the same duration but overlapping.\n\n3. The minimal cost may come from multiple pairs; we have to choose the smallest sum.\n\n4. No vouchers have a complementary duration.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read n lines, each with li, ri, costi.\n\nCompute each voucher's duration: d = ri - li +1.\n\nStore all vouchers in a list.\n\nThen, group them by duration in a dictionary, say duration_map. Each key is d, and the value is a list of (li, ri, costi).\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_map:\n\n   a. Sort the list by ri to create end_sorted.\n\n   b. Compute end_prefix_min: iterate through end_sorted, keeping track of the minimal cost up to each index.\n\n   c. Sort the list by li to create start_sorted.\n\n   d. Compute start_suffix_min: iterate from the end, keeping track of the minimal cost from each index onwards.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i in all_vouchers:\n\n   a. Compute d_i = ri_i - li_i + 1.\n\n   b. d_j = x - d_i.\n\n   c. If d_j not in duration_map: continue.\n\n   d. Else, process the two cases.\n\nProcessing Case 1 (j ends before i starts):\n\n   i. From the end_sorted list of d_j, find the maximum index k where ri_j <= li_i -1.\n\n   How to do this? Use binary search on the ri values of end_sorted.\n\n   For example, in Python, bisect module can help. We can extract the ri values as a separate list and perform bisect_right.\n\n   So, for the end_sorted list, create a list of ri_values = [voucher[0] for voucher in end_sorted]. Then, target = li_i -1. The index is bisect.bisect_right(ri_values, target) -1.\n\n   Wait, no. Wait, bisect.bisect_right returns the insertion point. So, all elements before the insertion point are <= target.\n\n   So, the maximum index k where ri_j <= target is bisect.bisect_right(ri_values, target) -1.\n\n   So, if k >=0, then the minimal cost is end_prefix_min[k].\n\n   ii. If k >=0, then the total cost is i's cost + end_prefix_min[k]. Update the global_min if this is smaller.\n\nProcessing Case 2 (j starts after i ends):\n\n   i. From the start_sorted list of d_j, find the minimal index m where li_j >= ri_i +1.\n\n   Again, using bisect.bisect_left on li_values.\n\n   For example, li_values = [voucher[0] for voucher in start_sorted]. Target = ri_i +1.\n\n   The insertion point is the first index where li >= target. So, all elements from m onwards are valid.\n\n   So, if m < len(li_values), then the minimal cost is start_suffix_min[m].\n\n   ii. If m < len(li_values), then the total cost is i's cost + start_suffix_min[m]. Update the global_min if needed.\n\nNow, the initial global_min can be set to a very high value, like infinity.\n\nAfter processing all vouchers, if global_min is still infinity, output -1. Else, output global_min.\n\nNow, some implementation details:\n\n- For each voucher, when computing d_i, it's possible that d_i is larger than x, making d_j negative. So, in that case, skip.\n\nSo, during the loop for each voucher i:\n\n   if d_i > x: continue, since d_j would be negative.\n\nAlso, for the case where d_j is zero, but since each voucher has duration >=1 (since li <= ri implies ri - li +1 >=1), so d_j can't be zero unless x is less than 1, but x is >=2 according to the input constraints (n and x are >=2, perhaps? Wait, the input says 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. So x is at least 2.)\n\nWait, x can be 1? No, because the problem statement says 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. So x is at least 2.\n\nSo, for each i, d_i is at least 1, so d_j = x -d_i could be as low as 1 (if x=2 and d_i=1), but no, x can be 2 and d_i=1, d_j=1. Or x can be larger.\n\nSo, for each i, compute d_i, d_j =x -d_i. If d_j is not in the map, continue.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3 days.\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2 days.\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2 days.\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2 days.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the first line in the input is '4 5', then four vouchers.\n\nLooking back, the input is:\n\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4']\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input was:\n\nn=4, x=5.\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3.\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 5, which comes from choosing the first and third vouchers.\n\nWait, the first voucher is 1-3, duration 3. Third voucher is 5-6, duration 2. Sum is 5, which matches x=5.\n\nThey don't overlap.\n\nCost is 4+1=5.\n\nSo, in the code, for i being the first voucher (d_i=3), d_j=2. Looking for vouchers of duration 2.\n\nIn the end-sorted list of duration 2, the vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, ri=2, cost=5.\n\nvoucher 3: li=5, ri=6, cost=1.\n\nvoucher4: li=1, ri=2, cost=4.\n\nWait, no, the vouchers of duration 2 are the second, third, fourth. Wait, let's re-calculate:\n\nVoucher 1: 1-3, duration 3.\n\nVoucher 2: 1-2, duration 2.\n\nVoucher3:5-6, duration 2.\n\nVoucher4:1-2, duration 2.\n\nSo, for the duration 2 group:\n\nend_sorted is sorted by ri:\n\nvoucher2: ri=2, cost=5.\n\nvoucher4: ri=2, cost=4.\n\nvoucher3: ri=6, cost=1.\n\nWait, no, wait, in end_sorted, it's sorted by ri. So, voucher2 and voucher4 have ri=2, so they come before voucher3.\n\nSo, end_sorted is [ (2,5), (2,4), (6,1) ].\n\nThe prefix_min would be:\n\nindex 0: 5.\n\nindex 1: min(5,4)=4.\n\nindex 2: min(4,1)=1.\n\nSo, for voucher1 (li=1, ri=3, cost=4), when looking for d_j=2.\n\nCase1: j ends before i starts.\n\ni's li is 1, so j's ri must be <=0. No j satisfies this.\n\nCase2: j starts after i ends. i's ri is 3. So j's li must be >=4.\n\nLooking at the start_sorted list of duration 2.\n\nstart_sorted is sorted by li.\n\nVoucher3: li=5.\n\nVoucher2: li=1.\n\nVoucher4: li=1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the start_sorted list of duration 2, we sort by li:\n\nvoucher2 has li=1, voucher4 has li=1, voucher3 has li=5.\n\nSo, the start_sorted list is [ (1,5), (1,4), (5,1) ].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the vouchers in duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher2: li=1, cost=5.\n\nvoucher4: li=1, cost=4.\n\nvoucher3: li=5, cost=1.\n\nSo, when sorted by li, it's [(1,5), (1,4), (5,1)].\n\nThe suffix_min would be computed from the end:\n\nindex 2: 1.\n\nindex 1: min(4,1) =1.\n\nindex 0: min(5,1) =1.\n\nSo, for i's ri is 3, target is 4.\n\nIn the start_sorted list, the li's are [1,1,5]. We need j's with li >=4.\n\nSo, find the first index where li >=4. That's index 2.\n\nSo, m=2. The suffix_min[2] is 1.\n\nSo, the total cost is 4 (i's cost) +1 =5.\n\nWhich is the sample's answer.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample.\n\nn=3, x=2.\n\nEach voucher has duration 3.\n\nSo, d_i=3, d_j= -1, which is invalid. So no pairs possible. Output is -1.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns -1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=5.\n\nVoucher1: duration 2, voucher2: duration 3. Sum is 5.\n\nIf they don't overlap, then the cost is sum of their costs.\n\nIf they do, then no.\n\nSo, the code would process each voucher.\n\nFor voucher1, d_j=3. Look for vouchers of duration 3.\n\nAssuming there is only voucher2, which is duration 3.\n\nCheck if they don't overlap.\n\nSo, in code, it's handled.\n\nNow, thinking about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, for each duration, I can precompute the end_sorted list and prefix_min, and start_sorted and suffix_min.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nWe can create a dictionary, say duration_map, where each key is d, and the value is a tuple of (end_sorted, end_prefix_min, start_sorted, start_suffix_min).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nduration_map = {}\n\nfor each voucher in vouchers:\n\n    d = ri - li +1\n\n    if d not in duration_map:\n\n        duration_map[d] = []\n\n    duration_map[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each d in duration_map:\n\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n\n    end_list = sorted( duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n\n    end_ri = [x[1] for x in end_list]\n\n    end_prefix = []\n\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n\n    for i in range(len(end_list)):\n\n        min_cost = min( min_cost, end_list[i][2] )\n\n        end_prefix.append( min_cost )\n\n    # process start_sorted and suffix_min\n\n    start_list = sorted( duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\n    start_li = [x[0] for x in start_list]\n\n    start_suffix = [float('inf')]*len(start_list)\n\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n\n    for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n\n        min_cost = min( min_cost, start_list[i][2] )\n\n        start_suffix[i] = min_cost\n\n    # store in duration_map\n\n    duration_map[d] = ( end_list, end_prefix, start_list, start_suffix )\n\nWait, but in Python, tuples are immutable, so perhaps better to store as a dictionary of dictionaries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps store each group as a dictionary entry with keys 'end', 'prefix_min', 'start', 'suffix_min'.\n\nBut for now, perhaps the code can manage.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i:\n\nli, ri, costi = voucher_i\n\nd_i = ri - li +1\n\nd_j = x - d_i\n\nif d_j not in duration_map:\n\n    continue\n\nelse:\n\n    end_list, end_prefix, start_list, start_suffix = duration_map[d_j]\n\n    # case1: j ends before i starts.\n\n    # j's ri <= li_i -1.\n\n    target = li_i -1\n\n    # find in end_ri the last ri <= target.\n\n    # using bisect.\n\n    import bisect\n\n    k = bisect.bisect_right(end_ri, target) -1\n\n    if k >=0:\n\n        min_cost_case1 = end_prefix[k]\n\n        total_cost = costi + min_cost_case1\n\n        if total_cost < global_min:\n\n            global_min = total_cost\n\n    # case2: j starts after i ends.\n\n    target = ri_i +1\n\n    # find in start_li the first li >= target.\n\n    m = bisect.bisect_left(start_li, target)\n\n    if m < len(start_li):\n\n        min_cost_case2 = start_suffix[m]\n\n        total_cost = costi + min_cost_case2\n\n        if total_cost < global_min:\n\n            global_min = total_cost\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where multiple j's are present in case1, but their cost varies. The prefix_min ensures that we pick the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly for case2.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nEach voucher is stored as (li, ri, costi).\n\nIn the code, for each voucher, we'll process it once.\n\nThe preprocessing step for the duration_map is O(n log n) per duration, which is acceptable for n=2e5.\n\nBecause each voucher is processed once, and for each duration, the sorting is O(m log m), where m is the number of vouchers in that duration. The sum over all durations is O(n log n).\n\nThen, for each voucher, we perform two binary searches, which are O(log m) operations. So the total time is O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should work within the time constraints.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\n- Handling the case where x is zero. But according to the input constraints, x is at least 2.\n\n- Handling the case where a voucher's duration is larger than x. For example, x=5, d_i=6, d_j=-1, which is invalid.\n\nSo, in the code, for each i, after computing d_j, we check if d_j is in duration_map. Otherwise, skip.\n\nWhat about when d_j is zero? Well, since each voucher has duration at least 1, d_j cannot be zero since x is at least 2.\n\nThus, the code handles it.\n\nAnother corner case: when two vouchers have the same duration, and their combined duration is x.\n\nAnother case: when x is equal to twice the maximum voucher duration.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 5\n\nVoucher1: 1 3 4 → d=3.\n\nVoucher2: 1 2 5 → d=2.\n\nVoucher3:5 6 1 →d=2.\n\nVoucher4:1 2 4→d=2.\n\nSo, the duration_map has d=3: [ (1,3,4) ]\n\nand d=2: [ (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4) ]\n\nFor d=3:\n\nend_list is [ (3,4) ].\n\nend_prefix: [4]\n\nstart_list: [ (1,4) ]\n\nstart_suffix: [4]\n\nProcessing each voucher:\n\nVoucher1: d_i=3, d_j=2.\n\nCheck in duration_map for d=2.\n\nend_list is [ (2,5), (2,4), (6,1) ].\n\ntarget = li_i -1 = 0.\n\nbisect_right on [2,2,6], target 0: returns 0, k=-1. So no case1.\n\ncase2: target=3+1=4.\n\nstart_list is [ (1,5), (1,4), (5,1) ].\n\nstart_li is [1,1,5].\n\nbisect_left for target 4 is 2.\n\nm=2, which is less than 3.\n\nstart_suffix[2] is 1.\n\ntotal cost 4+1=5.\n\nSo, global_min becomes 5.\n\nVoucher2: d_i=2, d_j=3.\n\nBut duration_map has d=3: [ (1,3,4) ].\n\ncase1: j ends before i starts. i's li is 1. So j's ri <=0. No.\n\ncase2: j starts after i's ri=2+1=3.\n\nIn d=3's start_list: [ (1,4) ]. target 3.\n\nbisect_left returns 1, since 1<3.\n\nm=1 is beyond the list length (0-based index, list length 1). So no.\n\nSo, no contribution.\n\nVoucher3: d_i=2, d_j=3.\n\nSame as above.\n\ncase1: j ends before i starts.\n\ni's li=5, target=4.\n\nIn d=3's end_list: [3]. 3<=4.\n\nk=0. end_prefix[0]=4.\n\ntotal cost 1+4=5. Compare to global_min, which is 5, same.\n\ncase2: j starts after i's ri=6+1=7.\n\nd=3's start_list: [1]. 1<7, so no.\n\nSo, contributes 5.\n\nBut global_min is already 5, so no change.\n\nVoucher4: d_i=2, d_j=3.\n\nSame as above.\n\ncase1: i's li=1, target=0.\n\nNo j's.\n\ncase2: i's ri=2+1=3.\n\nIn d=3's start_list: [1]. 1<3. No.\n\nSo, no contribution.\n\nThus, the minimal cost is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, x=5.\n\nVoucher1: 1-1, cost 10 → duration 1.\n\nVoucher2: 2-2, cost 20 → duration 1.\n\nSo, x=5, which is 1+4, but in this case, each voucher has duration 1. So d_j=4 for each.\n\nBut no vouchers have duration 4.\n\nThus, output is -1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, x=4.\n\nVouchers:\n\nA: 1-3 (d=3), cost 5.\n\nB: 2-4 (d=3), cost 6.\n\nC:5-6 (d=2), cost 10.\n\nSo, d_j for A is 1, which may not exist.\n\nd_j for B is 1, same.\n\nd_j for C is 2.\n\nLooking for d_j=2.\n\nVoucher C is duration 2.\n\nCheck if any other vouchers have duration 2.\n\nSuppose not. So no solution.\n\nBut if there is another voucher D: 7-8, d=2.\n\nThen, for voucher C, d_j=2.\n\nSo, for voucher C, d_j=4-2=2.\n\nLooking for j's of duration 2.\n\nCheck if any j's end before C starts (li=5), or start after C ends (ri=6+1=7).\n\nSo, for case1: j's end <=4.\n\nIn end_sorted for d=2, which includes D and any other duration 2 vouchers.\n\nSay, D has li=7, ri=8.\n\nThen, for case1, target=5-1=4.\n\nIn end_ri for d=2, let's say it's [3,8], then for target 4, j's ri <=4. So j's are those with ri <=4.\n\nIf any, their cost is added to C's cost.\n\nSimilarly for case2: j's li >=7.\n\nSo, the code should correctly find the minimal.\n\nThus, the code should handle it.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nI'll proceed step by step.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read each voucher.\n\nGroup them into a list.\n\nBuild the duration_map.\n\nFor each duration, sort end and start lists, compute prefix and suffix mins.\n\nThen, for each voucher, compute d_i, d_j.\n\nCheck if d_j is present.\n\nIf so, process both cases.\n\nUpdate the global_min.\n\nFinally, output global_min if it's not infinity, else -1.\n\nImplementing this.\n\nBut in Python, for handling the bisect, we need to have the end_ri and start_li as separate lists.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c) )\n\n# build duration_map\nduration_map = {}\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n    l, r, c = voucher\n    d = r - l +1\n    if d not in duration_map:\n        duration_map[d] = []\n    duration_map[d].append( (l, r, c) )\n\n# preprocess each duration\nprocessed_durations = {}\nfor d in duration_map:\n    # process end_sorted and prefix_min\n    end_list = sorted(duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n    end_ri = [x[1] for x in end_list]\n    end_prefix = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for x in end_list:\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, x[2])\n        end_prefix.append( min_so_far )\n    \n    # process start_sorted and suffix_min\n    start_list = sorted(duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n    start_li = [x[0] for x in start_list]\n    start_suffix = [float('inf')] * len(start_list)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, start_list[i][2])\n        start_suffix[i] = min_so_far\n    \n    processed_durations[d] = {\n        'end_list': end_list,\n        'end_ri': end_ri,\n        'end_prefix': end_prefix,\n        'start_list': start_list,\n        'start_li': start_li,\n        'start_suffix': start_suffix,\n    }\n\nglobal_min = float('inf')\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n    l, r, c = voucher\n    d_i = r - l +1\n    d_j = x - d_i\n    if d_j not in processed_durations:\n        continue\n    pd = processed_durations[d_j]\n    \n    # case1: j ends before i starts.\n    target = l -1\n    # find in end_ri, the last index where ri <= target.\n    # using bisect_right\n    k = bisect.bisect_right(pd['end_ri'], target) -1\n    if k >=0:\n        min_cost = pd['end_prefix'][k]\n        total = c + min_cost\n        if total < global_min:\n            global_min = total\n    \n    # case2: j starts after i ends.\n    target = r +1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration equals exactly `x` days and whose total cost is minimized.
