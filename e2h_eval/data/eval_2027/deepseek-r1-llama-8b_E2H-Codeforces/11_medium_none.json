A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe problem statement says that a group of n friends wants to make as many toasts as possible, with each toast requiring each friend to have specific amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt.\n\nLet's parse the input variables:\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles bought.\nl: milliliters per bottle.\nc: number of limes bought.\nd: slices per lime.\np: grams of salt bought.\nnl: milliliters of drink each toast needs per person.\nnp: grams of salt each toast needs per person.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each toast requires for each friend: nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So per toast, all friends together consume n * nl ml of drink, n slices (since each of the n friends takes one slice), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think in terms of total resources and then see how many toasts can be made based on each resource, then take the minimum.\n\nSo, let's compute the total drink available. Each bottle is l ml, so total drink is k * l ml.\n\nEach toast requires n * nl ml because each of the n friends needs nl ml. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (total_drink) // (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly, for the limes: each lime is cut into d slices, so total slices are c * d. Each toast requires n slices (one per friend). So the maximum toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt: total salt is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So the maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the overall maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute total_drink = k * l\n2. Compute max_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n3. Compute total_slices = c * d\n4. max_toasts_lime = total_slices // n\n5. max_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n6. The answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's test this logic.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20ml\nn * nl = 3*3=9ml per toast.\nmax_toasts_drink = 20//9=2 (since 2*9=18 <=20, 3*9=27>20).\n\ntotal_slices = 10*8=80\nn=3, so 80//3=26 (since 26*3=78 <80, 27*3=81>80).\n\nsalt: p=100, n*np=3*1=3. 100//3=33.\n\nSo min(2, 26,33) is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nCompute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink=1000ml.\nn*nl=5*4=20ml per toast → 1000//20=50.\n\nLimes: c=1, d=19 → 19 slices. Each toast needs 5 slices. 19//5=3.\n\nSalt: p=90, n*np=5*3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6) is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'.\n\nDrink: 1000*1000=1e6ml. Each toast needs 10*50=500ml. 1e6 /500=2000 toasts.\n\nLimes: 25*23=575 slices. Each toast needs 10 slices → 575//10=57.\n\nSalt: 1 gram. Each toast needs 10*1=10g. 1//10=0.\n\nSo the min is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, in code, I need to read the input as a single line, split into the variables, convert to integers, then compute as above.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat if any of the denominators are zero? But according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers, so division by zero isn't possible.\n\nAnother edge case: when the total required is exactly zero, but that's not possible since all inputs are at least 1.\n\nSo, code structure:\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into parts, convert each part to integer.\n\nThen compute each of the three resources' maximum toasts, then take the minimum.\n\nFinally, output that number as a string.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nTesting the code with the samples.\n\nLet me outline the code.\n\nRead input line:\n\nline = input().strip()\nparts = line.split()\nn = int(parts[0])\nk = int(parts[1])\nl = int(parts[2])\nc = int(parts[3])\nd = int(parts[4])\np = int(parts[5])\nnl = int(parts[6])\nnp = int(parts[7])\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntoasts_lime = total_slices // n\n\ntoasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nanswer = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n\nprint(answer)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first input is a list of strings, but in the actual code, the input is read as a single line. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', which is a single string.\n\nSo the code reads this correctly.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nAnother test case: what if all three are zero? But since the inputs are positive, that's impossible.\n\nAnother case where one of the resources is insufficient. For example, if drink allows 10 toasts, lime allows 5, salt allows 15: the answer is 5.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given specific amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of each resource per friend, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each friend needs a specific amount of drink, one lime slice, and a specific amount of salt for each toast.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of each resource available.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts per Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total lime slices available.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available.\n4. **Find the Limiting Resource**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is constrained by the resource that allows the fewest toasts. This is the minimum value from the three calculated values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntoasts_lime = total_slices // n\n\ntoasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single line with eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast.\n- **Compute Total Resources**: Calculate the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n- **Calculate Toasts per Resource**:\n  - For drink, divide the total drink by the amount needed per toast per friend.\n  - For lime slices, divide the total slices by the number of friends.\n  - For salt, divide the total salt by the amount needed per toast per friend.\n- **Determine Minimum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the three computed values, ensuring no resource is overused.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum number of toasts each friend can make while considering all constraints and resources.",
