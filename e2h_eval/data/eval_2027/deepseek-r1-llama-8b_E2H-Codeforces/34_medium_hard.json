And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is probably not going to work because that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved. For each possible window of size k, I need to sum the values in that window and then compute the average over all windows.\n\nWait, but adding each window from scratch every time would take O(k) per window, which when multiplied by O(n) windows gives O(nk) time—this would be 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to calculate the sums of all sliding windows. Oh right! That's where a sliding window technique or using a prefix sum array comes into play.\n\nYes, the prefix sum approach seems promising. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements.\n2. Then, for any window starting at index s and ending at index e (where e = s + k - 1), the sum can be calculated as prefix[e] - prefix[s-1], assuming 0-based indexing.\n3. Summing all these window sums will give me the total sum of all windows. Then, dividing by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1) will give the average.\n\nBut wait, how do I build the prefix sum? Let's see. Let me define the prefix sum as an array where prefix[0] = 0, and prefix[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1]. Then, the sum from a[p] to a[q] is prefix[q+1] - prefix[p].\n\nSo for each window starting at p, the end is p + k - 1. But I need to make sure that p + k -1 is less than n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Calculate the prefix sum array.\n- Iterate over each possible starting position p (from 0 to n - k).\n- For each p, the end is p + k - 1. So the sum is prefix[p + k] - prefix[p].\n- Sum all these sums, then divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1).\n\nThis approach is O(n) time because building the prefix sum is O(n) and then iterating through the windows is O(n) as well.\n\nGreat, that should handle the large constraints.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given. For instance, the third sample input:\n\nn=8, k=2. The array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1].\n\nThe number of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nEach window is two consecutive days. So the first window is 1+2=3, the next is 2+4=6, and so on until the last window is 1 (since the last two are 1 and 1, but wait, no: the last element is 1, so the last two are 789 and 1, sum 790? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait the array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. So the windows are:\n\n1+2 = 3\n\n2+4 =6 \n\n4+100000=100004 \n\n100000+123=100123 \n\n123+456=579 \n\n456+789=1245 \n\n789+1=790 \n\nWait, no. Wait, for k=2, each window has 2 elements. So for 8 elements, there are 7 windows. Each starting at 0, 1, ..., 6.\n\nSum of all windows:\n\n3 +6 +100004 +100123 +579 +1245 +790.\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\n3 is 1+2.\n\n6 is 2+4.\n\n100004 is 4+100000.\n\n100123 is 100000 +123.\n\n579 is 123+456.\n\n1245 is 456+789.\n\n790 is 789 +1.\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n9+100004=100013\n\n100013 +100123=200136\n\n200136 +579=200715\n\n200715 +1245=201,960?\n\nWait, 200715 + 1245 is 202,  715 +1245 = 1960, so 200715 +1245 = 201,960.\n\nThen adding 790: 201,960 +790=202,750.\n\nTotal sum is 202,750.\n\nNumber of windows is 7. So average is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, thinking about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, we can read the inputs, compute the prefix sum, then iterate through each window to accumulate the total sum.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- When k =n: in this case, there's only one window, which is the entire array. So the average is sum(a)/1.\n\n- When k=1: each day is a separate window. So the average is sum(a)/n.\n\nWait, yes. Because each day is a window of size 1, and there are n such windows.\n\nAnother edge case: n=k=1. Output is just a single value.\n\nAlso, when n is 2e5, the code needs to process that quickly.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and k from input.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the total sum of all windows.\n\nDivide by the number of windows (n-k+1) to get the average.\n\nNow, handling the prefix sum:\n\nIn Python, the list is 0-based. So the prefix sum can be built with prefix[0] =0, prefix[1]=a[0], prefix[2] =a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose a is [a0, a1, a2, ... an-1]\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =a0\n\nprefix[2] =a0+a1\n\nprefix[m] = sum of a[0..m-1]\n\nSo the sum from a[p] to a[q] (inclusive) is prefix[q+1] - prefix[p].\n\nSo for a window starting at p, the end is p +k-1.\n\nThus, the sum is prefix[p +k] - prefix[p].\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute prefix:\n\nprefix = [0] * (n +1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, total =0\n\nfor p in range(n -k +1):\n\n    end = p +k\n\n    total += prefix[end] - prefix[p]\n\naverage = total / (n -k +1)\n\nThen, print average with enough decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, the output requires that the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6, so we need to output at least 6 decimal digits.\n\nIn Python, we can format the output to have 10 decimal digits, which is more than enough.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the average is an integer? Like the first sample, which outputs 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the code should format the output with exactly 10 decimal places, including trailing zeros.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but sometimes the average could have more than 10 decimal digits, but the problem says to output enough digits to satisfy the error condition. So perhaps we should format it to, say, 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, looking at the sample outputs, the third one is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, in code, the format string is something like \"{0:.10f}\".\n\nBut wait, in Python, using .10f will show 10 decimal digits, even if they are zero. So that's correct.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo the windows are 3+4=7, 4+7=11. Total sum is 18. Number of windows is 2. Average is 9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nNow, what about when n is 1e5, but k is 1e5? So only one window. Then the code still correctly computes the sum of the array.\n\nWhat about when k is 1? Then n-k+1 =n, and each window is a single element. So the sum is sum(a) /n.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the computational efficiency.\n\nBuilding the prefix sum is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nLooping through all windows is O(n), also acceptable.\n\nSo the overall complexity is O(n), which is good.\n\nNow, let's test some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1, k=1.\n\nInput: 1 1\\n5\n\nOutput:5.0000000000.\n\nCase 2: n=2, k=2.\n\nInput: 2 2\\n1 2\n\nOnly one window: sum is 3. Average is 3. Output is 3.0000000000.\n\nCase 3: n=4, k=3.\n\nWindows: positions 0,1.\n\nWindow 0: a[0]+a[1]+a[2]\n\nWindow 1: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]\n\nSum is sum(a) + a[3] - a[0]\n\nBecause:\n\nsum0 = a0+a1+a2\n\nsum1 = a1+a2+a3\n\nsum0 + sum1 = a0+a1+a2 +a1+a2+a3 = a0 + 2a1 + 2a2 +a3.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is (prefix[3] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[4] - prefix[1]).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code handles this correctly.\n\nSo, I think this approach covers all cases.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nFirst, read n and k.\n\nThen read the array.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the total sum.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when dealing with very large numbers, floating points can have precision issues. But since the problem allows for a certain precision, and we're only computing sums of integers, perhaps the average can be represented accurately as a float, but I think using floating point division is acceptable here.\n\nWait, the sum can be up to 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10, and the number of windows is up to 2e5. So the average can be up to 2e10 /1, which is 2e10, but that's manageable as a float.\n\nIn Python, integers can be as big as needed, but when converted to floats, they can lose precision. However, for the purposes of this problem, since we're only required to have a precision of 1e-6, the floating point representation should suffice.\n\nSo, the code should be as follows.\n\nI'll proceed to write the code now.\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead a as a list.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nInitialize total_sum to 0.\n\nLoop p from 0 to (n -k), inclusive.\n\nFor each p, compute end = p +k.\n\nAdd (prefix[end] - prefix[p]) to total_sum.\n\nAfter all p, average = total_sum / (n -k +1).\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, n -k +1 is the number of windows. So for p in 0 to (n -k) inclusive, since the starting index can't go beyond that.\n\nWait, for example, when n=3, k=2.\n\nn -k +1 =2.\n\np can be 0 and 1.\n\nYes, because for p=0, end is 0+2=2 <3.\n\np=1: end=3, which is beyond the array? No, wait, the array is 0-based, so for a window starting at p=1, it's a[1] and a[2], which is allowed.\n\nSo the loop should run for p in range(n -k +1).\n\nYes, because n -k +1 is the number of windows.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor p in range(n - k +1):\n\n    end = p +k\n\n    total += prefix[end] - prefix[p]\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead a.\n\nCompute prefix.\n\nCompute total.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nTesting the third sample:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\na = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nprefix is [0,1,3,7,100007, 100130, 124275, 195064, 195065]\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =1\n\nprefix[2]=1+2=3\n\nprefix[3]=3+4=7\n\nprefix[4]=7 +100000=100007\n\nprefix[5]=100007 +123=100130\n\nprefix[6]=100130 +456=124,586?\n\nWait 100130 +456 is 100586?\n\nWait 100130 +456 is 100586.\n\nWait 100,130 +456 is 100,586.\n\nWait no: 100130 +456 = 100,586?\n\nWait 100,130 + 456 = 100,586.\n\nYes.\n\nprefix[6] = 100,586.\n\nprefix[7] = 100586 +789 =101375.\n\nprefix[8] =101375 +1=101376.\n\nSo the sum for each window:\n\np=0: end=2. sum is prefix[2]-prefix[0]=3-0=3.\n\np=1: end=3. sum is 7-1=6.\n\np=2: end=4. sum is 100007 -7=100000.\n\nWait wait, 100007 -7 is 100000.\n\nWait, 7 is prefix[3], which is 7.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, prefix[4] is 100007.\n\nSo p=2: end is 4, sum is prefix[4]-prefix[2] =100007-3=100004.\n\nAh, right.\n\nSimilarly, for p=3: end=5, sum is prefix[5] -prefix[3] =100130 -7=100123.\n\np=4: end=6. prefix[6] is 124586. prefix[4] is 100007. 124586 -100007 =24579.\n\nWait, 124586 -100007 is 24579.\n\np=5: end=7. prefix[7] is 101375. subtract prefix[5]=100130. 101375-100130=1245.\n\np=6: end=8. prefix[8]=101376. subtract prefix[6]=124586. 101376-124586 = -23510? Wait no, that can't be right.\n\nWait wait, no. p=6 is the starting index, which is 6, and end is 6+2=8. So the sum is prefix[8] - prefix[6].\n\nprefix[8] is 101376.\n\nprefix[6] is 124586.\n\nSo 101376 -124586 = -23510.\n\nWait that's negative. That can't be right.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So why is that?\n\nAh, because the window is from p=6 to p+2-1 =6+1=7.\n\nSo the elements are a[6] and a[7].\n\nWhich are 789 and 1. Their sum is 790.\n\nBut according to the prefix sum, prefix[6] is sum of first 6 elements: a[0] to a[5], which is 1+2+4+100000+123+456= 100586.\n\nprefix[8] is sum of all 8 elements: 1+2+4+100000+123+456+789+1= 101376.\n\nSo the sum from a[6] to a[7] is a[6] +a[7] =789+1=790.\n\nWhich is equal to prefix[8] - prefix[6] =101376 - 100586 =790.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation showed that p=6, end=8, so sum is prefix[8] - prefix[6] =101376 - 100586 =790.\n\nAh, I see, my mistake was that I thought prefix[6] was 124586, but that's incorrect.\n\nLet me recalculate the prefix sum correctly.\n\nLet me recompute the prefix for the third sample:\n\na = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =1.\n\nprefix[2] =1+2=3.\n\nprefix[3] =3+4=7.\n\nprefix[4] =7 +100000=100007.\n\nprefix[5] =100007 +123=100130.\n\nprefix[6] =100130 +456=100586.\n\nprefix[7] =100586 +789=101375.\n\nprefix[8] =101375 +1=101376.\n\nSo for p=6, end is 8.\n\nprefix[8] - prefix[6] =101376 -100586=790.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo earlier, I made a mistake in the prefix sum calculation.\n\nSo the code correctly calculates all the sums.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead a.\n\nCompute prefix.\n\nCompute total.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimals.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\ntotal = 0\nnum_windows = n - k + 1\nfor p in range(num_windows):\n    end = p + k\n    total += prefix[end] - prefix[p]\naverage = total / num_windows\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nprefix is [0,3,7,14]\n\nnum_windows = 2.\n\np=0: end=2. sum=7-0=7.\n\np=1: end=3. sum=14-3=11.\n\nTotal is 18. average 9. Output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nprefix is [0,10]\n\nnum_windows=1.\n\np=0: sum=10-0=10. average 10.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on given sleep records for consecutive days. The solution should efficiently handle large input sizes and ensure precision in the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given `n` days of sleep data and `k` consecutive days as a week. We need to compute the average sleep time over all possible windows of size `k`. The number of such windows is `n - k + 1`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Directly summing each window from scratch would be inefficient. Instead, we use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: This helps in calculating the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n   - **Sliding Window Technique**: Using the prefix sum array, we can efficiently compute the sum of each window of size `k` in linear time.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time due to the linear construction of the prefix sum array and the sliding window summation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal = 0\nnum_windows = n - k + 1\nfor p in range(num_windows):\n    end = p + k\n    total += prefix[end] - prefix[p]\n\naverage = total / num_windows\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values for `n`, `k`, and the sleep records `a`.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: The prefix sum array is constructed where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep records. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n\n3. **Total Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, the code iterates over each possible window of size `k`, computes the sum of each window, and accumulates the total sum.\n\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, which is then printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.",
