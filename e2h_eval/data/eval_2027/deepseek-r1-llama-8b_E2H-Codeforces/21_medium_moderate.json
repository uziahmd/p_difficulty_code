The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. The goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the keys. Each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by only one key.\n\nHmm, the condition for a key j to unlock chest i is that a_i + b_j is odd. So that means one must be even and the other odd. Because even plus odd is odd, right?\n\nSo, to rephrase: For a chest with a_i even, we need a key with b_j odd. And vice versa. Wait, no: wait, a_i + b_j mod 2 should be 1. So if a_i is even (0 mod 2), then b_j must be 1 mod 2 (odd). If a_i is odd, b_j must be even.\n\nSo the first step is to separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly, separate the keys into even and odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between the number of even a_i chests and the number of even b_j keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd a_i chests and the number of odd b_j keys. Because each group can only use the corresponding type of key.\n\nWait, yes! Because for even a_i, we need odd keys, and for odd a_i, we need even keys.\n\nSo, let me formalize this:\n\n- Count how many chests have even a_i (let's call this even_chests) and how many are odd (odd_chests).\n- Similarly, count the even and odd keys (even_keys and odd_keys).\n\nThen the maximum possible chests is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nBut wait, what if some keys are used up in one part? Like, suppose even_chests is 5, odd_keys is 3. Then you can only take 3 chests from there. But when you add the other part, which might have more keys than needed, but since the keys are used once, it doesn't affect the total.\n\nYes, because each key is used for exactly one chest. So taking as many as possible from both groups gives the optimal solution.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate through all a_i and count how many are even and odd.\n2. Do the same for b_j.\n3. Compute the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) and min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n4. That sum is the answer.\n\nWait, but what about the example given?\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nChests a_i: 9,14,6,2,11.\n\nEven a_i: 14,6,2 → 3 chests.\n\nOdd a_i: 9,11 → 2 chests.\n\nKeys b_j: 8,4,7,20.\n\nEven keys: 8,4,20 → 3 keys.\n\nOdd keys: 7 → 1 key.\n\nSo even_chests = 3, odd_chests = 2.\n\nodd_keys = 1, even_keys =3.\n\nSo min(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2. Total is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: second input.\n\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0.\n\nKeys:5 → odd. So even_keys=0, odd_keys=1.\n\nSo min(5, 0) is 0, min(0,1) is 0. So total 0? But the sample output is 1.\n\nWait wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait the second sample input is:\n\nn=5, m=1\n\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even.\n\nb = [5] → odd.\n\nSo even_chests =5, odd_chests=0.\n\neven_keys=0, odd_keys=1.\n\nSo according to my earlier logic, the answer would be min(5,1) (for even_chests and odd_keys) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. So total 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAh, right! So I had the logic correct. So the formula is indeed min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the a array and count even and odd.\n\n- Read the b array and count even and odd.\n\n- Compute the sum of the two minima.\n\nSo the code will look like this.\n\nNow, considering the constraints: n and m can be up to 1e5, so the solution needs to process this efficiently.\n\nIn Python, reading the input is manageable. We can read the lines, split into lists, and count evens and odds.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers for a.\n\ncount_even_a = 0\n\ncount_odd_a = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        count_even_a +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        count_odd_a +=1\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\ncount_even_b = 0\n\ncount_odd_b = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num %2 ==0:\n\n        count_even_b +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        count_odd_b +=1\n\nThen compute:\n\nmax_chests = min(count_even_a, count_odd_b) + min(count_odd_a, count_even_b)\n\nPrint max_chests.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst example:\n\na has 3 evens, 2 odds.\n\nb has 3 evens, 1 odd.\n\nmin(3,1)=1, min(2,3)=2 → 3.\n\nSecond example:\n\na has 5 evens, 0 odds.\n\nb has 0 evens, 1 odd.\n\nmin(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0 → total 1.\n\nThird example:\n\nInput is:\n\nn=1, m=4\n\na:10 → even.\n\nb:20,30,40,50 → all even.\n\nSo even_chests=1, even_keys=4.\n\nodd_chests=0, odd_keys=0.\n\nSo min(1,0) =0, min(0,4)=0 → total 0. Which matches the third sample output.\n\nLooks correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe'll read the input lines.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as three parts: the first line is n and m, the second line is a's, the third is b's.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input description, the user provided three lines. But perhaps it's a typo, or perhaps the way the input is presented is three lines: first line n m, second line a, third line b.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and m.\n\nRead the second line as a's list.\n\nRead the third line as b's list.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, it's written as three strings, each on their own line. So for the first sample input, the first line is '5 4', second is '9 14 6 2 11', third is '8 4 7 20'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen proceed to count.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nAlso, edge cases: when all chests are even and no keys are odd, then the answer is zero.\n\nOr when all keys are odd and all chests are even, then the answer is min(number of chests, number of keys) ?\n\nWait, no: for example, even_chests=3, odd_keys=5. Then min(3,5)=3. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about when a chest has a_i=0? Since 0 is even, it's considered even.\n\nWhat about a_i being 1, which is odd.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nCount even and odd in a.\n\nRead b list.\n\nCount even and odd in b.\n\nCompute sum of min(even_a, odd_b) and min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nPrint that sum.\n\nSo the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using given keys. Each key can unlock a specific type of chest based on whether the key and chest numbers are odd or even.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to maximize the number of chests that can be opened by using keys such that the sum of the key number and chest number is odd. This means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n2. **Intuition**: We can categorize the chests and keys into two groups: those with even numbers and those with odd numbers. The maximum number of chests that can be opened will be the sum of the minimum counts from each group pairing:\n   - Even-numbered chests can be unlocked using odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests can be unlocked using even-numbered keys.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened as the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Complexity**: The solution efficiently processes the input in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs up to the constraint limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a += 1\n        else:\n            odd_a += 1\n    \n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_b += 1\n        else:\n            odd_b += 1\n    \n    max_chests = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n    print(max_chests)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of chests and keys, followed by the lists of numbers on the chests and keys.\n- **Counting Evens and Odds**: It counts how many chests and keys have even and odd numbers.\n- **Calculating Maximum Chests**: Using the counts from the previous step, it calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering the minimum possible pairs of even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal use of keys to unlock the maximum number of chests, adhering to the problem constraints.",
