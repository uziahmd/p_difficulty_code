Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting souvenirs such that their total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is maximized. Petya has n souvenirs, each with a weight between 1 and 3, and a cost. We need to choose a subset where the sum of weights is ≤m, and the sum of costs is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, the constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So we need an efficient solution, probably O(n*m) is too slow. Wait, but n is 1e5 and m is 3e5, which gives 3e10 operations—way too much. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches. Since the weights are small (only 1,2,3), maybe we can group them by weight and handle each group separately.\n\nYes, for each weight class (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible count of taking items from each weight, we can compute the maximum cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nWait, but how do we combine the counts from each weight? Because the sum of 1*count1 + 2*count2 +3*count3 must be ≤m.\n\nThis sounds like a variation of the knapsack problem, but since the weights are limited, perhaps we can find a way to model it efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible number of items taken from weight 3, we can precompute the best possible selection of 2s and 1s that fit into the remaining weight.\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small, maybe we can try all possible combinations of counts for each weight, but even that might be too slow because for each combination, the count can be up to m/weight.\n\nWait, but the maximum m is 3e5, and for each of the three weight groups, the maximum possible count is m//w, which is 3e5 for w=1, which is way too big. So trying all possibilities isn't feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps a dynamic programming approach is needed, but optimized given the small weights.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a 0-1 knapsack where each item has weight 1, 2, or 3, and we want to maximize the value (cost) without exceeding the weight capacity m.\n\nIn the standard 0-1 knapsack, for each item, you iterate through the capacities from high to low. But with n=1e5, that's 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo, we need a way to process these items more efficiently. Given that the weights are small, perhaps we can group the items by weight and process each group in a way that allows us to compute the optimal DP quickly.\n\nFor each weight w, we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible number of items taken from this weight, we can compute the cumulative cost and weight. But again, with large counts, this could be tricky.\n\nAnother thought: for each weight, we can precompute the prefix sums of cost and weight. Then, for each possible k items taken from weight w, the cost is prefix_k_cost and the weight is prefix_k_weight. We can then, for each w, consider all possible k and see how they fit into the remaining weight.\n\nBut even with that, combining the different weights is still challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use a meet-in-the-middle approach, but with n being 1e5, that's not feasible either.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the maximum possible sum for each weight is manageable, perhaps we can represent the DP state as the maximum cost achievable for each possible weight up to m. Then, for each item, we update the DP accordingly.\n\nBut with 1e5 items, that's not feasible unless we can process multiple items at once.\n\nAh! Since all items of the same weight can be considered together. For example, for weight 1, if we take t items, the total cost is the sum of the top t items' cost, and the total weight is t.\n\nWait, exactly. So for each weight group, we can precompute the prefix sums of the sorted list (sorted by cost in descending order). Then, for each weight group, the prefix sums will allow us to quickly calculate what adding a certain number of items from that group contributes to both the cost and the weight.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Split the items into three groups based on their weight (w=1, 2, 3).\n2. For each group, sort the items in descending order of cost.\n3. For each group, compute the prefix sums of cost and prefix sums of weight. The prefix sum arrays will tell us, for taking the first k items from that group, the total cost and weight.\n4. Now, the problem reduces to choosing a number of items from each group (k1, k2, k3) such that 1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 ≤ m, and the total cost (sum of the prefix sums) is maximized.\n\nBut how do we find the best combination of k1, k2, k3?\n\nThis seems like a variation of the bounded knapsack problem, where each item can be taken up to some maximum count, and the goal is to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight.\n\nHmm, but even with that, for large m, the DP approach would be too slow.\n\nWait, but considering that the possible counts for each group are limited by the prefix sums. For example, for weight 3, the maximum k3 is such that 3*k3 ≤ m, so k3 can be up to m//3.\n\nBut for m=3e5, that's 1e5 per group, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but n is 1e5, but each group may have varying sizes. For example, all items could be in weight 1, so the group for weight 1 would have 1e5 items. Processing all those would be time-consuming.\n\nBut perhaps we can process each group independently and for each possible number of items taken from that group, track the minimal weight used to achieve that number of items, and then find the best combination across all groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to perform a three-dimensional DP, but that's not feasible because m is up to 3e5 and the third dimension is the count of items, which is impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by iterating over the possible counts for each group, but using the fact that the weight of the items is small.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I have precomputed the prefix sums for each group. For each group, the prefix sum tells me that taking k items from that group adds s_cost to the total and s_weight = k * w to the total weight.\n\nSo, the problem is to select k1, k2, k3 such that 1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 ≤ m, and sum of their prefix costs is maximized.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find the best combination of k1, k2, k3.\n\nAn alternative approach is to fix two of the variables and compute the best third variable.\n\nFor example, for each possible k3, compute the best possible k2 and k1 that fit within the remaining weight.\n\nBut even that could be too slow if done naively.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each possible remaining weight after selecting k3 and k2, the best k1.\n\nAlternatively, let's precompute for each possible k2, the best possible k1 and k3 that fit into the remaining weight.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to structure this.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible total weight, keep track of the maximum cost.\n\nWe can start with a DP array where dp[w] is the maximum cost achievable with total weight w.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0, and all others are -infinity or something.\n\nThen, for each group, we process it by updating the DP array.\n\nBut wait, processing each group as in the standard knapsack would require for each item, but here we have multiple items of the same weight. So perhaps for each group, we can compute all possible ways to add items of that weight in one go.\n\nLet me elaborate. For the weight 1 group, after sorting and computing the prefix sums, we can think of it as a set of possible (weight, cost) pairs where weight is the number of items taken (each contributes 1 to the total weight), and cost is the sum of their values.\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nSo, for each group, we can create a list of possible (delta_w, delta_c) where delta_w is the additional weight and delta_c is the additional cost. Then, the problem becomes combining these three lists in all possible ways such that the sum of delta_w is ≤ m.\n\nBut even this way, combining them is challenging.\n\nWait, but for each group, we can model the possible contributions as a list of (w_i, c_i) pairs, and then process each group by considering adding 0, 1, ..., up to the maximum possible items from that group.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a convolution-like approach, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another angle: since the groups are independent, perhaps we can model the problem as a combination of three separate prefix sum steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\n1. For each group, compute the prefix sums.\n\n2. For the weight 3 group, for each possible k3 (from 0 to max_k3), compute the total cost and weight.\n\n3. For each such k3, we then have a remaining weight of rem = m - 3*k3.\n\n   Then, for the weight 2 group, compute the maximum number of items k2 that can be taken such that 2*k2 ≤ rem.\n\n   For each possible k2 (from 0 to max_possible for rem), compute the remaining weight rem2 = rem - 2*k2.\n\n   Then, for rem2, take as many items as possible from the weight 1 group.\n\nBut this approach is O(max_k3 * max_k2), which could be up to (1e5)^2 = 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nNo, that won't work.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can optimize by precomputing for each possible weight the best possible combination.\n\nWait, another idea: the maximum possible weight is 3e5, which is manageable.\n\nWe can precompute for each possible weight, the best possible cost when considering the first two groups (say, 1 and 2), and then combine with the third group.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible weight, we can track the maximum cost achievable by combining any number of items from the 1 and 2 weight groups, and then add the best possible from the 3-weight group.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps we can compute for each possible weight w, the best possible cost for the 1 and 2 weight groups, and then for each w, compute the maximum cost by adding the best possible 3-weight group that fits into w.\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- Group A: weight 1\n- Group B: weight 2\n- Group C: weight 3\n\nCompute for group A and B, the maximum cost for each possible weight up to m.\n\nThen, for each possible weight w, the maximum cost is the maximum over all possible ways to split w into a sum of a (from A), b (from B), and c (from C), such that a + 2b + 3c ≤ w, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute for each possible weight up to m, the best possible cost using A and B, and then for each possible c (number of items from C), check if 3c is ≤ w, and then look up the best cost for w -3c.\n\nWait, that might be manageable.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess group C: compute prefix sums for the sorted list. So for each k3, we have cost3[k3], weight3[k3].\n\n2. Preprocess group A and B similarly.\n\n3. Compute a DP array for group A and B, where dp_ab[w] is the maximum cost achievable by taking items from A and B, with total weight w.\n\n4. Then, for each possible k3 (number of items from C), we can compute the weight used by C (3*k3). The remaining weight is rem = m - 3*k3.\n\n   If rem <0, skip.\n\n   For rem, find the maximum cost in dp_ab[rem], and add cost3[k3]. Keep track of the maximum total cost.\n\nBut wait, this approach considers only taking some items from C, then the rest from A and B. But what if it's better to take some from C and some from A and B in a different order?\n\nHmm, no, because the problem is additive. The order in which we take items doesn't affect the total weight or cost. So this approach should capture all possibilities.\n\nBut how to compute dp_ab[w], which is the maximum cost for groups A and B with total weight w.\n\nTo compute dp_ab, we can model it as a 0-1 knapsack problem with two groups, each contributing 1 and 2 weights respectively.\n\nComputing this for groups A and B can be done efficiently.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each group, sort the items in descending order of cost. Then compute the prefix sums for cost and weight.\n\nGroup A (w=1):\n\n- Sort all items by cost descending.\n- Compute prefix_a_cost and prefix_a_weight, where prefix_a_cost[k] is the sum of the first k items, and prefix_a_weight[k] is k*1.\n\nSimilarly for group B (w=2):\n\n- Sort, compute prefix_b_cost and prefix_b_weight.\n\nGroup C (w=3):\n\n- Sort, compute prefix_c_cost and prefix_c_weight.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the dp_ab array, which represents the maximum cost achievable using any number of items from A and B, with total weight up to m.\n\nHow to compute dp_ab efficiently.\n\nThe standard 0-1 knapsack approach for two groups is to process each group, updating the dp array.\n\nInitialize dp_ab as an array where dp_ab[w] is the maximum cost for weight w, starting with dp_ab[0] = 0 and others as -infinity.\n\nProcess group A first:\n\nFor each w from m down to 1:\n    for k in 1 to len(prefix_a):\n        if w >= k and dp_ab[w -k] + prefix_a_cost[k] > dp_ab[w]:\n            update dp_ab[w]\n\nBut wait, this is O(m * n_A), which could be up to 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10, which is way too slow.\n\nWait, but group A is processed in bulk. For each possible k, which is the number of items taken from A, the weight is k, and the cost is prefix_a_cost[k]. So for each possible k, we can iterate over the dp array and update the entries.\n\nThis can be optimized by using the fact that for group A, all items are 1 weight, and we can process them in a way similar to unbounded knapsack, but since each item can be taken at most once, it's 0-1 knapsack.\n\nWait, but even then, for group A with 1e5 items, processing each one would be too slow.\n\nWait, but we have the prefix sums. So for group A, each possible k (number of items taken) contributes a fixed weight (k) and cost (prefix_a_cost[k]).\n\nSo for group A, we can loop through all possible k (from 0 to len(prefix_a)), and for each k, add the possibility of taking k items from A.\n\nBut how to efficiently update the dp_ab array for group A.\n\nAh, right! For each k, the new possible weight is k, and the cost is prefix_a_cost[k].\n\nSo for group A, we can process the dp_ab array as follows:\n\nfor k in 0 to len(prefix_a):\n    cost = prefix_a_cost[k]\n    weight = k\n    for w in m - weight downto weight:\n        if dp_ab[w - weight] + cost > dp_ab[w]:\n            dp_ab[w] = dp_ab[w - weight] + cost\n\nWait, but this is still O(m * len(prefix_a)), which for 1e5 items, len(prefix_a) is up to 1e5, leading to 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So this approach isn't feasible for large n.\n\nWait, but in practice, the number of unique k's for group A is up to len(prefix_a). For group A, if it has 1e5 items, len(prefix_a) is 1e5. So the above approach would be O(1e5 * 3e5) = 3e10 operations—completely infeasible.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is not efficient enough.\n\nAlternative idea: since the items are sorted in descending order, perhaps the prefix sums are non-decreasing. So for group A, each additional item added increases the total cost and the total weight by 1.\n\nSo for group A, the possible (weight, cost) is a sequence where weight increases by 1 and cost increases by the next item's cost.\n\nThus, for group A, the possible options are a set of points that form a line.\n\nSo, when processing group A into the dp_ab array, instead of considering each individual item, perhaps we can find the maximum possible cost for each weight in a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible weight, the maximum cost from group A is simply the maximum prefix_a_cost[k] where k <= w.\n\nBut no, because group A and B contribute to the same weight, so it's a combined effect.\n\nWait, another idea: group A can be processed as an unbounded knapsack for the 1-weight items, but since each item can be taken only once, it's a 0-1 knapsack. But with 1e5 items, it's too slow.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm stuck. Let me think about alternative approaches.\n\nWait, given that the weight is up to 3e5, and the items have small weights, perhaps we can represent the DP for group A and B in a compressed way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a 3D knapsack, but that's not manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each possible weight, the maximum cost from group A, and then for each possible weight, precompute the maximum cost from group B, given a certain weight used by A.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to note that the weight is small (up to 3e5) but the number of items is large. So we need an approach that can handle each group efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps for group A, the maximum number of items that can be taken is min(len(prefix_a), m). So for each possible k in group A, the cost is prefix_a_cost[k], and the weight is k.\n\nSo when processing group A into the dp_ab array, for each k, we can add the possibility of taking k items from A, and for each possible weight w, see if w - k is achievable with some other items.\n\nBut again, this is O(k_max * m), which is too slow.\n\nHmm, perhaps another angle. Since the weight is up to 3e5, perhaps for each possible weight w, the maximum cost for group A is the maximum prefix_a_cost[k] where k <= w.\n\nSimilarly, for group B, the maximum cost for a given weight is the maximum prefix_b_cost[k] where 2k <= w.\n\nBut group A and B are combined, so their choices are interdependent.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a 2D problem where we track the maximum cost for a certain number of items from A and B, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to precompute for group A and B the best possible cost for each possible number of items taken, and then for each possible triplet (k1, k2, k3), check if 1*k1 + 2*k2 +3*k3 <=m, and keep track of the maximum cost.\n\nBut with 1e5 items in each group, the possible k1 and k2 could be up to 1e5 each, making the triplet approach 1e15 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's time to look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, I remember that when dealing with small weights, we can use a 1D DP array and process each group in a way that for each possible weight, we track the maximum cost.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the approach is as follows:\n\n1. Sort each group in descending order of cost and compute their prefix sums.\n\n2. Initialize a DP array where dp[w] is the maximum cost for weight w.\n\n3. Process each group, updating the DP array in a way that adds the possibilities from that group.\n\nBut with 1e5 items, this is again too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each group, the prefix sums can be processed in a way that allows us to update the DP array in O(m) time, regardless of the number of items in the group.\n\nWait, for group A, each item adds 1 weight and some cost. Since the items are sorted, each next item's cost is less than or equal to the previous.\n\nSo, for group A, for each possible number of items taken k, the cost is prefix_a_cost[k], and the weight is k.\n\nSo, for each possible k, we can add this to the DP array.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to process group A is similar to the unbounded knapsack problem. For each possible weight w, we can take as many items as possible from group A, but given that each item can be taken only once, it's more like a 0-1 knapsack.\n\nWait, but with 1e5 items, each requiring O(m) processing, that's 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think of a way to model this problem in a way that avoids processing each item individually.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for group A, the best way to include k items is to take the top k items, which gives the maximum possible cost for that k. So, the prefix sums are sufficient.\n\nSo, for group A, any subset of k items is better represented by the first k items in the sorted list.\n\nTherefore, for group A, the possible options are the prefix sums, and each option corresponds to a certain weight and cost.\n\nSimilarly for group B and C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the best combination of a k1 from group A, k2 from group B, and k3 from group C, such that 1*k1 + 2*k2 +3*k3 ≤m, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nSo, the question is how to find the triplet (k1, k2, k3) that satisfies the weight constraint and gives the maximum cost.\n\nBut with k1, k2, k3 potentially up to 1e5 each, it's impossible to check all triplets.\n\nThus, we need a smarter way.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible k3, we can find the maximum possible (k1, k2) that fits into the remaining weight m -3*k3.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each possible k3 (from 0 to max_k3), where max_k3 is the largest k3 such that 3*k3 ≤m.\n\n2. For each k3, compute the remaining weight rem = m -3*k3.\n\n3. Then, find the maximum possible cost from groups A and B that can fit into rem.\n\n4. The total cost is the sum of the cost from group C (k3) and the maximum cost from groups A and B (rem).\n\n5. Keep track of the maximum total cost over all valid k3.\n\nThe critical part is step 3: finding the maximum cost for groups A and B with total weight ≤ rem.\n\nIf we can compute this efficiently for each rem, the overall algorithm could be manageable.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to solving a 0-1 knapsack problem for groups A and B, with a maximum weight of rem.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for groups A and B, we can precompute a 2D array where for each possible total weight up to m, we store the maximum cost achievable by groups A and B. But that would require O(m) space and O(m) time to compute.\n\nWait, but how to compute this 2D array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute for each possible weight, the maximum cost achievable by groups A and B.\n\nWait, let's denote this as dp_ab[w], which is the maximum cost for groups A and B with total weight w.\n\nWe can compute dp_ab as follows:\n\n- Initialize dp_ab[0] =0.\n\n- For each possible weight w from 1 to m:\n\n   dp_ab[w] = max over all possible k (number of items from A) and l (number of items from B) such that k + 2*l =w, of (prefix_a_cost[k] + prefix_b_cost[l]).\n\nBut calculating this directly is O(m^2), which is impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: process group A and group B in a way that builds up the dp_ab array.\n\nInitialize dp_ab[0] =0.\n\nFor group A:\n\n   For each possible weight w from m downto 1:\n\n       for k in 1 to ...:\n\n           if w >=k and dp_ab[w -k] + prefix_a_cost[k] > dp_ab[w]:\n\n               dp_ab[w] = dp_ab[w -k] + prefix_a_cost[k]\n\nSimilarly for group B:\n\n   For each possible weight w from m downto 2:\n\n       for l in 1 to ...:\n\n           if w >= 2*l and dp_ab[w - 2*l] + prefix_b_cost[l] > dp_ab[w]:\n\n               dp_ab[w] = ...\n\nBut again, this is O(m * n_A + m * n_B), which is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can process group A and group B in a way that for each possible weight, we track the maximum cost, considering the items from A and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard way to compute this is to use a 1D array and for each group, process it as in the 0-1 knapsack.\n\nBut with 1e5 items in group A and 1e5 in group B, that's 2e5 operations each, which is 6e10 steps—way too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but group A and group B can be processed together. Since group A contributes 1 weight and group B contributes 2 weights, perhaps we can find a way to process them in a single pass.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process group A first, and then group B.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort group A and compute prefix_a.\n\n2. Sort group B and compute prefix_b.\n\n3. Initialize dp_ab[0] =0.\n\n4. For group A:\n\n   For w from m downto 1:\n\n       for k in 1 to len(prefix_a):\n\n           if w >=k:\n\n               if dp_ab[w -k] + prefix_a_cost[k] > dp_ab[w]:\n\n                   dp_ab[w] = dp_ab[w -k] + prefix_a_cost[k]\n\nBut again, this is O(m * n_A), which is too slow.\n\nSame for group B.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the problem can be treated as a 3-way unbounded knapsack, but with each item having a weight of 1, 2, or 3, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their costs without exceeding m.\n\nGiven the small weights, perhaps a DP approach is feasible.\n\nBut with m up to 3e5, and each item processed as a separate item, it's O(nm) which is 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nWait, but in our case, the items are grouped by weight, and each group can be processed in bulk.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a 3-way knapsack, but process each group in a way that allows us to compute the maximum cost for each weight.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Initialize a DP array where dp[w] is the maximum cost for weight w.\n\n- For each group (A, B, C), process the items in the group, updating the DP array.\n\nProcessing each group involves:\n\nFor group A (w=1):\n\n   For each possible k (number of items taken), which contributes k weight and sum of the first k items' cost.\n\n   For each possible current weight w in the DP array, if w +k ≤m, then update dp[w +k] to be the maximum of its current value and dp[w] + cost_k.\n\nBut again, this is O(m * n_A), which is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps for group A, we can compute the best possible for each possible weight.\n\nSince group A is sorted, the cost for k items is the maximum possible for that k.\n\nSo, for group A, the possible contributions are a set of (k, cost) where k ranges from 0 to len(prefix_a).\n\nThus, for group A, for each possible k, we can treat it as a single item with weight k and cost prefix_a_cost[k], and process it as in the 0-1 knapsack.\n\nBut again, with 1e5 items, this is O(m * 1e5) operations.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved using a greedy approach, but I don't see how because the items have different costs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a linear programming problem, but that's not feasible for coding.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the weight is small, perhaps the problem can be approached using a BFS-like method, where each state is the current weight and the maximum cost achieved so far. We can use a priority queue to explore the states in a way that prioritizes higher cost states.\n\nBut this might not work well due to the large number of possible states.\n\nWait, but for each group, the items are sorted, so the prefix sums are non-decreasing. So, for group A, taking more items can only increase the cost and the weight.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way to take items from group A is to take as many as possible, given the remaining weight.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, the optimal number of items to take is determined by the remaining weight and the cost per unit weight.\n\nBut this depends on the specific items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, the best way is to take as many items as possible until adding another item would exceed the remaining weight.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach and may not yield the optimal solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: since the problem is to maximize the cost, and the items are sorted in descending order, perhaps for each group, the maximum cost for a given weight is achieved by taking as many items as possible.\n\nThus, for group A, the maximum cost for weight w is the maximum prefix_a_cost[k] where k <=w.\n\nBut this is only true if the cost per weight is higher than other options. However, this may not hold in all cases because a lower number of items could have a higher cost.\n\nWait, no. Since the items are sorted in descending order of cost, the prefix sums are non-decreasing. So, for group A, the maximum cost for weight w is the maximum possible for any k <=w.\n\nSo, for group A, the best cost for weight w is the maximum prefix_a_cost[k] for k <=w.\n\nSimilarly for group B, the best cost for weight w is the maximum prefix_b_cost[l] for l <=w//2.\n\nWait, but group B's items have weight 2, so for a given weight w, the maximum l is floor(w/2).\n\nBut group A and B can be combined, so it's not just the sum of the two individual maximums.\n\nWait, but perhaps for group A and B, the best way is to precompute for each possible weight, the maximum cost achievable by any combination of group A and B.\n\nThis brings us back to the earlier problem of efficiently computing dp_ab[w], the maximum cost for group A and B with weight w.\n\nBut again, with the time constraints, it's unclear how to do this.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to precompute for group A and B the maximum cost for each possible weight, and then for each possible k3, find the best possible combination of k1 and k2 that fits into the remaining weight.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother Idea: Since group A and B have small weights (1 and 2), perhaps for each possible weight w, the maximum cost can be found using a sliding window approach.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for group A and B, the problem can be considered as a 0-1 knapsack with two types of items, each with different weights.\n\nBut again, this leads back to the same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for group A and B, the maximum cost can be computed using a single pass through the DP array.\n\nLet me think about how to compute dp_ab[w] for all w.\n\nInitially, dp_ab is zero for w=0 and negative infinity otherwise.\n\nProcess group A:\n\nFor each possible weight w from m downto 1:\n\n   for k in 1 to len(prefix_a):\n\n       if w >=k:\n\n           if dp_ab[w -k] + prefix_a_cost[k] > dp_ab[w]:\n\n               dp_ab[w] = dp_ab[w -k] + prefix_a_cost[k]\n\nBut again, this is O(m * n_A), which is too slow.\n\nWait, but group A's items are sorted in descending order, so for each w, the best k is the maximum possible that doesn't exceed w, and among those, the one that gives the highest cost.\n\nSo, for group A, for each w, the best k is the maximum possible k where prefix_a_cost[k] is as high as possible.\n\nWhich is just the maximum k such that k <=w.\n\nSo, for group A, the best possible contribution for weight w is the maximum prefix_a_cost[k], where k is min(len(prefix_a), w).\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct because taking fewer items could lead to a higher total cost when combined with group B.\n\nFor example, taking a higher cost item from group A and a higher cost item from group B could result in a better total cost than taking as many as possible from group A.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for group A and B, the best way is to precompute for each possible weight w, the maximum cost achievable.\n\nThis can be done by considering all possible k from group A and l from group B such that k + 2*l <=w, and find the maximum (prefix_a_cost[k] + prefix_b_cost[l]).\n\nBut again, this is O(m^2), which is not feasible.\n\nI'm stuck. Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.\n\nWait, another Idea: Since the weights are small, perhaps for each group, we can compute the maximum possible cost for all possible weights up to m, and then combine them in a way that the sum of weights does not exceed m.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for group C, since each item has weight 3, the maximum k3 is m//3. For each k3, we can compute the cost and the weight, then the remaining weight is m -3*k3.\n\nThen, for the remaining weight, we need to find the maximum cost from groups A and B that can fit into it.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each k3, compute the best possible cost from groups A and B with weight rem = m -3*k3.\n\nThus, the key is to compute, for each possible rem, the maximum cost from groups A and B.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible rem, the maximum cost can be computed as the sum of the maximum possible from group A (with weight up to rem) and group B (with weight up to rem - k1).\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nWait, but perhaps for group A and B, we can precompute the maximum cost for each possible weight up to m.\n\nSo, for group A, for each weight w, the maximum cost is prefix_a_cost[k], where k is the maximum possible ≤w.\n\nSimilarly for group B, for each weight w, the maximum cost is prefix_b_cost[l], where l is the maximum possible ≤w//2.\n\nThen, for a given rem, the maximum cost from A and B is the sum of the best possible from A and B that fit into rem.\n\nBut this is not necessarily the case because taking some from A and some from B may give a better total than taking the maximum possible from A and B separately.\n\nBut perhaps this is a good approximation.\n\nWait, but no. For example, group A's best for rem is k1, and group B's best for (rem -k1) is l1. But perhaps a different k1 and l1 could give a better total.\n\nSo, this approach is not accurate.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the maximum cost for group A and B for a given rem is the same as the maximum cost achievable by any combination of group A and B with total weight ≤ rem.\n\nThus, for each rem, we can compute this value once, and then for each k3, compute the total cost.\n\nBut how to compute this value efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps for group A and B, the maximum cost can be computed using a 1D DP array.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sums for group A and B.\n\n2. Initialize a dp_ab array where dp_ab[w] is the maximum cost achievable by groups A and B with total weight w.\n\n3. For group A:\n\n   For w from m downto 1:\n\n       for k in 1 to len(prefix_a):\n\n           if w >=k:\n\n               if dp_ab[w -k] + prefix",
