After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. We have n students and m subjects. Each student has m marks, each from 1-9. For each subject, we need to find out which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the max in any of their subjects. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject, determine which student(s) have the highest mark.\n2. For each student, check if they are the sole maximum in at least one subject.\n\nWait, but what if multiple students have the same maximum? Like, if two students have the same highest mark in a subject, then neither is the best. So for a subject, the best student is the one with the maximum, but only if it's unique.\n\nRight. So for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark and how many students have that mark. Only the students with that maximum (if it's unique) are considered best in that subject.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Read the input. The first line gives n and m. Then, there are n lines each representing a student's marks. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from '1' to '9'.\n\n- For each subject (from 0 to m-1), iterate through all students and find the maximum mark. Then, count how many students have that maximum. If the count is 1, then that single student is the best in that subject. Otherwise, no one is the best.\n\nWait, no. Because if more than one student has the maximum, then no one is the best. So for a subject, the best exists only if exactly one student has the maximum.\n\nSo, for each subject, collect all the marks, find the max, count how many times it occurs. If count is 1, note that student as the best in that subject.\n\nOnce we've processed all subjects, for each student, check if they are the best in at least one subject.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. Let's see: the first line is like '3 3\\n', then the next lines are the students. Wait, the sample input shows the first line as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'], which suggests that the input is provided as a list of strings, each representing a line. But in reality, the input is read via standard input, so perhaps the code should process each line correctly.\n\nIn Python, when reading from stdin, we can read lines using input(). But sometimes, when pasting, the trailing newlines may cause issues. So perhaps, the code should process each line, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nRead n and m from the first line.\n\nThen, for each of the next n lines, read the string, which represents the m marks for a student.\n\nFor each student, store their marks as a list of integers or characters—maybe as integers.\n\nWait, the marks are given as characters, so '2' is 2, etc. So for each row, we can convert each character into an integer.\n\nSo, for each student, their marks are stored as a list of integers.\n\nThen, for each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n\n- Collect all the marks of the students in this subject.\n\n- Find the maximum mark.\n\n- Count how many students have this maximum.\n\n- If the count is 1, then the corresponding student is the best in this subject.\n\nWe need to track for each subject j which student is the best (if any).\n\nSo, perhaps create a list of size m, where each element is the index of the student who is the best in that subject, or -1 if none.\n\nOnce we have this list, for each student, we check if any of the positions in the list is equal to their index. If yes, they are successful.\n\nAlternatively, for each student, keep track of whether they are the best in any subject.\n\nSo, for each subject j:\n\n- Iterate over all students, get their mark for j.\n\n- Find the maximum mark among all students for j.\n\n- Check how many students have this mark.\n\n- If exactly one, then that student is the best for j.\n\nWe can represent the bests for each subject as a list, say best_in_subject[j] = student_index (if any).\n\nThen, for each student i, if they are in best_in_subject for any j, increment the count.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nInitialize a list called best_in_subject, size m, initialized to -1.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Then, read each student's marks.\n2. **Track Best Students per Subject**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark and check if only one student has that mark. If so, record that student as the best in that subject.\n3. **Count Successful Students**: For each student, check if they are the best in any subject. Count such students as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    marks = list(map(int, list(line)))\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subject = [-1] * m  # Each subject may have 0 or 1 best student\n\nfor subject in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    best_student = -1\n    count_max = 0\n    for student in range(n):\n        mark = students[student][subject]\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n            best_student = student\n            count_max = 1\n        elif mark == max_mark:\n            count_max += 1\n    if count_max == 1:\n        best_in_subject[subject] = best_student\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor student in range(n):\n    for subject in range(m):\n        if best_in_subject[subject] == student:\n            successful += 1\n            break\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line gives the number of students `n` and subjects `m`. Each subsequent line represents a student's marks across all subjects.\n2. **Finding Best Student per Subject**: For each subject, iterate through all students to find the maximum mark. Track how many students have this maximum mark. If exactly one student has the maximum, record them as the best in that subject.\n3. **Counting Success**: For each student, check if they are the best in any subject by comparing against the recorded best students for each subject. If they are, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the number of successful students by leveraging simple iteration and tracking mechanisms.",
