Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about candles and figuring out how many hours they can burn for. The process goes like this: each candle burns for an hour and then goes out. But Vasily is smart because he can take 'b' number of burned-out candles and make a new one. So the question is, what's the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let's think about the example given. For instance, when a is 4 and b is 2, the output is 7. How does that work? \n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Now he has 4 stubs. He can exchange them for 4/2 = 2 new candles. Burning those adds 2 more hours, making total 6. Now he has 2 stubs left from these. But wait, 2 is equal to b, so he can make another candle. That's one more hour, bringing the total to 7. Oh right, because after burning the two candles, he gets 2 more stubs, which again give him one candle, adding another hour. Wait, no—wait, wait. Let me recount:\n\nInitial 4 burn → 4 hours. Then 4 stubs → 2 new, which gives 2 hours (total 6). Now he has 2 stubs from those 2 candles. So he can make 1 new candle, burn it for 1 hour (total 7), and now he has 1 stub. Since 1 is less than b=2, he can't make any more. So yes, 7.\n\nSo the approach is to sum all the possible hours by continuously converting stubs into new candles as long as there are enough stubs.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial a candles.\n2. Each time, the current number of stubs is divided by b to get the new candles added.\n3. The total hours increase by the number of new candles burned.\n4. The remaining stubs are (current stubs % b) + the new stubs from the just-burned candles.\n\nWait, no. Because when you make new candles from stubs, you use up those stubs and then burn the new ones, adding their count to the total and producing new stubs.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- total_hours = 0\n- stubs = a\n\nBecause the initial a candles will burn, adding a hours, and leaving a stubs.\n\nThen, while stubs >= b:\n   new_candles = stubs // b\n   total_hours += new_candles\n   stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles  # because each new candle produces one stub after burning.\n\nRepeat until stubs < b.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Let me test it with the sample.\n\nSample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nstubs =4\ntotal=0\n\nstubs >=2? Yes.\n\nnew_candles=4//2=2. total becomes 2.\n\nstubs =4%2=0 + 2 =2.\n\nAgain, stubs=2 >=2.\n\nnew_candles=2//2=1. total is 3.\n\nstubs =0 +1=1 <2. So stop.\n\nTotal is 4+2+1=7.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother sample: a=6, b=3.\n\nstubs=6. total=0.\n\nstubs >=3: yes.\n\nnew=6//3=2. total=6+2=8.\n\nstubs=6%3=0 +2=2 <3. So total is 8.\n\nWhich matches the second example.\n\nSo the plan is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe'll read a and b from input. Compute the total as per the algorithm.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if a is 1 and b is 2? Then initial stubs=1. Since 1 <2, no new candles. So total is 1.\n\nIf a is 5, b=5: initial 5 stubs.\n\nnew_candles=1. Total becomes 5+1=6.\n\nstubs:5%5=0 +1=1 <5. So done. Total 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nFirst iteration: 10//3=3. total=10+3=13.\n\nstubs:10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nSecond iteration:4//3=1. total=14.\n\nstubs:1+1=2 <3. So total 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b.\n\nInitialize stubs =a, total=0.\n\nLoop:\n\nwhile stubs >=b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nEnd loop.\n\nPrint total.\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nstubs = a\ntotal = 0\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nInput 4 2: code computes 4 -> 2, stubs become 2, then 2->1, stubs become 1. Total is 4+2+1=7.\n\nSecond sample:6 3. 6//3=2, stubs 0+2=2. 2<3, so total is 6+2=8.\n\nAll seems correct.\n\nWhat about when a is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, a is at least 1, so no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=2.\n\nInitial stubs 3: can make 1 new, total 3+1=4.\n\nStubs after: 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nNext, 2//2=1. total 5.\n\nStubs: 0+1=1 <2. So total 5.\n\nWait, let's compute manually:\n\nCandles:3 burn for 3 hours. Stubs:3.\n\nMake 1 candle, burn for 1h (total 4). Stubs:1 (from original) +1=2.\n\nMake another 1 candle, burn for 1h (total 5). Stubs:2-2=0 +1=1.\n\nSo yes, 5 is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the solution should be to implement this logic.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can create new candles from the stubs of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`.\n2. **Burn Candles**: Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a stub.\n3. **Recycle Stubs**: Convert the stubs into new candles by dividing the total number of stubs by `b`. Each time you can create `new_candles` from `stubs`, add these new candles to the total hours, and update the stubs count.\n4. **Repeat**: Continue recycling stubs until there are not enough stubs left to make a new candle (`stubs < b`).\n\nThe algorithm efficiently calculates the total hours by iterating and converting stubs into new candles whenever possible, ensuring optimal use of resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nstubs = a\ntotal = 0\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`.\n- **Initialization**: We start with `a` candles and initialize the total hours to 0.\n- **Loop to Recycle Stubs**: While there are enough stubs to make at least one new candle, calculate how many new candles can be made, add these to the total hours, and update the stubs count with the remainder plus the new stubs from the just-burned candles.\n- **Output Result**: Once no more new candles can be made, print the total hours.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of hours the candles can keep the room illuminated by efficiently recycling stubs into new candles whenever possible.",
