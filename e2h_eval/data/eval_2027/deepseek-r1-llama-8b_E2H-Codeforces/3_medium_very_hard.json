    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l in length. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d so that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, let's think about the input. The first line gives n and l. Then the next line has n integers, each representing the position of a lantern ai.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input, there are 7 lanterns at positions 15,5,3,7,9,14,0 on a street of length 15. The output is 2.5. Another sample is when two lanterns are both at 2 and 5 on a street of length 5. The minimal d is 2, because the first covers [0,4] and the second covers [3,5], together covering the entire street.\n\nAlright, so how do we approach this?\n\nI think the key is to model the problem as covering intervals. Each lantern, when given a radius d, will cover an interval [ai - d, ai + d], but this interval must not go beyond 0 or l. So the effective coverage is from max(0, ai-d) to min(l, ai+d).\n\nOur task is to choose d such that the union of all these intervals is exactly [0, l]. We want the smallest possible d where this is true.\n\nBut since d is what we're trying to find, perhaps a binary search approach would work. Because as d increases, the coverage intervals expand, and the minimal d is the smallest value where the union covers the entire street.\n\nYes, binary search makes sense here. We can perform a binary search on possible d values. For each candidate d, check if all parts of the street are covered by at least one lantern.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. This might help in efficiently determining coverage gaps.\n2. Use binary search over possible d values.\n3. For each d, simulate the coverage of all lanterns and see if the entire street is covered.\n4. Adjust the binary search bounds based on whether the current d is sufficient or not.\n\nWait, but how do we efficiently check if the street is covered for a given d? Let's think.\n\nEach lantern's coverage is [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)]. The union of all these intervals must include [0, l].\n\nAn alternative way: the entire street is covered if the leftmost coverage starts before the right ends after considering all the lanterns.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to sort the lanterns' positions. Then, for a given d, compute the merged coverage intervals and see if they cover the entire [0, l].\n\nWait, but merging the intervals could be computationally expensive if done naively for each binary step. But since n is up to 1000, and binary steps are say 50, then 1000 * 50 = 50,000 operations, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think.\n\nAnother idea: the minimal required d is determined by the maximum distance between consecutive points in some sorted list, possibly including the edges (0 and l). Because the coverage needs to bridge any gaps between lanterns.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of the distances between adjacent points in a sorted list that includes 0 and l. Let me explain.\n\nImagine that all lantern positions are sorted, and we add 0 and l to the list as virtual lanterns. Then, for each pair of consecutive points in this expanded list, we compute the distance. The minimal d must be at least half of the maximum such distance. Because for each gap between two consecutive points, a lantern somewhere in that region needs to cover the gap when d is large enough.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nSuppose we have points a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, sorted. Also, consider 0 and l as part of the sorted list. So the list is s = [0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, l], sorted.\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive points in s, say s_i and s_j (j = i+1), the distance is s_j - s_i. To cover this gap, at least one lantern must be within d of either s_i or s_j.\n\nWait, no. Because for the gap between s_i and s_j, the union of the coverage of the lanterns must cover this entire gap. So, the furthest point in the coverage of the lanterns on the left (s_i) and the furthest on the right (s_j) must meet or overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps for each such gap between two points (say, between s_i and s_j), the minimal required d is determined by the distance between s_i and s_j, divided by two. Because if a lantern is placed at s_i, then it can cover up to s_i + d, and similarly for s_j. Wait, no, perhaps that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe for each consecutive pair in s, the minimal required d is the maximum of (s_j - s_i)/2. Because the minimal d needed to cover the gap is when the coverage from s_i reaches s_j. So s_i + d >= s_j, which implies d >= s_j - s_i. But wait, that's the same as the distance between s_i and s_j. That can't be, because that would make d larger than necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's take an example.\n\nIn the second sample input, the lanterns are at 2 and 5, and l is 5. So the sorted list with 0 and 5 is [0,2,5]. The gaps are between 0 and 2 (distance 2), and between 2 and 5 (distance 3). For each gap, the minimal d must satisfy that for each gap, the sum of the d from the left endpoint and the d from the right endpoint is at least the gap distance.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nBetween 0 and 2, the coverage from 0 (if it's a lantern) is [0, d], and the coverage from 2 is [2-d, 2+d]. The gap between them is 2, so the maximum of (2 - (0 + d)) should be <= 0. Or wait, perhaps the coverage of 0 must reach into the next interval.\n\nWait, perhaps for each gap between s_i and s_{i+1}, the minimal d is the maximum of (s_{i+1} - s_i) / 2, because that's the minimal d needed so that the coverage from the left lantern (if any) and the right lantern (if any) overlap.\n\nWait, let's think of the first sample. The lanterns are at 0,3,5,7,9,14,15. The street is 15. So the sorted list with 0 and 15 is [0,0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The gaps are between 0-0 (0), 0-3 (3), 3-5 (2), etc.\n\nFor each gap, calculate the maximum distance between consecutive points, then for each such distance, the minimal d must be at least half of that distance. Because otherwise, the coverage from the left lantern doesn't reach the right lantern.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of (s_{i+1} - s_i) / 2 across all consecutive points in the sorted list including 0 and l.\n\nWait, let's test this idea with the samples.\n\nFirst sample: the maximum gap is between 14 and 15, which is 1. Half of that is 0.5. But the sample output is 2.5. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nHmm, that suggests my initial idea was wrong. So perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: model the problem as finding the minimal d such that for every point x on the street, there exists a lantern ai where |x - ai| <= d.\n\nThis is equivalent to the union of all [ai -d, ai +d] intervals covering [0, l].\n\nTo find the minimal d where this holds.\n\nBinary search seems like a feasible approach. So:\n\n- The lower bound for d is 0. The upper bound can be l/2, because if all lanterns are at 0, then d has to be l/2 to cover up to l.\n\nWait, but maybe the upper bound can be higher. Alternatively, the worst case is when all lanterns are at one end, requiring d = l to cover the entire street, but that's only if n=1. So perhaps setting the upper bound as l is sufficient.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n\n2. Binary search on d. For each candidate d, check if the entire street is covered.\n\n3. The minimal such d is the answer.\n\nNow, how to check if a given d covers the entire street.\n\nFor each lantern ai, the coverage is [ai -d, ai +d], but clipped to [0, l].\n\nWe can compute all these intervals, merge them, and check if their union covers [0, l].\n\nBut merging intervals for each binary step could be O(n log n) time, which is acceptable for n=1000 and binary steps of 50, giving 50,000 steps.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the coverage as the maximum start and minimum end of the intervals. Wait, no, because the intervals can be disjoint.\n\nWait, another idea: the earliest point covered is the minimal (ai -d) but not less than 0, and the latest point is the maximal (ai +d) but not more than l. But that's not sufficient because there might be a gap between the end of one interval and the start of another.\n\nSo, to correctly determine if all points are covered, we need to process all the intervals and see if their union is [0, l].\n\nProcessing all intervals for each d during the binary search may be the way to go.\n\nSo, to implement the check:\n\nFor a given d:\n\n- For each lantern ai, compute the interval [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)].\n- Collect all these intervals.\n- Merge them into non-overlapping intervals.\n- Check if the merged intervals cover [0, l].\n\nIf yes, then d is sufficient; else, it's not.\n\nSo, for the binary search:\n\n- Initialize low = 0, high = l (since that's the maximum possible d needed).\n- For each mid = (low + high)/2, check if the entire street is covered.\n- If yes, try to find a smaller d by setting high = mid.\n- If no, set low = mid.\n\nContinue until low and high converge to a certain precision (like 1e-9).\n\nNow, how to implement the interval merging.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n\n2. For each lantern, compute its coverage interval.\n\n3. Sort these intervals by their start points.\n\n4. Merge overlapping or adjacent intervals.\n\n5. After merging, check if the first interval starts at 0 and the last ends at l.\n\nWait, but the intervals may be in any order. So, the process is:\n\n- Collect all intervals, each as a tuple (start, end), where start = max(0, ai -d), end = min(l, ai +d).\n\n- Sort these intervals by their start.\n\n- Merge overlapping or touching intervals.\n\n- The merged list's first interval's start must be <= 0, but since the start is computed as max(0, ...), it's at least 0.\n\n- The merged list's last interval's end must be >= l.\n\nWait, but the start of the merged list is 0, and the end is l.\n\nWait, no. Because after merging, the intervals are continuous. So, the first interval's start is 0, and the last interval's end is l.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Suppose in the merged list, the first interval starts at 0, but the last ends before l. Then, the street isn't fully covered.\n\nSo the condition is that the merged intervals' union covers [0, l]. So the first interval's start must be <=0 and the last interval's end >=l.\n\nBut since the intervals are computed as [max(0, ...), min(l, ...)], the first interval's start is >=0, and the last's end is <= l.\n\nSo the merged intervals' first interval's start is 0, and the last's end is l.\n\nWait, not exactly. For example, if all intervals are [0, d], then the merged would be [0, d], which doesn't cover l unless d = l.\n\nSo, the merged intervals may consist of multiple intervals, but together they must cover 0 to l.\n\nThus, the merged intervals must form a single contiguous block starting at 0 and ending at l.\n\nSo, to check:\n\nAfter merging, the first interval's start is 0, and the last interval's end is l.\n\nSo, during the merging step, we can track whether the union covers from 0 to l.\n\nAlternatively, the merged intervals should collectively form a single interval [0, l].\n\nSo, the algorithm for checking is:\n\n- Compute all intervals.\n\n- Sort them by start.\n\n- Merge overlapping or adjacent intervals.\n\n- If the merged list's first interval is [0, x], and the last is [y, l], and x >= y, then the street is covered.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, suppose we have two intervals [0,5] and [10,15], and l=15. Then the merged list is [[0,5], [10,15]]. The union doesn't cover the entire street, because 5 <10.\n\nSo, the condition is that the merged intervals' start is 0 and their end is l, and that they form a single continuous interval.\n\nSo, during the merge, the first interval's start is 0, and the last interval's end is l.\n\nAlternatively, after merging, the total coverage is from 0 to l.\n\nSo, in code, for a given d, we can generate all intervals, sort, merge, and then check if the first interval starts at 0 and the last ends at l, and also that the merged intervals are contiguous.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to collect all the intervals, sort them, then check whether the maximum start is 0, the minimum end is l, and that the intervals are connected without gaps.\n\nAlternatively, the merged intervals can be represented as a list where the first interval starts at 0, and each subsequent interval starts where the previous ended.\n\nSo, during the merging process, we can track the current end, and if the next interval starts before or equal to the current end, we merge them into a larger interval.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo, here's the plan for the check function:\n\nGiven d:\n\n1. Generate all intervals: for each ai, compute [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)].\n\n2. Sort these intervals by their start.\n\n3. Merge the intervals:\n\n   a. Initialize a list 'merged' with the first interval.\n\n   b. For each subsequent interval in the sorted list:\n\n      i. Compare the current interval's start with the end of the last merged interval.\n\n      ii. If the current interval's start <= last merged end, merge them into a new interval with start = last merged start and end = max(last merged end, current end).\n\n      iii. Else, add the current interval as a new entry in 'merged'.\n\n4. After merging, check if the merged list contains exactly one interval that starts at 0 and ends at l.\n\n   Or, more precisely, check if the merged list's first interval starts at 0, and the last ends at l, and that the intervals are contiguous.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient. For example, if the merged list is [0,5], [6, l], then the union is the entire street, but the merged list has two intervals.\n\nSo, during the merging, if any interval in the middle starts before the end of the previous, they get merged. Otherwise, they are separate.\n\nSo, after merging, the merged list may have multiple intervals, but as long as the union covers [0, l], it's okay.\n\nSo, the check is: the first interval's start is 0, the last's end is l, and the union of the merged intervals is [0, l].\n\nBut how to represent that.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to do it is:\n\nCompute all intervals, sort them, then check if the first interval starts at 0, and the last ends at l, and the union of all intervals is [0, l].\n\nAlternatively, the merged intervals must form a single interval from 0 to l.\n\nSo, during the merging, if the first interval starts at 0 and the last ends at l, then it's covered.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the merged intervals have more than one interval.\n\nWait, no. Because if the merged intervals have more than one, then the union is not [0, l], but perhaps in some cases it is.\n\nWait, for example, if all the intervals are [0, l], then the merged list is one interval. But if some intervals are within [0, l], but others are outside, the merged list could have more than one interval.\n\nWait, no. Because each interval is computed as [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)], so all intervals are within [0, l].\n\nSo, the merged intervals are all within [0, l], but may consist of multiple intervals if some lanterns' coverage doesn't overlap with others.\n\nSo, the merged list can have multiple intervals, but as long as their union is [0, l], it's okay.\n\nTherefore, the correct way to check is to see if the first interval starts at 0, the last ends at l, and that all points between 0 and l are covered.\n\nBut that's redundant because the intervals are all within [0, l], so if the first starts at 0 and the last ends at l, then the entire street is covered.\n\nWait, no. Because the first interval might start at 0, but the next interval starts at 5, leaving a gap between 0 and 5.\n\nSo, the merged list may have multiple intervals, but the first starts at 0, the last ends at l, but there are gaps in between.\n\nThus, to correctly determine coverage, the merged list must have a single interval [0, l], or the first interval starts at 0, the last ends at l, and the intervals are contiguous.\n\nWait, but how to model that.\n\nPerhaps, the correct condition is:\n\nAfter merging, the first interval starts at 0, the last ends at l, and the union of all intervals is [0, l].\n\nBut since the intervals are all within [0, l], if the first starts at 0 and the last ends at l, and the merged list is a single interval, then it's covered.\n\nWait, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nWait, for example, if the merged list has two intervals, [0,5] and [6, l], then the first starts at 0 and the last ends at l, but the union doesn't cover the entire street. So, this is a false positive.\n\nThus, the check is not sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAfter merging, the merged list must consist of a single interval [0, l].\n\nHow can we determine that?\n\nWell, during the merging process, if the first interval's start is 0, and the last interval's end is l, and the merged list has only one interval, then it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, during the merging, we can track the current coverage, ensuring that after processing all intervals, the coverage is from 0 to l.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nInitialize the current_start as 0, current_end as 0.\n\nFor each interval in the sorted list:\n\n   if the interval's start > current_end: then we have a gap. So the coverage is incomplete.\n\n   else: current_end = max(current_end, interval's end).\n\nAt the end, if current_end >= l, then the entire street is covered.\n\nWait, this seems promising.\n\nLet me test this logic.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nn=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nd=2.\n\nEach lantern's coverage is:\n\nLantern at 2: [0,4]\n\nLantern at 5: [3,5]\n\nSorted intervals: [0,4], [3,5].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_start = 0, current_end =0.\n\nTake first interval [0,4]: start <= current_end (0 <=0). So current_end becomes max(0,4) =4.\n\nNext interval [3,5]: 3 <=4. So current_end becomes max(4,5)=5.\n\nNow, after processing all intervals, current_end is 5, which equals l=5. So the street is covered.\n\nAnother example: in the first sample, let's say d=2.5.\n\nLanterns are at 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nEach lantern's coverage is:\n\n0: [0, 2.5]\n\n3: [0.5,5.5]\n\n5: [2.5,7.5]\n\n7: [4.5, 9.5]\n\n9: [6.5, 11.5] → but l is 15, so min(15, 11.5) → 11.5.\n\n14: [11.5,16.5] → min is 15.\n\n15: [12.5,17.5] → min is 15.\n\nSo the intervals are:\n\n[0,2.5], [0.5,5.5], [2.5,7.5], [4.5,9.5], [6.5,11.5], [11.5,15], [12.5,15].\n\nSort them:\n\n0.0 → 2.5\n\n0.5 →5.5\n\n2.5 →7.5\n\n4.5 →9.5\n\n6.5 →11.5\n\n11.5 →15\n\n12.5 →15.\n\nNow, process them:\n\ncurrent_start=0, current_end=0.\n\nFirst interval [0,2.5]: start 0 <= current_end 0. So current_end becomes 2.5.\n\nSecond interval [0.5,5.5]: 0.5 <=2.5 → current_end becomes 5.5.\n\nThird interval [2.5,7.5]: 2.5 <=5.5 → current_end becomes 7.5.\n\nFourth interval [4.5,9.5]: 4.5 <=7.5 → current_end becomes 9.5.\n\nFifth interval [6.5,11.5]: 6.5 <=9.5 → current_end becomes 11.5.\n\nSixth interval [11.5,15]: 11.5 <=11.5 → current_end becomes 15.\n\nSeventh interval [12.5,15]: 12.5 <=15 → current_end remains 15.\n\nAfter processing all, current_end is 15, which is equal to l=15. So the street is covered.\n\nAnother example: if the merged intervals have a gap.\n\nLike, for a lantern at 0 and 5, and d=2.\n\nCoverage intervals: [0,2] and [3,7].\n\nBut l=7.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_start=0, current_end=0.\n\nFirst interval [0,2]: 0 <=0 → current_end becomes 2.\n\nNext interval [3,7]: 3>2 → so there's a gap. Thus, the coverage is incomplete.\n\nThus, the condition current_end >= l is not met, so the check returns false.\n\nSo, the correct condition is:\n\nAfter processing all intervals in order, the current_end must be >= l.\n\nYes, this seems to capture all cases.\n\nThus, the steps for the check function are:\n\n1. For each lantern, compute its coverage as [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)].\n\n2. Sort these intervals by their start.\n\n3. Initialize current_end = 0.\n\n4. Iterate through each interval in the sorted list:\n\n   a. If the interval's start > current_end → return False (gap found).\n\n   b. Else, update current_end to be the maximum of current_end and the interval's end.\n\n5. After all intervals, if current_end >= l → return True, else False.\n\nSo, now the binary search can proceed as follows.\n\nImplementing this in code:\n\nWe'll read the input, process the lanterns, sort them, then perform binary search.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each binary step, we need to compute all intervals, sort them, and perform the check.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps the lanterns don't need to be sorted beforehand, because for each d, we compute the intervals, then sort them.\n\nBut for n=1000, sorting 1000 elements is negligible.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nDefine a function is_covered(d):\n\n   intervals = []\n\n   for ai in a_i:\n\n       start = max(0, ai -d)\n\n       end = min(l, ai +d)\n\n       intervals.append( (start, end) )\n\n   # Sort intervals by start\n\n   intervals.sort()\n\n   current_end = 0\n\n   for (s, e) in intervals:\n\n       if s > current_end:\n\n           return False\n\n       current_end = max(current_end, e)\n\n   return current_end >= l\n\nThen, perform binary search between low=0 and high=l.\n\nBut since l can be up to 1e9, using floating-point numbers is necessary, and we need to be precise to 1e-9.\n\nSo, the binary search will loop until high - low is less than a small epsilon, say 1e-10.\n\nWait, but in practice, for each step, the required precision is 1e-9, so we can stop when high - low < 1e-9.\n\nAlternatively, perform a fixed number of iterations, like 100, which is sufficient for 1e-30 precision.\n\nSo, the code could be structured as follows:\n\nlow = 0.0\n\nhigh = l\n\nfor _ in range(100):\n\n   mid = (low + high) / 2\n\n   if is_covered(mid):\n\n       high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n       low = mid\n\nThen, print high.\n\nWait, but the initial high can be l, but perhaps the minimal d is smaller. So the binary search should adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the minimal d is 2.5, which is l/6 (since l is 15, 15/6=2.5). Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nBut the binary search will find the minimal d correctly.\n\nTesting the sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, l=15.\n\nLanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nSo a_i sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nWhen d=2.5:\n\nEach lantern's coverage:\n\n0: [0, 2.5]\n\n3: [0.5,5.5]\n\n5: [2.5,7.5]\n\n7: [4.5,9.5]\n\n9: [6.5, 11.5]\n\n14: [11.5,16.5] → but min is 15.\n\n15: [12.5,17.5] → min is 15.\n\nSo the intervals are:\n\n[0,2.5], [0.5,5.5], [2.5,7.5], [4.5,9.5], [6.5,11.5], [11.5,15], [12.5,15].\n\nSorting them:\n\n0.0 → 2.5\n\n0.5 →5.5\n\n2.5 →7.5\n\n4.5 →9.5\n\n6.5 →11.5\n\n11.5 →15\n\n12.5 →15.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_end starts at 0.\n\nFirst interval: 0.0 ≤0 → current_end=2.5.\n\nSecond: 0.5 ≤2.5 → current_end=5.5.\n\nThird: 2.5 ≤5.5 → current_end=7.5.\n\nFourth:4.5 ≤7.5 → current_end=9.5.\n\nFifth:6.5 ≤9.5 → current_end=11.5.\n\nSixth:11.5 ≤11.5 → current_end=15.\n\nSeventh:12.5 ≤15 → current_end remains 15.\n\nAfter all, current_end is 15 ≥15 → covered.\n\nThus, the function returns True.\n\nSo, the binary search will find that d=2.5 is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n1. All lanterns are at 0: the minimal d is l.\n\nBecause the coverage for each lantern is [0, d]. So, to cover up to l, d must be l.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for a single lantern at 0, the coverage is [0, d]. To cover the entire street, d must be l. So, yes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, ai= l. Then d must be l.\n\nAnother case: n=1, ai=0. Then d must be l.\n\nAnother case: n=2, ai=0 and l. Then d must be l/2.\n\nBecause 0's coverage is [0, d], and l's coverage is [l -d, l]. So, to cover the entire street, the coverage from 0 must reach d >= l, but that's impossible. Wait, no. Wait, 0's coverage is [0, d], and l's is [l-d, l]. The maximum of (l - (0 +d)) must be <=0. So, l -d <=0 → d >= l.\n\nBut that's not correct because that would require d = l, but in that case, the coverage of 0 is [0,l], which covers everything.\n\nWait, no, in that case, if ai=0 and ai=l, then for d= l/2:\n\n0's coverage is [0, l/2], and l's is [l - l/2, l] → [l/2, l]. So the combined coverage is [0, l/2] U [l/2, l] = [0, l]. So d can be l/2.\n\nSo, the minimal d is l/2.\n\nAh, so the earlier approach of considering the maximum of (s_j - s_i)/2 is correct in this case.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of (s_j - s_i)/2 for all consecutive points in the sorted list including 0 and l.\n\nWait, that's an interesting observation. So, perhaps instead of binary search, we can compute the minimal d as the maximum of (s_j - s_i)/2 for all consecutive points in the sorted list.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nsorted list is [0,2,5].\n\nGaps are 2 and 3. The maximum is 3. Divide by 2 → 1.5.\n\nBut the minimal d is 2.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of (s_j - s_i) / 2, but only when s_j is the next point.\n\nWait, no. In the second sample, the maximum gap is 3 (between 2 and 5), so (3)/2 = 1.5. But the minimal d is 2.\n\nHmm, so that approach doesn't hold.\n\nThus, binary search seems to be the way to go.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, ai=0. Then, the minimal d is l, because the coverage is [0, l].\n\nWait, no. Because if ai=0 and d is l, the coverage is [0, l], which covers the entire street.\n\nBut if ai=0 and d is less than l, the coverage is [0, d], which doesn't cover the rest of the street.\n\nThus, the minimal d is l.\n\nSo, the binary search approach correctly finds this.\n\nAnother case: n=2, ai=0 and l. Then, the minimal d is l/2, as earlier.\n\nSo, binary search will correctly find that.\n\nSo, the binary search approach seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the intervals are built as a list of tuples, sorted, then processed.\n\nNow, regarding the binary search:\n\nWe'll perform a binary search over the possible d values.\n\nThe initial low is 0.0, high is l.\n\nWe'll loop for a fixed number of times, say 100, which is sufficient for 1e-30 precision.\n\nIn each iteration, compute mid = (low + high)/2.\n\nCheck if the entire street is covered with this d.\n\nIf yes, set high = mid.\n\nElse, set low = mid.\n\nAfter the loop, high is the minimal d.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the initial high is too big, but it's sufficient because even if high is set to l initially, the binary search will find the correct minimal d.\n\nTesting the binary search:\n\nIn the second sample, the correct d is 2.\n\nBinary search steps:\n\nlow=0, high=5.\n\nmid=2.5.\n\nCheck is_covered(2.5) → returns True.\n\nSet high=2.5.\n\nNext mid=(0+2.5)/2=1.25.\n\nCheck is_covered(1.25): the intervals are [0,1.25], [2.75,5].\n\nMerging:\n\ncurrent_end starts at 0.\n\nFirst interval [0,1.25]: current_end=1.25.\n\nNext interval [2.75,5]: 2.75 >1.25 → gap detected. So returns False.\n\nThus, set low=1.25.\n\nNext mid= (1.25 +2.5)/2=1.875.\n\nCheck is_covered(1.875):\n\nEach lantern's coverage:\n\nai=2: [0.125, 3.875]\n\nai=5: [3.125, 5.875].\n\nIntervals:\n\n[0.125,3.875], [3.125,5.875].\n\nSorted.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_end=0.\n\nFirst interval: 0.125>0 → no, because 0.125>0 → current_end=0.125.\n\nWait, no. The first interval's start is 0.125. Since 0.125>0 (current_end=0), so it's a gap. Thus, returns False.\n\nSo, set low=1.875.\n\nMid becomes (1.875+2.5)/2=2.1875.\n\nCheck is_covered(2.1875):\n\nai=2: [0, 4.1875]\n\nai=5: [2.8125,5.1875].\n\nIntervals sorted as [0,4.1875], [2.8125,5.1875].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_end=0.\n\nFirst interval starts at 0 → current_end becomes4.1875.\n\nNext interval starts at 2.8125 ≤4.1875 → current_end becomes5.1875.\n\nWhich is >=5.

Each lantern lights up all points within a distance \\( d \\) from it.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using binary search to efficiently find the minimum radius \\( d \\). The key steps are:\n\n1. **Binary Search Setup**: We initialize the binary search with `low` set to 0 and `high` set to \\( l \\), the length of the street.\n2. **Coverage Check Function**: For each candidate radius \\( d \\) during the binary search, we check if all points on the street are covered by the lanterns. This is done by:\n   - Generating intervals for each lantern based on the current \\( d \\).\n   - Sorting these intervals by their start points.\n   - Merging overlapping or adjacent intervals and checking if they collectively cover the entire street.\n3. **Adjusting Search Range**: Based on whether the current \\( d \\) covers the entire street, adjust the binary search range to narrow down the minimum \\( d \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = float(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    def is_covered(d):\n        intervals = []\n        for ai in a:\n            s = max(0.0, ai - d)\n            e = min(l, ai + d)\n            intervals.append((s, e))\n        intervals.sort()\n        current_end = 0.0\n        for s, e in intervals:\n            if s > current_end:\n                return False\n            current_end = max(current_end, e)\n        return current_end >= l\n    \n    low = 0.0\n    high = l\n    for _ in range(100):\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if is_covered(mid):\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(high))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Binary Search**: The binary search is used to efficiently find the minimum \\( d \\) by repeatedly narrowing the range of possible values.\n- **Coverage Check**: For each midpoint \\( d \\) during the binary search, we generate intervals for each lantern, sort them, merge overlapping intervals, and check if the merged intervals cover the entire street.\n- **Efficiency**: The approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum \\( d \\) with a precision of up to \\( 10^{-9} \\) by iterating a fixed number of times (100 iterations), which is sufficient for achieving the required precision.\n\nThis method ensures that we handle all edge cases and efficiently determine the minimum radius needed to light the entire street.",
