He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or suffix of the original string s. Each string is either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S), and I need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's in the order of the input.\n\nHmm, the input has 2n-2 strings, each of which is either a prefix or a suffix of length 1 to n-1. The goal is to assign each one as P or S correctly.\n\nWait, but how? Because some prefixes might overlap with suffixes, right? So I need to find a way to determine which are prefixes and which are suffixes based on their possible positions in the original string.\n\nLet me think about the structure. For each possible candidate string s, all the prefixes and suffixes must fit into it. But since I don't know s, I have to find a way to group the given strings into prefixes and suffixes such that for some s, all the prefixes are indeed the first k characters and the suffixes are the last k characters.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find all possible s that could satisfy the given prefixes and suffixes. Once I find such an s, I can then assign each string as P or S based on whether they match the corresponding prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut wait, the problem says it's guaranteed that there exists at least one possible s. So my task is to find any such s, and then for each input string, decide if it's a prefix or a suffix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reconstruct s by finding the longest possible prefix and suffix chains.\n\nAnother thought: The original string s must have all the prefixes and suffixes as given. So for each position k, the k-length prefix is present, and the k-length suffix is present.\n\nWait, but the problem states that for each k from 1 to n-1, exactly two strings are provided—both a prefix and a suffix of length k.\n\nSo for each k, among the two strings for that length, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. But how do I know which is which?\n\nWait, for a given k, the prefix is the first k characters of s, and the suffix is the last k characters. So for each k, the two strings of length k must be equal only if the prefix and suffix are the same. Otherwise, they must be different.\n\nWait no. For example, in the first sample input, n=5:\n\nThe possible strings are 'ababa'. Its prefixes are a, ab, aba, abab. The suffixes are a, ba, aba, bab. So for k=3, the prefix is 'aba' and the suffix is 'aba'. So the two strings for k=3 are both 'aba', but in the input, they might be the same or different? Wait, no. The problem says that for each k, there are exactly two strings. But when the prefix and suffix are the same, then the two strings would be the same.\n\nWait, the problem statement says, \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\" So for each k, the two strings are either both prefixes, both suffixes, or one is a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because for each k, the two strings provided are the two possible candidates for the prefix and suffix. So for k=1, the two strings are the possible prefix and suffix of length 1. One of them is the first character, the other is the last. So they could be the same or different.\n\nSo the approach is to determine for each string whether it is a prefix or a suffix. How?\n\nHmm, perhaps I can model this by building possible s step by step.\n\nWait, another idea: the original string s must have the following property. For each k, the k-th prefix is a substring of the (k+1)-th prefix. Similarly, the (k+1)-th suffix must end with the k-th suffix.\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, for the entire string s, the i-th prefix is the first i characters, and the j-th suffix is the last j characters.\n\nSo for all possible prefixes and suffixes, the entire set must form a chain where each longer prefix starts with the previous, and each longer suffix ends with the previous.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the prefix of length m is the first m characters, which is the same as the prefix of length m-1 plus another character. Similarly for the suffix.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each possible k, collect all the strings of length k. There are two of them for each k.\n\n2. Among these, determine which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n3. Then, construct s step by step, ensuring that each step is consistent.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nWait, let's consider the k=1 case. There are two strings, say a and b. One is the first character, the other is the last.\n\nSo for s, the first character is either a or b, and the last is the other.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2, we have four strings (two for k=1, but grouped by k=2). Wait no, the input has 2n-2 strings. For n=5, that's 8 strings, each of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, but for each length, two strings.\n\nWait, no, for each k from 1 to n-1, there are two strings of length k. So for each k, two strings.\n\nSo for k=1, two strings.\n\nFor k=2, two more.\n\nAnd so on up to k = n-1.\n\nSo for each k, two strings.\n\nNow, for each k, the two strings can be the prefix and suffix of length k.\n\nWait, but for the actual s, the k-th prefix is the first k characters, and the k-th suffix is the last k characters.\n\nSo for each k, the two strings are either:\n\n- Both prefixes (but that's impossible because the k-th prefix is longer than the (k-1)-th, so for k >=2, the k-th prefix starts with the (k-1)-th prefix).\n\n- Or, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nNo, because for k=3, the prefix is the first three characters, which is the (k-1)-th prefix plus one character. Similarly, the suffix is the last three, which is the (k-1)-th suffix plus one character.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the suffix of length k is built from the end. So for the suffix of length k, it should be the same as the suffix of length k-1, but with an additional character added to the front.\n\nFor example, if the suffix of length 2 is 'ba', then the suffix of length 3 is 'aba' (if the third character from the end is 'a').\n\nSo, for each k, the k-th suffix must start with the (k-1)-th suffix.\n\nSimilarly, the k-th prefix must end with the (k-1)-th prefix.\n\nWait, no. Because the k-th prefix is the first k characters, so the (k-1)-th prefix is the first k-1, so the k-th is (k-1)-th plus one character.\n\nSo, the k-th prefix must start with the (k-1)-th prefix.\n\nSimilarly, the k-th suffix is the last k characters. The (k-1)-th suffix is the last k-1. So the k-th suffix is (k-1)-th suffix followed by one character, but that character comes before the (k-1)-th suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the prefixes and suffixes in terms of their possible overlaps.\n\nSo, for each k, the two strings of length k are either the prefix or the suffix.\n\nWe need to determine for each k which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nWait, but how? Because the choice for k affects the choices for k+1.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to build the prefix chain and the suffix chain.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\n- Start with k=1. The two strings for k=1 are possible candidates for the first and last character.\n\n- For each possible pair of first and last character (each could be one of the two strings for k=1), try to build the rest of the string.\n\n- For each candidate, check whether the longer prefixes and suffixes are consistent with the rest.\n\nIf at any point a contradiction is found, discard that candidate.\n\nOnce a valid candidate s is found, assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 100, this approach might be feasible.\n\nWait, but for each step, how many possibilities do we have?\n\nAt each step k, for the prefix, it must start with the (k-1)-length prefix.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffix, it must end with the (k-1)-length suffix.\n\nSo perhaps for each k, the two candidates for the k-length prefix and suffix can be checked against the previous steps.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the process by building the prefix and suffix chains.\n\nLet's try to model the prefix chain:\n\nprefix_1 must be a single character, which is the first character of s.\n\nprefix_2 must be prefix_1 plus one more character, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, suffix_1 is the last character, suffix_2 is the last two, etc.\n\nEach step, for each k, the two possible strings of length k can be considered as the prefix or the suffix.\n\nBut how to model the dependencies between k steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find for each k the possible options for the prefix and suffix.\n\nFor each k, the two strings of length k are either:\n\n- the prefix (so the (k-1)th prefix is its first k-1 characters)\n\n- the suffix (so the (k-1)th suffix is its last k-1 characters)\n\nSo for each k, we can consider the two possibilities for the prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, but the initial approach is getting complicated.\n\nAnother idea: Since the prefixes form a chain, the k-th prefix must be the (k-1)-th prefix plus one character. So, for each k, the two candidates for the k-th prefix must have the (k-1)-th prefix as their first k-1 characters.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffixes, the k-th suffix must be the (k-1)-th suffix plus one character at the beginning.\n\nWait, no. For the suffix, the k-th suffix is the last k characters. The (k-1)-th suffix is the last k-1. So the k-th suffix is (k-1)-th suffix followed by one character, but that character is the one before the (k-1)-th suffix.\n\nSo, the k-th suffix starts with the (k-1)-th suffix.\n\nWait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose s is \"abcde\".\n\nThen, the suffix of length 2 is \"de\", and the suffix of length 3 is \"cde\". So, the suffix of length 3 is the suffix of length 2 plus 'c' at the beginning.\n\nSo, yes, the k-th suffix is the (k-1)-th suffix with the next character added before it.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each k, the suffix of length k must be equal to the suffix of length k-1, prepended by the (n - (k-1))-th character of s.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, for each k, the suffix of length k is formed by taking the suffix of length k-1 and adding one character to the front. That character is the (n -k + 1)-th character of s.\n\nSo, for example, s = 'ababa' (n=5):\n\nsuffix_1 = 'a'\n\nsuffix_2 = 'ba' (add 'b' before 'a')\n\nsuffix_3 = 'aba' (add 'a' before 'ba')\n\nsuffix_4 = 'baba' (add 'b' before 'aba')\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, n=5, suffix_4 is the last four characters, which is 'baba'.\n\nWhich is the last three (aba) plus 'b' added before.\n\nYes, so suffix_k is the suffix_{k-1} with one character added to the front.\n\nSo, the way to model this is: for each k, the suffix is the suffix of k-1, plus the next character towards the beginning.\n\nSo, for the suffix chain, each step adds a character to the front.\n\nSo, for the suffix chain, the order is:\n\nsuff_1 = last char\n\nsuff_2 = suff_1's previous char + suff_1\n\nand so on.\n\nSo, for the suffix chain, the order is reversed.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit abstract.\n\nBut the key point is that for the suffix chain, each step builds upon the previous by adding a character to the front.\n\nSo, for the given strings, for each k, the two possible candidates for the suffix of length k must have the suffix of length k-1 as a suffix of themselves.\n\nBecause, when you add a character to the front of the suffix of k-1, you get the suffix of k.\n\nSo, for each k, the suffix of k must be a string that starts with the suffix of k-1.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of k is the last k characters, which includes the suffix of k-1 as the last k-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think of it differently. The suffix of length k is the last k characters of s.\n\nThe suffix of length k-1 is the last k-1 characters of s.\n\nSo, the suffix of length k is equal to the suffix of length k-1 plus the (n -k + 1)-th character.\n\nSo, the suffix of length k is the (n-k+1)th character concatenated with the suffix of length k-1.\n\nSo, for example, if the suffix of k-1 is 'ba', then the suffix of k is 'a' + 'ba' = 'aba' if the new character is 'a'.\n\nWait, no, wait. The new character is the (n -k +1)th character. For example, if s is 'ababa' (n=5), then for k=3, the suffix is 'aba', which is 'a' followed by 'ba' (the suffix of k=2).\n\nWait, so the suffix of k is the (n -k + 1)th character followed by the suffix of k-1.\n\nSo, for k=2, the suffix is 'ba' (last two chars), which is 'b' (from position 4) followed by 'a' (position 5).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the suffix of k as the next character (before the current suffix) plus the current suffix.\n\nSo, for each k, the suffix is built by taking the next character before the suffix of k-1 and adding it in front.\n\nSo, the suffix of k is next_char + suffix of k-1.\n\nThis makes sense because the suffix of k is the last k characters, which includes the last k-1 as the last part, plus the new character before that.\n\nSo, for the suffix chain, each step is built by adding a character to the front.\n\nThus, for the suffix chain, the order is:\n\nsuff_1: last character.\n\nsuff_2: (second last character) + suff_1.\n\nsuff_3: (third last character) + suff_2.\n\nand so on.\n\nSo, for each k, the suffix of length k is the (n -k)th character followed by the suffix of k-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index s from 0.\n\nLet me denote the string s as s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1].\n\nThen, the suffix of length 1 is s[n-1].\n\nSuffix of length 2 is s[n-2] + s[n-1].\n\nSuffix of length 3 is s[n-3] + s[n-2] + s[n-1].\n\nSo, yes, each step adds a character before the previous suffix.\n\nSo, for the suffix chain, each suffix of k is built by adding the (n -k)th character to the front of the suffix of k-1.\n\nSo, for each k, the suffix of k must be the (n -k)th character concatenated with the suffix of k-1.\n\nThus, for the given strings, for each k, the two possible candidates for the suffix of k must satisfy this condition.\n\nSo, for each k, the two candidates for the suffix of k must be such that one is equal to (some character) + the other.\n\nSimilarly, for the prefix chain, each prefix of k must be the prefix of k-1 plus a new character.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n   a. Collect the two strings of length k.\n\n   b. For each possible way to assign one as prefix and the other as suffix, check if the assignments are consistent with the previous steps.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, but manageable for n=100.\n\nWait, but how to model the state transitions.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the possible prefixes and suffixes as we build the string step by step.\n\nStart with k=1.\n\nFor k=1, the two strings are the possible first and last characters.\n\nWait, no. Because for k=1, the two strings are the two possible candidates for the first and last character.\n\nSo, for k=1, the possible options are:\n\n- The first character is a, the last is b.\n\n- The first is b, the last is a.\n\nSo, for each of these possibilities, we can try to build the rest of the string.\n\nOnce a possibility is chosen, we proceed to k=2.\n\nFor k=2, the two strings are the possible candidates for the prefix and suffix of length 2.\n\nEach of these must start with the previous prefix (for the prefix) and end with the previous suffix (for the suffix).\n\nWait, for the prefix of k=2, it must be the prefix of k=1 plus another character. So, for the prefix of k=2, it must start with the prefix of k=1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of k=2 must end with the suffix of k=1.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment of the two k=2 strings as prefix and suffix, we can check whether they are consistent with the previous steps.\n\nIf any assignment leads to a consistent solution, we can proceed.\n\nThis suggests a recursive approach, but for n up to 100, recursion depth could be an issue. So perhaps a dynamic programming approach is better.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to represent the current state as the current possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's manageable to model the possible current prefix and suffix for each k.\n\nWait, for each k, the prefix is built by adding a character to the previous prefix.\n\nSo, for k=1, the prefix is either a or b.\n\nFor k=2, the prefix must be the previous prefix plus a new character.\n\nSo, for each possible k=1 prefix, we can compute the possible k=2 prefix candidates, and see which of the two given options match.\n\nSimilarly for the suffix.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\nInitialize for k=1:\n\nPossible first characters are the two given options for k=1. Let's call them c1 and c2.\n\nSo, for each possible first character (c1 or c2), the last character is the other (since one is prefix, the other is suffix).\n\nWait, no. Because for k=1, the two strings are the possible first and last characters. So, if the first character is c1, the last is c2, and vice versa.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment of first and last character, we can proceed.\n\nFor each of these, we can build the possible prefixes and suffixes step by step.\n\nSo, for each possible first and last character:\n\n- Build the prefix chain:\n\n   For k=2, the prefix must be the first character (from k=1) plus some new character.\n\n   Among the two strings of length 2, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\n   Wait, but for k=2, the two strings are the possible prefix and suffix of length 2.\n\n   So, for the current first character (c1), the k=2 prefix is either s = c1 + s2, where s2 is the next character.\n\n   So, among the two possible strings for k=2, one must be equal to the k=1 prefix (c1) plus a new character.\n\n   Let's say the two options for k=2 are sA and sB.\n\n   If sA starts with c1, then sA could be the prefix of k=2.\n\n   Then, the suffix of k=2 must be either sA or sB.\n\n   But the suffix of k=2 must also be equal to the last character (which is known) plus the suffix of k=1.\n\n   Wait, the suffix of k=2 is the last two characters, which is the last character (c2 or c1?) plus the suffix of k=1.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet's think of the entire string s as being built from the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFor each possible starting character (from k=1), and ending character, we can try to build the possible s step by step.\n\nFor each step k, the prefix must be the first k characters, which is the (k-1) prefix plus a new character.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix must be the last k characters, which is the (k-1) suffix plus a new character before it.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n1. For each possible first character (from the two k=1 options):\n\n   a. The last character is the other option.\n\n2. For each possible first and last character, attempt to build the entire string:\n\n   a. For k from 2 to n-1:\n\n      i. Collect all possible k-length strings.\n\n      ii. Find which one is the prefix (starts with the previous prefix) and which is the suffix (ends with the previous suffix).\n\n      iii. If both conditions are satisfied, proceed.\n\n      iv. If no such assignment exists, backtrack.\n\n3. Once a full string is built, assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut this could be time-consuming, but for n=100, it's manageable.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each possible first character (c_first in {s1, s2} for k=1), and last character (c_last = the other one), we can try to build the string.\n\nFor each step k:\n\n- The two strings of length k are candidates for the prefix and suffix.\n\n- For the prefix of k, it must be the prefix of k-1 plus a new character. So, the prefix of k must start with the prefix of k-1.\n\n- For the suffix of k, it must end with the suffix of k-1, and the suffix of k is the suffix of k-1 plus a new character at the front.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of k is the suffix of k-1 plus a new character at the front.\n\nSo, for the suffix of k, it must be the suffix of k-1 with a new character added before it.\n\nSo, for the suffix of k, it must be a string that starts with the new character and is followed by the suffix of k-1.\n\nTherefore, for each k:\n\n- The two strings of length k are possible candidates for the suffix of k.\n\n   So, for each candidate string, check if it starts with the new character (the one before the suffix of k-1) and is followed by the suffix of k-1.\n\nWait, but how to find the new character.\n\nThe new character for the suffix of k is the (n -k)th character of s.\n\nBecause, the suffix of k is built by adding the (n -k)th character to the front of the suffix of k-1.\n\nSo, for each k, the suffix of k is (s[n -k] + suffix of k-1).\n\nThus, for each k, the suffix of k must be a string that starts with a certain character (s[n -k]) and is followed by the suffix of k-1.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each possible starting and ending character:\n\n   Initialize:\n\n      current_prefix = [c_first]\n\n      current_suffix = [c_last]\n\n   For k from 2 to n-1:\n\n      possible_strings = list of two strings of length k.\n\n      For each possible_string in possible_strings:\n\n          Check if possible_string starts with current_prefix[-1] (i.e., the last character of current_prefix) → meaning it's a candidate for the next prefix.\n\n          Also, check if possible_string ends with current_suffix[-1] → meaning it's a candidate for the next suffix.\n\n          Additionally, for the suffix:\n\n              The possible_string must be equal to (new_char) + current_suffix.\n\n              Where new_char is the character before the current_suffix.\n\n              Wait, the new_char is s[n -k], which is the (n -k)th character of s.\n\n              But since the suffix of k is built from the previous suffix, perhaps we can model this.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the current prefix and suffix as strings, and for each k, choose which of the two possible strings is the next prefix and which is the next suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, here's a concrete example.\n\nSuppose for k=2, the two possible strings are 'ab' and 'ba'.\n\nAssuming that the current prefix is 'a' (from k=1), then the possible next prefix is 'ab', because it starts with 'a'.\n\nThe possible next suffix could be 'ba' or 'ab'.\n\nBut the next suffix must also end with the previous suffix, which is 'c' (if c_last is 'c').\n\nWait, no. The suffix of k must end with the suffix of k-1.\n\nWait, the suffix of k is the last k characters, which includes the suffix of k-1 as the last k-1.\n\nSo, the suffix of k must end with the suffix of k-1.\n\nSo, for each possible candidate for the suffix of k (among the two options), it must end with the current suffix.\n\nSo, for k=2, the suffix must end with the suffix of k=1.\n\nSo, in the example, if the suffix of k=1 is 'c', then the suffix of k=2 must end with 'c'.\n\nSo, looking at the two options 'ab' and 'ba':\n\n- 'ab' ends with 'b' → not equal to 'c' → invalid.\n\n- 'ba' ends with 'a' → not equal to 'c' → invalid.\n\nSo, in this case, no possible suffix for k=2, so this path is invalid.\n\nThus, backtracking occurs.\n\nHmm, so the algorithm is:\n\nFor each possible first and last character:\n\n   Initialize current_prefix as the first character.\n\n   Initialize current_suffix as the last character.\n\n   For k from 2 to n-1:\n\n      Get the two possible strings for length k.\n\n      For each possible assignment of prefix_candidate and suffix_candidate (each being one of the two strings):\n\n          Check if prefix_candidate starts with current_prefix.\n\n          Check if suffix_candidate ends with current_suffix.\n\n          Also, check if suffix_candidate is equal to (some character) + current_suffix.\n\n          Wait, but what is the character to prepend? It's the (n -k)th character of s.\n\n          But since we don't know s yet, how to find this character.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternative approach: since the two possible strings for each k are the candidates for the prefix and suffix, perhaps for each k, we can find which of the two strings can be the prefix (by checking if it starts with the previous prefix) and which can be the suffix (by checking if it ends with the previous suffix).\n\nBut how to manage this for all k.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each k, the prefix must be the previous prefix plus a new character.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix must be the previous suffix plus a new character at the front.\n\nSo, for each k, the two possible strings can be tested as follows:\n\n- Is one of them a possible next prefix (starts with the previous prefix)?\n\n- Is one of them a possible next suffix (ends with the previous suffix and starts with a new character that hasn't been seen before)?\n\nWait, but the new character for the suffix is determined by the string s.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nMaybe the way forward is to model for each k, the possible next prefix and suffix, and track the current state.\n\nSo, for each step, the state consists of:\n\n- current_prefix: the first k-1 characters.\n\n- current_suffix: the last k-1 characters.\n\nFor each possible k, for each possible way to assign the two strings as prefix and suffix, we can update the state and proceed.\n\nBut for n=100, this could result in a lot of states, but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline this approach.\n\nWe can represent the state as:\n\n(current_prefix_length, current_suffix_length, current_prefix, current_suffix)\n\nWhere current_prefix is the string of the first (current_prefix_length) characters, and current_suffix is the string of the last (current_suffix_length) characters.\n\nInitially, for k=1, current_prefix_length is 1, current_suffix_length is 1, current_prefix is c1, current_suffix is c2 (assuming c1 is the first character and c2 is the last).\n\nThen, for each k from 2 to n-1:\n\n   We have two possible strings of length k: str1 and str2.\n\n   For each possible assignment of str_a as the prefix and str_b as the suffix (or vice versa), we need to check:\n\n   - str_a starts with current_prefix (i.e., current_prefix is a prefix of str_a).\n\n   - str_b ends with current_suffix.\n\n   Additionally, for the suffix assignment:\n\n   The suffix str_b must be equal to (some character) + current_suffix.\n\n   But since we don't know that character, perhaps we can derive it.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of k is built by adding the (n -k)th character of s to the front of the suffix of k-1.\n\nSo, for k=2, the suffix is (n-2)th character + suffix of k-1.\n\nBut since the suffix of k-1 is known (it's current_suffix), the suffix of k must be (some character) + current_suffix.\n\nThus, for each candidate for the suffix of k, it must be equal to (some character) + current_suffix.\n\nSo, for each candidate str_b, we can check if str_b starts with a character c such that c + current_suffix == str_b.\n\nIf yes, then c is the (n -k)th character of s.\n\nSo, for each candidate str_b, check if str_b equals c + current_suffix, for some c.\n\nIf so, then c is the next character to add, and thus the new current_suffix becomes str_b.\n\nSimilarly, for the prefix:\n\nstr_a must be current_prefix + c_new, where c_new is the next character.\n\nSo, for the prefix assignment, str_a must be equal to current_prefix + c_new, for some c_new.\n\nThus, the steps for each k are:\n\nFor each possible assignment of the two strings as prefix and suffix:\n\n   If str_a is a possible next prefix:\n\n      c_new = str_a[len(current_prefix):]\n\n   Else:\n\n      continue.\n\n   If str_b is a possible next suffix:\n\n      c_prev = str_b[:-len(current_suffix)]\n\n      if len(c_prev) != 1:\n\n          continue.\n\n      if c_prev is a new character not seen before.\n\n      Then, the new suffix is str_b.\n\n   Else:\n\n      continue.\n\nWait, but how to track the characters used so far to avoid cycles.\n\nWait, the string s is built step by step, and each step adds a new character.\n\nSo, for the prefix, each step adds a new character to the end.\n\nFor the suffix, each step adds a new character to the front.\n\nThus, the total number of unique characters in the prefix and suffix must be <= n.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, it's sufficient to model the state without tracking all the characters, but just the current prefix and suffix.\n\nBut this could lead to cycles, but given that the input is valid, the process should terminate.\n\nSo, to proceed:\n\nImplement a BFS approach where each state is (current_prefix, current_suffix, k).\n\nFor each state, for the next k, try all possible assignments of the two strings as prefix and suffix.\n\nFor each assignment:\n\n   Check if the prefix_candidate starts with current_prefix.\n\n   Extract the new character for the prefix (c_new = prefix_candidate[len(current_prefix):]).\n\n   Check if the suffix_candidate ends with current_suffix.\n\n   Extract the new character for the suffix (c_prev = suffix_candidate[:-len(current_suffix)]).\n\n   Then, the new prefix is prefix_candidate, and the new suffix is suffix_candidate.\n\n   Proceed to the next k.\n\nIf any state reaches k = n-1, then we've found a valid s.\n\nOnce s is found, assign each input string as P or S based on whether it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use BFS to explore all possible states.\n\n- For each state, for each k, try all possible assignments of the two strings as prefix and suffix.\n\n- For each valid assignment, create a new state and proceed.\n\nOnce a state reaches k = n-1, we can construct the full s, and then assign P/S.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nBut wait, for each k, the two strings are already known. So, for each k, the two strings are given in the input, but grouped by their lengths.\n\nSo, the first step is to group the input strings by their lengths.\n\nOnce that's done, for each k, the two strings are known.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read the 2n-2 lines, and group them by their lengths.\n\n   So, for each k from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings.\n\n3. Now, for each possible starting and ending character (from k=1), attempt to build the string.\n\n   So, for each possible first character (s1, s2) for k=1:\n\n      last_char = the other string (since for k=1, one is the first character and the other is the last).\n\n      current_prefix = s1\n\n      current_suffix = s2\n\n      Proceed to k=2.\n\n      For each k from 2 to n-1:\n\n          possible_strings = group[k]\n\n          for each possible assignment of prefix_candidate and suffix_candidate:\n\n              if prefix_candidate starts with current_prefix:\n\n                  new_prefix = prefix_candidate\n\n                  new_c_prefix = prefix_candidate[len(current_prefix):]\n\n              else:\n\n                  skip.\n\n              if suffix_candidate ends with current_suffix:\n\n                  new_suffix = suffix_candidate\n\n                  new_c_suffix = suffix_candidate[: len(suffix_candidate) - len(current_suffix)]\n\n              else:\n\n                  skip.\n\n              Now, check if new_c_suffix is a single character (since it's the (n -k)th character of s).\n\n              Also, check if new_c_suffix is not present in the current prefix and suffix.\n\n              Or wait, perhaps it's allowed to have overlapping characters.\n\n              So, regardless, proceed.\n\n              Then, create a new state with new_prefix, new_suffix, k.\n\n              Add this state to the queue.\n\n   Once a state reaches k = n-1, construct the full s.\n\n   Then, for each input string, determine if it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\n   Assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n   Output the result.\n\nSo, the code will need to manage this BFS.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps using memoization or pruning early when a state is invalid.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent the states as tuples: (current_prefix, current_suffix, current_k).\n\nWe can use a queue for BFS.\n\nWe can also keep a visited set to avoid revisiting the same state.\n\nBut since the current_prefix and current_suffix can vary, the visited set may be necessary.\n\nBut for n=100, the number of possible states is manageable.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings, store them in a list.\n\nGroup them by their lengths into a dictionary, say groups, where groups[k] is a list of two strings.\n\nThen, for each possible first character (from groups[1][0] and groups[1][1]):\n\n   last_char = the other.\n\n   current_prefix = groups[1][0]\n\n   current_suffix = groups[1][1]\n\n   if current_prefix starts with groups[1][0] and current_suffix ends with groups[1][1]:\n\n       proceed.\n\n   else:\n\n       skip.\n\n   enqueue the state (current_prefix, current_suffix, 1).\n\nThen, while the queue is not empty:\n\n   Dequeue a state.\n\n   If current_k is n-1:\n\n       construct s as current_prefix + ... ?\n\n       No, wait: s can be built as the prefix plus the added characters.\n\n       Or, perhaps s is current_prefix plus the new characters added for higher k.\n\n       Hmm, but perhaps it's better to track s as the full string.\n\n       Alternatively, since the current_prefix is the full prefix up to current_k, and the current_suffix is the full suffix up to current_k.\n\n       So, for the state when current_k is n-1, the current_prefix is the full prefix of length n-1, and the current_suffix is the full suffix of length n-1.\n\n       So, the full s can be reconstructed as:\n\n           s = current_prefix + (new characters from the suffix side?)\n\n       Wait, but perhaps not. Because the current_prefix is the first k characters, but the current_suffix is the last k characters.\n\n       So, perhaps the full s is current_prefix + (n - len(current_prefix)) * something.\n\n       No, that's not directly helpful.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`.
