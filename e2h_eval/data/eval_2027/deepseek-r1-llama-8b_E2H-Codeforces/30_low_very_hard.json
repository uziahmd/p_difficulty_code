Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game where two players, Homer and Marge, take turns picking digits from a number A, which has 2n digits. Each player makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers S1 and S2, which are built by appending the leftmost digit of A each time.\n\nHmm, the key here is that each move affects both the current player's number and the remaining digits. So the choice of who takes which digit at each step impacts the total value of S1 and S2.\n\nWait, but the objective is to maximize the sum S1 + S2. So we need to find a way to assign each digit to either Homer or Marge such that when you sum all the digits' contributions based on their position (like 10^k for their place in S1 or S2), the total is as large as possible.\n\nBut how do I model this? Since the digits are processed one by one, and each decision affects the future choices, this sounds like a dynamic programming problem.\n\nLet me think: the state could be determined by the current index in the string and which player has just made a move. Wait, no—because the assignment depends on the order in which the digits are taken. So perhaps the state should represent the next available digit and whether the current step is being handled by Homer or Marge.\n\nAlternatively, since each step alternates between the two players, maybe the state can be represented as the current position and whose turn it is. But wait, the initial state is that the first move is made by one of them. Oh right! Because before each turn, the players determine who goes first. So the initial choice is to decide whether Homer starts first or Marge does. Then, the rest of the steps alternate accordingly.\n\nWait, but the problem says that before each turn, they determine who makes the next move. Does that mean that the starting player can change each turn? Or is it that they have to alternate, starting with one player?\n\nNo, re-reading the problem statement: \"Each player should make exactly n moves.\" So the initial decision is who goes first, but then they alternate. For example, if n=2, the sequence would be H, M, H, M.\n\nSo the entire sequence is determined by the initial choice of who starts, and then the turns alternate.\n\nSo the main idea is that for the given string, we need to partition the digits into two sequences of length n each, where the i-th digit in A is assigned to S1 or S2 in such a way that the sum of their values is maximized.\n\nBut wait, not exactly. Because the assignment isn't just any partition; the order in which digits are taken matters because each digit is taken from the left, and the positions in S1 and S2 are based on the order of selection.\n\nFor example, the first digit chosen becomes the most significant digit in S1 if it's Homer's first move, or S2 if Marge's first move. The second digit is added to the next part of their respective number, etc.\n\nSo the problem reduces to assigning each digit to either S1 or S2, such that:\n\n- Exactly n digits are assigned to S1 and n to S2.\n- The assignment must follow the order of taking digits from left to right, and each digit is assigned in the order it appears.\n- The assignment must alternate between S1 and S2, starting with either S1 or S2, depending on who starts first.\n\nWait, no. Because the order of taking is strictly left to right. So for each digit, the assignment depends on whether it's assigned to S1 or S2 and which player is taking it now.\n\nBut the initial choice is to pick the first player. So the first digit is taken by the first player, then the second digit by the second player, then the third by the first, fourth by the second, etc., until all 2n digits are assigned.\n\nYes! So the problem can be viewed as deciding for each position i (0-based) whether it's taken by the first player or the second. But the assignment must alternate, starting with the first player.\n\nWait, but the initial choice is to choose who starts. So the initial player can be Homer or Marge. So there are two possibilities for the starting player, and for each, we need to compute the maximum sum, then choose the better one.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Determine whether Homer starts first or Marge does. For each possibility, calculate the maximum possible sum.\n\n2. Choose the option (start with Homer or Marge) that gives the higher sum. If both give the same sum, pick the one that results in lex order or any.\n\n3. Once the starting player is decided, generate the sequence of H and M.\n\nSo the core problem is, given a starting player (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, such that they maximize their total prize. The game involves taking turns to pick the leftmost digit from a given string, and each player must make exactly n moves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each player takes turns picking the leftmost digit from the string. The goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by the digits picked by each player. The challenge is to decide the order of picks optimally.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: The problem can be approached using dynamic programming where the state is represented by the current position in the string and whether it's the turn of the first or second player. This helps in tracking the maximum possible sum at each step.\n3. **Recursive Solution with Memoization**: We use recursion with memoization to explore all possible sequences of moves, considering both starting players (Homer or Marge). This ensures we find the optimal sequence that maximizes the total prize.\n4. **State Representation**: The state is defined by the current index in the string and the current player's turn. This helps in efficiently computing the maximum sum without redundant calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    def max_sum(start):\n        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n        def dp(i, is_homer_turn):\n            if i == len(A):\n                return 0\n            res = 0\n            if is_homer_turn:\n                take = A[i]\n                next_sum = dp(i+1, False)\n                res = (int(take) * (10 ** (n - (i // 2)))) + next_sum\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    res += dp(i+1, True)\n                else:\n                    res += dp(i+1, False)\n                return max(res, int(take) * (10 ** (n - (i // 2))) + dp(i+1, False))\n            else:\n                take = A[i]\n                next_sum = dp(i+1, True)\n                res = (int(take) * (10 ** (n - (i // 2)))) + next_sum\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    res += dp(i+1, True)\n                else:\n                    res += dp(i+1, False)\n                return max(res, int(take) * (10 ** (n - (i // 2))) + dp(i+1, True))\n        return dp(0, start)\n\n    best = (-1, [], [])\n    for start in [True, False]:\n        s = max_sum(start)\n        if s > best[0]:\n            best = (s, start, [])\n        elif s == best[0]:\n            if start < best[1]:\n                best = (s, start, [])\n            else:\n                pass\n    result = []\n    current_player = best[1]\n    for i in range(len(A)):\n        digit = A[i]\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            if current_player:\n                result.append('H')\n            else:\n                result.append('M')\n        else:\n            if current_player:\n                result.append('M')\n            else:\n                result.append('H')\n        current_player = not current_player\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The function `max_sum` calculates the maximum possible sum starting with either Homer or Marge. It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n3. **Recursive State**: The state is defined by the current index `i` and whether it's Homer's turn (`is_homer_turn`). This helps in exploring all possible sequences of moves.\n4. **Building the Result**: After determining the optimal starting player, the result sequence is built by iterating through the string and appending 'H' or 'M' based on whose turn it is.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal sequence of moves to maximize the total prize for both players.",
