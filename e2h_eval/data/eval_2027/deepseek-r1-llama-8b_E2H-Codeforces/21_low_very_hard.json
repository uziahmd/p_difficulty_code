The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to unlock as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that for a key j and chest i, a_i + b_j must be odd. Also, each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked at most once.\n\nHmm, right. So the main thing here is that each key can only be used once. So we need to pair keys and chests such that their sum is odd, and maximize the number of chests opened.\n\nLet me think about the parity. Because for a_i + b_j to be odd, one must be even and the other odd. So, for each key, depending on whether it's even or odd, it can unlock a chest that is of the opposite parity.\n\nSo the first step is to separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the condition is that a_i + b_j is odd. So if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd. And if a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\nSo, for all the chests, let's count how many have even a_i and how many have odd a_i. Similarly, for the keys, count how many are even and how many are odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between:\n\n- The number of even a_i chests and the number of odd b_j keys. Because each even a_i needs an odd key.\n\nPlus the minimum between:\n\n- The number of odd a_i chests and the number of even b_j keys. Because each odd a_i needs an even key.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because each key can be used once. So for the even a_i chests, each requires an odd key. So the maximum number of even a_i chests we can open is the minimum of the count of even a_i and the count of odd keys.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum number of odd a_i chests is the minimum of the count of odd a_i chests and the count of even keys.\n\nSo the total maximum is the sum of these two minima.\n\nBut wait, that's only true if the sum of those two doesn't exceed the total number of chests. Hmm, but actually, since each key is used once, the two minima can't both exceed m because the sum could potentially be more than n, but that's not possible because each chest uses one key. So the sum of the two minima can't exceed n, because you can't have more chests opened than the total.\n\nWait, no. Let's see. Suppose you have 3 even a_i chests and 4 odd b_j keys. Then, you can use 3 keys (odd) for the even chests, leaving 1 key (odd) unused. Then, for the odd a_i chests, say you have 2, and you have 5 even b_j keys. So you can use 2 even keys for them. So total is 3+2=5 chests. But if you have 10 even a_i and 10 odd keys, you can take 10 from the even and 0 from the odd, totaling 10.\n\nSo the approach is correct: the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minima of the two pairs.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (even_a, odd_a).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (even_b, odd_b).\n3. Take min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the sum of the two minima cannot exceed the total number of keys used, but perhaps in some cases, the sum can't exceed the total number of available keys. For example, suppose even_a is 100, odd_b is 50. Then, the first term is 50. If odd_a is 100, and even_b is 50, the second term is 50. Total 100. But if we have only 50 keys, that's impossible. Oh wait, no. Because the keys are used in both terms.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first term, you use odd_b for even_a. So the number of keys used for even_a is min(even_a, odd_b). Then, the remaining keys for the second term are the even_b minus how much is used? No, wait, because even_b is for the odd_a.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Because the sum of the two minima is not necessarily the answer. Let's see:\n\nSuppose even_a = 3, odd_b = 4. So min is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest only if the sum of the key's number and the chest's number is odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Parity Condition**: For a key `b_j` and a chest `a_i`, their sum must be odd. This means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n2. **Categorize the Chests and Keys**: Separate the chests into those with even numbers and those with odd numbers. Similarly, separate the keys into those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n3. **Count the Pairs**: Calculate how many chests can be opened using even keys and odd keys separately:\n   - Even chests can be unlocked using odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be unlocked using even keys.\n4. **Sum the Minimums**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum values from the two pairings mentioned above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n, m = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx +=n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a +=1\n        else:\n            odd_a +=1\n    \n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_b +=1\n        else:\n            odd_b +=1\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum possible\n    max_even = min(even_a, odd_b)\n    max_odd = min(odd_a, even_b)\n    total = max_even + max_odd\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, keys `m`, and the respective lists of numbers on the chests and keys.\n- **Categorizing Numbers:** We count how many chests have even and odd numbers, and similarly for the keys.\n- **Calculating Maximum Opened Chests:** Using the counts from the previous step, we determine the maximum number of even-numbered chests that can be unlocked using odd-numbered keys and vice versa. The sum of these two values gives the total number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach efficiently categorizes and counts the necessary pairs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n + m), which is suitable for the problem constraints.",
