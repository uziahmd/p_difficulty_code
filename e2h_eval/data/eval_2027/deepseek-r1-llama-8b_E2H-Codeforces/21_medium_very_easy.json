The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. The goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the keys. Each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by only one key.\n\nHmm, the condition for a key j to unlock chest i is that a_i + b_j is odd. So that means one must be even and the other odd. Because even plus odd is odd, right?\n\nSo, to rephrase: For a chest to be unlocked by a key, the sum of their values must be odd. That implies that one is even and the other is odd.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because 1 + 2 is 3, which is odd. So yes, a_i and b_j must be of opposite parity.\n\nSo the approach here is to figure out how many even and odd keys there are, and similarly for the chests, and then pair them in the best possible way.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll need to count:\n\n- Number of even a's (let's call it A_even)\n- Number of odd a's (A_odd)\nSimilarly,\n- Number of even b's (B_even)\n- Number of odd b's (B_odd)\n\nBecause a key can only open a chest if they are of opposite parity. So for example, an even a can be opened by an odd b, and an odd a can be opened by an even b.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests we can open would be the sum of the minimums between the available even a's and odd b's, and the available odd a's and even b's.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nSuppose we have some even a's and some odd a's. For each even a, we can pair it with an odd b. Similarly, each odd a can be paired with an even b.\n\nSo the total possible pairs would be the sum of the minimum of (A_even, B_odd) and (A_odd, B_even).\n\nWait, no. Because if I take all even a's and pair them with as many odd b's as possible, and then use the remaining even b's to pair with the odd a's, that might not maximize the total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the maximum possible by considering both scenarios:\n\n1. Use as many even a's as possible with odd b's.\n2. Use as many odd a's as possible with even b's.\n\nBut since each key can only be used once, perhaps the optimal approach is to take the minimum between the number of even a's and the number of odd b's, and add that to the minimum between the number of odd a's and the number of even b's.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each even a can only be matched with an odd b, and vice versa. So the maximum possible is the sum of the two minima.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Count how many a's are even (A_even) and odd (A_odd).\n- Count how many b's are even (B_even) and odd (B_odd).\n- The answer is min(A_even, B_odd) + min(A_odd, B_even).\n\nWait, but wait. Because each key is used once, and each chest is also used once. So this approach should work.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\na array: 9,14,6,2,11\n\nSo a's: 9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\n\nSo A_even = 3 (14,6,2), A_odd = 2 (9,11).\n\nb array: 8 even, 4 even,7 odd, 20 even.\n\nSo B_even = 3 (8,4,20), B_odd=1 (7).\n\nSo min(A_even, B_odd) is min(3,1) =1.\n\nmin(A_odd, B_even)= min(2,3)=2.\n\nTotal is 1+2=3, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1\n\na: 2,4,6,8,10 → all even, so A_even=5, A_odd=0.\n\nb:5 → odd. So B_even=0, B_odd=1.\n\nSo min(A_even, B_odd)= min(5,1)=1.\n\nmin(A_odd, B_even)=0.\n\nTotal 1, which is correct.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=1, m=4\n\na:10 → even. So A_even=1, A_odd=0.\n\nb:20,30,40,50 → all even. So B_even=4, B_odd=0.\n\nSo min(A_even, B_odd) is 0.\n\nmin(A_odd, B_even) is 0.\n\nTotal 0, correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if a has 2 even and 3 odd; b has 3 even and 2 odd.\n\nThen A_even=2, A_odd=3.\n\nB_even=3, B_odd=2.\n\nmin(A_even, B_odd) = min(2,2) =2.\n\nmin(A_odd, B_even)=min(3,3)=3.\n\nTotal 5.\n\nWhich is the sum of min(2,2)+ min(3,3) = 2+3=5.\n\nThat makes sense because each even a uses an odd b, and each odd a uses even b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the a array, count how many are even and odd.\n\n3. Read the b array, count how many are even and odd.\n\n4. Compute min(A_even, B_odd) + min(A_odd, B_even).\n\nThat's the answer.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, handling large inputs is manageable, but we need to read from stdin efficiently.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead a list: split the second line into integers.\n\nCount A_even and A_odd.\n\nSimilarly, read b list, count B_even and B_odd.\n\nCompute the sum of min(A_even, B_odd) + min(A_odd, B_even).\n\nPrint that sum.\n\nWait, but wait: the constraints say that n and m can be up to 1e5. So we need to process each list in O(n) time.\n\nBut in Python, that's manageable.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, for a:\n\nA_even = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nA_odd = len(a) - A_even\n\nSame for b:\n\nB_even = sum(1 for x in b if x %2 ==0)\nB_odd = len(b) - B_even\n\nans = min(A_even, B_odd) + min(A_odd, B_even)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but in the first example, when you have a_even=3 and B_odd=1, the min is 1. Then a_odd=2, B_even=3, min is 2. Sum 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst example:\n\na_even=3, a_odd=2.\n\nb_even=3, b_odd=1.\n\nsum min(3,1)=1, min(2,3)=2. Total 3.\n\nSecond example:\n\na_even=5, a_odd=0.\n\nb_even=0, b_odd=1.\n\nmin(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0. Total 1.\n\nThird example:\n\na_even=1, a_odd=0.\n\nb_even=4, b_odd=0.\n\nsum 0 + 0 =0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\na = [1,2] → a_even=1, a_odd=1.\n\nb = [3,4] → b_even=1, b_odd=1.\n\nsum min(1,1)=1, min(1,1)=1. Total 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na: 2,4,6 → a_even=3, a_odd=0.\n\nb:1,3,5 → b_even=0, b_odd=3.\n\nsum min(3,3) =3, min(0,0)=0. Total 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nI think this covers all cases. So the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using given keys. Each key can unlock a specific type of chest based on their parity (odd or even).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Each key can unlock a chest if the sum of their values is odd. This means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n2. **Count Parities**: We count how many chests have even and odd values separately. Similarly, we count how many keys have even and odd values.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Opened Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by pairing each even chest with an odd key and each odd chest with an even key. The result is the sum of the minimum counts of these pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na_even = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\na_odd = len(a) - a_even\n\nb_even = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nb_odd = len(b) - b_even\n\nmax_chests = min(a_even, b_odd) + min(a_odd, b_even)\nprint(max_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective values.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: For both chests and keys, we count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Pairing Strategy**: We calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering the minimum of even chests paired with odd keys and odd chests paired with even keys.\n4. **Output the Result**: The result is the sum of these two minimum values, which gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal pairing using simple arithmetic operations, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
