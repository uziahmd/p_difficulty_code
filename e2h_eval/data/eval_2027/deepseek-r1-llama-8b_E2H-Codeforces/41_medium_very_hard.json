There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house can be built on a spot, and each spot has a height between 0 and h. The profit for each spot is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges. \n\nHmm, the goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all the restrictions. So, I need to find the heights for each spot such that all the restrictions are met and the sum of squares is as large as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a dynamic programming problem because the choices for each spot depend on previous decisions, especially when considering overlapping ranges.\n\nWait, but n and h are up to 50, which is manageable for some brute-force approaches, but maybe a DP approach would be better since it's more efficient.\n\nLet me outline what I know:\n\n- For each spot i (from 1 to n), choose a height a_i such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ h.\n- For each restriction, the maximum a_i in the range [l_i, r_i] must be ≤ x_i.\n- The profit is the sum of a_i squared.\n\nSo, the constraints are on intervals, and each constraint affects all spots in that interval. This makes the problem a bit tricky because changing one spot's height can affect multiple constraints.\n\nI think we can model this using a DP where dp[i][a] represents the maximum profit achievable up to the i-th spot with the i-th spot set to height a, while satisfying all constraints up to i.\n\nBut wait, how do the constraints get incorporated into the DP? Because each decision (choosing a_i) affects not just the current spot but also any future constraints that include this spot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each spot i, for each possible height a (from 0 to h), we track the maximum possible a_i such that all constraints up to i are satisfied, including any new ones that might apply to i.\n\nAnother approach: For each spot i, and each possible height a, keep track of the minimum required height for the previous spots in such a way that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think differently.\n\nEach restriction is an interval [l_i, r_i], and within that interval, the maximum allowed height is x_i. So, for any spot in that interval, the height cannot exceed x_i. Also, the maximum in the interval must be exactly the minimum of all x_j for j in the interval where l_j ≤ i ≤ r_j.\n\nWait, no. Because a single spot could be in multiple intervals. For example, if spot 3 is covered by two restrictions: one says max 5, another says max 7. Then the maximum allowed for spot 3 is 5, because the overall maximum of the intervals covering it is the min of all applicable x_i.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x among all restrictions that cover i.\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction is an independent constraint. So, for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x over all restrictions that include i in their [l_i, r_i].\n\nYes, because each such restriction requires that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is at most x_i. So, for any spot in [l_i, r_i], the height can't exceed x_i. But if a spot is in multiple such intervals, each with their own x_i, then the height must be ≤ the minimum of those x_i.\n\nTherefore, for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x across all restrictions that cover i.\n\nSo, the first thing I can do is precompute for each spot i, the maximum allowed height. Let's call this max_height[i]. Then, the problem reduces to choosing for each spot a height a_i ≤ max_height[i], and also a_i ≤ h, with the aim to maximize the sum of a_i squared.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because each restriction is a separate condition. Suppose a spot is in two overlapping restrictions: one with x=3 and another with x=5. Then, the maximum allowed for that spot is 3 because the maximum of the interval for the first restriction is 3, and for the second it's 5, but the spot is in both. So, the spot's height must be ≤3, because otherwise the first restriction is violated.\n\nSo yes, for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x across all restrictions that include i in their interval.\n\nThat simplifies the problem! So now, the problem becomes: assign to each spot i a value a_i such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ min_x_i, where min_x_i is the minimal x from all restrictions that include i. Then, maximize the sum of a_i squared.\n\nBut wait, what if a spot isn't covered by any restriction? Then, min_x_i is h, because the default maximum is h. So, the spot can go up to h.\n\nSo the first step is to compute for each spot i, the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include i. That gives the upper bound for a_i.\n\nOnce we have these upper bounds, the problem is to choose a_i as high as possible within their respective ranges, but considering that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nThis sounds like a standard knapsack-like problem, but with per-item constraints. Since each spot's choice is independent once the upper bounds are determined, we can model this with DP.\n\nWait, because each spot's choice doesn't affect others except through the constraints. So, the optimal solution is to choose the highest possible a_i for each spot, given their individual constraints.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose h=3, and two spots, each can be up to 3. Choosing 3 for both gives 18. Alternatively, choosing 2 for both gives 8. So clearly, choosing higher values is better.\n\nBut what if the constraints are such that for a spot, the maximum allowed is 2, but another spot's maximum allowed is 3. Then, choosing 2 for the first spot and 3 for the second gives a higher sum than any other combination.\n\nWait, but in this case, each a_i is chosen to be as high as possible within their constraints. Because the square function is increasing for non-negative numbers, the maximum sum is achieved when each a_i is as large as possible.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, let's see: for each spot i, the profit is a_i², which increases as a_i increases. So, for each spot, the maximum a_i under the constraints will give the maximum possible contribution to the total profit.\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to set each a_i to the minimum between h and the minimal x_i for that spot.\n\nWait, but that's only if there are no overlapping constraints that might require a spot to have a lower maximum. But no, because the min_x_i already takes into account all overlapping constraints. So, setting each a_i to min_x_i is sufficient.\n\nWait, let's test this against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 --> spot 1: min_x is 1.\n\n2 2 3 --> spot 2: min_x is 3.\n\n3 3 2 --> spot 3: min_x is 2.\n\nSo, a = [1,3,2], which is indeed the sample solution, giving 14.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: 2 3 8. So spots 2 and 3 have min_x 8.\n\nRestriction 2: 3 4 7. Spots 3 and 4 have min_x 7.\n\nSo, the min_x for each spot:\n\nSpot 1: min of nothing, so h=10.\n\nSpot 2: min(8) = 8.\n\nSpot 3: min(8,7) =7.\n\nSpot4: min(7) =7.\n\nSo, a = [10,8,7,7], which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute the minimum x from all restrictions that include i.\n\n2. For each i, set a_i as the minimum between this computed value and h.\n\n3. Compute the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but wait: What about overlapping constraints that don't directly apply to a particular spot? For example, if a spot is included in multiple intervals, but each with different x. The min x is the limiting factor.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each spot i the min x from all restrictions that include i.\n\n- Then, set a_i to min(h, min_x_i).\n\n- Sum the squares.\n\nWait, but that's all? Because if that's the case, the problem is much easier than I thought.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each a_i is as large as possible under their constraints, which due to the square function being monotonically increasing, leads to the maximum sum.\n\nYes, that's correct. Because for each a_i, higher a_i contributes more to the sum.\n\nSo, the steps are straightforward.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. For each spot i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. Find all restrictions where l_i <= i <= r_i.\n\n   b. Among their x_i, take the minimum. If there are no such restrictions, the min is h.\n\n   c. So the maximum a_i can be is min(min_x, h).\n\n2. Sum a_i squared for all i.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nFor each of the m restrictions, store l, r, x.\n\nThen, for each spot i from 1 to n:\n\n   collect all x where l <=i <= r.\n\n   if any such x exists, min_x_i is the minimum of them.\n\n   else, min_x_i is h.\n\n   a_i = min(min_x_i, h)\n\n   add a_i^2 to the total.\n\nWait, but wait: the min_x_i could be less than h, but when you take min(min_x_i, h), it's redundant if min_x_i is already <=h. So, a_i is just min_x_i.\n\nBecause in the case where min_x_i is less than h, a_i is set to min_x_i. Otherwise, it's h.\n\nSo the code can proceed as:\n\nCompute for each spot i the min_x_i.\n\nThen a_i is min(h, min_x_i). But since min_x_i is the min of x's which are <=h (since x_i <=h per input), so min_x_i can't be larger than h. So a_i is simply min_x_i.\n\nWait, yes. Because all x_i in the restrictions are <=h. So for each spot, min_x_i is the min of some subset of x_i's, each of which is <=h. So min_x_i is automatically <=h.\n\nSo, a_i is exactly min_x_i.\n\nSo, the code can ignore the h and just take min_x_i as the a_i.\n\nWait, but no: because if a spot is not covered by any restrictions, then min_x_i is h. So, in that case, a_i can be h.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nfor each spot i:\n\n   min_x = h  # default is h if no restrictions apply.\n\n   for each restriction:\n\n       if l <=i <=r:\n\n           if x < min_x:\n\n               min_x = x\n\n   a_i = min_x\n\nsum += a_i^2\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing for each spot the minimum x_i across all applicable restrictions.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps for the code:\n\n1. Read n, h, m.\n\n2. Read m restrictions. Each is l, r, x. Note that l and r are 1-based.\n\n3. For each spot i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. Initialize min_x to h.\n\n   b. For each restriction, check if i is in [l, r]. If so, compare x with current min_x and take the smaller.\n\n   c. After processing all applicable restrictions, a_i is min_x.\n\n   d. Add a_i squared to the total.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    total += min_x ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first sample is presented as ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'], but that's probably a misrepresentation. Wait, no, looking back, the input is given as two lines, each being a string. Or perhaps it's a typo in the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the Input section shows:\n\nThe first line contains three integers ... etc.\n\nThen, the next m lines contain the restrictions.\n\nIn the first sample, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the first sample's input is:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWait, but that's probably a mistake. Because the first line is n, h, m. Then, m lines follow.\n\nSo, the first sample has n=3, h=3, m=3. Then, three restrictions.\n\nSimilarly, the second sample has n=4, h=10, m=2. Then, two restrictions.\n\nSo, the code above should handle this correctly.\n\nTesting the code on the first sample:\n\nFor i=1:\n\nCheck all restrictions. Only the first restriction applies (l=1, r=1, x=1). So min_x is 1.\n\ni=2:\n\nCheck all restrictions. Restrictions 2 (l=2, r=2, x=3) and 3 (l=2, r=3, x=8). Wait, no, the third restriction is l=3, r=3, x=2. So for i=2, only the second restriction applies (x=3). So min_x is 3.\n\ni=3:\n\nCheck all three restrictions. Restriction 2 has l=2, r=3, x=8, so i=3 is within. Restriction 3 is l=3, r=3, x=2. So min_x is min(8, 2) = 2.\n\nSo a_i's are [1,3,2], sum is 1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSimilarly, the second sample:\n\ni=1: no restrictions, so min_x is 10.\n\ni=2: restriction 2 (l=2, r=3, x=8). So min_x is 8.\n\ni=3: two restrictions: l=2-3 (x=8) and l=3-4 (x=7). So min is 7.\n\ni=4: restriction 3-4 (x=7). So min is7.\n\nSum is 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where a spot is covered by multiple restrictions.\n\nE.g., n=1, h=5, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: 1 1 3.\n\nRestriction 2: 1 1 5.\n\nFor spot 1, min_x is min(3,5)=3.\n\nSo a_1 is 3, profit 9.\n\nAnother case: a spot is not covered by any restrictions.\n\nn=2, m=0.\n\nh=10.\n\nSo both spots have a_i=10, sum 200.\n\nAnother case: a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions.\n\nn=5, m=3.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-3, x=2.\n\nRestriction 2: 2-4, x=3.\n\nRestriction 3: 3-5, x=4.\n\nSo for spot 1: only restriction 1 applies. min_x is 2.\n\nspot 2: min of 2 and 3 → 2.\n\nspot 3: min of 2,3,4 → 2.\n\nspot4: min of 3,4 → 3.\n\nspot5: min of 4 →4.\n\nSo a_i's are [2,2,2,3,4], sum is 4 +4 +4 +9 +16 = 37.\n\nSo the code correctly captures this.\n\nI think this approach is correct. So the code is as written earlier.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house can be built on a spot with a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each spot contributes to the total profit based on the square of its height. The challenge is to maximize this profit while respecting the constraints imposed by the zoning restrictions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Constraints**: Each restriction specifies a range of spots and the maximum height allowed within that range. For each spot, the height must be such that all applicable restrictions are satisfied.\n2. **Determine the Minimum Height for Each Spot**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum height value across all applicable restrictions. This ensures that all restrictions are satisfied.\n3. **Calculate the Profit**: Once the maximum allowable height for each spot is determined, compute the profit as the sum of the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    total += min_x ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions. Each restriction is then read and stored.\n2. **Iterate Over Each Spot**: For each spot from 1 to n, the code determines the minimum height allowed by checking all applicable restrictions.\n3. **Compute Maximum Height for Each Spot**: For each spot, the minimum height from all overlapping restrictions is calculated. This height is used to compute the profit contribution of that spot.\n4. **Sum the Profits**: The total profit is accumulated by summing the squares of the maximum allowable heights for all spots.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit by choosing the highest possible allowable heights for each spot. The solution efficiently handles the constraints and computes the result in a straightforward manner.",
