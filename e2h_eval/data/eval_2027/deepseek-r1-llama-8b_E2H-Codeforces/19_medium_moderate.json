The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about districts connected in a tree structure because it's given that each pair of districts has exactly one path connecting them. Each district i has 2^i fans. The president wants to remove k contestants, and after removing them, the remaining districts should form a connected subtree (since all remaining districts must be reachable from each other). Additionally, the goal is to maximize the total number of fans of the remaining contestants.\n\nHmm, so the key here is to find a connected subtree of size (n - k), which includes as many high-fan districts as possible. Wait, but wait: each district contributes 2^i to the total. So, higher i means much more contribution. So to maximize the sum, we need to include as many high i as possible, but the subtree must remain connected.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? It sounds like we need to find a subtree that includes as many high-value nodes as possible, while keeping the subtree connected. But since it's a tree, any subtree is connected if it's rooted at a certain point and includes all descendants. Or maybe not necessarily, but for a general tree, any subtree will be connected if it's formed by removing some edges.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you remove k nodes, you're effectively cutting the tree into components. But the problem says that the remaining nodes must form a single connected component. So the way to ensure that is to choose a set of nodes that forms a connected subtree, which can be thought of as selecting a subtree where all remaining nodes are connected via their original tree connections.\n\nSo the task is to select a subtree S with |S| = n -k, such that the sum of 2^i for i in S is maximized. Then, we need to remove the k nodes not in S.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says the president removes k contestants, so the remaining is n -k districts. So the problem reduces to choosing a subset of n -k districts that forms a connected subtree, and the sum of 2^i for these districts is as large as possible.\n\nSo the approach is to find the subset S of size n-k which is connected and has maximum possible sum of 2^i. Then, output the nodes not in S (the ones to be removed).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since each node contributes exponentially based on its index, the optimal strategy would be to include as many high-indexed nodes as possible, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but what defines a connected subtree? It's a subtree where all nodes are connected through their parent relationships in the tree. So perhaps the optimal way is to find a root, and then include all nodes in a certain subtree of it. Or perhaps not; maybe there's a way to include some high nodes in a way that they are all connected through lower-numbered nodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal solution is to find a path in the tree where the sum of 2^i along the path is as large as possible, but that might not directly apply here because the subtree can include multiple branches.\n\nWait, but wait. Since each node is included or excluded, and the sum is 2^i, the optimal way is to include all possible nodes with higher indices, as long as they can form a connected subtree.\n\nBut the issue is that including a high index node may require including lower index nodes to keep the subtree connected.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given. In the first sample input, the tree is:\n\nLet me parse the input lines. The input is:\n\n6 3\nThen 5 lines:\n2 1\n2 6\n4 2\n5 6\n2 3\n\nSo the tree looks like this:\n\n- 2 is connected to 1, 6, 3, and 4.\n\nWait, no: the lines are:\n\nLine 2: 2 1 → edge between 2 and 1.\nLine 3: 2 6 → edge between 2 and 6.\nLine 4:4 2 → edge between 4 and 2.\nLine 5:5 6 → edge between 5 and 6.\nLine 6:2 3 → edge between 2 and 3.\n\nSo the tree is as follows:\n\n- District 2 is connected to 1, 3, 4, and 6.\n\nDistrict 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the tree is like:\n\n        2\n      / | \\\n     1  3 4\n          |\n          6\n           |\n           5\n\nIn the sample, the output is 1,3,4 being removed. So the remaining districts are 2,5,6. But wait, that's 3 nodes, but n=6, k=3. So 6-3=3. So the remaining are 2,5,6.\n\nWait, but why are they connected? 2 is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So yes, they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100.\n\nWait, but why not include 3 and 4? Because including them would require including 2, but that's already included. Wait, no, the sum would be 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6. Which is 4+8+16+32+64 = 124, which is larger than 100. But why isn't that the case?\n\nAh, because including 3 and 4 would require that their removal is not done. Wait, wait. No, in the sample, the removed districts are 1,3,4. So the remaining are 2,5,6. So why not include 3 and 4?\n\nBecause if we include 3 and 4, we'd have 2,3,4,5,6. That's 5 nodes, but n -k is 3, so we can't include all five. Wait, no. Wait n=6, k=3. So n -k=3. So we can only have 3 districts. So why in the sample, the solution chooses to include 2,5,6 instead of, say, 2,3,4? Because 2,5,6 has a sum of 100, but 2,3,4 has 2^2+2^3+2^4=4+8+16=28, which is much less. So that's worse.\n\nSo the sample shows that sometimes, excluding some lower districts allows including higher districts that contribute more to the total.\n\nSo the approach is to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but connected, and of size exactly s = n -k.\n\nSo how can we model this?\n\nIdea: For each possible subtree, calculate the sum of 2^i for nodes in it, and choose the subtree with maximum sum, of size s.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, enumerating all possible subtrees is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the sum is 2^i, which grows exponentially, the optimal subtree must include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain of the highest possible nodes, connected in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that starts from some node and includes the maximum possible high-numbered nodes.\n\nBut how to determine which path to take.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to perform a kind of greedy selection, starting from the highest node and moving downwards, including as much as possible without breaking connectivity.\n\nWait, but the tree is arbitrary. So perhaps the approach is to find the subtree that includes as many nodes as possible in a way that all of them are in a single connected component, and their indices are as high as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since the sum is maximized by including the largest possible exponents, the optimal subtree must be the one that contains the largest s nodes, arranged in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree.\n\nWait, but the tree is a general tree, so the arrangement is not necessarily a straight line. So the optimal subtree could be a star shape, where one central node connects to several high-numbered nodes.\n\nFor example, if the tree has a central node 2 connected to 5,6,7,... etc., then including 2 and all those higher nodes would give a large sum.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find a node u, and include all its children v where v has a higher index than u, and then include all their descendants. But that depends on the tree structure.\n\nWait, but what if u is a leaf node? Then including it would not allow us to include any higher nodes.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that goes through as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, another approach: the problem can be viewed as finding a subtree S of size s = n -k, which is connected, and the sum of 2^i for i in S is maximized.\n\nWe can model this as trying to find a subtree where the sum is as large as possible. Since each node contributes exponentially, the higher the node's index, the better.\n\nSo the optimal subtree will include all the highest possible nodes, as long as they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree.\n\nPerhaps we can think of the subtree as a collection of nodes, where the minimum index in the subtree is as low as necessary to connect the higher nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree consists of all the nodes in a certain subtree of the tree, where the root is chosen such that as many high nodes as possible are included.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the problem as selecting a subtree where the sum is maximized, and the subtree is connected. Given that, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem on the tree.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, standard DP approaches won't work due to time constraints.\n\nSo alternative approach: Since the sum is exponential, the optimal subtree will consist of a path that includes the maximum possible number of high nodes. So perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that includes the s largest indices, arranged in a way that they are connected.\n\nWait, but the s largest indices may not all be connected in the tree. So the problem becomes, among all sets of s nodes, find the one that is connected and includes as many high indices as possible.\n\nBut how to find such a set efficiently.\n\nAnother Idea: We can perform a kind of pruning process. Start from the highest node, and include as much as possible, ensuring that the subtree remains connected.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to consider the subtree as a centroid. Centroid decomposition might help, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as choosing a root and then including all the nodes in a certain direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a star centered at a certain node, including as many high-numbered children as possible.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. The problem requires that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. So the minimal case is when the subtree is just a single node. The maximum case is when the entire tree is kept.\n\nBut in our case, we're to remove k nodes, leaving s = n -k.\n\nWhat if we decide which nodes to keep, such that their sum is as large as possible, and they form a connected subtree.\n\nSince the sum is 2^i, the optimal choice is to include as many high i as possible.\n\nSo the strategy is to find a connected subtree that includes the highest possible i's, and has size s.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the s highest i's, but they have to be connected.\n\nBut wait, how to ensure that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes in a path that has the highest possible sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps the subtree is a chain where each node is connected to the next, and all are as high as possible.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the tree.\n\nEach node can be considered as part of a connected subtree. The subtree can be represented as a tree itself, rooted at some node.\n\nThe sum of the subtree is the sum of 2^i for all nodes in it.\n\nWe need to find a subtree with size s, maximum sum.\n\nGiven that the sum is additive and each node's contribution is 2^i, which is exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree will include the highest possible nodes, even if that means including some lower nodes to maintain connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, but is connected.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nAnother Idea: The problem is similar to finding a subtree of size s that includes as many high i as possible. So perhaps we can model it as selecting a subtree that is a chain of the highest possible nodes, connected in a way that each is adjacent to the next.\n\nBut again, the tree structure can vary.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path where the nodes are ordered in such a way that each step is to a higher-numbered node.\n\nWait, but in a tree, that's not always possible. So perhaps the solution is to find the path in the tree where the sum of 2^i is maximum, and then see if we can include as many nodes as possible around it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a subtree that is a chain, and each node in the chain is higher than the previous. So, for example, if the tree has a chain of nodes 10, 20, 30, etc., then including them all would give a large sum.\n\nBut how to find such a chain in an arbitrary tree.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as finding the longest possible path in the tree where each node is numbered higher than the previous, but that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a subtree where all the nodes are in a certain \"upper\" part of the tree, near the root, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the optimal subtree will include all the nodes that are in a certain subtree of the main tree, and the root of this subtree is as high as possible.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Think about the problem as a priority queue.\n\nWe want to include as many high i as possible, but connected. So perhaps we can process the nodes in decreasing order of i, and greedily include them if adding them doesn't disconnect the subtree.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nWait, here's an idea: The subtree must form a connected component. To maximize the sum, we want to include the highest possible nodes. So we can start by including the highest node, then include as many of its children as possible, and so on, making sure that the subtree remains connected.\n\nBut this might not work in all cases because sometimes including a child might require excluding a higher node elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the s highest i, and is connected. So we can model it as selecting the s highest i, and then seeing if they form a connected subtree. If they do, include them. If not, find the minimal set of nodes to add to make them connected.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find a subtree where the sum is as large as possible, regardless of the specific structure. So perhaps the optimal way is to include all the nodes except those that are in the smallest possible number of 'low' i nodes, provided that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of graph theory.\n\nThe tree is undirected, and each node has a weight of 2^i.\n\nWe need to select a subtree T with |T|=s, such that the sum of weights is maximum.\n\nThe sum is maximized by including as many high-weight nodes as possible. So the optimal T will include as many high i as possible, but T must be connected.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find a subtree that includes the maximum number of high i, and is connected.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the fact that 2^i is exponentially increasing: the optimal subtree is the subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, and is connected. So the strategy is to find a subtree that includes as many of the highest i as possible, and is connected.\n\nSo perhaps the way to do this is to find the subtree that is a path starting from some node and going down to as low as needed to include as many high i as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a chain of nodes in the tree, each with a higher i than the previous, and the sum is maximum.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a star, with a central node connected to as many high i children as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the central node is a node with a high i, and all its children also have high i. Including all of them gives a large sum.\n\nBut how to find such a star.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a combination of a chain of high i nodes and their children.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming.\n\nSuppose I root the tree at some node, say node u. Then, for each node, I can compute the size of the subtree, the sum, and the maximum sum for various sizes.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, this would be too slow unless we can find an O(n) or O(n log n) approach.\n\nWait, another Idea: The optimal subtree must be a subtree where all the nodes are in a certain path. Because including any branching would require including lower i nodes, which might not contribute as much.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if a node has two high i children, including both would be better than including just one.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding a subtree where the sum of 2^i is as large as possible, and the size is exactly s. So the approach is to find all possible subtrees, compute their sum and size, and select the one with maximum sum.\n\nBut for n=1e6, this is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is 2^i, the contribution of each node is unique. So the optimal subtree is the one that includes as many high i nodes as possible, and they form a connected subtree.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the minimal subtree that connects as many high i nodes as possible, and has exactly s nodes.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a node u, and include all nodes in the subtree rooted at u, but only a certain number of them.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as finding the subtree with the s largest 2^i values that are connected.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm:\n\nStart by including the s largest nodes. Check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, include them. If not, find the minimal number of additional nodes needed to connect them, and remove the minimal number of nodes to reach s = n -k.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that starts at some node and goes down through as many high i nodes as possible.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that the optimal subtree is a subtree where all the nodes are in a single path. Because including any branches would require including lower i nodes, which may not contribute as much.\n\nSo the approach is to find the path in the tree that has the maximum sum of 2^i, and has length s.\n\nWait, but the path's length is the number of nodes in it, which is s. So the problem reduces to finding the path with the maximum sum of 2^i, and length s.\n\nBut the tree is not necessarily a straight line, so the path may not be the main chain.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that is a chain, i.e., a path, and within that path, the nodes are ordered in such a way that each node is higher than the previous.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a chain of s nodes, each with i as high as possible.\n\nSo how can we find such a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem by considering each node as a potential endpoint of the chain, and then compute the maximum sum for chains starting or ending at that node.\n\nBut for n=1e6, this would be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the sum is maximized by including as many high i nodes as possible, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that includes all the nodes in a certain subtree of the main tree, where the root is chosen to be as high as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is a star, with a root and as many children as possible, each contributing high i.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the node with the highest i, and as many of its children as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is to greedily include as many nodes as possible, starting from the highest i, and ensuring that each included node is connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nHere's an outline of a possible approach:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of i.\n\n2. Try to include as many as possible, starting from the highest.\n\n3. For each node in this order, check if adding it to the current subtree is possible while maintaining connectivity.\n\n4. Stop when the size reaches s.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nAnother Idea: The optimal subtree must include all the nodes that are in the s highest positions, and form a connected subtree. So perhaps the problem reduces to finding the minimal subtree that connects these s nodes.\n\nBut how to find which s nodes to include.\n\nBut for n=1e6, it's not feasible to try all combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is the minimal subtree containing the s highest i's.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct because maybe including some lower i nodes would allow including more higher i nodes.\n\nNo, because the higher i's contribute exponentially more.\n\nSo including higher i is better, so the optimal subtree will include as many high i as possible, and the minimal number of lower i's to connect them.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find a subtree that includes as many high i as possible, and the required number of lower i's to connect them.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a chain consisting of the s highest i's, connected in a path. So the sum is maximized by having the s highest i's connected in a path.\n\nBut the tree may not contain such a path. So perhaps the optimal subtree is the path in the tree that includes as many high i's as possible, and has a length of s.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to perform a BFS starting from the highest node and include as many nodes as possible, up to s, while ensuring connectivity.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a subtree where the root is the highest node, and all its children are included, recursively.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck on the exact approach. Maybe I should look for patterns in the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\n6 3\n\nThe tree is:\n\n2 connected to 1,3,4,6.\n\n6 connected to 5.\n\nThe optimal is to remove 1,3,4, leaving 2,5,6.\n\nSum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32 +64=100.\n\nIf instead, we included 3 and 4, the sum would be 4 +8+16 +32+64 = 124, but that's more than 100. But wait, that would require including 5 nodes, but n-k=3, so that's not allowed.\n\nWait, wait! Wait a minute, in the sample, n=6, k=3, so s=3.\n\nIncluding 2,3,4: sum is 4+8+16=28, which is less than 100. So including 2,5,6 is better.\n\nSo the optimal subtree is not the s highest nodes, but a connected subtree that includes some higher nodes and excludes others.\n\nSo how to find such a subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a subtree where the sum of 2^i is as large as possible, and the size is s.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is additive and 2^i is exponential, the optimal subtree will be the one that includes all the nodes that are in a certain \"dense\" area of the tree, where the nodes are connected and have high i.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to find a subtree that is a subtree of the tree, and the sum is as large as possible.\n\nBut again, for n=1e6, it's not feasible to compute for all possible subtrees.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution involves finding the subtree where the sum is maximized, which can be done by finding the subtree where the sum of 2^i is as large as possible, and the subtree is connected.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding the subtree with the maximum sum of 2^i, given that it has exactly s nodes.\n\nThis is a variation of the maximum sum subtree problem.\n\nIn such problems, for trees, the approach often involves dynamic programming on the tree, but for n=1e6, that's not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution lies in realizing that the optimal subtree is a chain of s nodes, each of which is connected, and the sum is maximized.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since each node's contribution is 2^i, the optimal subtree will have the s nodes with the highest 2^i values, arranged in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find which s nodes to include.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the s nodes with the highest 2^i values, but they may not form a connected subtree. So the problem becomes finding a connected subtree that includes as many of these s nodes as possible.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the problem is similar to finding a spanning tree with maximum sum, but the constraint is that the number of nodes is fixed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a node u, and include all its descendants in a certain direction, plus possibly some others.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's best to look for hints or related problems.\n\nWait, thinking about the problem differently: Each node contributes 2^i to the sum. So the sum is maximized by including as many high i nodes as possible, but the subtree must be connected.\n\nTherefore, the optimal subtree is the one that includes the largest possible number of high i nodes, connected together.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that is a star, centered at a high i node, with as many high i children as possible.\n\nBut how to find such a star.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that is a chain, where each node is connected to the next, and all are as high as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree with the maximum sum, which is a chain of s nodes, and the sum is the sum of 2^i for the nodes in the chain.\n\nBut again, how to compute this.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is exponential, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that includes the node with the highest i, and as many of its adjacent nodes as possible.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample, node 6 is the highest (i=6). It's connected to 5 (i=5) and 2 (i=2). So including 6 and 5 gives a sum of 64 +32=96, but then including 2 adds 4, totaling 100.\n\nBut including 2,5,6 gives a sum of 4+32+64=100.\n\nAlternatively, including 6,5, and perhaps 4 (if connected) would be better, but 4 is connected to 2, which is not included.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subtree is a subtree that starts from a certain node and includes as many of its descendants as possible, even if that requires including lower i nodes.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to perform a post-order traversal, and for each node, keep track of the maximum sum possible for a subtree of size s.\n\nBut with n=1e6, this would be O(n*s), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is 2^i, which is exponential, the value of each node is more significant than the sum of all lower nodes. Therefore, the optimal subtree must include the highest possible node, and as many as possible of its adjacent nodes.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a star centered at the highest node, including as many of its children as possible, up to s nodes.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes in a certain subtree of the main tree, where the root is as high as possible.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the problem in terms of the minimal number of nodes to remove to leave a connected subtree of size s.\n\nBut that's similar to the problem of finding the largest connected subtree, but in reverse.\n\nWait, the problem is to find a connected subtree of size s with maximum sum. So the problem is to find a subtree T with |T|=s, connected, and sum of 2^i is maximum.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to find the subtree T with maximum sum, which is connected and has size s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is maximum when the included nodes are as high as possible, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a chain of the s highest possible nodes, connected in a path.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the path in the tree that includes the s highest nodes, connected.\n\nBut for a general tree, this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that includes the s highest nodes, and is connected. The way to do this is to find the minimal subtree that connects these s nodes.\n\nBut how to choose which s nodes to include.\n\nWait, but it's unclear.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's best to think about what the algorithm would look like for small n, and then try to find a pattern or a way to generalize it.\n\nFor example, in the sample, the s is 3.\n\nThe highest 3 nodes are 5,6, and 2.\n\nWait, no, 6 is the highest (i=6), followed by 5 (i=5), then 2 (i=2).\n\nWait, but including 6,5, and 2 is 3 nodes, and they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the sum is 64 + 32 +4 = 100.\n\nAlternatively, if the subtree includes 6,5, and 4, that's 64 +32 +16=112, but 4 is not connected to 6 unless via 2. So to include 4, you must include 2, which brings the sum to 64+32+16+4=116, but that's 4 nodes, which is more than s=3.\n\nSo, perhaps including 6,5, and 2 is better, giving a sum of 100.\n\nSo the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest possible nodes, connected via their parent/child relationships.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find a subtree that is connected, includes the highest possible nodes, and has size s.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree.\n\nAnother Idea: The problem can be transformed into finding a subtree T with size s, such that the sum of 2^i for nodes in T is maximum.\n\nTo maximize the sum, T must include as many high i nodes as possible.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the subtree T that includes the s nodes with the highest 2^i values, and is connected.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Collect all nodes, sort them in descending order of i.\n\n2. Take the top m nodes, where m >= s, and check if they can form a connected subtree.\n\n3. If yes, include them.\n\n4. If not, find the minimal number of nodes to add to connect them.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is the union of the s highest nodes and the minimal necessary nodes to connect them.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that is the minimal subtree covering the s highest nodes.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample, the s=3 highest nodes are 6,5,2.\n\nThe minimal subtree that connects them is 2-6-5, which has 3 nodes.\n\nSo the sum is 64+32+4=100.\n\nWhich is the sample's result.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find the minimal subtree that connects the s highest nodes, which may include some lower i nodes.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Identify the s highest nodes.\n\n- Find the minimal subtree that connects them.\n\n- The sum is the sum of these nodes plus the nodes in the minimal subtree.\n\nWait, but the minimal subtree may include more nodes than s.\n\nWait, no. Because the minimal subtree to connect s nodes may have more than s nodes, but in our case, the total size must be s.\n\nSo, this approach may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree of size s that includes as many of the top nodes as possible.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is maximum when the nodes are as high as possible, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that is the union of the s highest nodes and their parent(s) necessary to connect them.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample, the s=3 highest nodes are 6,5,2.\n\nThey form a connected subtree 2-6-5, which has 3 nodes.\n\nSum is 100.\n\nIf there were s=4, we would need to include 6,5,2, and 3 (assuming 3 is connected to 2), but that's 4 nodes, sum 4+64+32+8=108.\n\nBut in that case, the sum is 108.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the s nodes that form a connected subtree and have the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to find these s nodes.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Greedy Approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as trying to find a subtree where the sum is as large as possible, and the size is s. Since the sum is dominated by the highest nodes, perhaps the optimal subtree includes the s highest nodes, and the minimal possible lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Collect all nodes, sorted in descending order of i.\n\n2. Select the top m nodes, where m >=s.\n\n3. Check if these m nodes can form a connected subtree. If yes, include them.\n\n4. If not, find the minimal number of nodes to add to connect them, and adjust the count accordingly.\n\nBut for n=1e6, this is not feasible.\n\nAnother Idea: Realize that the minimal subtree to connect s nodes is the subtree induced by the s nodes and their connecting paths.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the subtree that includes s nodes, and is connected, with the maximum sum.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's best to look for an alternative approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by finding the subtree that is a chain of s nodes, each connected in a path, with the highest possible sum.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to finding the maximum path sum in a tree, but with the constraint on the number of nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to perform a post-order traversal and for each node, keep track of the maximum sum for different subtree sizes.\n\nBut for n=1e6, this is impractical.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the sum is exponential, the optimal subtree must include the highest possible nodes, and thus the subtree is a star centered at a high i node, including as many high i children as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to find the node u with the highest i, and include as many of its children as possible, up to s nodes.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n- Find the node with the highest i, say u.\n\n- Include u, and as many of its children as possible, each of which has the highest i in their respective subtrees.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree rooted at u, which includes all possible descendants, but only a certain number.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress, and perhaps I should think about how others might approach this problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model the problem as finding a subtree where the sum is as large as possible, and the subtree is connected. Since the sum is maximized by including high i nodes, the optimal subtree is the one that includes the s highest i nodes and is connected.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the s highest i nodes and then find the minimal subtree that connects them.\n\nThe sum would then be the sum of these s nodes plus any additional nodes needed to connect them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The minimal subtree connecting s nodes is the subtree induced by the s nodes and the paths connecting them. So, the sum is the sum of all nodes in this minimal subtree.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the s nodes that have the highest 2^i, and then compute the sum of the minimal subtree that connects them.\n\nBut how to find these s nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree where",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected subtree with the maximum possible sum of fans. Each district contributes exponentially based on its number, so higher-numbered districts contribute more significantly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree where each district is connected to exactly one other district except for the root. This structure ensures there's exactly one path between any two districts.\n\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: The goal is to maximize the sum of fans, which means including as many high-numbered districts as possible. However, the remaining districts must form a connected subtree.\n\n3. **Key Insight**: The optimal solution involves finding a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes while ensuring connectivity. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered node and expanding downwards, including nodes that contribute the most to the sum without disconnecting the subtree.\n\n4. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Read the input and construct the tree.\n   - Use a BFS approach starting from the highest-numbered node to include as many high nodes as possible while maintaining connectivity.\n   - Ensure the resulting subtree has exactly `n - k` nodes, removing the necessary nodes if needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # Assign parent and build the tree\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    children = defaultdict(list)\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(1)\n    visited[1] = True\n    max_node = 0\n    for u in q:\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v] and v != parent[u]:\n                parent[v] = u\n                children[u].append(v)\n                visited[v] = True\n                if v > max_node:\n                    max_node = v\n                q.append(v)\n    \n    s = n - k\n    \n    # Now, find the subtree with size s, starting from max_node\n    result = []\n    stack = [(max_node, False)]\n    visited_sub = set()\n    total_sum = 0\n    current_size = 0\n    while stack:\n        node, processed = stack.pop()\n        if processed:\n            result.append(node)\n            continue\n        if node in visited_sub:\n            continue\n        visited_sub.add(node)\n        current_size += 1\n        total_sum += (1 << (node - 1))  # 2^node is 2^(node), but wait: 2^i for i=1 is 2^1=2, but in the code, it's 2^(node-1).
