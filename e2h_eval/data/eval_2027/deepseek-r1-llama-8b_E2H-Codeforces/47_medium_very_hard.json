    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the smallest non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest k.\n\nHmm, let's think about what a+k and b+k represent. Since a and b are given, adding the same k to both means their difference remains the same. So, the difference between a+k and b+k is equal to the difference between a and b. That's an important observation because it might help simplify things.\n\nWait, right. Let me denote d = |a - b|. Without loss of generality, let's assume a <= b, so d = b - a. Then, when we add k to both, the two numbers become (a + k) and (b + k), which are (d apart). So their LCM is going to depend on their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\nBecause for any two numbers x and y, LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y). So, if I can find the maximum possible GCD after adding k, that would minimize the LCM.\n\nSo, what's the maximum possible GCD of (a +k) and (b +k)? Well, since their difference is fixed as d, the GCD must divide d. Because GCD(a+k, b+k) = GCD(a+k, d). So, the GCD can be any divisor of d.\n\nThat's a crucial point. So to maximize the GCD, I need to find the largest possible divisor of d that divides (a +k). Wait, no, more precisely, that (a +k) must be a multiple of some divisor g of d, which would make (b +k) also a multiple of g.\n\nSo, the approach should be: iterate over all divisors g of d, compute the minimal k for each g, then pick the one with the largest g, and among those, the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, how do we find the minimal k for each g?\n\nLet's see. For a given g (divisor of d), we want a +k to be divisible by g. Since a +k ≡ 0 mod g, k ≡ (-a) mod g. So the smallest non-negative k for this g is (g - a % g) % g. But wait, let's calculate it correctly.\n\nIf a mod g is r, then k must be (g - r) mod g. Because (a +k) mod g = 0 implies k ≡ (-r) mod g. So the smallest k is (g - r) if r != 0, else 0.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d, compute the required k, then evaluate the LCM (which is (a +k) * (b +k) / g, but since b +k = (a +k) + d, which is (a +k) + (d). So maybe it's better to just compute the LCM based on g.\n\nWait, but for each g, the optimal k is (g - a mod g) mod g. Once we have that k, the two numbers are a +k and b +k = (a +k) + d. Both are multiples of g, so their LCM is (a +k) * (a +k + d) / g. But since d is fixed, perhaps this can be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k for each g is (g - a mod g) % g, but we have to ensure that (a +k) is positive. Since a and g are positive, this will always be true.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, then a and b are equal, so any k=0 is optimal, since LCM(a, b) is a.\n\n2. Otherwise, find all divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g, compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g. But wait, since a can be larger than g, perhaps the correct formula is (g - (a % g)) if a % g != 0, else 0. Or, more accurately, k = (g - (a % g)) % g. Because if a is already divisible by g, then a mod g is zero, so k is zero.\n\n4. Then, compute the LCM for each possible g, using the corresponding k, and track the minimal LCM and the smallest k that achieves it.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for each divisor g, we can compute k, but for each g, the resulting LCM could vary. We need to find the g that gives the minimal LCM, and among those, the smallest k.\n\nBut considering all divisors of d could be computationally expensive if d is large. However, since d is up to 1e9, finding all its divisors is manageable because the number of divisors is O(sqrt(d)), which is up to 3e4 for d=1e9.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g. Then compute the LCM for (a +k) and (b +k). But since (a +k) and (b +k) are both multiples of g, their LCM is (a +k) * (b +k) / g.\n\nWait, but (a +k) and (b +k) are (a +k) and (a +k + d). So their product is (a +k) * (a +k + d). Divided by g, which is a divisor of d.\n\nWait, but (a +k) is a multiple of g, so let's denote m = (a +k)/g. Then (b +k) is (a +k + d) = g * m + d. But since g divides d, d = g * t for some integer t. So (b +k) = g * m + g * t = g*(m + t). Therefore, the LCM is g * max(m, m + t). But since m and m +t are consecutive integers if t=1? Or not necessarily. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the LCM as (a +k)*(b +k)/g.\n\nWait, but (a +k) and (b +k) are co-prime only if their GCD is 1. But in our case, their GCD is exactly g, since we're considering each g as a divisor of d.\n\nSo yes, the LCM is (a +k) * (b +k) / g.\n\nBut wait, (a +k) is g * m, (b +k) is g * (m + t), where t = d/g. So their product is g^2 * m (m + t), divided by g gives g * m (m + t). So the LCM is g * m (m + t).\n\nBut m is (a +k)/g. And k is (g - (a mod g)) mod g, which makes a +k a multiple of g. So m is an integer.\n\nSo for each divisor g, we can compute m = (a +k)/g, and the LCM is g * m * (m + t), where t = d / g.\n\nBut perhaps this is complicating things. Maybe it's better to compute the LCM directly for each g.\n\nWait, but for each g, after computing k, the LCM is (a +k) * (b +k) // g, since GCD is g.\n\nYes, that's correct. So for each g, compute k, compute (a +k) and (b +k), then compute their LCM.\n\nBut for the purposes of comparing, perhaps we can compute the LCM in terms of g and other variables to avoid dealing with large numbers.\n\nBut in code, it's probably easier to just compute the actual value.\n\nSo the algorithm outline is:\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b)\n\nIf d == 0:\n    return 0\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g in the divisors:\n    compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n    if k < 0:  # but mod g ensures it's positive\n        continue\n    compute x = a + k\n    y = b + k\n    current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n    keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the smallest k that achieves it.\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider the case where k=0. Because in some cases, the minimal LCM might be achieved without any k. Wait, but when d is zero, it's trivial. When d is non-zero, but when k=0, the LCM is (a*b)//gcd(a,b). So it's possible that for some cases, choosing k=0 might be better.\n\nWait, no. Because in the general case, when d is non-zero, but when we choose k=0, the GCD is gcd(a, b). But for other values of k, perhaps the GCD is higher. So including k=0 is necessary because it's a possible candidate.\n\nBut wait, in our initial approach, when generating all divisors of d, including 1, 2, etc., perhaps the k=0 case is covered when g is a divisor of d that also divides a.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, suppose a=5, b=10. Then d=5.\n\nThe divisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: k = (1 -5%1) mod 1 = (1 - 0) mod1 = 0. So x=5+0=5, y=10+0=10. LCM is 10.\n\nFor g=5: a mod5 is 0, so k=0. x=5, y=10. Same as above.\n\nSo for this case, the minimal LCM is 10, achieved at k=0.\n\nWhich is correct, because in the sample input, when a=5, b=10, the output is 0.\n\nSo in this case, the initial approach covers the k=0 case.\n\nWait another example: a=6, b=10.\n\nd=4.\n\nDivisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: k=(1 -6%1) mod1 = 0. x=6, y=10. LCM=30.\n\ng=2: a mod2=0, so k=0. x=6, y=10. LCM=30.\n\ng=4: a mod4=2. So k=(4-2) mod4=2. x=8, y=12. LCM(8,12)=24.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, achieved at k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the initial approach includes all possible k's that could lead to higher GCDs, including k=0.\n\nBut wait, is that the case? Let's think: when g is a divisor of d, and for each g, we compute the minimal k to get a multiple of g. So for g=1, the minimal k is zero, which may or may not be the best option.\n\nWait, but in some cases, a higher g (like d itself) might yield a better LCM. So the initial approach correctly considers all possible divisors.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|\n\n2. If d == 0, return k=0.\n\n3. Else, generate all divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g in the list:\n\n   a. compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n   b. compute x = a +k, y = b +k\n\n   c. compute current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n\n   d. keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the smallest k.\n\n5. Also, include the case where k=0, which corresponds to g = gcd(a, b). Wait, but in step 4, when we process g = gcd(a, b), which is a divisor of d, it's included.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, when a=6, b=10, the GCD is 2, which is a divisor of d=4. So in step 4, it's considered as g=2.\n\nSo the initial approach covers all possibilities, including k=0.\n\nBut wait, why? Because when k=0, the GCD is the GCD(a, b), which is a divisor of d. So when processing g = GCD(a, b), which is a divisor of d, we compute the k that would make a+k a multiple of g, which is zero if a is already a multiple.\n\nYes, so the initial approach will include k=0 as a possible candidate.\n\nThus, the steps are correct.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n- Generating all divisors of d.\n\nHow to generate all divisors of a number d efficiently?\n\nWe can factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all combinations of exponents to get all possible divisors.\n\nBut factorizing d can be time-consuming for large d (up to 1e9). But since the number of test cases is one, and d is up to 1e9, it's manageable.\n\nAn alternative approach is to loop from 1 to sqrt(d) and collect all divisors.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo, the function to generate all divisors of d:\n\nInitialize a list of divisors.\n\nLoop i from 1 to sqrt(d):\n\n   if d % i ==0:\n\n      add i to the list.\n\n      if d/i != i, add d/i to the list.\n\nThen, after the loop, sort the list.\n\nBut for d=0, this would cause issues, but in our case, d is |a - b|, which is non-negative, and for d=0, we handle it separately.\n\nWait, no. Because when d=0, a and b are equal. So a +k and b +k are equal for any k, so their LCM is a +k. The minimal is achieved when a +k is as small as possible, which is when k=0. So for d=0, output k=0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif a == b:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   proceed.\n\nSo, back to generating divisors.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, for each g in the list, compute k as (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\nBut wait, what if a mod g is zero? Then, k is zero.\n\nSo, for each g, compute k, and then compute the current LCM.\n\nNow, for each possible g, the current LCM is (a +k) * (b +k) // g.\n\nBut wait, a +k and b +k differ by d, which is a multiple of g. So (a +k) is a multiple of g, (b +k) is (a +k) +d, which is a multiple of g since d is a multiple of g.\n\nSo, the LCM is (a +k) * (b +k) / g.\n\nBut (a +k) and (b +k) are (g*m) and (g*(m + t)), where t = d/g.\n\nSo the LCM is g * m * (m + t).\n\nBut again, perhaps it's easier to compute it as (a +k) * (b +k) // g.\n\nBut for code, it's straightforward.\n\nNow, for each g, compute k, then x = a +k, y = b +k. Then, the LCM is (x*y) // g.\n\nBut x and y can be very large (since a and b are up to 1e9, adding k can make them up to 2e9). So their product could be up to (2e9)^2 = 4e18, which is within Python's handling capacity, as it can handle big integers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b)\n\nif d ==0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   find all divisors of d.\n\n   for each g in sorted(divisors):\n\n       compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n       x = a +k\n\n       y = b +k\n\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n\n       compare with the current minimal.\n\nSo, but wait, the order of processing the divisors matters. Should we process them in increasing or decreasing order?\n\nBecause for the same g, the k can vary, and the LCM can vary. We need to find the minimal LCM, and the smallest k in case of ties.\n\nBut processing in any order is acceptable as long as we track the minimal.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the question is: how to generate all the divisors.\n\nImplementing the divisor generator.\n\nLet's write a function to generate all divisors of d.\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(d)) +1):\n\n        if d %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(d//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but for d=0, this would cause issues. But in our code, d is zero only when a==b, which is handled before.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # generate all divisors of d\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) +1):\n\n        if d %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(d//i)\n\n    divisors = sorted(divisors)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = 0\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        # compute k\n\n        rem = a % g\n\n        k = (g - rem) % g\n\n        x = a +k\n\n        y = b +k\n\n        current_gcd = g\n\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_k = k\n\n        # also check if k can be smaller? No, because for each g, the computed k is the minimal k that makes (a +k) divisible by g.\n\n    # Now, after checking all g, we also need to consider k=0?\n\n    # Wait, no. Because when a and b are not equal, d is non-zero, and for the g that is the GCD(a, b), which is a divisor of d, we have k=0.\n\n    # So the code already includes the k=0 case.\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but wait. What about cases where a > b? Like a=10, b=6.\n\nIn this case, d=4, same as before.\n\nSo, in the code, the function uses absolute value, so d is 4.\n\nThe code remains the same.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 10 → d=4.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nk = (1 -6%1) mod1= (1-0) mod1=0.\n\nx=6, y=10 → lcm=60.\n\ng=2:\n\na mod2=0 → k=0.\n\nx=6, y=10 → lcm=30.\n\ng=4:\n\na mod4=2 → k=4-2=2 mod4=2.\n\nx=8, y=12 → lcm=24.\n\nSo, minimal is 24, achieved at k=2.\n\nSample Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n21 31 → d=10.\n\ndivisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\nCheck each g:\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0 → x=21, y=31 → lcm=21*31 = 651.\n\ng=2:\n\na mod2=1 → k=2-1=1.\n\nx=22, y=32 → lcm= (22*32)/2 = 352.\n\ng=5:\n\na mod5=1 → k=5-1=4.\n\nx=25, y=35 → lcm= (25*35)/5=175.\n\ng=10:\n\na mod10=1 → k=10-1=9.\n\nx=30, y=40 → lcm= (30*40)/10=120.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 120, achieved at k=9.\n\nSample Output is 9.\n\nThird Sample:\n\n5 10 → d=5.\n\ndivisors 1,5.\n\ng=1: k=0 → lcm=50.\n\ng=5: a mod5=0 → k=0 → same as above.\n\nSo minimal is 50, achieved at k=0.\n\nSo sample outputs are as expected.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=7 → d=4.\n\ndivisors: 1,2,4.\n\ng=1: k=0 → lcm=21.\n\ng=2: a mod2=1 → k=1. x=4, y=8 → lcm=8.\n\ng=4: a mod4=3 → k=1. x=4, y=8 → lcm=8.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 8, achieved at k=1. So output is 1.\n\nWait, but wait: for g=4, k is 1. So x=4, y=8. LCM is 8.\n\nBut for g=2, k is 1. x=4, y=8. Same result.\n\nSo the minimal is 8, and the smallest k is 1.\n\nSo the code would select the earliest occurrence, which is when g=2.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each g in the sorted list of divisors, which are [1,2,4], it processes g=1 first, then g=2, then g=4.\n\nWhen processing g=2, the current_lcm is 8, and best_k is 1.\n\nThen, when processing g=4, the k is 1, same as before, and current_lcm is 8. So it's not better than the previous, but same. So the code would not change the best_k.\n\nWait, but in the code, the condition is:\n\nif current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n\nSo when the current_lcm equals min_lcm, and the k is smaller than the current best_k, we update.\n\nIn this case, for g=2, the best_k is 1, and for g=4, k is 1 as well. So no change.\n\nSo the code will correctly capture the minimal k.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=4 → d=2.\n\ndivisors: 1,2.\n\nFor g=1: k=0 → x=2, y=4 → lcm=4.\n\nFor g=2: a mod2=0 →k=0 → x=2, y=4 → same.\n\nSo minimal is 4, achieved at k=0.\n\nWhat if a=7, b=14 → d=7.\n\ndivisors: 1,7.\n\ng=1: k=0 → lcm=98.\n\ng=7: a mod7=0 →k=0 → same.\n\nSo output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=8, b=15 → d=7.\n\ndivisors:1,7.\n\ng=1: k=0 →x=8, y=15 → lcm=120.\n\ng=7: a mod7=1 →k=6. x=14, y=21 → lcm=42.\n\nSo minimal is 42, achieved at k=6.\n\nSo the code would correctly choose k=6.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where a=0? Well, the problem says a and b are at least 1, so no issue.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where a=1, b=1 → output 0.\n\nCase where a=1, b=2 → d=1.\n\ndivisors:1.\n\ng=1: a mod1=0 →k=0. x=1, y=2 → lcm=2.\n\nSo output is 0.\n\nAnother case: a=9, b=15 → d=6.\n\ndivisors of 6: 1,2,3,6.\n\nProcessing each:\n\ng=1: k=0 →x=9, y=15 → lcm=135.\n\ng=2: a mod2=1 →k=1. x=10, y=16 → lcm=80.\n\ng=3: a mod3=0 →k=0 →x=9, y=15 → lcm=45.\n\ng=6: a mod6=3 →k=3. x=12, y=21 → lcm=84.\n\nSo the minimal is 45, achieved at k=0.\n\nSo the code would correctly output 0.\n\nAnother case: a=4, b=6 →d=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=1: k=0 → lcm=24.\n\ng=2: a mod2=0 →k=0 → lcm=12.\n\nSo minimal is 12, achieved at k=0.\n\nSo code outputs 0.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nPotential problem: when d is 0. But code handles it.\n\nAnother potential issue: when d is 1, and a is 2, b is 3.\n\ndivisors:1.\n\ng=1: a mod1=0 →k=0. x=2, y=3 → lcm=6.\n\nNo other options.\n\nSo code returns 0.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read a and b, compute d.\n\nGenerate the divisors, process each, compute k, x, y, current_lcm, and track the minimal.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be something like:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d.\n\nIf d is zero, print 0.\n\nElse, generate all divisors of d.\n\nSort them.\n\nInitialize min_lcm as a large number, best_k as zero.\n\nFor each g in divisors:\n\n   rem = a % g\n\n   k = (g - rem) % g\n\n   x = a +k\n\n   y = b +k\n\n   current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n\n   if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n\n       min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n       best_k = k\n\nPrint best_k.\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, the divisors are sorted in increasing order. So, for a case where a=5, b=10, the code processes g=1, then g=5, then others. But in this case, the minimal is achieved at g=5, but perhaps another g gives a better result.\n\nBut in the code, all possible g's are considered, so the minimal is found correctly.\n\nAnother thing to note: the code is considering all divisors, including 1 and d.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the efficiency.\n\nFor d up to 1e9, the loop for generating divisors runs up to sqrt(d) which is 3e4 for d=1e9.

If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Observation on Difference**: The difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) remains constant when \\( k \\) is added to both. Let \\( d = |a - b| \\). This difference \\( d \\) plays a crucial role in determining the optimal \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: The optimal \\( k \\) must be such that \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) have a high greatest common divisor (GCD), which must be a divisor of \\( d \\). Therefore, we generate all divisors of \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\( k \\) for Each Divisor**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( a + k \\) is divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is given by \\( k = (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\).\n\n4. **Compute LCM**: For each divisor \\( g \\) and corresponding \\( k \\), compute the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). Track the minimum LCM and the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_optimal_k(a, b):\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Generate all divisors of d\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    divisors = sorted(divisors)\n    \n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        rem = a % g\n        k = (g - rem) % g\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        current_gcd = g\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n    \n    return best_k\n\n# Read input\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_optimal_k(a, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the absolute difference \\( d \\) between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n3. **Divisor Generation**: Generate all divisors of \\( d \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( d \\) and collecting both the divisor and its complement.\n4. **Optimal \\( k \\) Calculation**: For each divisor, compute the smallest \\( k \\) that makes \\( a + k \\) divisible by the divisor. Calculate the LCM for each \\( k \\) and track the minimum LCM and the corresponding smallest \\( k \\).\n5. **Output Result**: Print the smallest \\( k \\) that yields the minimal LCM.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
