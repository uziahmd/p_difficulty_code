    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. The task is to find the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears at least twice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. So, given a string like 'ababa', the output is 3 because the substring 'aba' appears twice. Oh right, and they can overlap. So for 'zzz', the substrings are 'zz' appearing twice, but wait, no—the entire string is length 3, so possible substrings longer than 2 can't appear more than once. So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the approach is to find all possible substrings, check if any of them occur at least twice, and then find the maximum length among those.\n\nBut considering the constraints, the string can be up to 100 characters long. So a brute-force approach might be manageable here since 100 isn't too big.\n\nWait, but generating all possible substrings and checking their occurrences could be time-consuming. Let's see: for a string of length n, there are O(n^2) substrings. For each substring, we need to check if it appears again somewhere else. So for each possible substring length l (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), we check all possible substrings of that length and see if any occurs more than once.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths l, starting from the largest possible (n-1) down to 1.\n2. For each l, generate all possible substrings of length l.\n3. For each such substring, check if it appears in the string again, possibly overlapping.\n4. If any substring of length l appears at least twice, then l is our answer.\n5. Return the first such l where this condition is met, which will be the largest possible.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read the input string.\n- For l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n   - For i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):\n      - current_sub = s[i:i+l]\n      - Check if current_sub appears again in s, starting from i+1.\n      - To check this, we can look for current_sub in s[i+1:], but with consideration that overlapping is allowed.\n      - Or, perhaps a better way is to track all substrings of length l and see if any appears more than once.\n- Once found, return l as the answer.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently check for duplicates? For each substring, I can keep a set of seen substrings. For each new substring, if it's already in the set, then return l. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nYes, that's a good approach. So for each l from the largest possible down to 1, we process all possible substrings of length l, and for each substring, if it's been seen before, we return l immediately.\n\nBecause once we find the largest possible l, we can stop processing.\n\nSo let's outline the code structure:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n# If no duplicates found, return 0\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but wait—what about when l is 1? Because for example, the string 'aaaaa' has all single characters appearing multiple times. But according to the sample inputs, like the third case 'zzz' which returns 2, because 'zz' appears twice. Wait, wait, no: the third sample input is ['zzz'], and the output is 2. So for l=2, the substrings are 'zz' at positions 0 and 1, which are overlapping. So in that case, the code correctly finds l=2.\n\nSo what about when all characters are unique? Like 'abcd'—the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababa' has length 5. For l=4, the substrings are 'abab' and 'baba'. Not duplicates. Then l=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So when i=0, substr is 'aba'; i=2, substr is 'aba' again. So when i=2, substr is 'aba' and it's already in seen, so the code returns 3.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nWhat about the string 'aaa'? The code would first check l=2. Substrings are 'aa' at i=0 and i=1. So when i=0, substr 'aa' is added to seen. Then i=1, substr 'aa' is checked and found in seen, so returns 2.\n\nWait, but in 'aaa' the maximum is 2, but the entire string is 3. So the code correctly returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'abacaba'—the maximum substring is 'aba' appearing three times. So for l=3, the code will find a duplicate quickly.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, thinking about edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All characters are unique. Output is 0.\n\nCase 2: All same characters, like 'aaaaa'. Then the maximum l is 4, because substrings of length 4 appear multiple times. Wait, no: for 'aaaaa', substrings of length 4 start at 0,1. Substring 'aaaa' occurs at both positions, so l=4 is the maximum.\n\nWait, but wait: the maximum possible l is n-1. For n=5, l can be 4.\n\nSo for the string 'aaaaa', the code will check l=4: substrings are s[0:4] = 'aaaa', s[1:5] = 'aaaa'. So when i=1, substr is 'aaaa' which was added when i=0, so l=4 is returned.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother case: 'ababab'. The maximum l is 4, because 'abab' appears at positions 0 and 2. So for l=4, the code will detect that.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is from n-1 down to 1. So for l in range(n-1, 0, -1). Wait, no—range in Python is exclusive on the upper bound. So for example, if n is 5, the range starts at 4, goes down to 1, but not including 0. So for l in 4,3,2,1.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother point: the code checks for each substring of length l, whether it has appeared before. So for each i, substr is s[i:i+l]. We check if it's in 'seen' before adding it. So for each i in order, when a substring is found in 'seen', we return l.\n\nThis ensures that the first occurrence of a duplicate (in terms of processing order) is found, which is the earliest possible, and since we're checking from largest l down, it returns the correct maximum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, let's think about the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' — all substrings are unique, so output is 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' — l=3 is the maximum.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' — l=2 is the maximum.\n\nSo the code should output the correct results.\n\nTesting the code with these samples.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaa' — the code would return l=3, since 'aaa' appears at i=0 and i=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcdeabcde' — the entire string is 10 characters. The maximum substring is 5, which appears at position 0 and 5. So the code should return 5.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",

These occurrences can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a string and need to find the length of its longest substring that appears at least twice. The occurrences can overlap.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each possible length `l` starting from the largest possible (length of the string minus one) down to 1, generate all substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: For each substring of length `l`, check if it has appeared before. Use a set to keep track of seen substrings.\n4. **Return Result**: If any substring of length `l` is found to be a duplicate, return `l` immediately as it will be the longest valid substring. If no duplicates are found for any length, return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Loop over possible substring lengths from the largest possible (length of the string minus one) down to 1.\n3. **Check Each Substring**: For each length `l`, generate all possible substrings of that length. Use a set to keep track of these substrings.\n4. **Check for Duplicates**: For each substring, check if it has been seen before.
