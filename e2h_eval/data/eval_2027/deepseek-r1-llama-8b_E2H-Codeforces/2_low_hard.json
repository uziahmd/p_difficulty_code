Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square of letters forms an 'X'. The conditions are specific. Valera's paper is a square with side length n (n is odd). We need to check if the letters form an X. \n\nHmm, what's the criteria for an X? From the description, on both diagonals, all letters must be the same. And all the other squares (the ones not on either diagonal) must contain the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, right. So the first step is to identify the two diagonals. For a square matrix, the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left.\n\nSo, for each cell in these diagonals, they must all be the same character. Let's call this 'c1'. Then, all the other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same as each other but different from c1. Let's call this 'c2'.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input is n followed by n lines, each containing n characters. Since the input is given as a string, I need to parse it correctly. Each line represents a row of the grid.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I need to extract the main and anti-diagonals. For example, in a 5x5 grid:\n\nPositions on the main diagonal are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4).\nAnti-diagonal: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nWait, but in the sample input, one of them is 3x3. Like the second sample has 3x3 grid. So for a 3x3, main diagonal is [0][0], [1][1], [2][2]. Anti-diagonal is [0][2], [1][1], [2][0].\n\nSo, for each grid, I can collect the main and anti-diagonal elements.\n\nBut wait, the main and anti-diagonals intersect at the center cell when n is odd. That's why in the sample input 3x3, the center is part of both.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n2. Collect the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n3. Check that all elements in main diagonal are the same, let's say 'c1'.\n4. Check that all elements in anti-diagonal are 'c1' as well.\n5. Then, collect all non-diagonal elements. They must all be the same, 'c2', and c2 must not be equal to c1.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what if the grid is such that the main and anti-diagonals have different characters? Like, suppose the main diagonal has all 'x's, but the anti has 'y's. Then, it's invalid because the anti-diagonal must also be the same as the main.\n\nSo, first, I should check that all the main diagonal is the same, all the anti-diagonal is the same, and both are the same as each other.\n\nThen, for the non-diagonal cells, check that all are the same and different from c1.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read n lines, each line being a string of length n. Store this as a 2D list or grid.\n- Extract the main diagonal: for i from 0 to n-1, take grid[i][i].\n- Extract the anti-diagonal: for i from 0 to n-1, take grid[i][n-1 - i].\n- Check if all elements in main diagonal are the same. Let's get c1.\n- Check if all elements in anti-diagonal are same as c1.\n- Now, for all cells not on either diagonal: iterate through each cell (i,j). If (i,j) is not on main or anti-diagonal, collect their values. All these must be same, and not equal to c1.\n\nWait, but the non-diagonal cells could include cells on either diagonal but not both. No, because the main and anti-diagonal only overlap at the center when n is odd.\n\nWait, no. For a cell to be on both diagonals, it's only possible if it's the center cell. For example, in 5x5, the cell (2,2) is on both. In 3x3, (1,1) is on both.\n\nSo, when collecting the non-diagonal cells, we need to make sure that for any cell (i,j), it's not on main or anti-diagonal.\n\nSo, for each cell, check if (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The criteria for forming an \"X\" are specific and require checking both diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` which represents the size of the grid, followed by reading the grid itself.\n2. **Extract Diagonals**: Identify the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n3. **Check Diagonals**: Ensure all elements in both diagonals are the same character, `c1`.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure all elements not on either diagonal are the same character, `c2`, and `c2` is different from `c1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if all elements in a list are the same\ndef all_same(lst):\n    return all(x == lst[0] for x in lst)\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n - 1 - i])\n\nc1 = main_diag[0]\nif not all_same(main_diag) or not all_same(anti_diag) or c1 != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check the non-diagonal cells\nc2 = None\nis_valid = True\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if (i == j or i + j == n - 1) and (i != j or i != (n-1 -j)):\n            continue\n        if c2 is None:\n            c2 = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != c2:\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n    if not is_valid:\n        break\n\nif is_valid and c2 != c1:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored as a list of lists where each sublist represents a row in the grid.\n2. **Diagonals Extraction**: We extract the main and anti-diagonals by iterating through the grid and collecting elements that lie on these diagonals.\n3. **Diagonal Check**: We verify that all elements in both diagonals are the same. If they are not, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n4. **Non-Diagonal Check**: We ensure all elements outside the diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal character. If any element fails this check, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms the letter \"X\".",
