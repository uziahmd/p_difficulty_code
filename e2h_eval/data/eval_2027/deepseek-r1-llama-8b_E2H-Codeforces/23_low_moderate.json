            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, each with a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). The goal is to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu, which is either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, right. So the task is to determine, for each possible scenario, what's the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, \"1s 2s 3s\" is a shuntsu already, so the output for that would be zero. Similarly, if all three are the same like \"9m 9m 9m\", then it's a koutsu, so output is zero.\n\nFor the third example given, the input is ['3p 9m 2p'], so the tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p. Wait, wait, no: the input is three separate tiles, each as a string. So in that case, the three tiles are 3p, 9m, and 2p. So she has one tile of each except for 9m, which is only one. Wait no, let me check:\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWait, wait no, perhaps each element is a single tile? Or is the input a list of three tiles, each being a single tile?\n\nWait the problem statement says: the input is three strings—each string represents a tile. So for example, the first example input is three tiles: '1s', '2s', '3s'—so she has those three, which form a shuntsu. So she doesn't need to draw any.\n\nThe second example: the three tiles are '9m', '9m', '9m'—so a koutsu, so again zero.\n\nThe third example: the three tiles are '3p', '9m', '2p'. So she has 3p, 9m, and 2p. So she has one tile each. To form a shuntsu, she needs three consecutive in the same suit. So possible options:\n\nLooking at each suit:\n\nFor m: 9m is present. So she needs 8m and 10m, but 10m is invalid. So that's not possible.\n\nFor p: she has 3p and 2p. So if she draws 1p, then she has 1p, 2p, 3p—so that's a shuntsu. Or if she draws 4p, then 2p, 3p,4p is also a shuntsu. So she needs one more tile.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the output is 0, 0, 1 for each of the three cases.\n\nSo the problem is: for each of the three initial hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add so that at least one mentsu exists.\n\nNow, how to model this.\n\nIdea:\n\nWe need to consider all possible mentsu that could be formed by adding some tiles. For each possible mentsu, calculate the minimal number of tiles needed to complete it, and then pick the smallest across all possibilities.\n\nBut considering that the initial hand is three tiles, and we can add any number of tiles (including zero), this might be computationally intensive.\n\nBut since the maximum number of tiles after drawing is 3 + d, where d is the number of draws, but d can be up to... well, in the worst case, perhaps 3, but probably less.\n\nBut to find the minimal d, perhaps we can precompute all possible mentsu that can be formed, and for each, determine how many tiles are missing from the initial hand.\n\nThen, the minimal d is the minimal among these.\n\nBut how do we generate all possible mentsu that can be formed given the initial tiles plus the added ones?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible mentsu, check how many tiles from the initial hand are present, and the required tiles that are not present. Then, the minimal number of draws needed is the number of missing tiles for that mentsu.\n\nWait, but the initial hand may have some tiles that belong to multiple mentsu. So we need to evaluate all possible mentsu that can be formed, and for each, compute the minimal number of tiles needed, then take the minimal across all.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo",
