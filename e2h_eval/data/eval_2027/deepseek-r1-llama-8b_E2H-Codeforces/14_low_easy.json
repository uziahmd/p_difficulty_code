He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nWait, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. But wait, also considering higher powers like 25, 125, etc., which contribute more than one 5 each.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is given by dividing n by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, and so on until the division results in zero. So Z(n) = sum_{i=1}^k floor(n/(5^i)) where 5^k <=n.\n\nBut the problem is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then output the count and the list of such n's.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I need to find the minimal n where Z(n) equals m. Then find the maximum n where Z(n) is still m. All the numbers between these two (inclusive) will be the solutions.\n\nWait, but how do I find the minimal and maximal n for a given m?\n\nI think binary search can be used here. Because Z(n) is a non-decreasing function as n increases. So for a given m, the possible n's lie within a certain range.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n2. Then check if Z(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution (since m may be higher than any possible Z(n)).\n3. Otherwise, find the largest n where Z(n) == m.\n4. The count is (max_n - min_n + 1). The list is [min_n, min_n+1, ..., max_n].\n\nWait, but wait. How do I find the minimal n? Let me think.\n\nWe can perform a binary search over n to find the first occurrence where Z(n) is equal to m. Or perhaps, since Z(n) can jump over m, maybe we need to find the lower bound where Z(n) is at least m, and then see if it's exactly m.\n\nAlternatively, for the minimal n, it's the smallest n where Z(n) = m. Similarly, the maximum n is the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n\nWait, let me think about an example. For m=5.\n\nLooking at the sample input, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. So min_n is 5, max_n is 9. Z(5)=1, wait no, wait:\n\nWait no, wait in the sample input, the first case is m=1 and m=5? Or wait, the input is ['1', '5'], so the outputs are for m=1 and m=5.\n\nWait, no, the input is a single integer m. Oh, the user input is a single integer m. So for m=5, the output is 5,6,7,8,9 because 5! has 1 zero, wait no. Wait, wait, wait, let's calculate Z(5):\n\nZ(5) = 5/5 = 1. So for m=1, the numbers are 5, since 5! is 120.\n\nWait, but in the sample, when the input is '1', the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Wait, no, wait the sample input is probably two test cases: one with m=1 and another with m=5. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait the sample input is ['1', '5'], but in the output, for the first case, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and for the second, '0'. Wait, no, the sample output shows two lines. Wait, the sample input is ['1', '5']—so perhaps it's two different m values. But that might not be the case; perhaps the input is a single line containing two integers, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the problem statement says the input is a single integer m. So the sample input must be a typo or perhaps a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is two lines, but that's unclear.\n\nWell, regardless, for the problem, the approach is to find all n's where Z(n) equals m.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. Then, check if Z(n) is m. If not, then there are zero solutions",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves finding the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy this condition using efficient algorithms.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by the count of the factor 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and higher powers of 5 contribute more zeroes.\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeroes equals \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the largest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeroes equals \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: Once the bounds are found, the count of valid \\( n \\) values is the difference between the upper and lower bounds plus one. If no such \\( n \\) exists, the result is zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(m):\n    def trailing_zero(n):\n        count = 0\n        while n > 0:\n            n = n // 5\n            count += n\n        return count\n\n    # Find lower bound\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m  # Initial guess for lower bound\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if trailing_zero(mid) < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    lower = left\n\n    # Check if lower has exactly m zeros\n    if trailing_zero(lower) != m:\n        return (0, [])\n\n    # Find upper bound\n    left, right = lower, 5 * m  # Initial guess for upper bound\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if trailing_zero(mid) <= m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    upper = left - 1\n\n    # Now, collect all n from lower to upper inclusive\n    count = upper - lower + 1\n    return (count, list(range(lower, upper + 1)))\n\nm = int(input())\ncount, ns = count_trailing_zeros(m)\nprint(count)\nif count > 0:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, ns)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Trailing Zero Calculation**: The function `trailing_zero(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions of each power of 5.\n- **Binary Search for Bounds**: Using binary search, we efficiently determine the smallest and largest \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n- **Result Construction**: After determining the bounds, we construct the result by counting the valid \\( n \\) values and listing them if they exist.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately find the required range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large inputs.",
