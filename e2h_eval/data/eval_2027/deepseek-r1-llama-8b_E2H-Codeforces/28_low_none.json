String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of beautiful strings based on given constraints. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, a beautiful string is a binary string consisting of 0s and 1s. It must satisfy two conditions: the number of 0s is exactly n, and the number of 1s is exactly m. But there's more. The string can be transformed into a string that ends with g (either 0 or 1) by performing some modifications.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the way the problem is phrased: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So, after some modifications, the string must end with g. But the initial string is beautiful as per the counts, but it might not end with g. So, the task is to count all such beautiful strings s where, through modifications, we can end up with a string that ends with g.\n\nHmm, so the question is, for each beautiful string s, can it be modified in some way to result in a string that ends with g? And we need to count all such s.\n\nBut wait, how do the modifications work? Each modification replaces the last two characters with one. So, each modification reduces the length by 1. For example, \"01010\" becomes \"0100\" after one modification, then \"011\" after another. Or maybe other possibilities depending on what's being replaced.\n\nSo, the key is to determine for each possible beautiful string s whether it's possible to perform some number of modifications to make the last character equal to g.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as some kind of state transition, tracking the possible endings after each modification.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the string after modifications.\n\nEach modification affects the last two characters. So, the last character depends on the previous steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the crucial observation is that the last character after k modifications depends on the original string in a certain way. Because each modification reduces the length by 1, starting from some length L, after k modifications, the length becomes L - k.\n\nBut what determines the last character? Let's think about it.\n\nEach modification replaces the last two characters. Let's say the string is s_0 s_1 ... s_{L-2} s_{L-1}. After a modification, it becomes s_0 s_1 ... s_{L-2} c, where c is determined by s_{L-2} and s_{L-1}.\n\nSpecifically, if both are 0, replace with 1. If both are 1, replace with 0. Otherwise, replace with 0 if one is 0 and the other is 1. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: the new character is 1 if it replaces two zeros; else, it's 0. So, when you have two 0s, you get a 1. Any other case (two 1s or a 0 and 1), you get 0.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem statement again: \"replace two last characters by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\n\nAh, right. So, during each modification, if the last two are 00, they become 1. In all other cases, they become 0.\n\nSo, each modification step depends on the last two bits of the current string.\n\nSo, the process is deterministic based on the current state.\n\nNow, the question is, for a beautiful string s (with exactly n 0s and m 1s), can we perform a series of modifications such that the resulting string ends with g?\n\nI think we can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where the state is the current last two characters and the current length. But since n and m can be up to 105, the total possible length is up to 210, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but the initial string has length n + m. Each modification reduces the length by 1, so the maximum number of modifications is n + m - 1. But perhaps for each possible ending state (after any number of modifications), we can see whether it's possible to reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nBut that seems computationally intensive. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAnother approach: for the original string, consider its parity in terms of 0s and 1s. Because each modification can only change certain things, perhaps the final outcome depends on the initial configuration.\n\nWait, let's think about the final step. Suppose the string has been modified k times, so the length is L = (n + m) - k. The last character is determined by the process of merging.\n\nWe want the last character to be g. So, we need to find all possible ways that, after some k modifications, the last character",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string ending with a specific character after a series of modifications. The solution involves understanding the effect of each modification and using dynamic programming to track possible states.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A beautiful string is a binary string with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones.\n   - Modifications replace the last two characters with one character based on specific rules.\n   - We need to determine if a beautiful string can be modified such that it ends with `g`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Each modification affects the last two characters of the string.\n   - The transformation of these characters depends on whether they are both zeros or not.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - Use a DP table where `dp[k][a][b]` represents the number of ways to reach a state where the last two characters are `a` and `b` after `k` modifications.\n   - Track transitions based on the rules of modifications.\n\n4. **State Transitions**:\n   - For each state, consider all possible previous states and apply the modification rules to update the current state.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - After processing all possible modifications, check if the last character can be `g` and sum up the valid configurations.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_len = n + m\ndp = [[[0 for _ in range(2)] for __ in range(2)] for ___ in range(max_len + 1)]\n\n# Base case: initial string without any modifications\nif max_len >= 1:\n    dp[0][0][0] = (n > 0)\n    dp[0][0][1] = (m > 0)\nelse:\n    dp[0][0][0] = 0\n    dp[0][0][1] = 0\n\nfor k in range(1, max_len + 1):\n    for a in [0, 1]:\n        for b in [0, 1]:\n            if dp[k-1][a][b] == 0:\n                continue\n            # Apply the modification rule\n            if a == 0 and b == 0:\n                new_char = 1\n            else:\n                new_char = 0\n            # Update the new state\n            if k <= max_len:\n                dp[k][b][new_char] += dp[k-1][a][b]\n                dp[k][b][new_char] %= MOD\n\n# Now, collect all possible end states where the last character is g\nresult = 0\nfor k in range(max_len, 0, -1):\n    if k > max_len:\n        continue\n    for b in [0, 1]:\n        if len(dp[k]) < 2:\n            continue\n        for c in [0, 1]:\n            if len(dp[k][b]) < 2:\n                continue\n            if (k == max_len - 1) and (c == g):\n                result += dp[k][b][c]\n                result %= MOD\n\nprint(result % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to modify the string such that it ends with the desired character `g`. It initializes the DP table to represent the initial state of the string and then iteratively applies the modification rules to update the possible states. Finally, it sums up the valid configurations that result in the last character being `g`, providing the count modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).",
