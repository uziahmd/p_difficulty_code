Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain substrings as they are added to a string S. Each modification appends either a '0' or '1' to S, and after each step, I need to compute the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code. The answer has to be modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So, each time I add a character to S, I need to find all possible substrings that can form a valid Morse code for an English letter. Then, count the number of unique sequences these substrings represent.\n\nWait, but the Morse code for each letter is unique, right? Except for those four bad strings. So any substring that is not one of those four bad strings corresponds to exactly one letter.\n\nSo, for each possible substring of S (after each step), if the substring is a valid Morse code, it contributes to the count. But since the same Morse code can appear as different substrings, but each represents the same letter, we have to make sure that each valid Morse code is only counted once per occurrence.\n\nWait no, the question says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". So each substring is considered as a Morse code, and each such code corresponds to exactly one English letter. So the total is the number of distinct Morse codes that are present as substrings in S.\n\nWait no, wait. Because multiple substrings can represent the same Morse code. For example, in the sample, \"11\" appears as the second and third characters. But each occurrence is still the same Morse code, which is one letter. So when counting, each Morse code is considered once, regardless of how many times it appears. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So each such sequence is a concatenation of letters, each of which comes from a substring of S. So for example, if a substring is \"11\", that's one letter, say 'M'. Another substring could be \"111\", which is another letter, say 'O'. But if two different substrings correspond to the same Morse code, then their corresponding letters are the same.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the number of sequences, which are formed by the Morse codes of the substrings. Wait no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the number of distinct Morse code substrings present, each representing a unique letter. Because each Morse code can represent one letter, except for the four bad ones, which don't correspond to any letter.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that each Morse code (string of 0s and 1s) of length up to 4, except the four bad ones, corresponds to a unique English letter. So for any substring of S, if its Morse code is valid (i.e., it's not one of the four bad strings), then it contributes to the count of letters. But each such valid Morse code is exactly one letter, so each occurrence of a valid Morse code substring contributes one to the total.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Because the problem is asking for the number of non-empty sequences of English letters. So each such sequence is formed by selecting a set of substrings, each of which corresponds to a letter. So for example, if there are two substrings \"1\" and \"11\" in S, their corresponding letters would be 'T' and 'M', forming a sequence 'TM'.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the number of such sequences. That sounds complicated because it would involve considering all possible combinations of substrings, which could be exponential. But that's impossible for m=3000. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem statement: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Hmm. So each sequence is a concatenation of one or more letters, where each letter is represented by a substring of S. So for example, if S is \"111\", the possible substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\". Each corresponds to a letter. So the possible sequences are:\n\n- 'T' (from \"1\")\n- 'M' (from \"11\")\n- 'O' (from \"111\")\n- 'TT' (from \"11\" followed by \"1\"? No, wait, the substrings are individual. So each letter is a single substring, so the sequences are formed by selecting any number of non-overlapping substrings, but they must be consecutive? Or can they be anywhere?\n\nNo, the problem says \"some substring of S\", which implies that each letter is a single substring. So the sequences are made by concatenating one or more letters,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed from substrings of a string S after each modification. Each modification appends either a '0' or '1' to S, and we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity**: Each valid Morse code string (composed of '0's and '1's) corresponds to exactly one English letter, except for four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP array `dp[i]` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid Morse code strings ending at position `i` in the string S.\n3. **Transition**: For each new character added to S, update the DP array based on whether the new character forms a valid Morse code string when combined with previous characters.\n4. **Count Valid Substrings**: Maintain a count of all valid Morse code substrings encountered so far.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    chars = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    # We'll represent the state as the current dp array and the total count\n    # Initialize dp: dp[i] is the number of valid substrings ending at position i\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        c = chars[i-1]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        if i >= 4:\n            # Check all possible substrings ending at i with length 1, 2, 3, 4\n            for l in range(1, 5):\n                start = i - l\n                if start < 0:\n                    continue\n                substring = ''.join(chars[start:i])\n                if substring not in {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}:\n                    dp[i] += dp[start]\n        else:\n            substring = c\n            if substring not in {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}:\n                dp[i] += 1\n        \n        # Update total\n        total = (total + dp[i]) % MOD\n        \n        print(total % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input values and initialize the DP array and a counter for the total number of valid substrings.\n2. **Iterate Through Modifications**: For each modification, append the character to the string and update the DP array.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each new character, check all possible substrings ending at this character (of lengths 1 to 4). If a substring is valid (not one of the four invalid codes), update the DP value.\n4. **Update Total Count**: After each modification, update the total count of valid substrings and print the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid Morse code substrings using dynamic programming and ensures that each modification is processed in constant time, making the solution suitable for large inputs.",
