Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about moving from home to university in Crazy Town, which is divided into blocks by roads. Each road is an infinite line. The key point is that you can move between adjacent blocks in one step. But how do we determine if two blocks are adjacent?\n\nHmm, the problem says that two blocks are considered adjacent if their shared border has a non-zero length. So, for example, if two blocks meet at a single point (like a corner), that doesn't count as a shared border. They must share a line segment longer than zero.\n\nThe task is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nSo, what's the approach here? Well, each step allows us to cross a road. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. And each road can only be crossed once, right? Because once you're on one side, you can't get back without crossing again, but the problem allows any number of steps as long as they are minimal.\n\nWait, wait. No, because you can cross a road multiple times, but each time it's a new step. But perhaps the minimal path doesn't require that. Hmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Each time you cross a road, you switch the side of that road. So, the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Because each such road needs to be crossed once.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each step crosses exactly one road. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that the home and university lie on opposite sides of. Because each such road contributes one step.\n\nOh right! So the problem reduces to counting how many lines (roads) separate the home and the university. Each such line will need to be crossed once.\n\nSo the solution is:\n\nFor each of the n roads, check whether the home and university are on the same side or not. If they are on opposite sides for a particular road, then that road contributes +1 to the answer.\n\nBut wait, how do I determine if the home and university are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nEach road is given by the equation a*x + b*y + c = 0. For a point (x0, y0), plugging into the equation gives a value s = a*x0 + b*y0 + c. If s is positive, negative, or zero, it tells us which side of the line the point is on.\n\nBut since the home and university are not on any road, their s values for each road will never be zero. So for each road, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If s1 and s2 have different signs (s1 * s2 < 0), then the points are on opposite sides of the road, so this road must be crossed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal steps required is the count of such roads where s1*s2 < 0.\n\nThat seems straightforward. So the algorithm is:\n\n1. Read home and university coordinates.\n2. Read all the roads, storing a, b, c for each.\n3. For each road, calculate s1 and s2 for home and university.\n4. If s1*s2 < 0, increment the count.\n5. Output the count.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if a road is vertical or horizontal? No, the method works regardless of the orientation.\n\nWhat about when a line is very close to the home or university? Doesn't matter because we just compute the sign.\n\nWhat if the same line is represented differently but is the same? But the problem states that no two roads are the same, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nAnother thing: the home and university are guaranteed not to lie on any road, so s1 and s2 will never be zero, so the product can't be zero. So no division by zero issues.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the inputs:\n\n- Read home (x1, y1)\n- Read university (x2, y2)\n- Read n\n- For each of the next n lines, read a, b, c.\n\nThen, for each road, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. Check if s1*s2 < 0. Count such roads.\n\nFinally, output the count as a string.\n\nWait, the sample input shows something like:\n\nInput:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nWhich represents two roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 (y=0) and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road defined by an infinite line.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each road is an infinite line, and moving from one block to another requires crossing a road.\n   - The minimal number of steps is determined by the number of roads that separate the home block from the university block. Specifically, each such road must be crossed exactly once.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides. If they are, this road must be crossed, contributing one step to the total count.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates.\n   - Determine if these values have opposite signs, indicating the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n   - Count the number of such roads to get the minimum steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read home and university coordinates\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Inputs**: The coordinates of home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Checking Each Road**: For each road, we compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, it means the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n- **Counting Crossings**: The number of such roads where the home and university are on opposite sides gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs relative to given points.",
