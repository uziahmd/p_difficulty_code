    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side (left, right, top, bottom) loses 2 cells. Wait, no. Wait, each ring is one cell wide, but how does that translate in terms of the dimensions?\n\nWait, for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w x h. For i=2, it's (w-4) x (h-4), and so on. But wait, the i-th ring is the border of the rectangle of size (w -4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). So for each ring, the perimeter is calculated based on these dimensions.\n\nBut the perimeter for a rectangle is 2*(width + height) -4, right? Because the four corners are counted once each. So for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, calculate the current_w and current_h as w -4*(i-1) and h-4*(i-1). Then compute the perimeter, which is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, and sum all these perimeters for i=1 to k.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input values w, h, k.\n2. Initialize a total count to 0.\n3. For each ring i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   c. If current_w < 3 or current_h <3, then this ring is not possible. But according to the constraints, k is such that this doesn't happen. So we don't need to handle that.\n   d. Compute the perimeter: 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   e. Add this to the total.\n4. Output the total.\n\nWait, let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1\n\nFor i=1:\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3\nperimeter= 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8. So output is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9\nperimeter is 2*(16) -4 =32-4=28. Correct.\n\nThird example:7 9 2\nWe have two rings.\n\nRing 1: 7x9 → 2*(16) -4=28\nRing 2:7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(8) -4=12. Total 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. So, something like:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop for i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w -4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\ntotal += perimeter\n\nFinally, print(total).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nWhat if w=3, h=3, k=1: 8 as before.\n\nWhat if k is the maximum allowed? Like when min(w, h) is say 7, then max k is floor( (7+1)/4 )=2.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, for example, min(w, h) is 7, then (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So k can be up to 2.\n\nWhich is the third example.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1.\n\nPerimeter: 2*(5+5) -4=20-4=16.\n\nIf k=2, then ring 2 is 1x1. So perimeter is 2*(1+1) -4= -0? Wait, no. Wait 1+1 is 2, 2*2=4, minus 4 is 0. That can't be right.\n\nWait, wait, for a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter would be 4 cells (the four sides?), but wait, 1x1 has only one cell. So maybe my formula is incorrect for small rectangles.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(width + height) -4. For a 1x1 rectangle, that's 2*(2) -4 = 0. That suggests that for a 1x1, there are zero perimeter cells. But in reality, it's one cell.\n\nHmm, that indicates a problem with the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is the number of cells along the border. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter is 2*(W + H) -4.\n\nBecause, for each row, the top and bottom are length W, but subtracting the 2 corners which are counted twice.\n\nWait, for W=3, H=3: 2*(3+3) -4= 12-4=8, which is correct.\n\nFor W=1, H=1: 2*(2) -4=0. But that's wrong, as the single cell is the perimeter.\n\nAh, so the formula works only when W and H are at least 2. But in our case, the rings are added until the inner rectangle is 1x1? Or perhaps the problem statement says that each ring is formed on the rectangle of size (w-4(i-1))x(h-4(i-1)), but only as long as that rectangle is valid.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that k is such that it won't cause any issues. So perhaps in our code, we don't have to worry about the case where the current_w or current_h is less than 1. Because the input ensures that.\n\nWait, looking back: the constraints say 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for a 5x5 grid, min is 5, (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1 only.\n\nWait, no, wait 5/4 is 1.25, so adding 1 gives 6, divided by 4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1.\n\nWait, let me take another example. Suppose w=7, h=7. min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2. So k can be up to 2.\n\nFor i=1: 7x7 → perimeter 28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 3x7-4=3. So 3x3 → perimeter 8. Sum 36.\n\nSo for w=7, h=7, k=2, the total is 28+8=36.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1. Output is 16.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=2. Let's see:\n\ni=1: 5x5 → 2*(10)-4=16.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1, 1x1. So 2*(2) -4=0. So total is 16+0=16. Is that correct? According to the problem statement, the rings are formed on the inner rectangle. So for i=2, the rectangle is 1x1. So the ring is the perimeter of that, which is just 1 cell.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, for 1x1 it's 0. So the code would give 16+0=16, but the actual number should be 1.\n\nHmm, this indicates a problem with the formula. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's the correct way to calculate the perimeter for a rectangle that's 1x1?\n\nWell, the rectangle is 1x1, so its perimeter is all four sides, but each side is 1 cell. So the total is 4. But according to the formula, 2*(1+1)-4=0. So the formula is wrong for 1x1.\n\nSo my initial approach is incorrect. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is 2*(w + h) -4, but only when w >=2 and h >=2. Otherwise, for 1x1, it's 4.\n\nBut how do we handle that?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nEach ring is defined as all the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. So for a 1x1 rectangle, the bordering cells are just 1 cell (the single cell itself). So the perimeter for 1x1 is 1.\n\nSo the formula must be adjusted.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct perimeter formula is:\n\nif w <=1 or h <=1: perimeter is max(w, h)\n\nelse: 2*(w + h) -4\n\nWait, for w=3, h=3: 2*(3+3)-4=8 → correct.\n\nw=1, h=1: 1.\n\nw=1, h=5: 5 (since it's a single row, the perimeter is 5 cells).\n\nSimilarly, w=5, h=1: 5.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, each ring is a full ring, but for the 1x1 case, it's just one cell.\n\nSo perhaps the correct perimeter calculation is:\n\nif current_w == 1 and current_h ==1: perimeter is 1.\n\nelif current_w ==1: perimeter is current_h.\n\nelif current_h ==1: perimeter is current_w.\n\nelse: 2*(current_w + current_h) -4.\n\nThat way, for 1x1, it's 1, for 1x5 it's 5, etc.\n\nBut how does this fit into the problem constraints?\n\nWait, the problem says that k is chosen such that the rings are possible. So perhaps the code will never have to deal with a 1x1 rectangle except when current_w and current_h are 1.\n\nBut then, in that case, the perimeter is 1, not 0.\n\nSo in the earlier test case where i=2 for w=5, h=5, the current_w and current_h are 1 and 1, so the perimeter is 1, making the total 16+1=17.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, it's 16+0=16, which is incorrect.\n\nSo this suggests that the formula needs adjustment.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement's third example, after two rings, the inner rectangle is 3x5, but wait no:\n\nWait, initial w=7, h=9, k=2.\n\nRing 1: 7x9 → perimeter 28.\n\nRing 2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5 → 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4= 16-4=12. So 28+12=40.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut for 5x5, k=2:\n\nRing 1: 5x5 → perimeter 16.\n\nRing 2: 1x1 → perimeter 1. So total 17.\n\nSo the initial approach would have given 16+0=16, which is wrong.\n\nSo the formula is wrong for 1x1.\n\nThus, the code needs to account for that.\n\nSo how to modify the code?\n\nWe need to adjust the perimeter calculation based on whether current_w and current_h are both 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nperimeter = 2*(w + h - 2) if w>1 and h>1 else max(w, h)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor 3x3: 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8 → correct.\n\nFor 1x1: max(1,1)=1 → correct.\n\nFor 1x5: 5 → correct.\n\nFor 5x5: 2*(5+5-2)= 2*8=16 → correct.\n\nSo yes, the correct formula is:\n\nif current_w > 1 and current_h > 1:\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nelse:\n\n    perimeter = max(current_w, current_h)\n\nSo that's the formula.\n\nSo now, the code needs to adjust for this.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nfor each ring i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nif current_w <=0 or current_h <=0:\n\n    break (but according to constraints, this won't happen)\n\nif current_w ==1 and current_h ==1:\n\n    perimeter =1\n\nelif current_w ==1:\n\n    perimeter = current_h\n\nelif current_h ==1:\n\n    perimeter = current_w\n\nelse:\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h -2)\n\nadd this to the total.\n\nWait, but in the case where current_w is 1 and current_h is greater than 1, like 1x5, the perimeter is 5.\n\nSo the code will correctly handle that.\n\nSo in the earlier test case of 5x5 and k=2:\n\nring 1: 5x5 → 2*(5+5-2)= 2*8=16.\n\nring 2: 1x1 → perimeter 1.\n\nTotal 17.\n\nSo the code would produce 17 instead of 16.\n\nBut wait, what's the actual required output for that case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's third example:\n\nIn the third example, the output is 40 when k=2, which uses 3x5. So the formula correctly calculates 12 for that case.\n\nBut for 5x5, k=2, the expected output is 16+1=17.\n\nSo the code needs to correctly compute this.\n\nThus, the code must include this condition.\n\nSo now, the code structure becomes:\n\nread w, h, k.\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    if cw <=0 or ch <=0:\n\n        # but according to constraints, this won't happen.\n\n        break\n\n    if cw ==1 and ch ==1:\n\n        p =1\n\n    elif cw ==1:\n\n        p = ch\n\n    elif ch ==1:\n\n        p = cw\n\n    else:\n\n        p = 2*(cw + ch -2)\n\n    total += p\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo let's test some cases.\n\nTest case 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nYes.\n\nTest case 2: 7 9 2 → 28 +12=40.\n\nYes.\n\nTest case 3: 5 5 2 → 16+1=17.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 1 → 16.\n\nAnother test case: 5 1 1 → perimeter is 5.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother case: 1 5 1 → perimeter 5.\n\nAnother case: 1 1 1 → 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead w, h, k:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nInitialize total=0.\n\nLoop for i in 1 to k:\n\nCompute cw and ch.\n\nCompute p based on the conditions.\n\nAdd p to total.\n\nPrint total.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    cw = w - 4*(i-1)\n    ch = h - 4*(i-1)\n    if cw ==1 and ch ==1:\n        p = 1\n    elif cw ==1:\n        p = ch\n    elif ch ==1:\n        p = cw\n    else:\n        p = 2 * (cw + ch - 2)\n    total += p\nprint(total)\n\nThat should work.\n\nTesting the third example: 7 9 2.\n\ni=1:\n\ncw=7, ch=9. So 2*(7+9-2)= 2*14=28. total=28.\n\ni=2:\n\ncw=3, ch=5. So 2*(3+5-2)= 2*6=12. total=40.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 2.\n\ni=1: 5x5 → 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\n\ni=2: 1x1 → 1. Total 17.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: 1 5 1 → 5.\n\nAnother test case: 1 1 1 → 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed around an inner rectangle that is progressively smaller by 2 cells on each side.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Ring Structure**: Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on.\n2. **Calculate Perimeter for Each Ring**: For each ring, the perimeter (number of gilded cells) can be calculated based on the dimensions of the current inner rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is adjusted to handle edge cases where the rectangle might be very small (e.g., 1x1).\n3. **Summing Up**: Sum the perimeters of all k rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    cw = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    ch = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    if cw == 1 and ch == 1:\n        p = 1\n    elif cw == 1:\n        p = ch\n    elif ch == 1:\n        p = cw\n    else:\n        p = 2 * (cw + ch - 2)\n    total += p\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (w), height (h), and number of rings (k).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the current width and height of the inner rectangle.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - If the rectangle is 1x1, the perimeter is 1.\n   - If the rectangle is a single row or column, the perimeter is the length of that row or column.\n   - Otherwise, use the standard perimeter formula adjusted for the rectangle's dimensions.\n4. **Summing Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeter of each ring to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and applying the appropriate perimeter formula based on the current dimensions of the inner rectangle.",
