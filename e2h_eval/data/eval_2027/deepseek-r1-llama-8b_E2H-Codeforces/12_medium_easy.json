The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So the i-th task can only be done after she's handled all earlier ones.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first test case, n=4, m=3, and the tasks are 3,2,3. The optimal path is 1 → 2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. That's 6 steps.\n\nWait, why is that the case? Let's see:\n\nShe starts at 1. Then she needs to do task 1 (a1=3). She moves from 1 to 2 (1 step), then 2 to 3 (another, total 2). Then she does task 2 (a2=2), which she's already there, no movement. Then task 3 is a3=3, which is next. But wait, she has to go back to 3. So from 3, she needs to go to 4, then back to 1, then 2, then 3 again. So that's 4 steps for those three tasks. Wait, but the total steps were 6.\n\nWait, let me recount: 1→2 is 1, 2→3 is 2, then 3→4 is 3, 4→1 is 4, 1→2 is 5, 2→3 is 6. Oh right, so the sequence is indeed 6 steps.\n\nSo how to model this problem.\n\nI think the key is to process the tasks in order and determine the earliest possible arrival times at each required house, considering the constraints.\n\nAnother approach: For each task ai, we need to ensure that Xenia arrives at ai before or at the same time as the previous task's position. Because she can't leave any task undone.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. Since the tasks are given in order, for each i, she must be present at ai at some point after completing all j < i tasks.\n\nBut since she can visit houses multiple times, perhaps the minimal path is to arrange the tasks in such a way that when she's moving towards higher-numbered houses, she covers all necessary stops.\n\nWait, maybe we can sort the tasks in the order they're given and compute the required movements.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tasks as points that must be covered, but the order in which she visits them matters.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to always move clockwise, covering each task in the order they appear, but sometimes you might have to loop around the ring to cover a task that's earlier in the sequence but requires an earlier visit.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think about the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 3\n2 3 3\n\nThe output is 2.\n\nWhat's the sequence?\n\nShe starts at 1. Then she needs to go to 2, which is the first task. So 1→2: 1 step. Then she does the second task at 3. So 2→3: another step, total 2. Then third task is 3, which she's already there. So total 2 steps.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the key is that each task must be visited in the order they come, but perhaps overlapping.\n\nWait, but how do we model the movement between the tasks?\n\nMaybe we can track the current position of Xenia and the time taken so far. For each task, we compute the minimal time to reach that task's location from the current position, considering the direction.\n\nBut wait, since the ring is circular, moving from house x to y could be either clockwise or counter-clockwise. But since traffic is only allowed in one direction (clockwise), she can't go counter-clockwise. Oh wait, no, the ring is one-way, but the problem statement says that the ring is a ringroad where you can only move to the next house in a clockwise direction. So moving from house x to y can only be done if y is larger than x, modulo n.\n\nWait, no, because the ring is a cycle. So, for example, house 4 is next to house 1. So if you are at 4 and need to go to 2, you'd have to go through 4→1→2, which is two steps.\n\nSo, movement is only possible in the clockwise direction, meaning that the distance between two houses is (y - x) mod n, but since the ring is one-way, moving from x to y is possible only if y is in the clockwise direction, i.e., y >=x (if x < y) or y <=x (if x is near the end).\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is one-way, the movement is strictly clockwise. So, from any house x, the next is x+1, wrapping around to 1 after n. So, the distance between x and y is (y - x) mod n, but only if y is reachable via the clockwise direction. Otherwise, you have to go the other way around.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the movement is restricted to the clockwise direction. So, to get from x to y, you must go through the path that is in the clockwise direction. So, for example, if x is 4 and y is 2 in a 4-house ring, the shortest path would be 4→1→2, which is two steps. Alternatively, going the other way around is impossible since the ring is one-way.\n\nSo, the movement is such that, the distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n if y > x, else (n - (x - y)).\n\nWait, no. Because for x=4 and y=2, (y - x) mod 4 is (2-4) = -2 mod4 is 2. Which correctly represents the two steps needed.\n\nSo, the distance between x and y is (y - x) % n.\n\nBecause in the ring, moving clockwise, the distance from x to y is (y -x) mod n.\n\nSo, given that, the problem becomes about finding the minimal time to visit each ai in the order of their indices, ensuring that for each i, the time to reach ai is at least the time when the previous task was completed plus the time taken to move to ai.\n\nWait, but since the tasks are in order, each task i must be done after all j < i. So, the latest possible time to arrive at ai is when you've finished all j < i. So, the arrival time at ai must be >= the arrival time at aj for j < i.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this by keeping track of the current time and the current position. For each task in order, we compute the earliest time we can reach ai from the current position, and update the current position and time accordingly.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities. Because sometimes, to reach a later task, it's better to go all the way around the ring, even if that's longer.\n\nFor example, suppose n=5, and the current position is 1, and the next task is 3. It's one step away (1→2→3? No, wait, 1→2 is one step, then 2→3 is another. So two steps. But if the next task is 4, then from 1, you have to go 1→2→3→4, which is three steps.\n\nWait, but that's the correct way.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nInitialize current_time = 0, current_position = 1.\n\nSort the tasks in the order they are given (since each task depends on the previous ones being done).\n\nFor each task in the list:\n\n   Compute the minimal steps required to go from current_position to a_i.\n\n   If a_i is greater than current_position, steps are (a_i - current_position) % n.\n\n   Wait, no. Because in a ring of size n, the minimal steps are (a_i - current_position) if a_i >= current_position, else (a_i + n - current_position).\n\nBut wait, since the movement is only in the clockwise direction, the distance is always (a_i - current_position) mod n.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut in our case, the movement is only in the clockwise direction, so the distance is (a_i - current_position) mod n.\n\nSo, for each task, the time to reach a_i from current_position is (a_i - current_position) mod n.\n\nBut wait, let's see: current_position is 1, a_i is 3. (3-1)=2 mod4 is 2. So two steps, which is correct.\n\nIn the first sample, after processing the first task (a1=3), current_time becomes 2, current_position is 3.\n\nThen, the second task is a2=2. So, from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod4 is ( -1) mod4 is 3. So she needs to go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. So current_time becomes 2 + 3 =5. But wait, in the sample, the time after second task is 5.\n\nWait, but the sample says the total steps are 6. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the initial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is a1=3: she must be there for task 1. So she moves from 1→2→3, which is 2 steps. So current_time is 2, current_position is 3.\n\nSecond task is a2=2: she must be there for task 2. From 3, to reach 2, she can't go counter-clockwise. She has to go clockwise, which would be 3→4→1→2: three steps. So current_time becomes 2+3=5, current_position is 2.\n\nThird task is a3=3: from 2, to reach 3: (3-2)=1 step. current_time becomes 5+1=6. So total time is 6, which matches the sample.\n\nSo yes, the approach is:\n\nFor each task in the order given, compute the time to move from current_position to a_i, add that to the current_time, and set current_position to a_i.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping tasks? Like in the second sample where a2=3 and a3=3.\n\nIn that case, after processing the first task a1=2, current_time is 1 (from 1→2). Then for a2=3: 3-2=1 step, so current_time becomes 2, current_position is 3. Then a3=3: no steps needed, so current_time remains 2.\n\nThat's the sample's output.\n\nSo, the approach seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, m.\n\n2. Read the list of a's.\n\n3. Sort the a's according to their positions in the original list (since the order matters as each task depends on the previous ones).\n\n4. Initialize current_time = 0, current_position = 1.\n\n5. For each a in the sorted list:\n\n   a. Compute the distance from current_position to a: (a - current_position) % n.\n\n   b. Add this distance to current_time.\n\n   c. Update current_position to a.\n\n6. After processing all tasks, output current_time.\n\nWait, but wait. Is the a list already sorted in the order they appear? Because the problem statement says that the second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am. So the order is important because the i-th task must be done after all j <i.\n\nSo the processing must be in the order of the list.\n\nSo the list is processed as a1, a2, ..., am, regardless of their values.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, a1 is 3, a2 is 2, a3 is 3. So processing a2 comes before a3, but a2 is smaller than a3. So the code above would process them in order, and the second task is a2=2, which is behind a1=3.\n\nSo the algorithm correctly handles that.\n\nWait, but what if the task list is something like [3,4,2,1]. So the order is 3,4,2,1. Each task must be done in order, but 2 and 1 are smaller than 3 and 4. So processing them in the given order.\n\nSo the code must process the tasks in the order given.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\ncurrent_time = 0\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor each a in the list:\n\n    steps = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n    current_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = a\n\nSo, the final current_time is the answer.\n\nWait, let's test this against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_time =0, current_pos=1.\n\na=3: steps = (3-1)%4=2. current_time=2, current_pos=3.\n\na=2: steps = (2-3)%4= ( -1 ) mod4=3. current_time=5, current_pos=2.\n\na=3: steps=(3-2)%4=1. current_time=6, current_pos=3.\n\nTotal is 6. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3].\n\ncurrent_time=0, current_pos=1.\n\na=2: steps=1, current_time=1, pos=2.\n\na=3: steps=1, current_time=2, pos=3.\n\na=3: steps 0, current_time remains 2.\n\nOutput is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if the tasks are in reverse order, but require going around.\n\nE.g., n=5, m=2, a = [5,4].\n\nSo starting at 1.\n\na1=5: steps from 1 to 5 is 4 steps. current_time=4, pos=5.\n\na2=4: from 5 to4: (4-5) mod5=4. current_time=8.\n\nTotal is 8.\n\nBut another way: 1→2→3→4→5 (4 steps). Then 5→1→2→3→4 (4 steps). Total 8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=4, a = [5,4,3,2].\n\nProcess:\n\ncurrent_time=0, pos=1.\n\na=5: steps=4, current_time=4, pos=5.\n\na=4: steps= (4-5) mod5=4. current_time=8, pos=4.\n\na=3: steps= (3-4) mod5=4. current_time=12, pos=3.\n\na=2: steps= (2-3) mod5=4. current_time=16, pos=2.\n\nSo total is 16.\n\nWhich would mean she goes 1→5 (4 steps), then 5→4 (4 steps), 4→3 (4 steps), 3→2 (4 steps). That's 16 steps.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut wait, could she have found a shorter path by taking a different route? Well, since the movement is only clockwise, she can't choose a shorter path in the other direction. So the algorithm correctly calculates the minimal steps.\n\nSo the approach seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to process each task in the given order, compute the steps from current position to the task's house, add to the time, and update the current position.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_time=0, current_pos=1.\n\nFor each a in a_list:\n\n    steps = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n    current_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = a\n\nPrint current_time.\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where m=1:\n\nn=2, m=1, a=[2].\n\nSteps: (2-1) mod2=1. So current_time=1.\n\nAnother case: m=0? Wait, the problem says m>=1? No, the input constraints say 1<=m<=105.\n\nWait, the input says 1 ≤ m ≤ 105. So m is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, m=2, a = [2,1].\n\nProcessing:\n\na1=2: steps=1, current_time=1, pos=2.\n\na2=1: (1-2) mod2= ( -1 ) mod2=1. current_time=2, pos=1.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: all a's are 1.\n\nn=5, m=3, a = [1,1,1].\n\nEach step is 0, so current_time remains 0.\n\nSo the output is 0.\n\nWait, but she starts at 1, and the first task is 1. So she doesn't need to move. Then the others are also 1, so no movement. So total time is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a = [3,4,5].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_time=0, pos=1.\n\na=3: (3-1)=2 steps. current_time=2, pos=3.\n\na=4: (4-3)=1 step. current_time=3, pos=4.\n\na=5: (5-4)=1 step. current_time=4, pos=5.\n\nTotal 4 steps.\n\nWhich is correct: 1→3 (2 steps), 3→4 (1), 4→5 (1). Total 4.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the Python code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\na_list = list of a's.\n\ncurrent_time = 0\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor a in a_list:\n\n    steps = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n    current_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = a\n\nprint(current_time)\n\nSo, now, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is read as a string, possibly with spaces. So, for example, the first input line may be like '4 3' and the second line '3 2 3'.\n\nSo, in Python, the code should read the first line as n and m, then the second line as a list of integers.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_time = 0\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor a in a_list:\n\n    steps = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n    current_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = a\n\nprint(current_time)\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\na=3: steps 2, current_time=2.\n\na=2: steps (2-3) mod4= 3, current_time=5.\n\na=3: steps 1, current_time=6.\n\nOutput is 6.\n\nSample 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nProcessing:\n\na=2: steps 1, current_time=1.\n\na=3: steps 1, current_time=2.\n\na=3: steps 0.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, m=2, a=[5,4]\n\nAs discussed earlier, the code will calculate:\n\na=5: steps 4, current_time=4.\n\na=4: steps (4-5) mod5=4, current_time=8.\n\nOutput is 8.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, m=4, a=[5,4,3,2].\n\nProcessing:\n\na=5: steps 4, current_time=4.\n\na=4: steps 4, current_time=8.\n\na=3: steps 4, current_time=12.\n\na=2: steps4, current_time=16.\n\nOutput is 16.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and can only move clockwise around the ringroad. Each task must be completed in the given order, and Xenia must be present at the specified house for each task.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia can only move clockwise around the ringroad. The distance between two houses `x` and `y` is calculated as `(y - x) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n2. **Task Completion Order**: Each task must be completed in the given order, meaning that Xenia must reach each subsequent task's location from her current position.\n3. **Track Current Position and Time**: Start from house 1 with zero time elapsed. For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the task's house, update the current time, and set the current house to the task's location.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_time = 0\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor a in a_list:\n    steps = (a - current_pos) % n\n    current_time += steps\n    current_pos = a\n\nprint(current_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`.
