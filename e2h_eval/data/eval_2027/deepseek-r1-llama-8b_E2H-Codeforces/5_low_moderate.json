Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And also, output these pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem better.\n\nSo, each left boot has a color (a lowercase letter or '?'), same for right boots. Two colors are compatible if they're the same or one is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the description: an indefinite color (i.e., '?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color. So, when either is '?', they are compatible. Otherwise, their colors must be exactly the same.\n\nSo, for example:\n- 'f' and 'f' are compatible.\n- '?' and 'z' are compatible.\n- 'a' and '?' are compatible.\n- '?' and '?' are compatible.\n\nBut 'f' and 'g' are not, and 'a' and 'z' aren't.\n\nSo, the task is to pair each left boot with a right boot, without reusing any, such that the number of compatible pairs is maximized.\n\nI need to compute the maximum possible k, and then list all such pairs.\n\nThe output requires the count and then each pair in order, with all left indices unique and right indices unique as well.\n\nNow, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, the constraints: n can be up to 150,000. So, any O(n^2) approach is out of the question. We need an efficient method.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. It seems like a bipartite graph matching problem, where left and right nodes are connected if their colors are compatible. Then, finding the maximum matching would give the solution.\n\nBut with n=15e5, standard algorithms like the Hungarian method are impossible because they are O(n^3), which is way too slow.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: group the left and right boots based on their colors, and then find the best way to pair these groups.\n\nBut even that needs some careful handling.\n\nLet me think about the counts.\n\nEach left boot can be paired with any right boot that is compatible.\n\nBut since the order matters, perhaps we can model it as counting for each possible color pair, the minimum of the number of lefts and rights of that color. Then sum all those minima.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities because '?' can pair with anything. So, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts: handling the exact color matches first, then using '?' to cover the remaining.\n\nWait, maybe that's a way to proceed.\n\nLet me outline a plan:\n\n1. For each color c (including '?'), count the number of left boots with color c and right boots with color c.\n\n2. For each c, the maximum possible pairs from exact matches is the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c].\n\n3. Sum these across all c. But wait, what about the '?'? Because a '?' can pair with any other color.\n\nWait, no. Because when you process the exact matches, the '?' is treated as itself. So, for example, a left '?' can pair with a right '?', but also with any specific color.\n\nBut if we handle the exact matches first, then the '?' can be used to pair with the remaining.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- First, compute the exact matches for each color (excluding '?').\n\n- Then, the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't find a match in their exact color) can use the '?' to pair.\n\nWait, but perhaps the '?' can be considered as a wildcard that can match any color.\n\nSo, here's another approach:\n\nCompute for each color c (including '?'), the number of left and right boots.\n\nFor c = '?', the number of left boots is the total left boots minus those that have a specific color.\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nThen, for each c (including '?'), the maximum possible pairs between left and right of color c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nSumming all these gives the maximum possible pairs.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the '?' can match any color, including themselves, but when considering exact matches, the '?' is treated as a specific color.\n\nWait, no. Because the '?' is a wildcard, so when pairing, a left '?' can pair with any right color, including those that are '?'. Similarly for right '?'.\n\nBut if I process exact colors first, I might end up double-counting something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- Compute for all colors (including '?') the number of left and right boots.\n\n- The maximum number of pairs is the sum over c of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nBut that can't be right, because that would include pairs where both are '?', but also where a",

Each boot has a color, which can be a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Two boots are compatible if their colors are the same or if one of them is a question mark.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Colors**: First, count the occurrences of each color (including '?') in both left and right boot lists.\n2. **Exact Matches**: For each color (excluding '?'), compute the maximum number of exact matches between left and right boots.\n3. **Wildcard Matches**: Use the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't find an exact match) and pair them using the wildcard capability of '?'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Count occurrences for each color in left and right\n    left_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    right_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in l:\n        left_counts[c] += 1\n    for c in r:\n        right_counts[c] += 1\n\n    # Compute the maximum possible pairs for exact matches (non-? colors)\n    total_pairs = 0\n    for c in set(left_counts.keys()) & set(right_counts.keys()):\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        min_count = min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])\n        total_pairs += min_count\n\n    # Now handle the ? cases\n    # Calculate remaining left and right after exact matches\n    left_remaining = sum(left_counts.values()) - total_pairs\n    right_remaining = sum(right_counts.values()) - total_pairs\n\n    # The number of ? pairs is min(left_remaining, right_remaining)\n    q_pairs = min(left_remaining, right_remaining)\n    total_pairs += q_pairs\n\n    # Now collect all the pairs\n    result = []\n    # For exact matches\n    for c in left_counts:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        take = min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])\n        if take > 0:\n            left_indices = [i+1 for i, color in enumerate(l) if color == c][:take]\n            right_indices = [i+1 for i, color in enumerate(r) if color == c][:take]\n            for l_idx, r_idx in zip(left_indices, right_indices):\n                result.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # For ? pairs\n    left_q_indices = [i+1 for i, color in enumerate(l) if color == '?']\n    right_q_indices = [i+1 for i, color in enumerate(r) if color == '?']\n    take = min(len(left_q_indices), len(right_q_indices))\n    if take > 0:\n        for l_idx, r_idx in zip(left_q_indices[:take], right_q_indices[:take]):\n            result.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Sort the result\n    result.sort()\n    print(total_pairs)\n    for pair in result:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Counting Colors**: We use dictionaries to count how many times each color appears in both left and right boot lists.\n2. **Exact Matches**: For each color (excluding '?'), we determine how many pairs can be formed where both boots have the same color.\n3. **Wildcard Matches**: After handling exact matches, any remaining left or right boots (which couldn't find a pair) can be paired using the wildcard '?' capability. We count how many such pairs can be formed and add them to our total.\n4. **Collecting Pairs**: We gather all the pairs (both exact matches and wildcard matches) into a list, sort them, and print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum number of compatible pairs without reusing any boots, leveraging both exact color matches and the wildcard capability of '?'.",
