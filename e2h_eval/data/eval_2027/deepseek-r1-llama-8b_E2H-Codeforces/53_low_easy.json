    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. The task is to find the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears at least twice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. So, given a string like 'ababa', the output is 3 because the substring 'aba' appears twice—once starting at index 0 and again at index 2. Oh right, and the occurrences can overlap. So, for example, in 'zzz', the substrings 'zz' appear twice: once starting at 0 and another at 1. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo, what's the plan here? Well, one way is to check all possible substrings of the string and see which is the longest that appears more than once.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently generate all possible substrings and track their occurrences? Since the maximum string length is 100, even a brute-force approach might be manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each possible substring length, starting from the largest possible down to 1.\n2. For each length l, check all possible substrings of that length.\n3. For each substring, see if it appears again somewhere else in the string (could be overlapping).\n4. If such a substring exists, return l as the answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the approach is to iterate over possible lengths in descending order. Once we find the maximum length where there's a duplicate substring, we can stop.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nI'll loop the possible lengths from len(s) down to 1. For each length l:\n\n- Generate all possible substrings of length l.\n- Use a set or a dictionary to track these substrings.\n- For each substring, check if it has appeared before.\n\nWait, but if we're generating all substrings for a given l, and checking for duplicates, then for each l, the first occurrence of a substring that appears again would mean that l is our answer.\n\nAlternatively, for each l, we can collect all substrings of that length, and see if any occurs more than once. But since we're starting from the largest l, the first l where this is true is our answer.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nLoop l from len(s) downto 1:\n\n   create a set to store the substrings of length l.\n\n   for i in 0 to len(s) - l:\n\n       substring = s[i:i+l]\n\n       if substring is already in the set, then return l.\n\n       else add it to the set.\n\n   continue until found.\n\nIf no such substring exists for any l, return 0.\n\nWait, but wait: for each l, after adding a substring to the set, I should check if it's been added before. Because if it's added again later, that means it's duplicated.\n\nWait, no. Because for each substring, when I process it, I check whether it's already in the set. If yes, then return l. Otherwise, add it to the set. Because if it's added again in a later iteration, that means another occurrence.\n\nWait, maybe I should collect all substrings for the current l, then check if any occur more than once. Because during the loop, if a substring is added again, it's a duplicate.\n\nSo for each l, I can collect all substrings in a list, and then check for duplicates.\n\nBut that might be inefficient. Alternatively, for each substring, as I process it, I can check if it's in the set. If yes, then return l. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nYes, that seems better because as soon as I find a duplicate, I can return.\n\nSo, the algorithm becomes:\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            # Found duplicate substring of length l\n\n            max_length = l\n\n            print(max_length)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nreturn max_length\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test this logic against some examples.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → the output is 0.\n\nBecause all substrings of length 4 are unique, 3 are unique, etc., down to 1.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → the substrings of length 3 are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). So when i=2, substr is 'aba', which was already in the set. So returns 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → for l=2, the substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). So when i=1, substr 'zz",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears at least twice. These occurrences can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking all possible substrings of the given string starting from the longest possible length down to the shortest. For each length, we generate all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once. The first length for which we find such a duplicate substring is our answer.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: We start by checking the longest possible substrings first, working our way down to shorter lengths.\n2. **Track Substrings**: For each length, we use a set to keep track of the substrings we have seen so far.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: As we generate each substring, we check if it has been seen before. If it has, we immediately return the current length as the result.\n\nThis method ensures that we find the longest possible substring efficiently by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and avoiding unnecessary computations once a duplicate is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string is read and processed to ensure it is clean.\n- **Loop Over Lengths**: We loop from the length of the string down to 1, checking each possible substring length.\n- **Substring Generation and Check**: For each length, we generate all possible substrings and use a set to track these substrings. If a substring is found in the set before adding it again, we print the current length and exit.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick membership testing, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum input size.\n\nThis solution effectively balances thoroughness with efficiency, ensuring we find the correct result without unnecessary computations.",
