Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm, right. So Andrew starts with a string s, which consists of digits. Then, for each query, which is in the form \"di->ti\", we replace every occurrence of digit di in the current string s with the substring ti. After all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do the substitutions work? Because each substitution can be applied multiple times, depending on the order. Oh right, because each query is processed in the given order. So the substitutions are applied one after another, each possibly modifying the string further.\n\nSo the challenge is to model this efficiently without having to process the string step by step each time, especially since the string can get quite long (up to 105 characters initially and substitutions can add more). Processing each substitution naively could be computationally expensive, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nHmm, thinking about it, perhaps instead of actually modifying the string each time, we can represent the transformations as a mapping that tells us what each digit gets replaced with. But wait, no—because each substitution is dependent on the previous ones. So if a substitution replaces '2' with '00', and then another substitution replaces '0' with '5', the second substitution affects the result of the first.\n\nWait, but the queries are applied in order. So each query is a transformation that must be applied to the current state of the string. So for each query, we need to find all instances of di in the current string and replace them with ti.\n\nBut doing this naively would involve repeatedly scanning the string and replacing each occurrence. For a small string, this is manageable, but since the length can be up to 105, and n can be up to 105, it's possible that each substitution could increase the string's length, making the overall approach O(n * m) where m is the maximum possible string length, which could be very large.\n\nWait, but the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is limited to 105. That's an important constraint. So the total expansion isn't going to be too bad. Because each substitution's ti can't be longer than 105 in total across all queries.\n\nSo perhaps a straightforward approach is feasible here. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. Read n queries, each being a substitution.\n3. For each query, process it: replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n4. After all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the substitution has to be done in the order of the queries. So for each query, the current string is modified based on the previous modifications.\n\nSo the key is to process each substitution in sequence, modifying the string accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the data structure. The string can be represented as a list of characters or a string. Each substitution will scan through the current string and replace each occurrence of di with ti.\n\nFor example, for each substitution, we can loop through each character in the string, and whenever a character is equal to di, we replace it with the corresponding substring from ti.\n\nBut wait, that's not efficient when the string is large, but given the constraints, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nWait, the initial string is up to 105 characters, and each substitution can add some more. But the sum of ti lengths is 105, so even after all substitutions, the maximum possible length is 105 + 105*1 = 210? Or wait, no—each substitution's ti can be any length, including zero. But the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is at most 105. So for example, if all ti are 100 in length, but that's only if n is 1. Wait no, the sum is 105, so for n=105, each ti is 1 character. So the maximum possible length of s is the initial 105 plus 105*1, which is 210. So the maximum possible length is manageable.\n\nThus, processing each substitution by directly modifying the string is feasible.\n\nSo let's outline the steps again:\n\n- Start with s as a string.\n- For each query:\n   - Split the query into di and ti. Di is the first character, and ti is the rest.\n   - Replace all occurrences of di in s with ti.\n- After all queries, compute the numeric value of s modulo MOD.\n\nWait, but the order of processing the queries is crucial. Each query must be applied in the order given.\n\nNow, how to compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7. Since the string can be up to 210 characters, converting it directly into a number might cause issues with integer overflows in some languages, but in Python, that's not a problem. However, since the string can be up to 210 digits, it's better to compute the mod incrementally to avoid handling very large numbers.\n\nYes, because if s is, say, 200 digits, converting it directly to an integer and then taking mod 1e9+7 is possible, but for larger values, it's not feasible. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so it's manageable. But for efficiency, it's better to compute the mod during the conversion.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nAfter all substitutions, iterate through each character in s, updating a variable (like result) by multiplying by 10 and adding the current digit's value, each time taking mod 1e9+7.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the mod as we build the number.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead s from input.\n\nRead n, then read each query, process each in order.\n\nEach query is processed by replacing all occurrences of di in the current s with ti.\n\nOnce all queries are done, compute the value of s modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, how to split the query into di and ti? The format is \"di->ti\". So for example, \"2->00\" has di='2' and ti='00'.\n\nSo, in code, for each line in the queries, split on '->'. The first part is di, the second is ti.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in Python, strings are immutable, so each substitution requires creating a new string. So for each substitution, we'll loop through the current string, and for each character, if it's equal to di, append ti, else append the character.\n\nThis is O(m) per substitution, where m is the current length of the string.\n\nGiven that the maximum length is around 210, and n is up to 105, the total operations are 210 * 105 = 22050, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead s.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor each query in queries:\n    parts = query.split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n    # Now, replace all di in s with ti\n    new_s = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    s = ''.join(new_s)\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, compute the number mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, leading zeros? According to the note, leading zeros are not removed. So for example, if the string becomes \"00012\", it's treated as 12. Wait no, the note says that leading zeros are ignored when representing the number. Wait, no, the note says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nWait, so after all substitutions, the string may start with several zeros. We have to treat that as a single zero. So, for example, the string \"000\" becomes 0, but \"0123\" becomes 123.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nTake the resulting string, strip leading zeros, and then interpret it as a number. If it's empty, the number is zero.\n\nBut wait, the string can't be empty because each substitution appends ti, which could be empty. For example, a substitution that replaces '3' with \"\" could make s empty.\n\nWait, no: the initial s is non-empty (since |s| >=1). But during substitutions, if the entire string is replaced by empty, then s becomes empty.\n\nIn that case, the output is 0.\n\nSo, after processing all substitutions, the resulting s is processed as follows:\n\n- If s is empty, output 0.\n\n- Else, remove leading zeros until the first non-zero character.\n\n- The remaining string represents the number. If it's empty (all zeros were stripped), output 0.\n\n- Otherwise, compute its value mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Remove leading zeros\n    s = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not s:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(s)\n        print(num % MOD)\n\nWait, but in the example provided:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nSo, after first substitution, '222' becomes '000'.\n\nThen, substitution '0' is replaced by '7', so '000' becomes '777'.\n\nSo the resulting string is '777' → 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the third sample in the note shows that leading zeros are not removed. Wait, no, looking back: the note says that leading zeros are ignored when you represent the number as a decimal. So the string remains as is, but when converted to a number, leading zeros are removed.\n\nWait, the note says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nSo for example, the string \"00123\" becomes 123, but the string remains as \"00123\" before conversion. So the actual numeric value is 123, but the string itself is kept as is.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the note says that leading zeros are ignored. So when you compute the number, you ignore the leading zeros. So for the string \"000\", the number is 0.\n\nSo in code, regardless of the string's leading zeros, the numeric value is computed as the integer formed by the string, which automatically ignores leading zeros.\n\nWait, but if the string is \"000\", int(\"000\") is 0.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCompute the integer value of the string, ignoring leading zeros. If the string is empty, the value is zero.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif s == \"\":\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num = int(s)\n    print(num % MOD)\n\nBecause when you pass \"000\" to int(), it becomes 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead s.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor each query in queries:\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    # Replace di in s with ti\n    new_s = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    s = ''.join(new_s)\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nif s == \"\":\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num = int(s)\n    print(num % MOD)\n\nWait, but in Python, the split('->') function will split on the first occurrence of '->', right? Because strings are split on substrings by splitting at each occurrence. So, for example, if di is 'a->b', then parts = ['a', 'b'], which is correct.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that each query is of the form \"di → ti\", where di is exactly one digit. So the split should correctly extract di as the first part, and ti as the rest.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, a query like \"5->000\" will split into di='5', ti='000'.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that di is a single character, so after splitting, parts[0] should be length 1.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, it is guaranteed.\n\nSo, the code should handle it correctly.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, no—the sample input seems to be written as a list of four elements. Wait, the first line is '123123', then n=1, then a query. Wait, perhaps the sample input is miswritten, but probably, it's a representation of the test case.\n\nWait, in the sample input shown, it's written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, that can't be right. Perhaps the actual input is four lines: the initial s is '123123', followed by 3 queries, and then a fourth line which is 0.\n\nWait, the sample input may have been formatted incorrectly. But perhaps the actual input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nquery: 2->00\n\nthen another query: 3->\n\netc.\n\nBut in any case, the code should process each query as described.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the first query is applied, then the second, etc.\n\nIn the sample:\n\nAfter first query 2->00: 123123 becomes 13031003.\n\nSecond query 3->: replace 3 with empty, so 13031003 → 12001003.\n\nWait, no, wait, the first query replaces 2 with 00, so '123123' becomes '1' + '00' + '3' + '123'? No, wait, no. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: 1 2 3 1 2 3.\n\nAfter replacing 2 with 00: each 2 becomes 00. So the new string is 1 00 3 1 00 3 → '10031003'.\n\nThen, the next query is 3 -> empty string. So replace 3 with empty string. So the string becomes 10031003 → '1001003'?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string is '10031003'. Let's see each character:\n\n1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 3.\n\nReplacing 3 with empty: the 3s are replaced by nothing. So the new string is 1 followed by 00, then 1, then 00, then nothing for the last 3. So the string becomes '100100'.\n\nWait, no: original string is '10031003'. Let's break it down:\n\nPositions:\n\n0: 1 → stays\n\n1: 0 → stays\n\n2: 0 → stays\n\n3: 3 → replaced by nothing.\n\n4: 1 → stays\n\n5: 0 → stays\n\n6: 0 → stays\n\n7: 3 → replaced by nothing.\n\nSo the new string is '100' + '1' + '00' → '100100'.\n\nWait, but that's not matching the sample output. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different. Maybe the third sample is the one with the substitution leading to '777'.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed with the code as per the plan.\n\nWait, but the code seems correct. Let me test it against the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nFirst line: '123123'\n\nn=1.\n\nQuery: 2->00.\n\nSo the code processes this, replacing all 2s with 00. So the string becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second line is another query: 3->.\n\nWait, no, in the sample input, the second query is '3->' which is replacing 3 with empty string.\n\nSo after that substitution, the string becomes '1001003'?\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nOriginal string after first substitution: '10031003'.\n\nProcessing the second substitution, which replaces 3 with empty string.\n\nSo:\n\nEach 3 is replaced by empty.\n\nSo the string becomes:\n\n1 0 0 3 → 1 0 0 '' → 1 0 0.\n\nThen 1 → 1.\n\nThen 0 0 3 → '' → nothing.\n\nSo the string becomes '100100'.\n\nWait, but the sample output for the second substitution is '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution process.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is applied in such a way that all occurrences are replaced in the string as a whole.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is applied once, but in a way that replaces all instances in a single pass.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the substitution is applied.\n\nWait, when you have a substitution di→ti, you replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n\nSo for example, in the first substitution, the string '123123' becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second substitution is '3→', meaning replace every '3' with empty string. So in the current string, which is '10031003', the '3's are at position 3 and 7.\n\nReplacing those gives '100' + '1' + '00' → '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output after the second substitution is '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Or maybe the sample input is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns = '222'\n\nn = 2.\n\nQueries: '2->0' and '0->7'.\n\nSo first substitution replaces 2 with 0 → '000'.\n\nSecond substitution replaces 0 with 7 → '777'.\n\nWhich is the third sample, giving output 777.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code handles that correctly.\n\nAnother sample: the first substitution is '2->00' on '123123' gives '10031003'.\n\nThe second substitution is '3->' → replacing all 3s with empty string.\n\nSo '10031003' becomes '1001003'?\n\nWait, let me re-examine:\n\nThe string after first substitution is '10031003'.\n\nEach '3' is at positions 3 and 7.\n\nSo replacing those with empty:\n\nThe string becomes:\n\npositions 0-2: 1,0,0 → '100'\n\nposition 3: 3 → removed.\n\nposition 4: 1 → remains.\n\npositions 5-6: 0,0 → '00'\n\nposition 7: 3 → removed.\n\nSo the resulting string is '100' + '1' + '00' → '100100'.\n\nWhich is 100100 → 100100 mod 1e9+7 is 100100.\n\nBut in the sample output, after the second substitution, the output is '1212'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution order.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe initial string is '123123'.\n\nFirst query: '2->00' → becomes '10031003'.\n\nSecond query: '3->' → becomes '10031003' → replacing 3 with empty.\n\nWait, in '10031003', the 3s are at positions 3 and 7.\n\nSo the new string is '100' + '1' + '00' → '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output for the second substitution is '1212'.\n\nHmm, perhaps the substitution is being applied differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is to replace the entire string, not just individual characters.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says that each substitution replaces all digits di in the string with ti. So it's a per-character replacement.\n\nWait, maybe the substitution is done in a way that the entire string is processed, and each di is replaced with ti.\n\nSo for example, in the first substitution, '2' is replaced with '00', so each 2 becomes two 0s.\n\nThen, in the second substitution, '3' is replaced with empty string, so each 3 is removed.\n\nSo the string '10031003' after substitution of 3 becomes '1001003'?\n\nWait, wait, let's count the characters:\n\nOriginal string after first substitution: 1 0 0 3 1 0 0 3.\n\nEach 3 is replaced with empty, so the string becomes:\n\n1 0 0 → 100, then 1, then 0 0 → 00, and the last 3 is removed.\n\nSo 100 + 1 + 00 → '100100'.\n\nSo the string is '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output after the second substitution is '1212'.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution order.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input includes more queries. Wait, the sample input is a bit confusing.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, that seems like a list of four elements, but perhaps it's intended as the input lines.\n\nSo the first line is '123123'.\n\nn=1.\n\nThen, a query '2->00'.\n\nThen, a query '3->'.\n\nThen, a query '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'.\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Or perhaps the actual input is:\n\nLine 1: 123123\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nLine 3: 2->00\n\nLine 4: 3->\n\nLine 5: 222\n\nLine 6: 2\n\nLine 7: 2->0\n\nLine 8: 0->7\n\nLine 9: 1000000008\n\nLine 10: 0\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the first three lines are for the first query, then the fourth line is the second query, and so on.\n\nSo, the first query is 2→00: initial s is '123123' → becomes '10031003'.\n\nSecond query is 3→ : replaces all 3s with empty string.\n\nSo in '10031003', the 3s are at positions 3 and 7.\n\nReplacing them with empty:\n\nThe string becomes '100' + '1' + '00' → '100100'.\n\nThird query: '222' → perhaps this is a typo. Or maybe the third line is a query. Wait, perhaps the input is:\n\nAfter the first two queries, the third line is '222' as s, and then n=2, with the two queries.\n\nNo, perhaps the sample input is a bit unclear, but perhaps it's better to proceed with the code as planned.\n\nAssuming that the code correctly processes each substitution, the sample outputs should match.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is as follows:\n\nAfter the first substitution, the string is '10031003'.\n\nAfter the second substitution, replacing 3 with empty string, the string becomes '1001003'.\n\nWait, but that's 7 characters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution. Let me try to simulate:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nFirst query: 2→00 → '10031003'.\n\nSecond query: 3→ → replace each 3 with empty string.\n\nSo '10031003' becomes '1001003'.\n\nWait, because the 3s are at positions 3 and 7. So:\n\npositions 0-2: '100'\n\nposition 3: 3 → removed.\n\nposition 4: 1 → remains.\n\npositions 5-6: '00'\n\nposition 7: 3 → removed.\n\nSo the string becomes '100100' → length 6.\n\nSo the resulting string is '100100' → 100100.\n\nBut sample output after second substitution is '1212', which suggests that the string is '1212'.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second substitution is applied after the third substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between the sample input and the problem description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is as follows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\nThen another substitution:\n\n3->.\n\nSo the first substitution transforms s into '10031003'.\n\nThe second substitution is 3→, which replaces all 3s with empty string.\n\nSo in '10031003', the 3s are at position 3 and 7.\n\nSo replacing them with empty string:\n\nThe string becomes '100' + '1' + '00' → '100100'.\n\nWhich is 100100.\n\nBut sample output after second substitution is '1212'.\n\nSo this suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is done in a way that replaces the entire string at once, not character by character.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says: \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\".\n\nSo that implies that each occurrence of di is replaced, not the entire string.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps in the second substitution, the '3's are replaced by nothing, and the string '10031003' is transformed into '1001003' (length 7), but the sample output says '1212'.\n\nHmm, perhaps the sample input is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the code and see if it passes the sample.\n\nWait, in the sample input, after all substitutions, the output is 777, which is correct.\n\nBut for the other samples, perhaps the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and I'm just not understanding the sample.\n\nWell, perhaps I should proceed with writing the code as per the plan.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n queries.\n\nProcess each query: replace di with ti in s.\n\nFinally, compute the integer value of s, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nSo, the code in Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().strip()\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    new_s = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    s = ''.join(new_s)\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num = int(s)\n    print(num % MOD)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third query is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', which seems to have two substitutions. But in our code, each query is processed as a single substitution.\n\nAh, right! Because in the problem statement, each query is of the form di→ti, which is a single substitution. So the third query is '2->0', and the fourth is '0->7'.\n\nSo, the code processes each query in order, each being a single substitution.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: 2->00 → s becomes '10031003'.\n\nSample Output: 10031003.\n\nThen, the next line is '3->' → n=1, so no more queries. So the output is 10031003 mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, after two substitutions, the output is '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a multi-line string, but in the problem statement, the sample input is written as a list of four lines, but perhaps it's a misrepresentation.\n\nIn any case, the code is correct as per the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then compute the numeric value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with a given substring. The challenge is to apply these substitutions in sequence and handle the resulting string efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Start by reading the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries:** For each query, split it into the digit to replace (di) and the substring to replace it with (ti). Replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n3. **Compute Result:** After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into an integer and compute its value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().strip()\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    new_s = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    s = ''.join(new_s)\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num = int(s)\n    print(num % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input.\n2. **Processing Each Query:** Each query is processed by splitting it into `di` and `ti`. The string `s` is then updated by replacing every occurrence of `di` with `ti`.\n3. **Handling the Result:** After all queries are processed, the resulting string is converted to an integer. If the string is empty, the result is 0. Otherwise, the integer value of the string is computed and taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is applied correctly in sequence, and the final result is efficiently computed using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.",
