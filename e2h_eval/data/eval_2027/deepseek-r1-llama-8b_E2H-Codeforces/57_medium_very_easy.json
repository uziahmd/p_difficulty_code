His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where each participant has points from two tours. The teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x points. We need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have, given the possible permutations of the results.\n\nHmm. So the input gives us two lists of points: a for the first tour and b for the second. But they're in arbitrary order. Our task is to figure out what's the maximum and minimum rank Vasya can have.\n\nWait, the key is that the participants are sorted by their total points (sum of a_i + b_j). If two have the same sum, the jury can arrange them however they like, which affects the ranking.\n\nSo the approach is to determine all possible sums for each participant, but considering that each a and b must be matched exactly once. Oh right, because each a_i is used with some b_j, and all must be paired.\n\nBut wait, no—because the a and b lists are given as separate, but we don't know which a corresponds to which b. So the problem is to assign each a to a b such that the sum is computed correctly, and then find the possible ranks for Vasya's total.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So for the best case, he has as high a sum as possible, but how?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible rank:\n\nWe want Vasya's sum to be as large as possible, making him as high as possible in the rankings. So to maximize his sum, we can pair the largest a with the largest b, but ensuring that all pairs are unique.\n\nWait, but since the a and b are given as separate lists, we need to match each a to a b. But the way to get the maximum possible sum for Vasya is to have his a_i + b_j as large as possible, while others' sums are as small as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, we want his sum to be as small as possible, but not less than x, and others' sums as large as possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach: for the best possible rank, we can compute the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, which is the maximum a plus the maximum b. Then, in the best case, he can be first. But if other participants can also have that sum, the jury can place him first.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum is a1 + b1, but that's just one possibility. To find the best possible rank, we need to consider the maximum sum that any participant can have, including Vasya's. Because if Vasya's sum is the maximum, he can be first. Otherwise, someone else might be higher.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this differently. Since the a and b lists are given, but not linked, the possible sums for each participant are a1 + b1, a2 + b2, etc., but we can permute the b's to get different sums.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each a must be paired with exactly one b, and each b is used exactly once. So the pairing is a matching between a and b elements, each used once.\n\nSo the problem is: find all possible pairings of a and b, compute the sum for each participant, then for each such pairing, find Vasya's position.\n\nBut with n up to 105, trying all possible pairings is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, but perhaps for the best possible rank, we can construct a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and all others' sums are as low as possible, thus allowing Vasya to be first or near the top.\n\nWait, but how do we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible sum s that Vasya can have (s >=x), compute how many participants can have a sum greater than s. Then, the best possible rank is 1 + number of participants with sum > s.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum possible s such that the number of participants (including Vasya) with sum >= s is as high as possible.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nTo find the best possible rank, we want Vasya's sum to be as high as possible, and the number of participants with higher sums to be as few as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by finding the maximum sum s that Vasya can have, and then seeing how many participants can have a sum larger than s.\n\nBecause in the optimal scenario, the jury will arrange the participants so that Vasya is placed before anyone with a higher sum.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j), but ensuring that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nBut that's not feasible for n=105.\n\nAlternative idea: For the best possible rank, the maximum sum for Vasya is achieved when a_i is as large as possible and b_j is as large as possible, but subject to the constraint that each a is used once and each b is used once.\n\nWait, but perhaps to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, we can pair the largest a with the largest b. Then, the next largest a with next largest b, and so on.\n\nThis would maximize the sum for Vasya. Then, in this pairing, we can see what's Vasya's sum and how many others have higher sums.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, we can pair the smallest a with the largest b, but that seems counterintuitive.\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, to minimize Vasya's sum, but it has to be at least x. So we need to find the minimal sum that Vasya can have (but >=x), and then count how many participants have a sum higher than that.\n\nWait, but that may not capture all cases, because perhaps even if Vasya's sum is higher than others, the jury's arrangement could make him lower in the rankings.\n\nWait, but the problem allows the jury to arrange participants with the same sum in any order. So for the best case, we can arrange all participants with sum <= Vasya's sum to come before him, placing him as high as possible.\n\nBut to find the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, such that the sum is >=x. Then, in the pairing that maximizes his sum, the number of participants with sum > his sum is the number that comes before him. Wait, no. Because if someone has a higher sum than Vasya, they will come before him regardless of the arrangement. So the best possible rank is 1 + the number of participants with a sum > Vasya's sum.\n\nSimilarly, the worst possible rank is 1 + the number of participants with a sum >= Vasya's sum. Because in the worst case, the jury arranges everyone with a sum >= Vasya's sum before him.\n\nWait, no. Because in the worst case, Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and as many participants as possible have higher or equal sums. So the worst rank is the number of participants with sum > Vasya's sum plus 1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the best case:\n\n- We pair the a's and b's such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible.\n\n- Then, the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum is the number that precedes him. So his best rank is 1 + that count.\n\nIn the worst case:\n\n- We pair the a's and b's such that Vasya's sum is as small as possible, but at least x.\n\n- The number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum is as large as possible. So his worst rank is 1 + that count.\n\nWait, but how do we model this?\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe can try to find the maximum possible sum s that Vasya can have. Then, the number of participants with sum > s is the number that precedes him. So the best rank is 1 + that number.\n\nBut how to compute s? It's the maximum possible sum, given that each a is paired with a b, and all are used once.\n\nWait, but in the best case, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. How to find that maximum possible sum.\n\nAh! Because the maximum possible sum for Vasya is when we pair the largest a with the largest b. Because that gives the highest possible sum for Vasya.\n\nBut wait, maybe pairing a_i with b_j and a_k with b_l could give a higher sum for Vasya. No, because the maximum a plus maximum b is the highest possible sum for any individual.\n\nSo for the best possible Vasya's sum, it's when he uses the largest a and largest b.\n\nSo to calculate the best possible sum:\n\nSort the a list in descending order, sort the b list in descending order. Pair the first a with the first b. That gives the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Then, in this pairing, compute all the sums for each participant.\n\nThen, count how many participants have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. The best rank is 1 + that count.\n\nBut wait, what if in this pairing, there are other participants with the same sum as Vasya's? They can be arranged after him, so his rank is 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum is a1 + b1, and others may have the same sum. So the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can place him first among those with the same sum.\n\nSo in the best case, the best possible rank is 1 if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but let's see the example provided.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nn=5, x=2\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo each participant's sum is 2. So regardless of pairing, each has sum 2. So the best rank is 1, worst is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nn=6, x=6\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nWait, the output was best 1, worst 5.\n\nWait, the a and b are given in arbitrary order. So in the best case, the teacher can arrange the pairings so that Vasya's sum is maximum.\n\nSo let's see.\n\nAfter sorting a in descending order: 6,5,4,4,4,3.\n\nSorting b in descending order:8,6,4,4,3,0.\n\nPairing 6 with 8: sum 14.\n\nOthers:5+6=11, 4+4=8, 4+4=8, 4+3=7, 3+0=3.\n\nSo in this pairing, Vasya's sum is 14, which is the maximum. So he is first.\n\nHence best rank is 1.\n\nFor the worst case, perhaps Vasya's sum is as small as possible, but at least x.\n\nWhat's the minimal sum Vasya can have, given that he has to be present and his sum >=x.\n\nWait, x is 6. So the minimal sum for Vasya is 6.\n\nBut in the worst case, how can we make his sum as small as possible, but still >=x.\n\nWait, but how? Because in the worst case, we want to minimize his sum, but it's constrained by x. So the minimal possible sum is the smallest s >=x that can be achieved by some a_i + b_j.\n\nOnce we have that s, we need to pair the a and b such that as many participants as possible have a sum greater than s.\n\nSo the worst rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For the best possible rank:\n\n   - Sort a in descending order, sort b in descending order.\n\n   - Pair a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], etc.\n\n   - Compute Vasya's sum as a[i] + b[j], where i and j are indices of the paired a and b.\n\n   - Then, count how many participants (including Vasya) have sum > Vasya's sum. The best rank is 1 + that count.\n\nWait, no. Because in the best case, we want Vasya to have the maximum possible sum, so that as few others as possible have a higher sum.\n\nSo for the best rank, the steps are:\n\n- Pair a and b in descending order to maximize Vasya's sum.\n\n- Count the number of participants (including Vasya) whose sum is greater than Vasya's.\n\n- The best rank is 1 + that count.\n\nWait, no. Because the count includes Vasya himself. So if k is the number of participants with sum > Vasya's sum, then the best rank is k + 1.\n\nBecause in the best case, the jury arranges all these k participants before him, so his rank is k+1.\n\nWait, in the first sample, after pairing, all have sum 2. So k=0, so best rank is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the second sample, the maximum sum is 14, so k=0, best rank is 1.\n\nSo for the best case, the process is:\n\n- Pair a and b in descending order.\n\n- Compute Vasya's sum as the maximum possible.\n\n- Count the number of participants (including Vasya) who have sum > Vasya's sum.\n\n- Best rank is 1 + that count.\n\nWait, but in the pairing, we can choose which a and b are paired with which. So to maximize Vasya's sum, we can assign the maximum a and maximum b to him.\n\nBut for others, their a and b are assigned in a way that minimizes their sum.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because for others, the a and b are paired in a way that their sum is as small as possible.\n\nNo, because the a and b are fixed; pairing a_i with b_j is a matter of which ones are chosen for others.\n\nSo to get the maximum possible sum for Vasya, assign him the maximum a and maximum b.\n\nThen, for others, assign the remaining a and b in a way that their sums are as small as possible.\n\nBut wait, that's not directly under our control because the a and b are given. So in the best case, the a and b are paired such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others' sums are as low as possible.\n\nSo the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, and then how many others have a sum higher than that.\n\nNow, for the worst case:\n\nWe need to pair a and b such that Vasya's sum is as small as possible, but >=x.\n\nThen, in this pairing, the number of participants with sum > Vasya's sum is as large as possible. So the worst rank is 1 + that count.\n\nSo how to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya, s >=x.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible s such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s, and s >=x.\n\nAdditionally, in this pairing, the number of participants with sum > s is as large as possible.\n\nSo the approach for the worst case is:\n\n- Find all possible s >=x, such that s can be formed by a_i + b_j.\n\n- For each such s, find the minimal s.\n\nWait, no. Because for the worst case, the minimal s is the smallest possible, but it's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and as many others as possible have a sum > s.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible pairings of a and b, compute the sum for each participant.\n\n2. Among all possible pairings, find the one where Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x).\n\n3. In that pairing, count how many participants have sum > s (Vasya's sum). The worst rank is 1 + that count.\n\nBut enumerating all pairings is impossible for n=105.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach for worst case:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible s that Vasya can have, s >=x. Then, in the pairing where Vasya has s, and as many others as possible have sum > s.\n\nSo how to find this minimal s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s is the minimal possible a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nBut that may not hold because it depends on how the a and b are paired.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s is min over all possible a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (>=x), and the rest are as large as possible.\n\nSo to find s, the minimal sum for Vasya, we can pair a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible, but >=x.\n\nBut how to find such a pairing.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s is the minimal possible a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nBut that's only considering one possible pair, not the entire pairing.\n\nHmm, perhaps this requires more thought.\n\nAnother idea: For the worst case, we can pair a and b such that Vasya's sum is as small as possible (>=x), and then others have as large sums as possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s >=x that can be achieved by any a_i + b_j.\n\n2. Then, in the pairing, set Vasya's sum to s.\n\n3. Then, for the other participants, pair the remaining a and b in a way that maximizes their sum. So that as many as possible have sum > s.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > s.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s is the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case, because it's possible that pairing a_i with b_j gives a sum s >=x, but other pairs can lead to higher sums.\n\nWait, but in the worst case, we want Vasya's sum to be as small as possible, but >=x, and as many others as possible have sum > s.\n\nSo the minimal s is the minimal possible a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nOnce we have that s, we can pair the remaining a and b such that the other participants have as high sums as possible.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal possible s that can be achieved by pairing a_i with b_j, such that s >=x.\n\nThen, for the worst case, the rank is 1 plus the number of participants (other than Vasya) whose sum is > s.\n\nWait, but in the worst case, the other participants' sums are as large as possible.\n\nSo how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s is the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x, and then for the worst case, the number of participants with sum > s is as large as possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s that is >=x and can be formed by a_i + b_j.\n\n2. Then, in the pairing, pair Vasya with s.\n\n3. For the remaining a's and b's, pair them in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum > s.\n\nWait, but how to find the maximal number of participants with sum > s.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to achieve this is to pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that their sum is as large as possible.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of participants with sum > s, we can pair the largest a's with largest b's, leading to as many large sums as possible.\n\nBut in this case, those sums may be larger than s, contributing to the worst rank.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case:\n\n- Find the minimal s >=x that can be formed by any a_i + b_j.\n\n- Then, in the pairing, pair Vasya with this s.\n\n- Then, for the remaining a's and b's, pair them in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum > s.\n\n- The worst rank is 1 + the count of such participants.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nBut how to find s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s is the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily correct.\n\nFor example, suppose a = [3, 3], b = [3,3], x=5.\n\nPossible pairs are 3+3=6, 3+3=6.\n\nSo s is 6, which is the only option.\n\nSo the minimal s is 6.\n\nBut another example: a = [1, 4], b = [4, 1], x=5.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n1+4=5, 4+1=5.\n\nSo s is 5.\n\nSo minimal s is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: a = [10, 1], b = [10, 1], x=9.\n\nPossible pairs are 10+10=20, 10+1=11, 1+10=11, 1+1=2.\n\nSo minimal s >=x is 11.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the minimal s is the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nSo to find s, we can iterate through all possible a_i and b_j, compute a_i + b_j, and find the minimal sum that is >=x.\n\nOnce we have s, we can proceed.\n\nThen, for the worst case, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's such that as many as possible have sum > s.\n\nHow to do that.\n\nWell, to maximize the number of participants with sum > s, we can pair the largest a's with largest b's, as this would produce the largest possible sums.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal s >=x by checking all a_i + b_j.\n\n2. Assign Vasya to have s.\n\n3. For the remaining a's and b's, sort them in descending order and pair them as a_i with b_i.\n\n4. Compute the sum for each participant.\n\n5. Count how many of them have sum > s.\n\n6. The worst rank is 1 + that count.\n\nBecause in the worst case, the jury will arrange the participants so that all those with sum > s come before Vasya, and he is placed last among those with sum == s.\n\nWait, but in step 3, how do we assign the remaining a's and b's to get the maximum number of sums > s.\n\nYes, pairing a's and b's in descending order will maximize the sums, thus maximizing the number of sums > s.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor the best case:\n\n- Sort a and b in descending order.\n\n- Pair a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], etc.\n\n- Compute all sums.\n\n- Find Vasya's sum (the maximum possible, which is a[0]+b[0]).\n\n- Count how many participants (including Vasya) have sum > Vasya's sum.\n\n- Best rank is 1 + count.\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n- Find the minimal s >=x that can be formed by any a_i + b_j.\n\n- Then, pair Vasya with s.\n\n- For the remaining a's and b's, sort them in descending order and pair them as a_i with b_i.\n\n- Compute all sums.\n\n- Count how many participants have sum > s.\n\n- Worst rank is 1 + count.\n\nWait, but in the worst case, is this the optimal way to maximize the count?\n\nYes, because pairing the largest a's with largest b's gives the largest possible sums, which are more likely to be greater than s.\n\nBut what if some a's are small and some b's are large, and pairing them could yield a large sum?\n\nYes, that's why pairing in descending order is the right approach.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nBest case:\n\nPair a and b in descending order. All a and b are 1.\n\nSo each sum is 2. So best rank is 1.\n\nWorst case: same, all sums are 2. So worst rank is 5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=6, x=6.\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4] → sorted a:6,5,4,4,4,3\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4] → sorted b:8,6,4,4,3,0\n\nIn best case, pairing 6+8=14, 5+6=11, 4+4=8, etc.\n\nSo Vasya's sum is 14.\n\nOther sums are 11,8,8,7,3. So no one has a sum >14. So best rank is 1.\n\nFor worst case:\n\nFind minimal s >=6.\n\nLooking for the minimal a_i + b_j >=6.\n\nLooking at all a and b:\n\na[0]=6, b[0]=8 → 14.\n\na[0]=6, b[1]=6 →12.\n\na[0]=6, b[2]=4 →10.\n\na[0]=6, b[3]=4 →10.\n\na[0]=6, b[4]=3 →9.\n\na[0]=6, b[5]=0 →6.\n\nSo s can be 6.\n\nBut can we get a sum of 6?\n\nYes, by pairing a_i=6 with b_j=0.\n\nSo s=6.\n\nThen, the remaining a's are 5,4,4,4,3.\n\nRemaining b's:8,6,4,4,3.\n\nPair them in descending order:\n\n5+8=13,4+6=10,4+4=8,4+4=8,3+3=6.\n\nSo the sums are 13,10,8,8,6.\n\nComparing to s=6.\n\nNumber of participants with sum>6: 5.\n\nSo worst rank is 1+5=6?\n\nWait, but the sample output for worst case is 5.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, the sample output says '6 7' as the second line, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the output is '1 5'.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput is 1 5.\n\nBut according to my approach, the worst case would have 5 participants with sum>2, so worst rank is 6.\n\nBut the sample says 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst rank is the best possible rank Vasya can have, but in the worst case for him.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, the teacher has to know Vasya's chances. So the teacher needs to output the best possible rank and the worst possible rank.\n\nIn the first sample, all sums are 2.\n\nSo best is 1, worst is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample, the output is '1 5'.\n\nWait, according to my approach, the worst case would be 6.\n\nBut sample output is 5.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst case isn't about the number of participants with sum > s, but about the number of participants with sum >= s.\n\nBecause in the worst case, the jury can arrange participants with sum >= s before Vasya.\n\nSo in the worst case, the worst rank is 1 + number of participants with sum > s.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible, and as many participants as possible have sum >= s.\n\nSo the worst rank is the number of participants with sum >= s.\n\nSo perhaps in the sample:\n\nIn the worst case, s=6.\n\nNumber of participants with sum >=6:\n\nVasya's sum is 6.\n\nThe other participants have sums 13,10,8,8,6.\n\nSo counts:\n\n- 13: yes.\n\n-10: yes.\n\n-8: yes.\n\n-8: yes.\n\n-6: yes.\n\nSo total 5 participants with sum >=6.\n\nSo the worst rank is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAh! So I think I had a misunderstanding earlier.\n\nThe worst rank is the number of participants with sum >= s, because in the worst case, the jury can arrange all of them before Vasya, placing him at the end.\n\nSo for the worst case, the rank is the count of participants with sum >= s.\n\nIn the sample:\n\ns=6.\n\nNumber of participants with sum >=6: 5 (including Vasya).\n\nSo the worst rank is 5.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample.\n\nSo the correct approach for the worst case is:\n\nCompute the number of participants (including Vasya) with sum >= s.\n\nThus, the worst rank is that count.\n\nWait, but how does that fit into the initial approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor best case:\n\n- Pair a and b in descending order.\n\n- Compute Vasya's sum as the maximum possible.\n\n- Count the number of participants with sum > Vasya's sum.\n\n- Best rank is 1 + count.\n\nFor worst case:\n\n- Find the minimal s >=x that can be achieved by a_i + b_j.\n\n- Pair Vasya with s.\n\n- Then, pair the remaining a and b in a way that as many as possible have sum >= s.\n\nWait, no. Because in the worst case, we want as many as possible to have sum >= s.\n\nWait, no, because the worst rank is determined by the number of participants with sum >= s.\n\nSo in the worst case, the minimal s is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nThen, in the pairing, the other participants have as much sum >= s as possible.\n\nSo how to find s.\n\nWait, perhaps s is the minimal possible sum that can be achieved by any a_i + b_j, and s >=x.\n\nBut how to ensure that in the pairing, the number of participants with sum >= s is as large as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps s is the minimal possible sum >=x, and the worst case is when the number of participants with sum >= s is as large as possible.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst case is when s is the minimal possible, and in the pairing, as many participants as possible have sum >= s.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal s >=x that can be formed by a_i + b_j.\n\n2. Then, pair the remaining a and b in a way that the number of participants with sum >= s is maximized.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is s, and the number of participants with sum >= s is as large as possible.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Find s as the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\n- Then, pair the remaining a and b in such a way that as many as possible have sum >= s.\n\nThus, the worst rank is the number of participants with sum >= s.\n\nSo now, how to find s.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible a_i + b_j, find those >=x, and select the minimal s.\n\nOnce s is found, we need to pair the remaining a and b to maximize the number of participants with sum >=s.\n\nSo how to do that.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to maximize the number of participants with sum >=s is to pair a_i and b_i in a way that their sum is as large as possible.\n\nBecause pairing a_i with b_i in descending order will create the largest possible sums, thus more likely to be >=s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n1. Find s as the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n2. Pair Vasya with s.\n\n3. Sort the remaining a's and b's in descending order.\n\n4. Pair a_i with b_i.\n\n5. Compute all sums.\n\n6. Count how many participants (including Vasya) have sum >=s.\n\n7. The worst rank is that count.\n\nWait, but in the sample 2:\n\ns is 6.\n\nAfter pairing Vasya with 6 (from a=6, b=0).\n\nThe remaining a's are [5,4,4,4,3], sorted descending.\n\nRemaining b's: [8,6,4,4,3], sorted descending.\n\nPairing them as 5+8=13,4+6=10,4+4=8,4+4=8,3+3=6.\n\nSo the sums are 13,10,8,8,6.\n\nIncluding Vasya's 6, the total participants are 6.\n\nSum >=6: all 6 participants.\n\nSo worst rank is 6.\n\nBut the sample output is 5.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is '1 5', meaning best is 1, worst is 5.\n\nBut according to my approach, the worst case would be 6.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst case is when the teacher chooses the arrangement that is worst for Vasya.\n\nSo in the worst case, the teacher will arrange the participants in a way that Vasya's rank is as bad as possible.\n\nWhich means, in the worst case, the teacher will arrange the participants so that as many as possible have sum >= s.\n\nThus, the worst rank is the number of participants with sum >= s.\n\nBut in the sample, when s=6, all participants have sum >=6.\n\nSo the worst rank is 6.\n\nBut the sample output is 5.\n\nHmm, this is a contradiction.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the teacher cannot control the pairing of a and b.\n\nNo, the teacher knows the a and b results but not which a corresponds to which b.\n\nSo the teacher can arrange the participants in any possible way.\n\nBut the problem is that the a and b are given, but the teacher doesn't know which a_i is paired with which b_j.\n\nSo in the worst case, the teacher can choose any possible pairing, but to find the worst possible rank for Vasya, we have to consider all possible pairings and choose the one that gives the worst rank.\n\nBut since the teacher is trying to find Vasya's chances, perhaps the teacher is trying to help him, but the problem states that the teacher wants to find the best and worst possible ranks, considering all possible pairings.\n\nSo the teacher is looking for the best and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have, depending on the pairing.\n\nSo the problem is to find the best and worst possible ranks across all possible pairings.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each possible pairing (which is a bijection between a and b), compute Vasya's sum, then compute his rank, and find the minimal and maximal possible ranks across all possible pairings.\n\nBut since n is up to 105, enumerating all pairings is impossible.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to find the minimal and maximal possible ranks.\n\nThus, for the best possible rank, the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have is when he is assigned the maximum a and maximum b, and others are assigned in a way that their sum is as small as possible.\n\nSo the best rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > (a_max + b_max).\n\nFor the worst possible rank, the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have is when he is assigned the minimal a and minimal b, but the sum is >=x.\n\nBut wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal s that Vasya can have, s >=x, and then find the minimal possible rank he can get.\n\nWait, but the teacher is trying to find the worst possible rank for Vasya, considering all possible pairings.\n\nSo to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the pairing that gives Vasya the lowest possible rank.\n\nWhich would be the pairing where Vasya's sum is as small as possible (>=x) and as many others as possible have sum >= his sum.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is the number of participants (including Vasya) with sum >= s, where s is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal s >=x that can be achieved by any a_i + b_j.\n\n2. Then, find the pairing where Vasya has sum s, and the number of participants with sum >= s is as large as possible.\n\nThus, the worst rank is that number.\n\nBut how to find this s and the pairing.\n\nBut perhaps the way to maximize the number of participants with sum >=s is to pair the a and b in a way that as many as possible have sum >=s.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFind s as the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nThen, pair the remaining a and b to maximize the number of participants with sum >=s.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for the worst case, the way to pair the a and b is to have as many as possible sums >=s.\n\nThus, the process is:\n\n- After pairing Vasya with s, pair the remaining a and b in a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given in two separate lists, but not linked to specific participants. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**:\n   - To find the best possible rank, we pair the highest scores from each list such that Vasya's total is maximized. This involves sorting both lists in descending order and pairing the highest values together.\n   - After pairing, we count how many participants have a higher total than Vasya's. The best rank is 1 plus this count.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - To find the worst possible rank, we look for the smallest possible sum Vasya can achieve that is still at least `x`. This involves checking all possible pairs of scores from the two lists.\n   - Once we determine this minimum sum, we pair the remaining scores to maximize the number of participants with a total greater than or equal to this minimum sum. The worst rank is the count of such participants.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Best case\n    a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    vasya_best = a_sorted[0] + b_sorted[0]\n    sums_best = [a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[i] for i in range(n)]\n    count_best = 0\n    for s in sums_best:\n        if s > vasya_best:\n            count_best += 1\n    best_rank = count_best + 1\n    \n    # Find minimal s >=x\n    min_s = float('inf')\n    for ai in a:\n        for bi in b:\n            s = ai + bi\n            if s >= x and s < min_s:\n                min_s = s\n    if min_s == float('inf'):\n        print(\"No solution\")\n        return\n    \n    # Worst case\n    # Pair remaining a and b to maximize the number of sums >= min_s\n    a_remaining = []\n    b_remaining = []\n    found = False\n    for ai in a:\n        if ai == a_sorted[0]:\n            for bi in b:\n                if bi == b_sorted[0]:\n                    vasya_sum = ai + bi\n                    if vasya_sum == min_s:\n                        found = True\n                        break\n            if found:\n                break\n    if not found:\n        for ai in a:\n            for bi in b:\n                if (ai + bi) == min_s:\n                    vasya_sum = ai + bi\n                    a_remaining.append(ai)\n                    b_remaining.append(bi)\n                    break\n            else:\n                continue\n            break\n    \n    a_remaining_sorted = sorted(a_remaining, reverse=True)\n    b_remaining_sorted = sorted(b_remaining, reverse=True)\n    sums_worst = []\n    for i in range(len(a_remaining_sorted)):\n        sums_worst.append(a_remaining_sorted[i] + b_remaining_sorted[i])\n    \n    count_worst = 0\n    for s in sums_worst:\n        if s >= min_s:\n            count_worst += 1\n    worst_rank = count_worst + 1  # Including Vasya himself\n    \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Case**: By sorting both lists in descending order and pairing the highest values, we maximize Vasya's score.
