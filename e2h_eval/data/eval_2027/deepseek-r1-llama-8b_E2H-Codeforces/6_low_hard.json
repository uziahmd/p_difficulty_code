Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x and they don't overlap. Also, the total cost should be as minimal as possible. If it's impossible, we return -1.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j (i != j) where their durations sum to x. Also, they must not intersect. So either voucher i ends before voucher j starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe goal is to find the pair with the minimum total cost. If no such pair exists, output -1.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nI think the first thing is to process each voucher and calculate its duration. Then, for each possible pair of vouchers, check if their durations add up to x, and if they are non-overlapping. But wait, n can be up to 2e5, so a brute force O(n^2) approach isn't feasible. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to do this.\n\nLet me think: For each voucher, say with duration d, I need to find another voucher with duration x - d. Then, among all such pairs, find the one with the smallest cost, ensuring that they don't overlap.\n\nBut even that might be tricky because for each voucher, I have to find all vouchers of duration x - d and check if they are compatible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can pre-process the vouchers by their duration. So I'll create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of all vouchers with that duration along with their cost.\n\nThen, for each voucher, I look into the dictionary for duration x - d. For each such voucher in that list, check if they are non-overlapping with the current voucher.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the minimal cost pair? Because for each possible pair, we need to compute whether they are non-overlapping and track the minimal cost.\n\nHmm. Let's see:\n\nFor each voucher i with duration d_i, we can find all vouchers j with duration d_j = x - d_i. For each j, we check if i and j are non-overlapping.\n\nIf they are, then we can add the sum of their costs to our candidate set.\n\nWe need to find the minimal sum in this candidate set.\n\nBut again, considering all possible i and j could still be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5.\n\nSo what can I do here?\n\nAlternative idea: For each voucher j with duration d, precompute the earliest possible starting time for a voucher i with duration x - d, such that they don't overlap.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to pre-sort the vouchers based on their end times. Then, for each voucher j, we can quickly find all vouchers i that have duration x - d_j, and whose end time is before j's start time, or whose start time is after j's end time.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher j, we can look for vouchers i that have duration x - d_j, and where i ends before j starts OR starts after j ends.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, computing their duration and grouping them by duration.\n\n2. For each voucher j, determine what duration we need for i, which is x - d_j.\n\n3. If x - d_j is negative, skip.\n\n4. Otherwise, look into the group for that duration.\n\n5. For each i in that group, check if i and j are non-overlapping.\n\n6. Keep track of the minimal cost.\n\nBut again, doing this for each j would require iterating through potentially a lot of i's, leading to O(n^2) time.\n\nWait, but maybe for each j, we can find the best possible i quickly.\n\nWhat if we sort the vouchers in a certain way so that for a given j, we can query the group i's for x - d_j and find those that end before j's start or start after j's end, and among those find the one with the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to structure this.\n\nMaybe for each duration group, we can keep two separate lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time, and for each end time, keep track of the minimal cost up to that point.\n\n- Another sorted by start time, keeping track of minimal cost from that point onwards.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- A list sorted by end time, and for each end time, we can query the minimal cost for all vouchers ending before a certain time.\n\n- Similarly, a list sorted by start time, and query for minimal cost for vouchers starting after a certain time.\n\nThis way, when looking for a voucher i that ends before",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose total duration equals exactly x days and whose combined cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing Vouchers**: First, we calculate the duration of each voucher as `ri - li + 1` and group them by their duration. This helps in efficiently finding pairs of vouchers whose durations sum up to x.\n2. **Sorting for Efficient Lookup**: For each duration, we maintain two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end day (`ri`) to quickly find vouchers ending before a given start day.\n   - Another sorted by the start day (`li`) to quickly find vouchers starting after a given end day.\n3. **Binary Search for Minimal Cost**: For each voucher, we determine the required complementary duration. Using binary search on the sorted lists, we find the minimal cost vouchers that can be paired with the current voucher without overlapping.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    vouchers = []\n    duration_dict = {}\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost, duration))\n        if duration not in duration_dict:\n            duration_dict[duration] = []\n        duration_dict[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n\n    min_total = float('inf')\n\n    # For each voucher j, look for i with duration x - d_j\n    for j in vouchers:\n        lj, rj, cj, dj = j\n        needed_duration = x - dj\n        if needed_duration <= 0:\n            continue\n        if needed_duration not in duration_dict:\n            continue\n        i_list = duration_dict[needed_duration]\n        # Find all i's where i ends before j starts OR i starts after j ends\n        # We'll split into two cases\n        # Case 1: i ends before j starts\n        # Find the latest end time <= lj - 1\n        # Also, among these, find the minimal cost\n        # To do this, create a list sorted by end time, and for each entry, track the min cost up to that point\n        # Preprocess i_list for case 1\n        # Create a list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri\n        sorted_ri = sorted(i_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_ri]\n        costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_ri]\n        # Find the largest end <= lj - 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(ends, lj - 1) - 1\n        if idx >= 0:\n            min_cost = min(costs[:idx+1])\n            total = min_cost + cj\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n        # Case 2: i starts after j ends\n        # Find the earliest start >= rj + 1\n        # Again, create a list sorted by li\n        sorted_li = sorted(i_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_li]\n        costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_li]\n        # Find the first start >= rj + 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(starts, rj + 1)\n        if idx < len(starts):\n            min_cost = min(costs[idx:])\n            total = min_cost + cj\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n\n    if min_total != float('inf'):\n        print(min_total)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into vouchers, each with its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick lookup of complementary durations.\n3. **Sorting for Binary Search**: Each group of vouchers is sorted by end day and start day to enable efficient searching for non-overlapping pairs.\n4. **Finding Minimum Cost**: For each voucher, the algorithm checks both possible non-overlapping scenarios (one ending before the other starts and one starting after the other ends) and uses binary search to find the minimal cost pairs efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal solution without resorting to brute force, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
