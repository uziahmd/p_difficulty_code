Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm, right. So Andrew starts with a string s, which consists of digits. Then, for each query, which is in the form \"di->ti\", we replace every occurrence of digit di in the current string s with the substring ti. After all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do the substitutions work? For example, if s is '123123' and the query is '2→00', then the string becomes '10031003'. Another example: if the query is '3→', that replaces '3's with nothing, turning '123123' into '1212'.\n\nSo the key point is that each substitution is applied in order. Each query is processed sequentially, replacing the current string as per the substitution.\n\nBut the tricky part is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can get quite large, and n can be up to 105. Processing each substitution naively by replacing each character could be computationally expensive, especially if the string is long and the substitutions are many.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible length of the string after substitutions? The initial string can be up to 105 characters. Each substitution can add or remove some characters. But with n being up to 105, the total sum of ti lengths is 105. So maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to model the transformations without actually building the string step by step. Because for each substitution, we can represent the current string as a mapping from each possible digit to a certain replacement string. But wait, because each substitution affects the current state of the string, we need to process them in the given order.\n\nHmm, let's think differently. Instead of modifying the string each time, perhaps we can represent the transformations as a function. Since each substitution only affects specific digits, we can model the current state as a dictionary where each key is a digit (char) and the value is the corresponding replacement string. As we process each query, we update this mapping.\n\nWait, but that might not capture the order correctly because replacements can depend on previous substitutions. Oh, but each substitution is absolute in the sense that when you replace a digit, you use the current state of the substitution mappings. Or maybe not, because each substitution is a direct replacement. For example, if after a substitution, another substitution could change the same digit again.\n\nWait, no. Each substitution is a new replacement rule that is applied to the current string. So each substitution completely replaces occurrences of di in the current string with ti. So the substitution rules are cumulative, but each rule is applied on the current state of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the substitution as a function that maps each digit in the original string to a sequence of digits, considering all the substitution rules that have been applied so far. But this seems complicated because each substitution can affect the digits in a non-trivial way.\n\nWait, here's an alternative idea: instead of modifying the string step by step, we can represent the transformation as a list of functions that, for each digit, tells us what it's replaced with. Then, when processing a query, we can update this mapping, and when we finally compute the string, we can traverse each original digit in s, apply all the substitution rules in reverse order to find out which final digit(s) it becomes.\n\nWait, but substitution rules can overwrite each other. For example, if we first replace '2' with 'a', and then 'a' with 'b', then the substitution for '2' is now 'b'. So the order of processing matters.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to process the substitutions in the order given, and for each substitution, we update a dictionary that maps each digit to its replacement string.\n\nBut wait, each substitution is a complete replacement for a particular digit. So for example, if a substitution is made for digit '2', then any occurrence of '2' in the current string is replaced with the new ti string. So the next substitution could be for another digit, say '3', and so on.\n\nBut when processing substitutions, if a digit has already been mapped to a string, any future substitution for that digit would override the previous mapping. For example:\n\n- Initial mapping: empty.\n- Query 1: replace '2' → 'a'.\n- Query 2: replace '2' → 'b'. So now, whenever '2' appears, it is replaced with 'b'.\n- Query 3: replace 'a' → 'c'.\n\nIn this case, the '2' in the original string would first be replaced with 'a' in the first substitution, but then, in the second substitution, any occurrence of '2' is replaced with",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then compute the resulting numeric value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each query specifies replacing all occurrences of a digit with a given substring. The challenge is to efficiently handle these substitutions and compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model Substitutions with Mappings**: Use a dictionary to keep track of the current substitution rules. Each key in the dictionary will be a digit (as a string), and the corresponding value will be the substring it should be replaced with.\n2. **Process Queries Sequentially**: For each query, update the substitution rules. If a digit already has a substitution rule, it will be overwritten by the new rule in the query.\n3. **Generate the Result String**: After processing all queries, construct the final string by replacing each digit in the initial string with its corresponding substitution from the dictionary. Handle empty strings and leading zeros appropriately.\n4. **Compute Modulo**: Convert the resulting string to an integer, remove any leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nsubstitutions = {}\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n    substitutions[di] = ti\n\n# Now, for each character in the original s, replace it according to the substitution rules\nresult = []\nfor c in s:\n    if c in substitutions:\n        result.append(substitutions[c])\n    else:\n        result.append(c)\n\nfinal_str = ''.join(result)\n\n# Compute the numeric value modulo MOD\nif not final_str:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num = 0\n    for ch in final_str:\n        num = (num * 10 + int(ch)) % MOD\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input.\n2. **Processing Queries**: Each query is split into the digit to replace and the replacement string. These are stored in a dictionary `substitutions`.\n3. **Constructing the Result String**: For each character in the initial string `s`, we check if there is a substitution rule. If so, we use the replacement string; otherwise, we keep the character as is.\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the resulting string is empty, we treat it as zero. Otherwise, we convert each character to its numeric value, maintaining the correct order to form the number and compute its modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is processed efficiently, and the final result is computed correctly while handling all edge cases.",
