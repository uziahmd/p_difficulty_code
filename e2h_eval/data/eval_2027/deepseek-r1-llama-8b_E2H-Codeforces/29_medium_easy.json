Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then there are multiple queries where each query is like \"di → ti\". For each digit di in the current string, replace it with the substring ti. After all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored when interpreting the number, but wait, no—wait, the note says that leading zeroes are not removed after replacement. Oh right, because in the example, the third sample input ends up as '777', but the replacement didn't add any leading zeros beyond what was already there. Wait, no: the third sample's output is '777'—so perhaps the leading zeros are kept as part of the string but when converting to the number, leading zeros are ignored. Or maybe not. Wait, let me check the note again.\n\nIn the note, it says that the leading zeroes are not removed from the string s after the replacements. So when the resulting string is processed, even if it starts with zeros, they remain. But when the number is considered, leading zeros are ignored, except when the string is empty, which is zero.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\" So after all substitutions, the string could have leading zeros, but when converting to a number, those are ignored. So for example, if the string becomes \"00123\", the number is 123. However, for the computation, leading zeros do matter in the sense that the digits contribute to the modulo calculation. Wait no—because when you compute the number, leading zeros change the actual digits. So, for example, \"000\" would be treated as 0, but \"00\" followed by other digits is part of the number.\n\nWait, no. The note clarifies that leading zeros are not removed, but when you represent it as a number, leading zeros are ignored. So the string \"00123\" becomes 123. But for the modulo operation, it's computed based on the entire string, including leading zeros. Or is it?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that when the string is converted into a number, leading zeros are ignored. So the numeric value is the same as the integer represented by the string, ignoring leading zeros. But for the purpose of computing the modulo, do we process the entire string, including leading zeros? Because the modulo depends on the entire number.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is \"0123\", the number is 123. But the modulo is 123 % MOD. So the leading zero doesn't affect the numeric value. Therefore, for the purpose of calculating the modulo, we can treat the string as the numeric value without leading zeros. Because the leading zeros don't contribute anything beyond their place in the number.\n\nWait, but the way the substitution works, the string is being transformed. So for example, if a substitution adds leading zeros, the overall string may have leading zeros. So when considering the final string, the numeric value is the integer represented by that string, with leading zeros stripped, except when the string is empty.\n\nSo how do we model this? Well, perhaps the best approach is to model the transformation of the string, applying all the substitution rules, and then compute the numeric value of the transformed string, ignoring leading zeros, and then take mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the substitution is done in the order given. So each substitution replaces a digit in the current string with the corresponding ti.\n\nThe challenge is to process the substitutions efficiently.\n\nHmm, the initial string can be up to 105 characters long, and there are up to 105 queries. Each query can potentially replace a single character with a longer or shorter string. So the total length can vary a lot.\n\nBut processing each substitution naively by replacing each occurrence of di in the string step by step may be manageable since 105 steps, each with 105-length strings, is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, for each query, we can build a mapping of each digit to its replacement. But wait, the queries are applied in order, and each query can overwrite previous mappings. So for example, if a query comes later that changes the mapping for a certain digit, that will take precedence.\n\nYes, that's correct. So for each substitution, the digit di is replaced with ti. So the order of the queries matters because each new substitution may override the previous ones for the same digit.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to process each query in order, updating a substitution map, and then apply all substitutions in sequence.\n\nWait, but substitution isn't just a one-time thing. Because each substitution affects the current string, which can include the same digit that was previously substituted. So for example, if a substitution is made, and then another substitution is made that includes the same digit, the latest substitution will take effect.\n\nSo, the substitution rules must be applied in the order of the queries. So for each query, we need to replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\nSo, the straightforward way is to process each query in order:\n\n- For each query, parse di and ti.\n- Replace all instances of di in the current string with ti.\n- Keep track of the current string after each substitution.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, compute the numeric value of the string, ignoring leading zeros, and output the mod result.\n\nBut the problem is that for large substitutions, the string can become very long, but given the constraints (sum of ti lengths is up to 105), it's manageable.\n\nWait, the sum of ti lengths across all queries is at most 105. So the maximum possible size of the string after all substitutions is the initial s plus 105. Since the initial s can be 105, adding 105 gives 210. So even with 105 queries, each potentially increasing the string length, it's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. Read n queries, process them in order.\n\n3. For each query, split into di and ti. For each occurrence of di in the current string, replace it with ti.\n\n4. After all substitutions, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros (if any) and return the mod.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the substitution is applied to the current string, which may have been modified by previous substitutions. So, for each query, we replace all di's in the current string with ti.\n\nThis suggests that the substitution is done in a breadth-first manner. For example, if a substitution introduces more di's, they would be processed in the next substitution steps.\n\nWait, no. Because each substitution is done for the current string as it is at that moment. So, for example, if the first substitution replaces 'a' with 'bb', and the second substitution replaces 'b' with 'c', then the first substitution would turn 'a' into 'bb', and the second substitution would turn each 'b' into 'c', so the result is 'ccc'.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, processing each query in order, and for each query, replacing all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\nNow, the issue is to implement this efficiently.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n- Read s.\n\n- Read n.\n\n- For each of the n queries:\n\n   - Split the query into di and ti.\n\n   - Replace all occurrences of di in the current s with ti.\n\n- After all queries, process s to get the numeric value mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how to handle the numeric value correctly, considering leading zeros.\n\nFor example, after substitution, the string might be '00012', which represents the number 12, so mod is 12.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nApproach:\n\nCompute the numeric value of the string, treating leading zeros as insignificant, except when the string is all zeros (like '0000' is 0) or empty (also 0).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Process all substitutions, getting the final string s.\n\n2. If s is empty, the result is 0.\n\n3. Else, strip leading zeros to get the significant digits.\n\n4. If the significant digits are empty (all zeros), then the result is 0.\n\n5. Otherwise, compute the integer value of the significant digits, mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the problem says to ignore leading zeros. So for the string '000123', the number is 123, so mod is 123. But for '0000', the number is 0, so mod is 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter substitution, we have the string s.\n\nWe need to convert s into a number, stripping leading zeros, then compute mod.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Process substitutions, get s.\n\n- Remove leading zeros: find the first non-zero character, take the substring from there. If all are zeros, s is empty, which is 0.\n\n- Compute the numeric value of this substring.\n\n- Compute mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the numeric value can be very large, up to 1e210, which is impossible to handle directly. So, we need a way to compute the mod without building the full integer.\n\nAh, that's a key point. We can't represent the number as an integer due to its potential size, but we can compute the mod during the process of building the string.\n\nSo, the plan is to compute the mod as we process the string, handling each digit and updating the current mod value accordingly.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can model the process as follows:\n\nInitialize mod_value = 0.\n\nFor each character c in the string s:\n\n   mod_value = (mod_value * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n\nWhere MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, this is only correct if the string is treated as a number. But in our case, leading zeros are ignored. So, if the string is '00123', the actual number is 123, but the mod should be 123 mod MOD.\n\nBut the above method would compute (0*10 + 0) = 0, then (0*10 + 1) = 1, etc., which would give 123 mod MOD, which is correct.\n\nWait, because the leading zeros are processed as part of the string, but their contribution is zero. So the initial zeros contribute nothing to the mod. So, in effect, the mod is computed correctly whether or not we process the leading zeros.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to process the entire string, including leading zeros, and compute the mod as we go along.\n\nBecause each leading zero would multiply the current mod by 10 and add zero, which is equivalent to doing nothing. So the mod remains 0 until the first non-zero digit is processed.\n\nBut wait, let's test with an example.\n\nSuppose s is '000123'.\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nStart with mod_value=0.\n\nFirst '0': (0*10 + 0) = 0.\n\nSecond '0': same.\n\nThird '0': same.\n\nFourth '1': (0*10 +1) =1.\n\nThen '2': (1*10 +2)=12.\n\nThen '3': (12*10 +3)=123.\n\nMod is 123, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: s is '0123'.\n\nProcessing:\n\nmod_value starts at 0.\n\n'0' → 0.\n\n'1' → 1.\n\n'2' → 12.\n\n'3' → 123.\n\nMod is 123.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat about s is '0000'?

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the numeric value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The substitutions are applied in the given order, and after all substitutions, we need to handle leading zeros appropriately before computing the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Start by reading the initial string and the list of substitution queries.\n2. **Process Queries:** For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the corresponding replacement string.\n3. **Compute Modulo:** After processing all substitutions, convert the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().strip()\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    # Replace all occurrences of di in current_s with ti\n    current_s = current_s.replace(di, ti)\n\n# Now compute the mod\nif not current_s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Remove leading zeros\n    first_non_zero = 0\n    while first_non_zero < len(current_s) and current_s[first_non_zero] == '0':\n        first_non_zero += 1\n    if first_non_zero == len(current_s):\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        # Compute mod as we go\n        mod_value = 0\n        for c in current_s[first_non_zero:]:\n            mod_value = (mod_value * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n        print(mod_value)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The initial string and the number of queries are read first.\n2. **Processing Queries:** Each query is processed in order, replacing every occurrence of the specified digit with the given replacement string. This ensures that each substitution is applied correctly in the sequence provided.\n3. **Handling Leading Zeros:** After all substitutions, the resulting string is checked for leading zeros. If there are leading zeros, they are ignored when converting the string to a number.\n4. **Modulo Calculation:** The numeric value of the resulting string (after removing leading zeros) is computed iteratively to avoid handling very large numbers directly. Each digit is processed sequentially, updating the modulo value at each step to ensure efficiency.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the substitutions and computes the required result using modular arithmetic to manage potential overflow issues with large numbers.",
