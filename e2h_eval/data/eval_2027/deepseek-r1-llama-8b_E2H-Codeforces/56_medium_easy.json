Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases. Each base must have exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base. So, it's a perfect matching between R rebels and B bases.\n\nBut there's an additional condition: the straight paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. So, no two paths can cross each other in the galaxy plane.\n\nHmm. So, I need to determine if such a matching exists.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input consists of R spaceships and B bases. The coordinates are given, and no three points are colinear, which probably helps because it reduces some cases where lines could overlap.\n\nThe output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether a valid matching exists.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Read the input correctly.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n3. For each matching, check if any two paths intersect.\n4. If any matching satisfies that no paths intersect, output \"Yes\".\n5. If none do after checking all possibilities, output \"No\".\n\nWait, but wait. The number of matchings depends on the minimum of R and B. Oh, wait no, since R and B can be up to 10 each. But if R != B, then it's impossible to have a perfect matching. So first, I should check if R == B. Because each spaceship must assign to a base, and vice versa.\n\nWait, the problem says R and B are the numbers of spaceships and bases. So for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: It says \"R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", so the assignment is a perfect matching only if R = B. So in the code, the first thing to check is whether R equals B. If not, output \"No\" immediately.\n\nWait no, the problem says, \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\". Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the assignment is a perfect matching, which requires that R equals B. So if R is not equal to B, then it's impossible. So in that case, the answer is \"No\".\n\nSo the first step is: if R != B, output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo assuming R == B.\n\nThen, the next step is to generate all possible permutations (since it's a bijection) of the bases to the spaceships, and for each permutation, check whether the corresponding paths are non-intersecting.\n\nWait, but generating all permutations may be computationally expensive for R=10. Wait, 10! is 3.6 million, which is manageable. Because 3.6 million is not too bad for a program.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph problem. For each spaceship, connect it to bases, and find a matching where the edges don't cross.\n\nWait, but the crossing condition is a geometric condition. So it's more of a geometric matching problem.\n\nHmm. So the problem reduces to finding a perfect matching between two sets of points (spaceships and bases) such that when each spaceship is connected to its matched base, the segments do not intersect.\n\nThis sounds familiar. It's similar to the problem of finding a non-crossing bipartite matching.\n\nSo perhaps, the solution is to model this as a bipartite graph where each spaceship is connected to each base, and then find a maximum matching that's non-crossing.\n\nWait, but the matching has to be perfect, i.e., every node is matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartitioned graph where edges are only allowed if the line segments connecting them do not cross.\n\nWait, but even that seems tricky. Because it's not just about the edges in the bipartite graph; the edges in the matching itself must not cross.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to generate all possible perfect matchings and check for each whether any two edges cross.\n\nBut for R=10, generating all 10! = 3.6 million permutations is feasible.\n\nWait, but 3.6 million is manageable in Python, right? Because each iteration isn't too heavy.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- If R != B: output No.\n- Else, collect all the spaceships and bases into two lists, say S and B.\n- Then, generate all possible permutations of B's list, where each permutation represents a mapping from S to B.\n- For each permutation, create the set of line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base.\n- Check if any two of these segments intersect.\n- If any permutation results in no intersections, output Yes.\n- If none do, output No.\n\nSo, now the question is: how to efficiently check for line segment intersections.\n\nI remember that to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect, we can use the cross product method. The algorithm goes like this:\n\nCompute the orientation of four points A, B, C, D. Orientation is 0 if the points are colinear, 1 if they make a counter-clockwise turn, -1 otherwise.\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- Points A and B are on opposite sides of CD, and\n- Points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we don't have to worry about the case where points lie exactly on the same line, except for the two endpoints.\n\nSo, for two segments (p1, p2) and (q1, q2), we can compute their orientations.\n\nWait, here's a function to compute if two segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    (a, b) = s1\n    (c, d) = s2\n\n    # Check if points are in order on the line segments\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    if (ccw1 == 0 and ccw2 != 0) or (ccw1 != 0 and ccw2 == 0):\n        return False\n\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n    if (ccw3 == 0 and ccw4 != 0) or (ccw3 != 0 and ccw4 == 0):\n        return False\n\n    # General case: the segments straddle each other\n    return True\n\nWait, but wait. That function returns True only if the segments intersect properly. Because if any of the endpoints lie on the other segment, that would also count as an intersection.\n\nBut in our problem, the points are all unique, and no three are colinear. So, in our case, any two line segments either don't intersect, or intersect at exactly one point, and that point is one of the endpoints.\n\nSo, the function above should correctly handle all cases.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation, we need to generate all the pairs of line segments between the spaceships and their assigned bases, and check if any pair intersects.\n\nWait, but for a permutation of size R, the number of segments is R, and the number of pairs is R*(R-1)/2. For R=10, that's 45 per permutation. So, 3.6 million * 45 = about 162 million operations. Hmm, that's a lot. Is that manageable in Python?\n\nWait, let's calculate: 3.6 million permutations, each with 45 checks. 3.6e6 * 45 = 162e6 operations. That's 162 million checks. In Python, each iteration is a bit slow, but perhaps manageable within time constraints.\n\nWait, but what's the time limit? Well, for programming competitions, sometimes it's around 1-2 seconds. 162 million operations in Python might be tight, but perhaps it's manageable, especially since the actual computation per check is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to check for intersections.\n\nAnother idea: for a given permutation, the segments form a polygonal chain. We can process the segments in order and ensure that each new segment doesn't intersect with any previous ones.\n\nWait, but that's only applicable if the segments are ordered in a certain way. Like, if the permutation is processed in a particular order, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the segments as a list, and for each new segment, check against all existing segments.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the initial approach. So, perhaps the initial approach is the way to go.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, read R and B.\n\nIf R != B: print No.\n\nElse, read R spaceships into a list S.\n\nRead B bases into a list Bases.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   create a list of segments, each being (S[i], permutation[i])\n\n   for each pair of segments in this list:\n\n       check if they intersect.\n\n   if no intersections found, return Yes.\n\nIf after all permutations, none satisfy, return No.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n- Generate all permutations.\n\n- For each permutation, create the segments.\n\n- For each pair of segments, check for intersection.\n\nNow, the question is: how to implement this in Python.\n\nImplementing the permutation generator is straightforward using itertools.permutations.\n\nImplementing the segment intersection function is as discussed.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the segments can be represented as tuples of (x, y).\n\nSo, let's think about the code structure.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nbases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nIn this case, a possible matching is spaceship 0 → (-2,1), spaceship 1 → (0,3), spaceship 2 → (2,2). The segments are (0,0)-(-2,1), (2,0)-(0,3), (3,1)-(2,2). None of these segments intersect.\n\nSo the code should return 'Yes'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\nSpaceships: (1,0), (2,2)\n\nBases: (2,1), (3,1)\n\nMatching: spaceship 0 → (2,1), spaceship 1 → (3,1). The segments are from (1,0) to (2,1) and (2,2) to (3,1). Do these intersect?\n\nWait, let's plot this.\n\nSegment 1: from (1,0) to (2,1): this is a line going from lower left to upper right.\n\nSegment 2: from (2,2) to (3,1): this is a line going from upper middle to lower right.\n\nDo these two lines cross?\n\nThe first segment is from (1,0) to (2,1). The second is from (2,2) to (3,1).\n\nThese two segments cross each other. So the matching is invalid.\n\nAre there any other possible matchings? Since it's 2 elements, the only permutation is the one given. So the answer is No.\n\nSo, the code needs to correctly identify that.\n\nNow, coding.\n\nImplement the ccw function as described.\n\nImplement a helper function to check if two segments intersect.\n\nThen, for each permutation, check all pairs of segments in that permutation.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    a, b = s1\n    c, d = s2\n    # Check if c is on AB\n    if ccw(a, b, c) == 0 and ccw(a, b, d) != 0:\n        return True\n    # Check if d is on AB\n    if ccw(a, b, d) == 0 and ccw(a, b, c) != 0:\n        return True\n    # Check if a is on CD\n    if ccw(c, d, a) == 0 and ccw(c, d, b) != 0:\n        return True\n    # Check if b is on CD\n    if ccw(c, d, b) == 0 and ccw(c, d, a) != 0:\n        return True\n    # Now, general case: segments cross each other\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n    # If (ccw1 and ccw2 have different signs) and (ccw3 and ccw4 have different signs)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    # Also, check if any of the endpoints are the same as the other segment\n    # But according to problem statement, all points are unique, so no need.\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    B = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    S = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        S.append( (x, y) )\n        ptr +=2\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        ptr +=2\n\n    # Generate all possible permutations of the bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # Create the list of segments\n        segments = [ (S[i], perm[i]) for i in range(R) ]\n        # Check all pairs\n        conflict = False\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                s1 = segments[i]\n                s2 = segments[j]\n                if segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n                    conflict = True\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                break\n        if not conflict:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, the segments are built as a list where each element is a tuple of (ship, base). Then, for each pair of segments, we check if they intersect.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, when perm is (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2):\n\nsegments are ( (0,0), (-2,1) ), ( (2,0), (0,3) ), ( (3,1), (2,2) )\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nSeg1 and Seg2: (0,0)-(-2,1) vs (2,0)-(0,3). Let's compute ccw for seg1 and seg2.\n\nccw of (0,0), (-2,1), (2,0) is ( (-2-0)*(0-0) ) - ( (1-0)*(2-0) ) = ( (-2)*0 ) - (1*2) = -2.\n\nccw of (0,0), (-2,1), (0,3) is ( (-2)*3 - 1*0 ) = -6.\n\nSince both are negative, same sign.\n\nSimilarly, check the other way.\n\nccw of (2,0), (0,3), (0,0) is (0-2)(0-3) - (3-0)(0-2) = (-2)(-3) - 3*(-2) = 6 +6=12 >0.\n\nWait, maybe I should recompute.\n\nWait, the ccw function is (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x).\n\nFor seg1: A=(0,0), B=(-2,1).\n\nSeg2: A=(2,0), B=(0,3).\n\nCheck if any endpoint is on the other segment.\n\nSeg1's B is (-2,1). Does this lie on seg2?\n\nCompute ccw of (2,0), (0,3), (-2,1).\n\n(0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(-2-2) = (-2)*1 - 3*(-4) = -2 +12=10>0.\n\nNot zero.\n\nSimilarly, seg2's B is (0,3). Check if it's on seg1.\n\nSeg1's A is (0,0), B is (-2,1).\n\nccw(0,0), (-2,1), (0,3):\n\n(-2-0)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) = (-2)*3 -1*0 = -6.\n\nNot zero.\n\nSo, they don't share endpoints.\n\nSo, check the general case.\n\nccw of seg1's A,B with seg2's A,C.\n\nseg1's A,B: (0,0), (-2,1).\n\nseg2's A is (2,0), C is (2,0). Wait, no, the other segment is from (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the code, for each pair of segments, we compute if they intersect.\n\nSo, for the first two segments:\n\nSeg1 is (0,0) to (-2,1).\n\nSeg2 is (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nDo these intersect?\n\nLet's compute the ccw values.\n\nccw for seg1's A,B with seg2's A,C: A is (2,0), C is (2,0). Wait, that's the same point. No, wait, no, in the code, the segments are s1 and s2, which are two different segments.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to run through the code.\n\nIn any case, the code will correctly detect if any two segments in the permutation intersect.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the second sample:\n\nR=2, B=2.\n\nSpaceships: (1,0), (2,2).\n\nBases: (2,1), (3,1).\n\nThe only permutation is [(2,1), (3,1)].\n\nSo, the segments are (1,0)-(2,1) and (2,2)-(3,1).\n\nDo these segments intersect?\n\nCheck using the code.\n\ns1 is (1,0)-(2,1).\n\ns2 is (2,2)-(3,1).\n\nCompute ccw for s1's A,B with s2's A and B.\n\nccw(1,0, 2,2) = (2-1)(2-0) - (1-0)(2-1) → (1)(2) - (1)(1) = 2-1=1.\n\nccw(1,0, 3,1) = (3-1)(1-0) - (1-0)(3-1) → (2)(1) - 1*(2) = 2-2=0.\n\nSo, since one is zero, we check if the other point is on the segment.\n\nIs (3,1) on the segment (1,0)-(2,1)?\n\nParametrize: from (1,0) to (2,1), any point (x,y) can be written as (1+t, 0 + t), where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, (3,1) would require 1+t=3 → t=2, which is outside the segment. So no.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is not on the segment.\n\nSo, the general case.\n\nccw(s1.A, s1.B, s2.A) is 1.\n\nccw(s1.A, s1.B, s2.B) is 0.\n\nSo, for the first condition, since one is zero, we see if the other is not on the line. As (3,1) is not on s1, it's okay.\n\nThen, check the other way.\n\nccw(s2.A, s2.B, s1.A) = (2-3)(0-2) - (1-2)(1-2) → (-1)(-2) - (-1)(-1) → 2 -1=1.\n\nccw(s2.A, s2.B, s1.B) = (3-2)(1-2) - (1-2)(2-1) → (1)(-1) - (-1)(1) → -1 +1=0.\n\nAgain, one is zero, the other is not on the line.\n\nSo, check the general case.\n\nccw(s1.A, s1.B, s2.A) is 1.\n\nccw(s1.A, s1.B, s2.B) is 0.\n\nccw(s2.A, s2.B, s1.A) is 1.\n\nccw(s2.A, s2.B, s1.B) is 0.\n\nSo, the product of s1's ccw values is 1 * 0 = 0.\n\nWhich is not less than zero, so the condition (ccw1 * ccw2 <0) is false.\n\nSimilarly for the s2's part: 1 *0 is 0, so again, the condition is false.\n\nThus, the segments do not intersect according to the code.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggested they do.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine the two segments.\n\nSeg1: from (1,0) to (2,1).\n\nSeg2: from (2,2) to (3,1).\n\nWait, I think I may have miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's compute the orientation.\n\nPoint (1,0) is A, (2,1) is B.\n\nPoint (2,2) is C, (3,1) is D.\n\nCompute ccw(A,B,C):\n\n(B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\n= (2-1)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-1)\n\n= (1)*(2) - 1*(1) → 2-1=1.\n\nccw(A,B,D):\n\n(2-1)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(3-1)\n\n= (1)*(1) - 1*(2) → 1-2= -1.\n\nSo, since (A,B,C) is positive and (A,B,D) is negative, they are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nSimilarly, compute ccw(C,D,A):\n\nD.x - C.x = 3-2=1.\n\nD.y - C.y = 1-2=-1.\n\nA.x - C.x = 1-2=-1.\n\nA.y - C.y = 0-2=-2.\n\nccw(C,D,A) = (D.x - C.x)*(A.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y)*(A.x - C.x)\n\n= (1)*(-2) - (-1)*(-1) → -2 -1= -3.\n\nccw(C,D,B):\n\nB.x - C.x= 2-2=0.\n\nB.y - C.y= 1-2=-1.\n\nccw(C,D,B) = (0)*(-1) - (-1)*(2-2) → 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nSo, since (C,D,A) is negative and (C,D,B) is zero, but since (C,D,A) is not zero, we need to check if A is on CD.\n\nBut in our case, (C,D,A) is (-3), which is not zero. So, point A is not on CD.\n\nSimilarly, check if B is on CD: ccw(C,D,B) is zero, but B is (2,1), which is on the segment CD. Because CD is from (2,2) to (3,1), and (2,1) is not on that line. Wait, no, (2,2) to (3,1) is a line with slope (1-2)/(3-2) = -1.\n\nPoint (2,1): when x=2, y=2 - (2-2) = 2 → which is not 1. So, (2,1) is not on CD.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, the line CD is from (2,2) to (3,1). Its equation is y = -x + 4.\n\nPoint (2,1): substituting x=2 → y= -2 +4=2. So (2,1) is not on CD.\n\nSo, point B is not on CD.\n\nSo, in this case, the segments AB and CD cross each other.\n\nBecause A is on one side of CD, D is on another side, etc.\n\nSo, the code should return True for segments_intersect(s1, s2), leading to the permutation being invalid.\n\nBut according to the code, for this permutation, the segments_intersect function returns True.\n\nWait, but in the code, the function segments_intersect returns True only if any two segments cross.\n\nSo, in the code, for this permutation, the segments_intersect function would find that the two segments cross, thus making the permutation invalid.\n\nHence, the code would correctly return 'No' for the second sample.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential optimizations:\n\n- Pre-check if the number of bases is R, else output No.\n\n- Order the bases in a way that reduces the number of checks. For example, if a segment is added in a certain order, perhaps some early termination can happen.\n\nBut I think the code as written is efficient enough.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the efficiency of the permutation generator. Using itertools.permutations is efficient, but for R=10, it's 10! = 3,628,800 permutations. Each permutation requires R*(R-1)/2 = 45 checks, which is 3,628,800 *45 = 163,001,600 checks.\n\nEach check involves computing four ccw functions, which are O(1) operations.\n\nIn Python, each operation is relatively fast, but 1e8 operations can take about a second. 1.6e8 is about 1.6 seconds, which may be acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find a way to short-circuit as much as possible.\n\nIn the code, for a permutation, as soon as any pair of segments is found to intersect, the permutation is discarded.\n\nSo, in the best case, for a permutation with a lot of intersecting segments early on, it can break early.\n\nBut in the worst case, for a permutation with all segments not intersecting, it has to check all pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is manageable.\n\nTesting another case: R=1, B=1. Then, no segments, so output is Yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nSpaceships at (0,0), (1,1).\n\nBases at (1,0), (0,1).\n\nPermutation: [(1,0), (0,1)].\n\nSegments: (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1).\n\nDo these segments cross?\n\nSegment 1 is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (1,0).\n\nSegment 2 is from (1,1) to (0,1), which is a horizontal line.\n\nThese two segments are parallel, but do they cross? No, they are on different y levels.\n\nSo, the code should output Yes.\n\nBut wait, the segments are from (0,0) to (1,0) and from (1,1) to (0,1). These are two horizontal lines at y=0 and y=1, so they don't intersect.\n\nSo, the code would correctly return Yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nSpaceships: (0,0), (2,2).\n\nBases: (1,0), (0,1).\n\nPermutation: (1,0) and (0,1).\n\nSegments: (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2)-(0,1).\n\nCheck if these cross.\n\nCompute ccw for (0,0)-(1,0) with (2,2) and (0,1).\n\nccw((0,0),(1,0), (2,2)) = (1-0)*(2-0) - (0-0)*(2-0) → 1*2 - 0*2 = 2.\n\nccw((0,0),(1,0), (0,1)) = (1-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(0-0) → 1*1 -0=1.\n\nBoth positive.\n\nFor the other segment, (2,2)-(0,1):\n\nccw with (0,0) and (1,0).\n\nCompute ccw((2,2), (0,1), (0,0)): \n\n(0-2)*(0-2) - (1-2)*(0-2) → (-2)*(-2) - (-1)*(-2) → 4 - 2=2.\n\nccw((2,2), (0,1), (1,0)): \n\n(0-2)*(0-2) - (1-2)*(1-2) → (-2)*(-2) - (-1)*(-1) → 4 -1=3.\n\nSo, both positive.\n\nThus, the segments do not cross.\n\nSo, the code would accept this permutation.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the final code should be as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship should not intersect in the galaxy plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching**: First, ensure that the number of spaceships (R) equals the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, output \"No\" immediately as a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of the bases, create a mapping from spaceships to bases. This represents a potential assignment.\n3. **Check Segment Intersection**: For each permutation, generate the corresponding segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base. Check if any two segments intersect using the cross product method to determine orientation.\n4. **Early Termination**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting segments, output \"Yes\". If all permutations are checked and none satisfy the condition, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    a, b = s1\n    c, d = s2\n\n    # Check if c is on AB segment\n    if ccw(a, b, c) == 0 and ccw(a, b, d) != 0:\n        return True\n    # Check if d is on AB segment\n    if ccw(a, b, d) == 0 and ccw(a, b, c) != 0:\n        return True\n    # Check if a is on CD segment\n    if ccw(c, d, a) == 0 and ccw(c, d, b) != 0:\n        return True\n    # Check if b is on CD segment\n    if ccw(c, d, b) == 0 and ccw(c, d, a) != 0:\n        return True\n\n    # General case: check if the segments straddle each other\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    B = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    S = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr + 1])\n        S.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr + 1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        segments = [(S[i], perm[i]) for i in range(R)]\n        conflict = False\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                if segments_intersect(segments[i], segments[j]):\n                    conflict = True\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                break\n        if not conflict:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n2. **Permutation Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible mappings from spaceships to bases are generated.\n3. **Segment Intersection Check**: For each permutation, segments are created between spaceships and their assigned bases.
