He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then count how many such n's and list them.\n\nFirst, I think I need a way to compute Z(n) quickly. But for finding n given m, maybe I can use binary search. Because Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. So for a given m, the possible n's must lie in a certain range where Z increases by one each step, but sometimes jumps by more.\n\nWait, actually, when you increase n by 1, Z(n) increases by the number of new factors of 5 added. For example, n=5 adds 1, n=6 adds 0, n=10 adds 1, etc.\n\nWait no: Let me think. For n=24, Z(n)=4 (since 24/5=4, 24/25=0). For n=25, Z(25) is 6 because 25/5=5, 25/25=1, so total 6.\n\nSo between 24 and 25, Z increases by 2. So for m=5, the possible n's would be 25,26,... until when?\n\nWait, let's see the example given. The first sample input is m=5. The output says that the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but wait: 5! has 1 zero, 6! has 1 as well? No, wait:\n\nWait 5! is 120 → 1 zero.\n6! is 720 → 1 zero.\n7! is 5040 → 1 zero.\nWait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, 5! is 120 → 1 zero.\n6! is 720 → 1 zero.\n7! is 5040 → 1 zero.\n8! is 40320 → 1 zero.\n9! is 362880 → 1 zero.\n\nWait, 10! is 3628800 → which has two trailing zeros. Oh right! So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. That's why in the sample input, when m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows the input as ['1', '5'], but the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. Hmm, perhaps the input is given as two test cases, but perhaps that was a typo or misunderstanding. Or maybe it's a single input line with two values, but perhaps it's just an example.\n\nAnyway, back to the problem.\n\nSo for a given m, we need to find all n such that Z(n) = m. And then output the count and the list.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n_low such that Z(n_low) = m.\n2. Find the largest n_high such that Z(n_high) = m.\n3. All n's between n_low and n_high inclusive will satisfy Z(n) = m.\n4. The count is (n_high - n_low + 1).\n5. Then output the count and the list of these n's in order.\n\nBut how do we find n_low and n_high?\n\nWe can use binary search for this. Since Z(n) is monotonically increasing, for a given m, the possible n's form a contiguous range. So binary search can help us find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each possible n whether Z(n) equals m, but that's not efficient for large m.\n\nWait, but m can be up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. Then check if Z(n) is exactly m. If yes, then n_low is that n. Then find the next n where Z(n) > m, and the maximal n is one less than that.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to find the lower bound and the upper bound.\n\nWait, another approach is to note that for each n, Z(n) can be computed, and for a given m, the possible n's are consecutive numbers around the point where Z(n) becomes m.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nImplement a function count_trailing_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given m, find the smallest n where Z(n) = m. Similarly, find the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n\nOnce we have n_low and n_high, the count is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nWe can perform a binary search for the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. But since we need Z(n) exactly m, we have to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\nFind the smallest n where Z(n) = m. That can be done via binary search.\n\nSimilarly, find the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n\nAlternatively, find the first occurrence of m, then find the last occurrence.\n\nLet me think about how to find n_low:\n\nWe need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) == m.\n\nWe can start with low=0, high= some upper limit.\n\nWait, what's the maximum possible n for a given m? Well, since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, the maximum possible n is 5*m. But for larger m, say 1e5, 5*1e5 is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo during binary search:\n\nFor a given target m, find the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n\nWait, but binary search may not directly give that. Let's think.\n\nSuppose we have a function f(n) = Z(n). We want to find the minimal n where f(n) = m.\n\nWe can perform a binary search between low and high.\n\nWait, but how do we know when to stop? Because for some m, there may be a range of n's where f(n) = m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Find the first n where f(n) >= m.\n\nBut since f(n) can jump over m, we need to check if f(n) is exactly m.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\na. Binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nb. Check if f(n) is equal to m. If not, then there is no solution, return 0.\n\nc. Otherwise, find the maximum n where f(n) <= m. Or wait, perhaps find the maximal n where f(n) = m.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the lower bound and upper bound as follows:\n\nCompute the first n where Z(n) = m, then compute the last n where Z(n) = m.\n\nHow?\n\nWell, the first n can be found by binary search:\n\nWe can look for the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. But since Z(n) can only increase, if Z(n) is m, then perhaps n is the first occurrence.\n\nWait, but for example, m=5: the first n where Z(n) >=5 is 25, but Z(25)=6. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to find the minimal n where Z(n) == m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the minimal n is the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n\nBut perhaps using binary search isn't straightforward. Maybe we can instead compute n such that Z(n) is approximately m, then adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given m, the minimal n is somewhere around 5*m, but that's not precise.\n\nAlternatively, for the binary search, perhaps find the minimal n where Z(n) >=m, but then check if it's exactly m.\n\nIf it's exactly m, then the minimal n is that value. Then, we need to find the maximal n where Z(n) is m.\n\nWait, perhaps that's manageable.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_min where Z(n_min) = m.\n\n   a. Start with low=0, high=some upper limit (like 5*m).\n\n   b. While low < high:\n\n      i. mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n      ii. Compute z = Z(mid)\n\n      iii. If z < m: set low = mid + 1\n\n      else: set high = mid\n\n   c. After loop, low is the minimal n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n   d. Check if Z(low) == m. If not, then no solution, return 0.\n\n2. Now, find the maximal n_max where Z(n_max) = m.\n\n   a. To find the maximal n, perhaps we can start from low and find the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n\n   b. We can increment low until Z(low) exceeds m.\n\n   c. Then the maximal n is the last n where Z(n) = m before it exceeds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform another binary search for the upper bound.\n\nWait, perhaps after finding n_min, we can find the next n where Z(n) > m, and then subtract 1.\n\nFor example:\n\nOnce n_min is found where Z(n_min) = m, the next n where Z(n) > m is the first occurrence where Z increases beyond m. Then the maximal n is that n -1.\n\nSo:\n\nCompute n_next = first n where Z(n) > m.\n\nThen n_max = n_next -1.\n\nSo, how to compute n_next:\n\nWe can perform a binary search from n_min upwards to find the minimal n where Z(n) > m.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, starting from n_min, we can incrementally check higher n's until Z(n) > m. Once found, then n_max is that n minus 1.\n\nBut for large m, this might take a lot of steps. So perhaps for efficiency, better to use binary search.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Compute n_min via binary search, as the minimal n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n   - If Z(n_min) != m, return 0.\n\n- Compute n_next via binary search, the minimal n where Z(n) > m.\n\n- Then n_max = n_next -1.\n\n- The count is n_max - n_min +1.\n\n- Output the count, followed by the numbers from n_min to n_max.\n\nNow, the key is implementing the binary search correctly.\n\nLet me outline the binary search functions.\n\nFunction to compute Z(n):\n\ndef count_zero(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard method.\n\nNow, for finding n_min:\n\nWe can perform a binary search where we find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n\nWait, no. Because n_min is the first n where Z(n) == m. So perhaps the initial approach is to find the first n where Z(n) == m.\n\nWait, but binary search typically finds the first occurrence in a sorted array. Since Z(n) is strictly increasing, perhaps the binary search can be modified to find the first occurrence where Z(n) >= m.\n\nWait, no. Because for some m, like m=5, the minimal n is 25, but Z(25)=6. So that approach won't work.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary search should be designed to find the first n where Z(n) is equal to m.\n\nBut how can that be done?\n\nAlternative approach: for a given m, we can compute the minimal and maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n\nWait, perhaps another way is to find the lower and upper bounds by finding the points where adding 1 to n increases Z(n) by 1.\n\nAlternatively, considering that Z(n) is the sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ..., which can be considered as a non-decreasing function.\n\nSo for a given m, the possible n's are a continuous interval [a, b], and for any n in [a, b], Z(n) = m.\n\nThus, to find a, the first n where Z(n) = m, and b, the last n where Z(n) = m.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find a via binary search, which is the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n\n2. Find b via binary search, which is the maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search for a and b.\n\nFor a, the minimal n where Z(n) = m:\n\nWe can perform a binary search where we look for the smallest n where Z(n) >= m. Then, once found, we need to check if Z(n) is exactly m. If it is, then a is that n. Otherwise, no solution.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, m=5: the minimal n where Z(n)>=5 is 25, but Z(25)=6>5. So in that case, there is no solution, but according to the sample, m=5 is possible.\n\nWait, no. Wait the sample says for m=1, n can be 5,6,7,8,9. So for m=5, perhaps the sample is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the sample input is [1,5], but the output is for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is showing two test cases, but perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the sample is for m=1 and m=5.\n\nWait, looking back, the sample input is shown as ['1', '5'], but the output is for m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5,6,7,8,9. So perhaps the sample is for m=1 and m=5, but the second case is m=5.\n\nWait, but in the note, the first sample says that 5! has 1 zero, 6! has 1, etc., up to 9!, which also has 1. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers.\n\nThen the output for m=5 would be something else. So perhaps the sample is showing two test cases, but the actual problem expects one test case per run.\n\nBut regardless, the problem requires handling a single m.\n\nSo, back to the algorithm.\n\nTo find a, the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n\nWe can't directly binary search for this because Z(n) can jump over m. So perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n   - Call this candidate_n.\n\n   - Check if Z(candidate_n) == m.\n\n   - If yes, then a = candidate_n.\n\n   - Else, no solution exists.\n\nBut wait, in the case where Z(candidate_n) is greater than m, but there exists an n where Z(n) = m, that approach won't capture it.\n\nWait, for example, let's say m=5. The candidate_n would be 25, where Z(25)=6>5. So the algorithm would think that there is no solution, but in reality, there is no n with Z(n)=5.\n\nWait, but in the sample, m=5 is the second case, but perhaps in that case, the output is zero.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps m=5 is handled as follows:\n\nCompute Z(n) for n=20: 20//5=4, 20//25=0 → Z=4.\n\nn=21: same.\n\nn=24: Z=4.\n\nn=25: Z=6.\n\nSo there is no n where Z(n)=5. So for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output for the first case is 5 numbers, and the second case is zero.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample input is for m=1 and m=5, and the outputs are as shown.\n\nSo, in code, for a given m, we can proceed as:\n\nFind the minimal n where Z(n) >=m.\n\nCheck if Z(n) ==m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, find the maximal n where Z(n) ==m.\n\nHow to find the maximal n?\n\nWe can start from n_min and keep increasing until Z(n) exceeds m.\n\nBut for large m, this could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perform a binary search to find the maximal n where Z(n) <=m.\n\nBut wait, since Z(n) is non-decreasing, the maximal n where Z(n) =m is the largest n such that Z(n) <=m and Z(n+1) >m.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nAfter finding n_min, the minimal n where Z(n) =m, we can perform a binary search in the range [n_min, upper_bound] to find the maximal n where Z(n) =m.\n\nBut what's the upper bound for the binary search? It could be 5*(m+1), but perhaps for practical purposes, n_min plus 100 or so is sufficient, because each step adds at most one to Z(n).\n\nBut perhaps a smarter way is to find the first n where Z(n) >m, and then the maximal n is that n-1.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute n_min as the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n\n   a. This is done by binary search.\n\n   b. If Z(n_min) != m, output 0.\n\n2. Compute n_max as the maximal n where Z(n) =m.\n\n   a. Find the first n where Z(n) >m.\n\n   b. Then n_max = n_first -1.\n\n3. The count is n_max -n_min +1.\n\n4. Output the count and the list.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement the binary searches correctly.\n\nLet's implement the binary search for n_min:\n\nWe can perform a binary search between low=0 and high=5*m (as an upper estimate). For each mid, compute Z(mid). If Z(mid) <m, set low=mid+1; else, set high=mid.\n\nWait, but the condition is to find the minimal n where Z(n)>=m. But perhaps that's not the same as finding the minimal n where Z(n) =m.\n\nWait, no. Because for some m, like m=5, the minimal n where Z(n)>=5 is 25, but Z(25)=6>5. So in that case, there is no solution.\n\nSo, the binary search for n_min should be for the minimal n where Z(n) >=m.\n\nOnce found, check if Z(n_min) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for the n_max:\n\nWe can find the first n where Z(n) >m.\n\nThis can be done via another binary search, starting from n_min.\n\nBecause for n >=n_min, Z(n) is at least m.\n\nWe need to find the smallest n where Z(n) >m.\n\nOnce found, n_max =n-1.\n\nSo, the binary search for n_max_candidate:\n\nSet low =n_min, high = some upper limit, say 5*(m+1).\n\nWhile low <high:\n\n   mid = (low + high)//2\n\n   if Z(mid) >m: set high=mid.\n\n   else: set low=mid +1.\n\nAt the end, low is the first n where Z(n) >m. So n_max=low-1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nImplement a function to compute Z(n):\n\ndef count_zero(n):\n    res =0\n    while n>0:\n        n =n//5\n        res +=n\n    return res\n\nThen, for a given m:\n\nbinary search to find n_min:\n\nlow =0, high=5*m.\n\nwhile low <high:\n\n   mid = (low +high)//2\n\n   z = count_zero(mid)\n\n   if z <m:\n\n       low=mid+1\n\n   else:\n\n       high=mid\n\nSo after loop, low is the minimal n where Z(n)>=m.\n\nif count_zero(low)!=m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   find n_max.\n\n   perform another binary search for the first n where Z(n)>m, starting from low.\n\n   low2 =low\n\n   high2= 5*(m+1)  # or higher.\n\n   while low2 <high2:\n\n       mid = (low2 +high2)//2\n\n       z =count_zero(mid)\n\n       if z>m:\n\n           high2=mid\n\n       else:\n\n           low2=mid+1\n\n   # now, low2 is the first n where Z(n)>m.\n\n   n_max=low2-1\n\n   count =n_max -low +1\n\n   print(count)\n\n   print the list from low to n_max, space-separated.\n\nWait, but what if low2 exceeds the maximum n we're checking? Like, for very large m, 5*(m+1) may not be sufficient.\n\nBut in practice, for m up to 1e5, 5*(m+1) is 5e5+5, which is manageable.\n\nTesting this approach:\n\nTest case 1: m=1.\n\nn_min is found via binary search.\n\nCompute for mid values:\n\nInitially, low=0, high=5*1=5.\n\nmid=2: Z(2)=0 <1 → low=3.\n\nmid=(3+5)/2=4: Z(4)=0 <1 → low=5.\n\nmid=5: Z(5)=1 ==1 → high=5.\n\nLoop ends with low=5.\n\nCheck Z(5)=1 → yes.\n\nNow, find n_max.\n\nBinary search for first n where Z(n)>1.\n\nStart with low2=5, high2=5*(1+1)=10.\n\nmid=7: Z(7)=1 → not >1.\n\nmid= (5+10)//2=7.\n\nZ(7)=1.\n\nso, low2=7+1=8.\n\nmid=(8+10)//2=9: Z(9)=1.\n\nlow2=9+1=10.\n\nmid=10: Z(10)=2>1 → high2=10.\n\nLoop ends, low2=10.\n\nn_max=10-1=9.\n\nSo the numbers are from 5 to 9 → 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nn_min is found as 25, but Z(25)=6>5 → so no solution, output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_min is found as 25 (Z=6).\n\nFind n_max:\n\nbinary search for first n where Z(n)>6.\n\nCheck mid=30: Z(30) =6+1=7>6 → so high=30.\n\nContinue until low2=25, high=30.\n\nEventually, the first n where Z(n)>6 is 30. So n_max=29.\n\nWait, what is Z(29)?\n\n29//5=5, 29//25=1 → total 6.\n\nZ(30)=30//5=6 +30//25=1 → total 7.\n\nSo yes, n_max=29.\n\nSo for m=6, the count is 29-25+1=5.\n\nNumbers 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the output would be 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=0. But according to the problem statement, m>=1.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle the required cases.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase m=1: as above.\n\nCase m=2: What's the possible n's?\n\nCompute Z(n) for n=5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nn=5:1.\n\nn=6:1.\n\nn=7:1.\n\nn=8:1.\n\nn=9:1.\n\nn=10:2.\n\nSo for m=2, the minimal n is 10.\n\nWhat's Z(10)? 2.\n\nFind n_max: first n where Z(n)>2.\n\nCheck Z(11):2.\n\nZ(12):2.\n\n...\n\nWait, wait, n=14: Z(14)=2.\n\nn=15:15//5=3, 15//25=0 → Z=3>2.\n\nSo the first n where Z(n)>2 is 15.\n\nThus, n_max=14.\n\nSo the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo the output is 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nAnother edge case: m=3.\n\nn_min is 15 (Z=3).\n\nn_max is the first n where Z(n)>3 is 20.\n\nZ(19) is 3 (19//5=3, 19//25=0 → 3).\n\nZ(20)=20//5=4, 20//25=0 →4>3.\n\nSo n_max=19.\n\nCount is 19-15+1=5.\n\nSo the numbers are 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about m=4?\n\nn_min is 20 (Z(20)=4).\n\nWait, wait, Z(20)=4, but what about n=19: Z(19)=3.\n\nSo n_min=20.\n\nn_max: find first n where Z(n)>4.\n\nCompute Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6>4.\n\nSo the first n where Z(n)>4 is 25.\n\nn_max=24.\n\nCount is 24-20+1=5.\n\nSo numbers 20-24.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_min via binary search.\n\nCheck if Z(n_min) !=m → output 0.\n\nElse, compute n_max via finding the first n where Z(n) >m.\n\nn_max is low2-1.\n\nCompute the count, and output.\n\nNow, in code.\n\nBut in Python, for large m, the binary search needs to be efficient.\n\nSo, writing the code.\n\nImplement count_zero as a helper.\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_min.\n\nCheck if count_zero(n_min) !=m → print 0.\n\nElse, compute n_max.\n\nPrint count and the list.\n\nSo the code:\n\ndef count_zero(n):\n    res =0\n    while n>0:\n        n =n//5\n        res +=n\n    return res\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlow, high =0, 5*m\nn_min =0\nwhile low < high:\n    mid = (low + high)//2\n    z = count_zero(mid)\n    if z < m:\n        low = mid +1\n    else:\n        high = mid\nn_min = low\nif count_zero(n_min) !=m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # find n_max\n    low2 =n_min\n    high2 =5*(m+1)\n    while low2 < high2:\n        mid = (low2 + high2)//2\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high2 = mid\n        else:\n            low2 = mid +1\n    n_max = low2 -1\n    count =n_max -n_min +1\n    print(count)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_min, n_max+1))))\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, the initial high is 5*m.\n\nBut for m=1, 5*1=5, which is correct.\n\nBut for m=5, 5*5=25, which is correct.\n\nBut what about m=6, 5*6=30, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=0 is not allowed.\n\nBut in the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nBut the code doesn't handle m=0.\n\nBut that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, after computing n_min, it checks if count_zero(n_min) ==m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute n_max.\n\nSo for m=5, n_min=25, count_zero(25)=6>5, so output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input: m=1.\n\nOutput:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nn_min=25, count_zero(25)=6!=5 → output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_min=25, count_zero(25)=6.\n\nCompute n_max:\n\nlow2=25, high2=5*(6+1)=35.\n\nbinary search:\n\nmid= (25+35)//2=30.\n\nz=30//5=6, 30//25=1 → total 7>6 → high2=30.\n\nmid= (25+30)//2=27.\n\nz=5 +1=6 → not >6 → low2=28.\n\nmid=28+30=29 → mid=29.\n\nz=5+1=6 → low2=30.\n\nmid=30: z=6 → low2=31.\n\nmid= (31+30)//2=30.5→30.\n\nWait, no, in Python, integer division.\n\nWait, perhaps better to reorganize.\n\nIn any case, the code should find that the first n where Z(n)>6 is 30, since Z(30)=7.\n\nSo n_max=29.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the binary search correctly.\n\n- Overflow or incorrect upper limits.\n\nBut for m up to 1e5, 5*(m+1) is 5e5+5, which is manageable.\n\nAnother thing: in the binary search for n_max, the high2 starts at 5*(m+1), but for some m, the first n where Z(n)>m could be beyond that. But in practice, for m up to 1e5, 5e5 is a safe upper limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps setting high2 to 5*(m+1) is sufficient.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves using binary search to efficiently find the range of such integers \\( n \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by the count of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   This formula sums up the contributions of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., in the factorial.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Range**: To find the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) = m \\), we perform a binary search between 0 and \\( 5 \\times m \\). If \\( Z(n) \\) at this smallest \\( n \\) is not equal to \\( m \\), there are no such \\( n \\) and the result is 0.\n\n3. **Finding the Upper Bound**: Once we have the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) = m \\), we need to find the largest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) = m \\). This is done by finding the first \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) > m \\) and then setting the upper bound as one less than this value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zero(n):\n    res = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        res += n\n    return res\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlow, high = 0, 5 * m\nn_min = low\nwhile low < high:\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    z = count_zero(mid)\n    if z < m:\n        low = mid + 1\n    else:\n        high = mid\nn_min = low\n\nif count_zero(n_min) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    low2, high2 = n_min, 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low2 < high2:\n        mid = (low2 + high2) // 2\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high2 = mid\n        else:\n            low2 = mid + 1\n    n_max = low2 - 1\n    count = n_max - n_min + 1\n    print(count)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_min, n_max + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input value \\( m \\) is read and stored.\n2. **Finding Minimum \\( n \\)**: Using binary search, we find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeroes equals \\( m \\).\n3. **Checking Validity**: If the count of trailing zeroes at this minimum \\( n \\) is not \\( m \\), we print 0.\n4. **Finding Maximum \\( n \\)**: We use another binary search to find the first \\( n \\) where the count exceeds \\( m \\), then set our upper bound as one less than this value.\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the count of such \\( n \\) values and the values themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
