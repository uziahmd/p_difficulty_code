Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about counting triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D, and the triangle is non-degenerate, which means x + y > z must hold.\n\nHmm, right. So the constraints are that x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but y has to be at least as big as x), and z is between C and D (and z has to be at least as big as y). Also, since it's a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But in this case, since x <= y <= z, the most restrictive condition is x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait: because x <= y <= z, so for the triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest. So yes, x + y > z is the necessary and sufficient condition.\n\nSo the plan is to find all possible triples (x, y, z) within the given ranges that satisfy x <= y <= z and x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the ranges, directly iterating through all possible x, y, z would be too slow, especially since the upper limits can be up to 5e5. So we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, let's consider the variables:\n\n- x can be from A to B.\n- For each x, y can be from max(x, B) to C. Wait, no: since B ≤ y ≤ C, and x can be up to B. So for a given x, y starts from B (since y >= x and x can be up to B). So y ranges from x to min(C, ...?), but wait, since y must be >= B (because B <= y <= C). Oh wait, no, the initial constraints are x is between A and B, y is between B and C, but also y >= x. So for a given x, y can range from max(x, B) to C.\n\nWait, no: the condition is x <= y, and B <= y <= C. So for a given x, y can be from max(x, B) to C.\n\nFor example, if x is 1 and B is 2, then y starts from 2.\n\nIf x is 3, then y starts from 3, but only if 3 <= C. So in general, for each x, y starts at max(x, B) and goes up to C.\n\nThen, for each y, z can be from max(y, C) to D. So z starts at C (if y is less than or equal to C) or higher, but wait, no: since y <= C, and z >= C. So for a given y, z starts at C, but if y is larger than C, then z starts at y. Wait, no: the problem says C ≤ z ≤ D. So for any y, z must be at least C, but also at least y, since y <= z. So z is from max(y, C) to D.\n\nBut wait, since y can't be more than C, because y's maximum is C. So z starts at C, because for any y <= C, z must be >= y and >= C. So for each y, z starts at y (but since y <= C, z starts at C, but wait no: for example, if y is 3 and C is 4, then z starts at 4. If y is 4, then z starts at 4.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nThe condition is C <= z <= D, and z >= y.\n\nSo for a given y, z can be from max(y, C) to D.\n\nBut since y can be as high as C (since y is up to C), when y = C, then z starts at C. So in general, z starts at C when y is C, and for lower y's, z starts at y if y < C? No, no. Because z must be >= y and >= C. So the minimum z can be is the maximum of y and C.\n\nWait, but since y is <= C (because y is between B and C), then max(y, C) is C. So for any y, z starts at C.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, y can be up to C. So when y is C, z starts at C. When y is less than C, like 3 and C is 4, then z must be >=4, because z has to be >= y (3) and >= C (4). So in",
