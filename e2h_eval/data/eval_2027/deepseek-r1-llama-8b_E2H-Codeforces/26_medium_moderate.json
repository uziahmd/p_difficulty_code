Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about counting triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D, and the triangle is non-degenerate, which means x + y > z must hold.\n\nHmm, right. So the constraints are that x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but y has to be at least as big as x and at most C), and z is between C and D (with z at least as big as y). Also, the triangle condition x + y > z must be satisfied.\n\nMy goal is to compute the total number of such triangles.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to approach this efficiently because the input can be up to 5e5, so any O(n^3) approach is definitely out of the question.\n\nLet's break down the variables:\n\nx ranges from A to B.\ny ranges from max(x, B) to C. But since x can't be more than B, y starts at B and goes up to C.\nz ranges from max(y, C) to D. Since y is at least B and C is <= D, z starts at C and goes up to D.\n\nBut wait, the problem says B ≤ y ≤ C and C ≤ z ≤ D. So y is in [B, C], and z is in [C, D]. Also, z has to be ≥ y because y ≤ C ≤ z.\n\nWait no, the problem statement says that y is ≤ C and z is ≥ C, but it doesn't directly say that z ≥ y. Wait, the original condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So y can be equal to C, and z can be equal to C as well, but z can also be larger. So for a given y, z can range from max(C, y) up to D? Or is it always that z starts at C?\n\nWait, no: if y is less than C, then z can be from C to D. Because y is ≤ C, so z is ≥ C. So for each y, z starts at C and goes up to D. Because even if y is less than C, z has to be at least C. So the lower bound for z is C.\n\nWait no, the condition is y ≤ C and z ≥ C. So z can be as low as C. So regardless of y's value, z starts at C.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express the constraints:\n\nThe problem states that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be from A to B, y from B to C, and z from C to D. Additionally, y >= x and z >= y. So for each x in [A, B], y is in [x, C], but since x <= B, y is in [B, C] because x can be as low as A, but y must be >= x and >= B. Wait, no. Wait, x is <= B, and y is >= B (since y is >= x and x can be up to B). So y is in [B, C].\n\nSimilarly, z is in [C, D], and since y can be up to C, z can be from C to D, but also z must be >= y, because y <= C and z starts at C. So for each y, z can be from C to D, but also must be >= y. So for each y, z starts at max(C, y) and goes up to D. But since y <= C (as per y's range), max(C, y) is just C. So z starts at C.\n\nWait, but what if y is greater than C? No, because y is in [B, C], so y is at most C. So z's lower bound is C. So for each y, z can be from C to D.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to iterating over all possible x, y, z within these ranges and counting the cases where x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the size of the input (up to 5e5 for each variable), we need an efficient way to compute this without triple loops.\n\nLet's think about the variables:\n\nFor x, possible values are from A to B. For each x, y ranges from max(x, B) to C. Wait, no. Because x can be as small as A, which is <= B. So for each x in [A, B], y can be from B to C, but y must be >= x. So for x <= B, y starts at B and goes up to C, but only if x <= B.\n\nWait, but x can be less than B. So for example, x could be 1, B is 2, then y starts at 2.\n\nSo for each x, y ranges from max(x, B) to C.\n\nSo the first step is to fix x and iterate through possible y values. For each pair (x, y), determine the range of z that satisfies z < x + y and z >= C.\n\nWait, but z must also be >= y, as per the initial condition, but since z >= C and y can be up to C, that's already satisfied.\n\nSo for each x and y, the valid z's are those that are >= C, <= D, and < x + y.\n\nSo for each (x, y), the z can vary from C to min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo the count for each (x, y) is the number of integers z where C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1). If x + y - 1 < C, then there are zero such z's.\n\nSo the problem reduces to summing over all x and y the maximum of (0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if x + y > C, else zero.\n\nWait, no. Because for z to be valid, it needs to be >= C and <= D, and also < x + y. So the lower bound is C, upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nIf x + y -1 < C, then this is negative, so the count is zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over x, y of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be:\n\nFor each x in [A, B]:\n   For each y in [max(x, B), C]:\n       if x + y > C:\n           upper_z = min(D, x + y - 1)\n           count += max(0, upper_z - C + 1)\n       else:\n           continue\n\nBut with x and y possibly up to 5e5, this would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: find for each y, the x's that can form a valid triangle with y.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find for each y, the x's that are in [A, B], and for each such x, the minimal z is C, and the maximal z is min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: for fixed y, find the range of x's that allow z to be in [C, D], i.e., x + y > z ≥ C.\n\nBut since z is at least C, for a fixed y, the condition is x + y > z ≥ C → z can be as high as min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo for a given y, the x can be in [A, B], and for each x, the count is the number of z's as before.\n\nBut again, this seems like it might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps for each y, we can precompute the minimal x that allows z to be as large as possible.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the problem differently.\n\nThe condition for the triangle is x + y > z.\n\nBut z must be at least C and at most D. So for a given y, the minimal x is A, and the maximal x is B.\n\nBut we need x + y > z_max, where z_max is min(D, x + y -1). Wait, no. Maybe I should reorganize.\n\nWait, for each y, the x can be in [A, B], and for each x, the z can be in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nSo for each y, the total contribution is the sum over x of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nSo for each y, the sum is:\n\nsum_{x = a to b} max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1)\n\nWhere a = A, b = B.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum quickly?\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nFor a fixed y, and varying x, the term inside depends on x. Let's see when x + y - 1 >= C. Otherwise, the term is zero.\n\nSo for x >= (C - y + 1), the term is positive.\n\nSo for x < (C - y + 1), the contribution is zero.\n\nThus, x must be >= max(A, C - y + 1).\n\nLet me define x_min = max(A, C - y + 1). If x_min > B, then no x contributes for this y.\n\nOtherwise, x ranges from x_min to B.\n\nThen, for each x in x_min to B, the term is min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1.\n\nLet me denote z_max = min(D, x + y -1). So the count per x is z_max - C + 1, if z_max >= C.\n\nWhich simplifies to (z_max - C + 1) if z_max >= C, else 0.\n\nBut since x >= x_min, x + y -1 >= (C - y + 1) + y -1 = C. So z_max will be >= C.\n\nSo the count per x is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nSo the sum becomes sum_{x = x_min to B} [ min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1 ]\n\nThis sum can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. When x + y -1 <= D: then min is x + y -1.\n2. When x + y -1 > D: min is D.\n\nSo for each y, we can find the x's where x + y -1 <= D and x + y -1 > D.\n\nLet me find the threshold x where x + y -1 = D.\n\nx_threshold = D - y + 1.\n\nSo for x < x_threshold, the min is x + y -1.\n\nFor x >= x_threshold, the min is D.\n\nBut x can't exceed B, so we have to consider whether x_threshold is beyond B.\n\nSo for each y:\n\nCompute x_min = max(A, C - y + 1).\n\nIf x_min > B: contribute 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute x_threshold = D - y + 1.\n\nIf x_threshold < x_min: all x's in [x_min, B] have x + y -1 > D. So for all these x's, the term is D - C + 1, provided D >= C.\n\nElse, split the sum into two parts:\n\na) x from x_min to x_threshold - 1: sum (x + y -1 - C + 1) = sum (x + y - C).\n\nb) x from x_threshold to B: sum (D - C + 1).\n\nSo let's formalize this.\n\nCase 1: x_threshold <= x_min.\n\nIn this case, for all x >= x_min, x >= x_threshold.\n\nThus, the sum is (B - x_min + 1) * (D - C + 1), but only if D >= C.\n\nCase 2: x_threshold > x_min.\n\nThen, x runs from x_min to x_threshold -1, and x_threshold to B.\n\nSum a: sum from x = x_min to x = x_threshold -1 of (x + y - C) = sum_x (x + (y - C)).\n\nSum b: sum from x = x_threshold to B of (D - C + 1) = (B - x_threshold + 1) * (D - C + 1), but only if D >= C.\n\nAdditionally, for both sums, we have to ensure that D >= C; otherwise, the term is zero.\n\nSo for each y, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute x_min = max(A, C - y + 1).\n\n   If x_min > B: continue.\n\n2. Compute x_threshold = D - y + 1.\n\n3. If x_threshold < x_min:\n\n   All x >= x_min have x + y -1 >= D.\n\n   So the count for this y is (B - x_min + 1) * (D - C + 1) if D >= C.\n\n   Else, it's zero.\n\n4. Else:\n\n   Split into two parts.\n\n   Sum a: x from x_min to x_threshold -1:\n\n      sum (x + (y - C)) → sum x is (x_min + x_threshold -1) * (y - C + 1) / 2.\n\n      Wait, sum from a to b of x is (a + b) * (b - a + 1)/2.\n\n      So sum_a = (y - C) * (number of terms) + sum of x from x_min to x_threshold-1.\n\n      Wait, no: each term is (x + y - C). So sum_a = sum x + (y - C) * (number of terms).\n\n      So:\n\n      n_terms_a = x_threshold - x_min\n\n      sum_x = (x_min + x_threshold -1) * n_terms_a // 2\n\n      sum_a = sum_x + (y - C) * n_terms_a\n\n   Sum b: x from x_threshold to B:\n\n      if D < C: sum_b = 0\n\n      else: number of terms is B - x_threshold + 1\n\n      sum_b = (number_of_terms) * (D - C + 1)\n\n   So total for this y is sum_a + sum_b.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each y in [B, C], we need to compute the above steps.\n\nBut y ranges from B to C, which could be up to 5e5. So the algorithm's time complexity is O(C - B + 1), which is acceptable if C is up to 5e5.\n\nBut wait, what about the initial y range?\n\nWait, earlier analysis said that y is in [B, C], because x is in [A, B], and y >= x and >= B.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop y from B to C.\n\nFor each y:\n\n   x_min = max(A, C - y + 1)\n\n   if x_min > B: continue.\n\n   x_threshold = D - y + 1\n\n   if x_threshold < x_min:\n\n      if D < C: continue.\n\n      count += (B - x_min + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n\n   else:\n\n      if D < C:\n\n          sum_a = 0\n\n          sum_b = 0\n\n      else:\n\n          n_terms_a = x_threshold - x_min\n\n          sum_x = (x_min + x_threshold -1) * n_terms_a // 2\n\n          sum_a = sum_x + (y - C) * n_terms_a\n\n          n_terms_b = B - x_threshold + 1\n\n          sum_b = n_terms_b * (D - C + 1)\n\n      count += sum_a + sum_b\n\nSo this way, for each y, the computation is O(1), leading to O(C - B + 1) time.\n\nNow, the question is how to handle the cases where D < C. Because then, the count for each y is zero.\n\nSo we can pre-check if D < C: then the entire count is zero.\n\nWait, yes. Because z must be >= C and <= D. So if C > D, then z cannot exist. So the count is zero.\n\nSo first, in the code, check if C > D. If so, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo, putting this all together.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4.\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ny ranges from 2 to 3.\n\nFor y=2:\n\nx_min = max(1, 3 - 2 +1 )= max(1, 2)=2.\n\nSince x_min=2 <= B=2.\n\nx_threshold =4 -2 +1=3.\n\nx_threshold=3 > x_min=2.\n\nSo sum_a: x runs from 2 to 2 (since x_threshold-1=2).\n\nsum_a: x=2. Each term is 2 + 2 -3 =1.\n\nsum_a = 1.\n\nsum_b: x runs from 3 to 2? No, because x_threshold=3 is greater than B=2. So sum_b=0.\n\nSo for y=2, count is 1.\n\nWait, wait: no. Wait, the sum_a is for x up to x_threshold-1, which is 2 (x_threshold is 3, x_threshold-1 is 2). So x runs from 2 to 2.\n\nEach term is 2 + (2-3) = 1. So sum_a is 1.\n\nsum_b is 0 since x_threshold=3 > B=2.\n\nSo total for y=2 is 1.\n\nBut according to the sample, the triangle (2,2,3) is counted, which has z=3. So for y=2, x=2, z can be 3 or 4?\n\nWait, no. Let's re-calculate:\n\nWait for y=2, x=2, z can be from 3 to min(4, 2+2-1=3). So z can be 3 only.\n\nSo one option.\n\nSo the code's calculation is correct.\n\nFor y=3:\n\nx_min = max(1, 3 -3 +1)=max(1,1)=1.\n\nx_threshold =4-3+1=2.\n\nx_threshold=2> x_min=1.\n\nSo sum_a: x from 1 to 1 (since x_threshold-1=1).\n\nEach term is x + (3-3) =x.\n\nSo for x=1: 1 + 0 =1.\n\nsum_a=1.\n\nsum_b: x from 2 to 2 (since B=2).\n\nEach term is min(4, 2+3-1)=4, so D=4, so term is 4-3+1=2.\n\nsum_b=2.\n\nTotal for y=3: 1+2=3.\n\nSo overall, y=2 contributes 1, y=3 contributes 3. Total 4. Which matches the sample.\n\nGreat.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: 1 2 2 5.\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ny ranges from 2 to 2.\n\nFor y=2:\n\nx_min = max(1, 2 -2 +1)=max(1,1)=1.\n\nx_threshold =5 -2 +1=4.\n\nx_threshold=4> x_min=1.\n\nSo sum_a: x from 1 to 3 (since x_threshold-1=3, but B is 2).\n\nWait, wait, x can be up to B=2.\n\nSo sum_a is x from 1 to 2.\n\nWait, no: x_threshold is 4, so x runs from x_min=1 to x_threshold-1=3, but since B is 2, the x can only go up to 2.\n\nSo sum_a is x from 1 to 2.\n\nEach term is x + (2-2) =x.\n\nsum_x = (1+2)*2/2=3.\n\nsum_a=3.\n\nsum_b: x runs from 4 to 2 → no terms. So sum_b=0.\n\nWait, but D is 5, which is >= C=2.\n\nSo for sum_a: each term is x (since y=2, C=2, so x + 0).\n\nFor x=1: 1.\n\nx=2: 2.\n\nsum_a = 3.\n\nsum_b: x starts at 4, but B is 2, so no terms.\n\nSo total for y=2 is 3.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output is 3.\n\nWait, but sample's note says three triangles: (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3).\n\nWait, what's wrong here?\n\nAh, wait, no: in the sample, y=2 and x can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1 and y=2:\n\nz can be from 2 to min(5, 1+2-1=2). So z=2.\n\nThat's one triangle.\n\nFor x=2 and y=2:\n\nz can be from 2 to min(5, 2+2-1=3). So z=2,3.\n\nThat's two triangles.\n\nSo total 3.\n\nWhich matches the code's calculation.\n\nWait, but according to the code, for y=2, sum_a is 3, which includes x=1 and x=2. But wait, for x=1, the count is 1 (z=2).\n\nFor x=2, the count is 2 (z=2 and 3).\n\nSo total 1+2=3.
