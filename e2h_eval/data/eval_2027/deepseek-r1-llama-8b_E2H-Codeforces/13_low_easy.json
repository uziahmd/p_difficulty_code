For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a major and minor triad. From the description, a major triad has two specific distances between consecutive notes when ordered properly. Similarly, a minor triad has another pair of distances.\n\nLet me break down the definitions:\n\n- For a major triad (X, Y, Z), when arranged in order, the distance from X to Y should be 4 semitones, and Y to Z should be 3. So the total from X to Z is 7 semitones.\n- For a minor triad, the distance from X to Y is 3 semitones, and Y to Z is 4. Again, the total is 7 semitones but in a different arrangement.\n\nWait, but how do the notes wrap around? Since the notes are cyclic, after H comes C again. So the distance from H to C is 1 semitone, right?\n\nI think the first step is to assign each note a numerical value so that we can compute the distances correctly. Let's create a list that maps each note to its position in the scale. The order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait—wait, the initial problem statement says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, because H is the last before C again. So let me list them as:\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo each note has an index from 0 to 11. The distance between two notes X and Y is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) mod 12. But since we're moving forward, the distance is always the positive difference modulo 12. Or wait, no—the problem says the distance is from the lower to the higher, so for example, E to C is 8 semitones, but C to E is 4.\n\nWait, the problem says: the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones going upward. So if X is lower than Y, it's Y - X. But if X is higher, like E to C, then it wraps around and is 12 - (E's index - C's index). Wait, no—let me think.\n\nWait, the scale is cyclic. So the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) % 12. Because if X is higher than Y, adding 12 gives the correct count.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for any two notes, the distance is the minimal way to go up from one to the other. So for example, C to E is 4 semitones, E to C would be 8 (since you go E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C). So the function to compute distance should return the positive difference in their positions, considering the cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, which will always give a positive number between 0 and 11. Because for example, C is 0, E is 4. 4-0=4. For E to C: (0 -4) mod12 is 8. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is: assign each note an index from 0 to 11. Then, for any triplet of notes, we need to consider all possible orderings of these three notes and check if any ordering satisfies the major or minor triad conditions.\n\nBecause the triad is an unordered set, we can arrange the three notes in any order and see if any permutation satisfies the condition.\n\nSo for each permutation of the three notes, calculate the distances between the first and second, and second and third. Then, check if either of the major or minor conditions is met.\n\nWait, but since it's an unordered set, we can try all possible orderings of the three notes and see if any of them meets the major or minor criteria.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Create a mapping from note names to their indexes.\n2. Read the input triplet as a list of three note strings.\n3. For each possible permutation of these three notes, check if they form a major or minor triad.\n4. If any permutation satisfies the major condition, the chord is major.\n5. Else, if any permutation satisfies the minor condition, it's minor",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: \n   - A major triad is defined by two specific distances between consecutive notes when ordered: 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones.\n   - A minor triad is defined by two specific distances: 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones.\n   \n2. **Assign Numerical Values to Notes**: \n   - Each note (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H) is assigned a numerical index from 0 to 11. This helps in calculating the distances between notes.\n\n3. **Calculate Distances**:\n   - The distance between two notes is calculated as the difference in their indices modulo 12, ensuring cyclic calculation.\n\n4. **Check All Permutations**:\n   - For each permutation of the three notes, calculate the distances between consecutive notes and check if they match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input notes\nnotes = input().split()\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n# Create a dictionary to map each note to its index\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of the input notes\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    # Get their indices\n    i_x = note_indices[x]\n    i_y = note_indices[y]\n    i_z = note_indices[z]\n    \n    # Calculate distances\n    dist_xy = (i_y - i_x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (i_z - i_y) % 12\n    \n    # Check for major triad condition: 4, 3\n    if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n        is_major = True\n        break\n    # Check for minor triad condition: 3, 4\n    elif dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n        is_minor = True\n        break\n\nif is_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of three note strings.\n2. **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to its respective index in the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations**: We generate all permutations of the three notes to explore all possible orderings.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modulo 12 arithmetic.\n5. **Triad Check**: We check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad and print the result accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify the type of chord based on the given criteria, efficiently handling all edge cases.",
