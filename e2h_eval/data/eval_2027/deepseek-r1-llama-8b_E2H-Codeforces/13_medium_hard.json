For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are given as strings separated by spaces, and they can be in any order. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a major and minor triad. From the description:\n\n- A major triad has a specific order where the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 3 semitones apart. So, for example, C E G: C to E is 4, E to G is 3. So the total from C to G is 7 semitones.\n- A minor triad is the opposite: the first two are 3 semitones apart, and the next two are 4. Like in C# B F arranged as B C# F: B to C# is 3, C# to F is 4.\n\nSo the approach is: take all possible permutations of the three notes, compute the semitone distances in each permutation, and check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nWait, but the notes can be in any order. So for each permutation of the three notes, we need to calculate the distances between consecutive notes and see if either of the major or minor conditions hold.\n\nBut how do I represent the notes numerically? Because the distance between them depends on their positions in the scale.\n\nLet me list out the order of the notes and assign each a number. The sequence is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes. Wait, wait, the problem says there are 12 notes including H. Oh, right. So the order is important because the distance is cyclic.\n\nSo perhaps I should create a list where each note corresponds to its position. Then, for each note, I can find its numerical value, and then compute the distances.\n\nLet me think about creating a mapping from note names to their indices. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, up to H which is 11.\n\nOnce I have that, for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but considering the direction. Wait, no. Because the distance is always from lower to higher. So for two notes A and B, the distance is (B_index - A_index) mod 12, but only if B comes after A. But when we wrap around, like from H (11) to C (0), that's 1 semitone. So the correct way is to compute (B - A) mod 12, which gives the positive difference.\n\nWait, no. Because if A is at index i and B is at j, then the distance is (j - i) if j >i, else (12 - (i - j)). So the semitone distance is (j -i) %12.\n\nYes, because (j -i) mod 12 will give the correct number of steps forward. So for example, from H (11) to C (0): 0 -11 = -11, mod 12 is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo step 1: create a dictionary mapping each note name to its index.\n\nLet me write down the order:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo each note is assigned 0 to 11 respectively.\n\nNext, for a given set of three notes, say [X, Y, Z], I need to consider all possible orderings (permutations) of these three notes. Because the triad could be major or minor based on any permutation.\n\nFor each permutation, I'll calculate the distances between the first and second, and second and third. Then, I'll check if those distances match the major or minor condition.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies the major condition, the triad is major. Similarly for minor. Otherwise, it's strange.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the answer is unambiguous; no triad can be both major and minor. So once I find a permutation that fits major, I don't need to check for minor, unless I'm sure that it's not possible for it to fit into both. But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that no such cases exist, so I can process in any order.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. Read the input as a list of three note strings.\n\n2. Create the note_to_index mapping.\n\n3. For each permutation of the three notes:\n   a. Get the indexes of the three notes.\n   b. Calculate the distances between consecutive pairs.\n   c. Check if the distances are 4,3 for major (so the first distance is 4, second is 3). Or 3,4 for minor.\n\n4. If any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'; else if any permutation satisfies minor, return 'minor'; else, 'strange'.\n\nSo first, let's figure out how to generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nIn Python, the itertools.permutations function can be used. For a list of three elements, it will generate 6 permutations, each as a tuple of the three notes.\n\nBut wait, the same note could be present multiple times. Oh, but the problem says the input is three space-separated notes. Are duplicates allowed? The problem doesn't specify, but looking at the sample input, all are distinct. So perhaps the code should handle duplicates, but since the chord is an unordered set, perhaps having duplicate notes doesn't form a valid triad. But the problem says it's exactly three notes, but doesn't specify if they must be distinct. Hmm, but the problem statement says \"a set\", which implies no duplicates. So perhaps the code can assume that the three notes are distinct.\n\nBut perhaps in the code, the case where two or more notes are the same would not form a triad. So in that case, the output would be 'strange' because the distances would not meet the required conditions.\n\nSo, in our code, for each permutation, even if some notes are same, it's considered.\n\nWait, but for the distance calculation, if two notes are the same, their distance is zero. So for a permutation where two notes are same, the distances between them would be zero, which can't satisfy the major or minor conditions. So in that case, the triad would be 'strange'.\n\nSo the code can handle that naturally.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nRead the input as a list. Split the input string into three note strings.\n\nThen, for each permutation of the three:\n\n- Get their indexes in the notes_order list.\n\n- Compute d1 = (index2 - index1) mod 12.\n\n- Compute d2 = (index3 - index2) mod 12.\n\nThen, check if (d1 ==4 and d2 ==3) → major.\n\nOr (d1 ==3 and d2 ==4) → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'.\n\nElse, check if any permutation satisfies minor, output 'minor'.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nSo, now, implementing this.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the order is important. For example, in a major triad, the first two notes are 4 apart, the next two are 3 apart.\n\nBut for the minor triad, the first two are 3, next two are 4.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we need to arrange the notes in such a way that their order satisfies one of these conditions.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    idx_a = note_to_index[a]\n    idx_b = note_to_index[b]\n    idx_c = note_to_index[c]\n\n    d1 = (idx_b - idx_a) % 12\n    d2 = (idx_c - idx_b) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        is_major = True\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        is_minor = True\n\nBut wait, since the problem says that the answer is unique, as soon as is_major is True, we can break and return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo perhaps in code, we can loop through all permutations, and for each, check if it satisfies major or minor. As soon as a major is found, we can mark it as such and break early.\n\nAlternatively, we can collect all the possibilities and then decide.\n\nBut with only 6 permutations, it's efficient enough to just process all of them.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    idx_a = note_to_index[a]\n    idx_b = note_to_index[b]\n    idx_c = note_to_index[c]\n\n    d_ab = (idx_b - idx_a) % 12\n    d_bc = (idx_c - idx_b) % 12\n\n    if d_ab ==4 and d_bc ==3:\n        found_major = True\n    elif d_ab ==3 and d_bc ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print('major')\nelif found_minor:\n    print('minor')\nelse:\n    print('strange')\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, no, the input is three space-separated notes. So in the sample input, the input lines are:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, no, wait, the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps it's a typo. No, the actual input is one line with three notes, each being a string.\n\nWait, no, the user wrote the sample input as:\n\nInput:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in formatting. The actual input is a single line with three note strings, each note is a single character or two characters (like C, C#, etc.) So for example, the first sample input line is 'C E G', which is three notes: C, E, G.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is three space-separated note strings. Each note can be one or two letters, but in the problem statement, the notes are as per the list: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo each note is represented as a single character except for C#, D#, etc., which are two characters.\n\nSo for example, the first note is 'C', second is 'E', third is 'G' for the first sample.\n\nSo in the first sample input, the three notes are C, E, G.\n\nSo the code will process each permutation, calculate the distances.\n\nFor C, E, G:\n\nPermutation (C, E, G):\n\nd_ab = (E - C) → 4 semitones.\n\nd_bc = (G - E) → 3 semitones. So it's major.\n\nThus, found_major is True. So output is 'major'.\n\nSecond sample input: ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nWait, no, the sample input is 'C# B F' → the three notes are C#, B, F.\n\nWe need to find a permutation that satisfies minor.\n\nLooking for a permutation where the first two are 3 semitones apart, and the next two are 4.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nLooking at B, C#, F.\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nCompute d_ab = (1 - 10) mod 12 → (1-10) is -9 → mod 12 is 3.\n\nd_bc = (5 -1) mod 12 →4.\n\nSo d_ab is 3, d_bc is4. So this permutation satisfies minor.\n\nThus, found_minor is True, so output is 'minor'.\n\nThird sample input: ['A', 'B', 'H'].\n\nWhat's the permutation?\n\nA is index 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCompute all permutations.\n\nCheck for major:\n\nPossible permutations:\n\nA B H:\n\nd_ab=1, d_bh=1 → no.\n\nA H B:\n\nd_ab= (10-9)=1, d_bh=(11-10)=1 → no.\n\nB A H:\n\nd_ab= (9-10) mod 12 → 11.\n\nd_ah=(11-9)=2 → no.\n\nWait, no, wait, the permutation is (B, A, H). So a is B (10), b is A (9), c is H (11).\n\nd_ab = (9-10) mod12 = 11.\n\nd_bc = (11-9) mod12 = 2.\n\nNo.\n\nOther permutations:\n\nB H A:\n\nb is B (10), h is H (11), a is A (9).\n\nd_ab=1, d_ha= (9-11) mod12 → (9-11) is -2 → mod12 is 10. So no.\n\nH B A:\n\nh is H (11), b is B (10), a is A (9).\n\nd_ab= (10-11) mod12 = 11.\n\nd_bc= (9-10) mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: H A B.\n\nh is 11, a is 9, b is 10.\n\nd_ab= (9-11) mod12=10.\n\nd_bc= (10-9) mod12=1.\n\nNo.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo none of the permutations satisfy either major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about a triad with all same notes? Like C C C. Then, for any permutation, the distances are 0 and 0. So not major or minor.\n\nThus, output is 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: E, G, C.\n\nE is 4, G is 6, C is 0.\n\nLet's see permutations.\n\nE, G, C:\n\nd_ab=2, d_bc= (0-6) mod12=6. Not matching.\n\nE, C, G:\n\nd_ab= (0-4) mod12=8, d_bc= (6-0) mod12=6. No.\n\nG, E, C:\n\nd_ab= (4-6) mod12=10, d_bc= (0-4) mod12=8.\n\nNo.\n\nG, C, E:\n\nd_ab= (0-6) mod12=6, d_bc= (4-0) mod12=4.\n\nSo d_ab=6, d_bc=4. Not matching.\n\nC, E, G: yes, 4 and 3. So it's a major triad.\n\nWait, but wait, the permutation (C, E, G) is in the input as C, E, G. So yes, it's a major.\n\nSo the code would correctly identify it.\n\nAnother edge case: the triad is E, C, G. So the permutation E, C, G.\n\nd_ab= (0-4) mod12=8, d_bc= (6-0) mod12=6 → no.\n\nBut the permutation C, E, G would be the correct one.\n\nSo the code correctly finds it.\n\nAnother edge case: the triad is C, D#, G.\n\nWait, what's that? Let's see: C is 0, D# is 3, G is 6.\n\nIn permutation C, D#, G: d_ab=3, d_bc=3. Not matching.\n\nC, G, D#: d_ab=6, d_bc= (3-6) mod12=9.\n\nNo.\n\nD#, C, G: d_ab= (0-3) mod12=9, d_bc= (6-0) mod12=6.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, but another permutation: D#, G, C.\n\nd_ab= (6-3)=3 mod12=3.\n\nd_bc= (0-6)=6 mod12=6.\n\nSo d_ab=3, d_bc=6 → doesn't match.\n\nWait, what's the major condition?\n\nWe need d_ab=4, d_bc=3.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo perhaps this is a strange triad.\n\nWait, perhaps I should test another case.\n\nWhat about C, D#, G#.\n\nC is 0, D# is 3, G# is 8.\n\nIn permutation C, D#, G#:\n\nd_ab=3, d_bc=5 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: D#, C, G#.\n\nd_ab= (0-3) mod12=9, d_bc= (8-0) mod12=8 → no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not thinking of a known triad.\n\nAlternatively, think of a minor triad: A, C, E.\n\nA is 9, C is 0, E is4.\n\nWait, in the permutation A, C, E:\n\nd_ab= (0-9) mod12=3.\n\nd_bc= (4-0) mod12=4.\n\nSo 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nSo the code would detect that.\n\nAnother test: E, G#, C.\n\nE is4, G# is8, C is0.\n\nIn permutation E, G#, C.\n\nd_ab=4, d_bc= (0-8) mod12=4.\n\nWait, 0-8 is -8, mod12 is 4.\n\nSo d_ab=4, d_bc=4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother permutation: G#, E, C.\n\nd_ab= (4-8) mod12= 8 → no.\n\nWait, maybe another permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct permutation is E, C, G#.\n\nd_ab= (0-4) mod12=8, d_bc= (8-0) mod12=8 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not getting the right example.\n\nBut regardless, the code will correctly check all permutations.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, to implement this.\n\nPotential issues: making sure the note_to_index is correctly built.\n\nWait, the note_order list is ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'].\n\nSo C is 0, C# 1, D 2, D#3, E4, F5, F#6, G7, G#8, A9, B10, H11.\n\nSo the code correctly builds the note_to_index.\n\nAnother point: the input is three space-separated note strings. So, for example, the input could be 'C E G' → which is three notes.\n\nThus, the code uses input().split(), which splits on whitespace.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    idx_a = note_to_index[a]\n    idx_b = note_to_index[b]\n    idx_c = note_to_index[c]\n    \n    d_ab = (idx_b - idx_a) % 12\n    d_bc = (idx_c - idx_b) % 12\n    \n    if d_ab ==4 and d_bc ==3:\n        found_major = True\n    elif d_ab ==3 and d_bc ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print('major')\nelif found_minor:\n    print('minor')\nelse:\n    print('strange')\n\nWait, but wait: the problem statement says that the three notes may be in any order, so the code correctly checks all permutations.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1: ['C', 'E', 'G']\n\nOne permutation is C, E, G. d_ab=4, d_bc=3 → major.\n\nSample 2: ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nLooking for a permutation where d_ab=3, d_bc=4.\n\nLike B, C#, F: B is 10, C# is 1, F is5.\n\nd_ab = (1-10) mod12= 3.\n\nd_bc =5-1=4 mod12=4.\n\nSo minor.\n\nSample 3: ['A', 'B', 'H'].\n\nNo permutation satisfies either condition.\n\nThus, code outputs 'strange'.\n\nSo all test cases pass.\n\nAnother test case: ['C', 'E', 'G'] → major.\n\nAnother test case: ['A', 'C', 'E'] → minor.\n\nAnother test case: ['E', 'C', 'G'] → no permutation will have d_ab=4 and d_bc=3 except for C,E,G.\n\nSo code correctly identifies.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are provided in any order, and we need to check all possible permutations to classify the triad correctly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: A major triad is defined by two specific distances between consecutive notes: 4 semitones between the first two notes and 3 semitones between the next two notes. A minor triad is the opposite, with 3 semitones between the first two notes and 4 semitones between the next two notes.\n2. **Note Representation**: Each note is assigned a numerical index based on its position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distance between notes easily.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Since the order of notes matters, we generate all permutations of the given three notes. For each permutation, we compute the distances between consecutive notes and check if they match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Efficiency**: Given that there are only 6 permutations of three notes, checking each permutation is computationally efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    idx_a = note_to_index[a]\n    idx_b = note_to_index[b]\n    idx_c = note_to_index[c]\n    \n    d_ab = (idx_b - idx_a) % 12\n    d_bc = (idx_c - idx_b) % 12\n    \n    if d_ab == 4 and d_bc == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    elif d_ab == 3 and d_bc == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print('major')\nelif found_minor:\n    print('minor')\nelse:\n    print('strange')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Index Mapping**: We map each note to its respective index in the musical scale. This allows us to compute the distance between any two notes using modular arithmetic.\n2. **Permutation Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the given three notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we calculate the distance between consecutive notes using the formula `(idx_b - idx_a) % 12` and `(idx_c - idx_b) % 12`.\n4. **Triad Check**: We check if the calculated distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If any permutation satisfies the major condition, we mark it as a major triad. Similarly, if any permutation satisfies the minor condition, we mark it as a minor triad.\n5. **Result Determination**: Based on the checks, we output whether the triad is major, minor, or strange.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately classify the given triad by considering all possible note orders and their respective distances.",
