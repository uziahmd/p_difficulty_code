The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to unlock as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that for a key j and chest i, a_i + b_j must be odd. Also, each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked at most once.\n\nHmm, right. So the main thing here is that each key can only be used once. So we need to pair keys and chests such that their sum is odd, and maximize the number of chests opened.\n\nLet me think about the parity. Because for a_i + b_j to be odd, one must be even and the other odd. So, for each key, depending on whether it's even or odd, it can unlock a chest that is of the opposite parity.\n\nSo the first step is to separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the condition is that a_i + b_j is odd. So if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd. And if a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\nSo, for all the chests, let's count how many have even a_i and how many have odd a_i. Similarly, for the keys, count how many are even and how many are odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between:\n\n- The number of even a_i chests and the number of odd b_j keys. Because each even a_i needs an odd key.\n\nPlus the minimum between:\n\n- The number of odd a_i chests and the number of even b_j keys. Because each odd a_i needs an even key.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because each key can be used once. So for the even a_i chests, each requires an odd key. So the maximum number of even a_i chests we can open is the minimum of the count of even a_i and the count of odd keys.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum number of odd a_i chests is the minimum of the count of odd a_i chests and the count of even keys.\n\nSo the total maximum is the sum of these two minima.\n\nBut wait, that's only true if the sum of those two doesn't exceed the total number of chests. Because maybe the sum could be larger than n. But since each key can only be used once, perhaps not.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used once. So when you use some keys for even a_i, others can be used for odd a_i. But in reality, each key is either used for even a_i or for odd a_i, but not both.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nCompute the number of even a's (let's call it A_even) and the number of odd a's (A_odd). Compute the number of even b's (B_even) and the number of odd b's (B_odd).\n\nThen, the maximum possible chests is the minimum between (A_even and B_odd) plus the minimum between (A_odd and B_even). But wait, because each key is used in only one way, the sum of these two minima cannot exceed the total number of keys, m. Or is it?\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used either for even a or for odd a. So the total keys used would be (number of even a's matched with odd keys) plus (number of odd a's matched with even keys). Which is (min(A_even, B_odd) + min(A_odd, B_even)). But what if the sum of these two exceeds m? Because each key is used once.\n\nWait, no. Because each key is either odd or even. So the sum of the two minima can't exceed m. Because:\n\nSuppose we have x = min(A_even, B_odd) → this uses x odd keys.\nAnd y = min(A_odd, B_even) → this uses y even keys.\nx + y cannot exceed m because x ≤ B_odd and y ≤ B_even, and B_odd + B_even = m.\n\nSo the total is x + y, which is the sum.\n\nBut wait, what if A_even is 3, B_odd is 5. Then x is 3. Then, for y, A_odd could be 4, B_even is 2. So y is 2. Total is 5, which is less than m=5+2=7? Wait, no, m is the total keys, which is B_odd + B_even.\n\nIn any case, the sum x + y is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a's.\n   - A_even = number of a_i where a_i % 2 == 0.\n   - A_odd = n - A_even.\n\n2. Count the number of even and odd b's.\n   - B_even = number of b_j where b_j % 2 == 0.\n   - B_odd = m - B_even.\n\n3. The maximum possible chests is min(A_even, B_odd) + min(A_odd, B_even).\n\nWait, but wait. Is that always the case? Let's take the example given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo a's: 9,14,6,2,11 → a_i's parities: 9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So A_even = 3, A_odd = 2.\n\nb's: 8 even,4 even,7 odd,20 even → B_even=3, B_odd=1.\n\nSo min(A_even, B_odd) is min(3,1)=1. min(A_odd, B_even)= min(2,3)=2. Sum is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example:\n\nSecond input:\n\n5 1\n2 4 6 8 10\n5\n\na's: all even → A_even=5, A_odd=0.\n\nb's: 5 is odd → B_even=0, B_odd=1.\n\nSo min(A_even, B_odd) is min(5,1)=1. min(A_odd, B_even)=0. So total 1. Which matches.\n\nThird example:\n\n1 4\n10\n20 30 40 50\n\na is even, so A_even=1, A_odd=0.\n\nb's are even, so B_even=4, B_odd=0.\n\nSo min(A_even, B_odd)=0. min(A_odd, B_even)=0. So total 0. Correct.\n\nSo yes, this approach works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the a list, count how many are even and odd.\n\n- Read the b list, count how many are even and odd.\n\n- Compute x = min(a_even, b_odd), y = min(a_odd, b_even). Total is x + y.\n\nSo that's the solution.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nWe can process the a and b arrays as follows:\n\nFor each array, count the number of even numbers.\n\nThen compute the four variables.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nRead n, m from input.\n\nRead a list: list of integers.\n\nRead b list: list of integers.\n\ncount_a_even = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\na_odd = n - count_a_even\n\ncount_b_even = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 ==0 )\n\nb_odd = m - count_b_even\n\nx = min(count_a_even, b_odd)\n\ny = min(a_odd, count_b_even)\n\nprint(x + y)\n\nWait, but wait, in the sample input, the second line is '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5'. So the a's are 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So count_a_even is 5. B's are [5], which is odd. So count_b_even is 0, count_b_odd is 1.\n\nx is min(5,1)=1. y is min(0,0)=0. So total 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: what if a_even is 3, a_odd is 2, b_odd is 2, b_even is 3.\n\nSo x is min(3,2)=2, y is min(2,3)=2. So total 4. Which is 2+2=4, but the total number of keys is 5, which is more than 4, so that's fine.\n\nWhat if a has 100 even and 100 odd. b has 50 even and 150 odd.\n\nx = min(100,150) =100. y = min(100,50)=50. total 150.\n\nBut since m is 200, that's acceptable.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read a as list of integers.\n\nRead b as list of integers.\n\nCompute count_a_even = len([x for x in a if x%2 ==0])\n\ncount_b_even = len([x for x in b if x%2 ==0])\n\nThen x = min(count_a_even, m - count_b_even)\n\ny = min(n - count_a_even, count_b_even)\n\nTotal = x + y.\n\nPrint total.\n\nWait, but what about when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m >=1? No, looking back:\n\nConstraints say 1<=n,m<=1e5. So no, m can be 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nAs per code:\n\na: [9,14,6,2,11]\n\ncount_a_even = 3 (14,6,2).\n\ncount_a_odd = 2.\n\nb: [8,4,7,20]\n\ncount_b_even = 3 (8,4,20).\n\ncount_b_odd = 1.\n\nx = min(3,1)=1.\n\ny = min(2,3)=2.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nSample Output is 3.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond example:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5.\n\ncount_a_even=5.\n\ncount_b_even=0.\n\nx= min(5, 0+1? Wait no, count_b_odd is m - count_b_even=1-0=1.\n\nx = min(5,1)=1.\n\ny= min(5-5=0, 0)=0.\n\nTotal 1.\n\nThird example:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50.\n\ncount_a_even=1.\n\ncount_b_even=4.\n\nx = min(1, 4-4=0) → 0.\n\ny = min(0,4) →0.\n\nTotal 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the Python code will be something like:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_a_even = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        count_a_even +=1\na_odd = n - count_a_even\n\ncount_b_even =0\nfor num in b:\n    if num %2 ==0:\n        count_b_even +=1\nb_odd = m - count_b_even\n\nx = min(count_a_even, b_odd)\ny = min(a_odd, count_b_even)\nprint(x + y)\n\nBut wait, in Python, for large inputs, using loops can be slow. So for n up to 1e5, doing a loop is O(n), which is acceptable. But perhaps, it's better to make it more efficient.\n\nAlternative, using list comprehensions:\n\ncount_a_even = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 ==0)\n\nSimilarly for b.\n\nThis should be efficient enough.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_a_even = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\na_odd = n - count_a_even\n\ncount_b_even = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nb_odd = m - count_b_even\n\nx = min(count_a_even, b_odd)\ny = min(a_odd, count_b_even)\nprint(x + y)\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nTesting against the samples:\n\nAll pass.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Parity Condition**: For a key `b_j` and a chest `a_i`, the condition `a_i + b_j ≡ 1 (mod 2)` must hold. This means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: Separate the chests and keys into two groups based on their parity (even or odd). Count the number of even and odd chests and keys.\n3. **Match Keys to Chests**: Calculate how many even-numbered chests can be unlocked using odd-numbered keys and how many odd-numbered chests can be unlocked using even-numbered keys. The sum of these two values gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_a_even = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\na_odd = n - count_a_even\n\ncount_b_even = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nb_odd = m - count_b_even\n\nx = min(count_a_even, b_odd)\ny = min(a_odd, count_b_even)\nprint(x + y)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of chests `n` and keys `m`, followed by the lists of numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: Count how many chests have even numbers (`count_a_even`) and how many have odd numbers (`a_odd`). Similarly, count how many keys are even (`count_b_even`) and how many are odd (`b_odd`).\n3. **Matching Keys to Chests**: Determine the maximum number of even chests that can be unlocked using odd keys (`min(count_a_even, b_odd)`) and the maximum number of odd chests that can be unlocked using even keys (`min(a_odd, count_b_even)`).\n4. **Summing Results**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the above two values.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the given keys by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.",
