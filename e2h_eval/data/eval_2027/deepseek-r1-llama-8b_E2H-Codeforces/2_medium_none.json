Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square of letters forms an 'X'. The conditions are specific. Valera's paper is a square with side length n (n is odd). We need to check if the letters form an X. \n\nHmm, what's the criteria for an X? From the description, on both diagonals, all letters must be the same. And all the other squares (the ones not on either diagonal) must contain the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, right. So the first step is to identify the two diagonals. For a square matrix, the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left.\n\nSo, for each cell in these diagonals, they must all be the same character. Let's call this 'c1'. Then, all the other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same as each other but different from c1. Let's call this 'c2'.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input is n followed by n lines, each containing n characters. Since the input is given as a string, I need to parse it correctly. Each line represents a row of the grid.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I need to extract the main and anti-diagonals. For example, in a 5x5 grid:\n\nPositions on the main diagonal are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4).\nAnti-diagonal: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nWait, but in the sample input, one of them is 3x3. Like the second example, which outputs YES.\n\nLet's think about that sample. It's 3x3:\n\nw s w\ns w s\nw s w\n\nWait, no, the input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. So the rows are ['wsw', 'sws', 'wsw'].\n\nSo the main diagonal is [w, w, w]. The anti-diagonal is [w, s, w]. Wait, wait. Let me index them properly.\n\nRow 0: index 0 is 'w', column 0 is 'w'.\nRow 1: column 1 is 'w'.\nRow 2: column 2 is 'w'.\nSo main diagonal is all 'w's.\n\nAnti-diagonal: row 0, column 2 is 'w'; row 1, column 1 is 'w'; row 2, column 0 is 'w'. So all 'w's? Wait, but in the grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w → positions (0,0)=w, (0,1)=s, (0,2)=w.\nRow 1: s w s → (1,0)=s, (1,1)=w, (1,2)=s.\nRow 2: w s w → (2,0)=w, (2,1)=s, (2,2)=w.\n\nSo main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) → all 'w's. Anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) → all 'w's. So both diagonals are same as each other and same as all other cells? Wait, no. Because the other cells are 's's. But in this case, the non-diagonal cells are all 's's except for maybe some parts?\n\nWait, in the 3x3 case:\n\n- Cells on either diagonal are 'w's. So the rest are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Are all of those 's'? Let's see.\n\n(0,1) is 's', (1,0) is 's', (1,2) is 's', (2,1) is 's'. So yes, all non-diagonal are 's's. So the entire grid is 'w' on the diagonals and 's' elsewhere. So that's an X, so output is YES.\n\nBut wait, the sample input for the second case is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. Oh right, so the grid is:\n\nw s w\ns w s\nw s w\n\nWhich meets the condition.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the grid into a 2D array.\n2. Extract the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n3. Check if all elements in the main diagonal are the same and all in anti-diagonal are the same.\n   - Also, check if the main and anti-diagonal are the same character.\n   - Because, for example, if main is 'x' and anti is 'y', then it's invalid.\n4. Then, collect all the non-diagonal elements and check if they are all the same as each other and different from the diagonal.\n\nWait, let's think: the diagonals can't be different. Because, according to the problem statement, the X requires that both diagonals are the same. Otherwise, it's not an X.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Check that all elements in main diagonal are the same, say c1.\n- Check that all elements in anti-diagonal are the same, and that c1 equals this value.\n- Then, check that all non-diagonal elements are same as each other, say c2.\n- Also, c2 must not equal c1.\n\nSo, let's outline the algorithm:\n\nRead n, read the grid.\n\nIf n is 1, but n is at least 3, so no need to handle that.\n\nCollect the main diagonal: for i in 0 to n-1, grid[i][i]\nCollect the anti-diagonal: for i in 0 to n-1, grid[i][n-1 - i]\n\nCheck if all elements in main diagonal are same, and all in anti-diagonal are same.\n\nIf main_diag[0] != main_diag[-1], then invalid.\n\nSimilarly for anti_diag.\n\nAlso, check that main_diag[0] == anti_diag[0].\n\nIf any of these checks fail, output NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, collect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if i != j and i + j != n-1, include it.\n\nCheck if all these are same, and also different from c1.\n\nIf all pass, output YES else NO.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\n# Check main diag all same\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti diag all same\nif len(set(anti_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if main and anti are same\nif main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nc1 = main_diag[0]\n\n# Now check non-diagonal cells\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(non_diag) == 0:\n    # This can only happen if n=1, but n >=3 and odd, so n is at least 3.\n    # So len(non_diag) is n^2 - 2n + 1 = (n-1)^2 >=4 when n>=3.\n    # So we can ignore this case.\n    pass\n\n# Check if all non_diag are same and not c1\nif len(set(non_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif non_diag[0] == c1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where n is 1? Well, the constraints say n is at least 3 and odd, so we don't have to handle n=1.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, all diagonals are same, but non-diagonal are same as each other but same as the diagonal.\n\nLike:\n\naaa\naaa\naaa\n\nThen, non-diagonal is a, same as c1, so it's invalid.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, main and anti are 'a's, non-diagonal are 'b's. That's valid.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nThe grid is 5x5.\n\nMain diagonal: positions (0,0)=x, (1,1)=o, (2,2)=x, (3,3)=o, (4,4)=x.\n\nSo main_diag is ['x','o','x','o','x'], which has multiple different values. So len(set) is 2>1 → output NO.\n\nSample Output is 'NO'.\n\nSample 2:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain diag: w, w, w → same.\nAnti diag: w, w, w → same as main. So c1 is 'w'.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1)=s; (1,0)=s; (1,2)=s; (2,1)=s → all 's's. So it's valid.\n\nSample Output is 'YES'.\n\nSample 3:\n\n3\nxpx\np x p\nxpe\n\nWait, let's see. Wait, the input is '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'.\n\nSo grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\nRow 1: p x p\nRow 2: x p e\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e.\n\nSo main_diag is x, x, e → not all same → invalid. So output 'NO'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'a's → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'a's, non-diagonal are 'b's → valid.\n\nWhat about a grid where the diagonals are same, but non-diagonal have varying letters? Like:\n\na b a\nb a b\na b a\n\nHere, main and anti are a. Non-diagonal are b's → valid.\n\nAnother case: main diag a, anti diag a, non-diagonal have some a's and others. So non-diagonal will fail.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nIn Python, handling the input:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\nThen, extract main and anti diagonals.\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nCheck if all main_diag are same:\n\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nSame for anti_diag.\n\nif len(set(anti_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nc1 = main_diag[0]\n\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(non_diag) == 0:\n    # Only possible if n=1, but n >=3.\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if len(set(non_diag)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if non_diag[0] == c1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but in the code above, after checking len(set) is 1, we need to make sure that the non_diag's character is different from c1.\n\nYes, because in the problem statement, the non-diagonal must be a different letter than the diagonals.\n\nSo, code:\n\nAfter extracting non_diag:\n\nif len(set(non_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif non_diag[0] == c1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, testing for n=3:\n\ngrid is:\n\n['w', 's', 'w']\n['s', 'w', 's']\n['w', 's', 'w']\n\nmain_diag = ['w', 'w', 'w']\nanti_diag = ['w', 'w', 'w']\nnon_diag is ['s', 's', 's'] → set size 1, and 's' != 'w' → YES.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, grid is:\n\na a a\na a a\na a a\n\nmain_diag is a, a, a.\nanti_diag same.\nnon_diag is a, a, a → same as c1 → invalid → output NO.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5.\n\nSuppose main_diag is all 'x', anti_diag all 'x', and non-diag are all 'o's.\n\nOutput is YES.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nAnother thing to consider: n=1, but n is at least 3, so no.\n\nWhat about n=7? Same logic applies.\n\nI think this should cover all cases.\n\nNow, writing the code accordingly.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first line is a list of strings, but perhaps the actual input is given as a single string with '\\n' separators. So in Python, when reading via input(), each line is read as a separate string. So the code as written is correct.\n\nWait, the problem says that the first line is n, and then the next n lines are each of the rows. So the code correctly reads n, then reads n lines.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement it.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the grid.\n\nExtract main and anti diagonals.\n\nCheck conditions.\n\nIf all passed, print YES, else NO.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1 or len(set(anti_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nc1 = main_diag[0]\n\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(non_diag) == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if len(set(non_diag)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    elif non_diag[0] == c1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n",
