Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. So for example, \"01\" can become \"10\", and \"12\" can become \"21\". But you can't swap '0' and '2' directly or via other steps because that would require moving through a '1'.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the minimum possible string after any number of such swaps. Since the swaps can be done any number of times, I need to figure out how the characters can be rearranged within certain constraints.\n\nLet me think about what the allowed swaps imply. \n\nSwaps between 0 and 1 mean that 0 and 1 can be reordered among themselves. Similarly, 1 and 2 can be reordered. Wait, no—wait, wait. No, the allowed swaps are only between specific pairs. For example, 0 and 1 can be swapped, but 0 and 2 cannot be directly swapped unless there's a 1 in between. Or maybe not even then. Wait, let's think: If I have a string like \"012\", can I get \"021\"? Well, no, because the only allowed swaps are 0<->1 and 1<->2. So in \"012\", I can swap 0 and 1 to get \"102\", then swap 1 and 2 to get \"120\". Then, perhaps swap 1 and 2 again to get \"210\". Hmm, but can I get 021? Maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s. So, overall, 0s can move relative to 1s, and 1s can move relative to 2s. But 0s and 2s can't cross each other because you can't swap them directly, and you can't move 0 past 2 by moving through 1s since 0 can't jump over 1s in a way that would allow it to reach positions beyond 1s.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the movement possibilities.\n\nFor example, consider a string with only 0s and 2s. Can their order change? Well, no, because the only allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. So if all you have are 0s and 2s, you can't swap them at all. So in that case, the original order is fixed.\n\nBut if there are 1s in the string, then 0s can move past 1s, and 2s can move past 1s. But what about the relationship between 0s and 2s?\n\nWait, suppose I have a string like \"0 1 2\". Can I swap 0 and 1, then 1 and 2 to get \"2 1 0\"? Wait, no. Because:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2\n\nSwap 0 and 1: 1 0 2\n\nSwap 0 and 2? No, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So after that, you can't move 0 past 2.\n\nSo the final arrangement after swapping 0 and 1, and then 1 and 2 would be 1 2 0. Hmm, but that's not helpful for getting 0 to the right of 2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think step by step.\n\nIn the string \"012\", what can I do?\n\n- Swap 0 and 1: becomes \"102\".\n- Then, can I swap 1 and 2? Yes, that gives \"120\".\n- Now, can I swap 2 and 0? No, because they are not adjacent, and I can't swap 0 and 2 directly. So from \"120\", I can't get to \"021\" because that would require swapping 2 and 0, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal string would be \"012\" as is, because trying to move 0 further right is not possible without being able to swap it with 2.\n\nWait, but wait—could I somehow move the 1 around to create a situation where 0 and 2 can be swapped indirectly? For example:\n\nStart with \"012\".\n\nSwap 1 and 2 to get \"021\".\n\nNow, can I swap 0 and 2? No, because those are not allowed. So no, that doesn't help.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal string is \"012\".\n\nWait, but what about a string like \"102\"? How can I arrange that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that 0s can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing adjacent swaps between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The allowed swaps mean that '0's can move past '1's, and '1's can move past '2's, but '0's cannot directly move past '2's.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot be changed because they cannot be swapped directly. However, '1's can act as intermediaries, allowing '0's to move to the left past '1's and '2's to move to the left past '1's. Therefore, within their respective groups, '0's can be moved to the left past '1's, and '2's can be moved to the left past '1's, but '0's and '2's themselves cannot cross each other.\n\nGiven this, we can process the string in two passes:\n1. **First Pass**: Move all '0's as far left as possible by swapping them with adjacent '1's.\n2. **Second Pass**: After moving all possible '0's, move all '2's as far left as possible by swapping them with adjacent '1's.\n\nThis approach ensures that we get the smallest possible string by leveraging the allowed swaps effectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Convert string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    \n    # First pass: move all '0's to the left\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s_list):\n        if s_list[i] == '0':\n            # Find the next '1' to swap with\n            j = i + 1\n            while j < len(s_list) and s_list[j] != '1':\n                j += 1\n            if j < len(s_list):\n                s_list[i], s_list[j] = s_list[j], s_list[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Second pass: move all '2's to the left\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s_list):\n        if s_list[i] == '2':\n            # Find the previous '1' to swap with\n            j = i - 1\n            while j >= 0 and s_list[j] != '1':\n                j -= 1\n            if j >= 0:\n                s_list[i], s_list[j] = s_list[j], s_list[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\nprint(min_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **First Pass**: We iterate through the string and move each '0' to the left by swapping it with the next '1'. This ensures that all '0's are as left as possible.\n2. **Second Pass**: After handling '0's, we then handle '2's by moving each '2' to the left by swapping it with the previous '1'. This ensures that all '2's are as left as possible without affecting the positions of '0's already placed.\n\nThis two-pass approach efficiently rearranges the string to achieve the lexicographically smallest result by leveraging the allowed adjacent swaps.",
