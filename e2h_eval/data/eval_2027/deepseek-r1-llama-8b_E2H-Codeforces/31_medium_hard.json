Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero, but the absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But since some are missing, we need to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, wait. The initial set includes all possible integers from -x to x. So Vanya had infinitely many cards covering each possible value in that range. Now he has found n of them, but the sum of these found cards isn't zero. We need to find the smallest number of additional cards he must find (from the initial infinite set) such that when added to the found ones, the total sum is zero.\n\nSo the task is: given the current found cards' sum S, and knowing that the maximum allowed per card is x, what's the minimal number of cards needed to add such that their sum is (-S), with each added card's value between -x and x.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the found cards is S_current. We need to add some cards whose sum is -S_current, and each added card's value is between -x and x.\n\nBut since we can choose any values as long as they're within [-x, x], the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of terms (k) such that their sum is equal to target = -S_current, and each term is at most x in absolute value.\n\nYes. So the key is to find the minimal k where the sum of k numbers (each ≤x and ≥-x) can reach the target T = -S_current.\n\nBut wait, how? Let me think about this.\n\nLet's denote T as the required sum of the new cards. Our goal is to find the minimal k where:\n\nsum_{i=1 to k} a_i = T,\n\nand for each i, |a_i| ≤ x.\n\nWhat's the minimal possible k?\n\nSo, the problem is to find the smallest k such that T can be expressed as the sum of k numbers, each between -x and x.\n\nLet me think about the constraints on T. For example, if the sum of the found cards is S, then T is -S.\n\nWe can model this as trying to cover T with as few steps as possible, each step being adding a value between -x and x.\n\nWait, but the minimal k would depend on the maximum possible contribution each term can give towards reaching T.\n\nI think the minimal k is determined by two factors:\n\n1. The absolute value of T. Let's call it |T|.\n2. The maximum possible per term, x.\n\nEach term can contribute at most x towards reducing |T|. So, the minimal k is at least ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, because each term can be either positive or negative. So, maybe there's another way to reach T with fewer terms if T can be achieved by combining positive and negative contributions.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me consider the required sum T.\n\nThe minimal number of terms k is the smallest integer such that k * x >= |T| and (k - m) * x >= T, where m is the number of terms used to subtract.\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Maybe I should think about the minimal k as follows:\n\nThe sum of k terms, each of which can be at most x, can contribute up to k*x in the positive direction and down to -k*x in the negative.\n\nSo, for T to be achievable with k terms, T must be <= k*x and >= -k*x.\n\nWait, no. Because each term can be positive or negative, the sum can vary more.\n\nWait, the sum can be as high as k*x (if all terms are x) and as low as -k*x (if all terms are -x). So for T to be possible with k terms, T must satisfy |T| <= k*x.\n\nBut also, considering that each term can be at most x, the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k >= |T| / x, rounded up.\n\nBut wait, that might not always be sufficient. For example, if T is 5 and x is 3.\n\nThen |T| /x is 5/3 ~ 1.666, so ceil is 2. 2*3=6 >=5. So yes, 2 terms can do it: 3 + 2 =5.\n\nWait, but 2 is indeed the minimal k here.\n\nAnother example: T=4, x=3.\n\nCeil(4/3)=2. 2*3=6 >=4. Yes, 3+1=4. So two terms.\n\nAnother example: T=3, x=3. One term.\n\nWhat about T=0? Then k=0, since no terms are needed.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, if the found cards already sum to zero, then no additional cards are needed. So that's a corner case.\n\nWait, but let's get back. So the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k >= |T| / x.\n\nBut is that always correct?\n\nWait, let's see another example. Suppose T=2, x=3. Then |T|/x is 0.666, ceil is 1. So one term of 2 is sufficient. So k=1.\n\nAnother example: T=5, x=2. 5/2=2.5, so ceil is 3. 3*2=6 >=5. Can we achieve 5 with 3 terms? 2+2+1=5. So yes.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is at most 2, so 1+2+2=5.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Like T=-5, x=2. Then the minimal k is 3, since 3*2=6 >=5. And you can use -2-2-1 =-5.\n\nSo regardless of the sign of T, the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x).\n\nWait, but what about T=4, x=3.\n\n|T|=4, x=3. 4/3=1.333, ceil is 2. 2*3=6>=4. So two terms: 3+1=4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput is '3 2\\n-1 1 2'\n\nSo the found cards sum is (-1)+1+2=2. So T = -2.\n\nWhat's the minimal k? Let's compute |T|=2. x=2.\n\nSo 2/2=1, so k=1.\n\nIndeed, as in the sample, adding a single card with -2.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nInput is '2 3\\n-2 -2'.\n\nFound cards sum is (-2) + (-2) = -4. So T is 4.\n\nx=3. |T|=4. 4/3 is 1.333, so ceil is 2. So k=2.\n\nBecause 3+1=4, but each term can be 3 and 1, but 1 is less than x. Wait, but wait: 3 and 1. But 1 is allowed as it's ≤3. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, 2+2=4. Both are ≤3.\n\nSo yes, two cards.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if T is zero. Then k=0.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute T = -sum(found_cards).\n\nIf T is zero, return 0.\n\nElse, compute |T|. The minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nWait, but wait: what if |T| is exactly divisible by x? Like T=6, x=3. Then 6/3=2, so k=2.\n\nYes, because 3+3=6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards, S.\n\n2. Compute T = -S.\n\n3. If T is zero, output 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the absolute value of T, |T|.\n\n5. Compute k as the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\n6. Output k.\n\nWait, but let me think again. What about cases where |T| is not divisible by x.\n\nLike T=7, x=3. |T|=7. 7/3=2.333, ceil is 3. 3*3=9 >=7. So 3 terms: 3+3+1=7. Or 3+2+2=7.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if T is 5 and x is 3. 5/3=1.666, ceil is 2. 2*3=6 >=5. So 3+2=5, but 2 is allowed as it's ≤3. So two terms.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let's think about another case where |T| is larger than x, but perhaps a combination of positive and negative terms can allow us to reach T with fewer terms.\n\nIs that possible? Because in our approach, we are assuming that each term contributes as much as possible towards T, but perhaps using both positive and negative terms can help in some way.\n\nWait, for example, suppose T=5, x=4. Then |T|=5, x=4. 5/4=1.25, so ceil is 2. 2*4=8 >=5. So 2 terms: 4+1=5.\n\nBut what if x was 5? Then T=5, x=5. One term.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about a scenario where T is 4, x=3.\n\nAs before, 4/3 is 1.333, so 2 terms. 3+1=4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: T=7, x=5.\n\n7/5=1.4 → ceil is 2. 5+2=7. So two terms.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if T=3, x=4.\n\n3/4=0.75 → ceil is 1. So one term of 3 is acceptable.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems valid.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 5 and x is 3. 5/3 is 1.666, so 2 terms. 3+2=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the minimal k is always the ceiling of |T| /x.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n- Read n and x.\n\n- Read the list of n integers.\n\n- Compute their sum S.\n\n- Compute T = -S.\n\n- If T is 0, output 0.\n\n- Else, compute |T|.\n\n- Compute k = ceil(|T| / x).\n\n- Output k.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: What if T is something like 2, and x is 3. Then 2/3 is 0.666, ceil is 1. So one term of 2 is acceptable.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when T is negative, say T = -5, x=3. So |T|=5. 5/3=1.666, ceil is 2. So two terms: 3 and -2, sum is 1. No, that's not right. Wait, wait, no, because each term can be up to 3 in absolute value. So for T=-5, we need the sum of the added cards to be -5.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Oh wait, no. The sum of the found cards is S. So T is -S. So if S is 5, T is -5. So the added cards need to sum to -5. So each added card can be negative as well.\n\nSo, for T=-5, x=3:\n\nWe can have two terms: -3 and -2. Sum is -5.\n\nYes, so two terms.\n\nSo the formula still holds.\n\nAnother example: T=6, x=3. 6/3=2 → k=2.\n\nYes, 3+3=6.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 4 and x is 3.\n\n4/3 is 1.333, so k=2. 3 +1=4. But 1 is allowed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach is solid.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of integers.\n\nsum_found = sum of the list.\n\nT = -sum_found\n\nif T ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n\n    k = (abs_T + x -1) // x  # This is equivalent to ceil(abs_T /x)\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait: in Python, integer division can be tricky. For example, 5//3 is 1, but we need 2.\n\nSo to compute the ceiling, (a + b -1) //b is the way.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ns = sum(cards)\n\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait another case: what if x is zero? But the problem says x is at least 1.\n\nBecause in the input, x is given as 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. So no division by zero.\n\nSo, that's the solution.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nSum is 2. T is -2. abs_T=2. x=2.\n\n(2+2-1)//2= (3)//2=1. So output is 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nSum is -4. T=4. abs_T=4.\n\n(4+3-1)/3 =6//3=2. So output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: T=5, x=3 → 5+3-1=7 →7//3=2.\n\nAnother test case: T=0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: T=6, x=3 →6//3=2.\n\nAnother test case: T=7, x=3 →7+3-1=9 →9//3=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code is as above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card can have an integer value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Vanya has found some cards, each with an integer value between -x and x.\n   - The sum of these found cards is given, and we need to find the minimum number of additional cards such that the total sum becomes zero.\n   - The additional cards must also have values within the range [-x, x].\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Let the sum of the found cards be \\( S \\). We need the sum of the additional cards to be \\( -S \\) to make the total sum zero.\n   - The minimum number of additional cards required is determined by the absolute value of \\( -S \\) (denoted as \\( |T| \\)) and the maximum value \\( x \\). Specifically, the minimum number of cards \\( k \\) is the smallest integer such that \\( k \\times x \\geq |T| \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the sum \\( S \\) of the found cards.\n   - Calculate the target sum \\( T = -S \\).\n   - If \\( T \\) is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, compute the absolute value of \\( T \\) and determine the minimum \\( k \\) using the formula \\( k = \\lceil \\frac{|T|}{x} \\rceil \\), which can be efficiently computed as \\( (|T| + x - 1) // x \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards \\( n \\) and the maximum value \\( x \\). It then reads the list of integers representing the values on the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum \\( S \\) of the found cards is computed.\n- **Target Sum**: The target sum \\( T \\) needed for the additional cards to make the total sum zero is calculated as \\( -S \\).\n- **Check for Zero**: If \\( T \\) is zero, no additional cards are needed, so the result is 0.\n- **Compute Minimum Cards**: For non-zero \\( T \\), the absolute value of \\( T \\) is used to determine the minimum number of additional cards required using integer arithmetic to compute the ceiling of the division.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine the minimum number of additional cards needed, considering all edge cases and constraints.",
