Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero, but the absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But since some are missing, we need to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, wait. The initial set includes all possible integers from -x to x. So Vanya had infinitely many of each. But now, he only found n of them, and we need to compute the minimal number of more cards he must find such that when added, the sum becomes zero.\n\nSo, the sum S of the found cards is a certain value. We need to find how many additional cards with values in [-x, x] can be added so that the total sum is zero.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero.\" Oh, right, but initially, he had all the cards. Now, he found n of them, and the sum of those n is S. So the sum of all the found plus the ones he needs to find should be zero. Or wait, maybe it's that the sum of all the found (including the ones he finds now) should be zero.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero.\" So the sum of the found cards (including any new ones he finds) must be zero.\n\nSo the task is: given the current sum S of the found n cards, find the minimal number k of additional cards (each with a value between -x and x) such that S + (sum of additional cards) = 0.\n\nSo the required sum for the additional cards is -S. Let me denote target as T = -S.\n\nWe need to find the minimal k such that T can be expressed as the sum of k terms, each term is between -x and x.\n\nWhat's the minimal k? Well, the maximum possible per term is x (if all are x), so to reach T, the minimal k would be ceil( |T| / x ). Because each term contributes at most x towards reducing the absolute value of T.\n\nWait, but wait: if T is positive, the maximum per term is x. So the minimal number of terms is |T| / x, rounded up. Similarly for T negative, same logic.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the math here.\n\nSuppose T is positive. Then, each additional card can contribute up to x. So to reach T, the minimal k is T divided by x, rounded up. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 terms: 2+2+1.\n\nSimilarly, if T is 4 and x is 2, then 4/2=2, so 2 terms.\n\nIf T is 0, then no additional cards are needed.\n\nSo, the formula for the minimal k is:\n\nk = max(0, ceil( |T| / x )) if T != 0 else 0.\n\nWait, but what if T is zero? Then, no additional cards are needed.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S. This is the sum that the additional cards must contribute.\n3. If T is zero, output 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal k as ceil( |T| / x ).\n   But wait, because each card can contribute at least -x. So for T positive, the minimal k is indeed ceiling(T / x).\n   For T negative, same: minimal k is ceiling(|T| / x).\n\nWait, no. Wait, if T is negative, say T is -5, and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to -2. So to get a total of -5, you can have 3 cards: -2, -2, -1. Total is -5. So yes, the minimal k is 3, which is ceiling(5/2)=3.\n\nSo regardless of the sign of T, the minimal k is ceiling( |T| / x ).\n\nWait, but wait: what if T is 0? Then k is 0.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute the sum of the found cards.\n\nCalculate T = -sum_found.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute k as the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput is 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1+1+2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the current sum. This ensures that the total sum becomes zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target Sum**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, calculate the minimum number of cards required. This is done by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by x and rounding up to the nearest integer. This gives the minimal number of cards needed, as each card can contribute at most x towards reducing the target sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(cards)\ntarget = -sum_found\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = abs(target) // x\n    if k * x < abs(target):\n        k += 1\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. It then reads the values on these `n` cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is calculated as the negative of the found sum.\n4. **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, the output is zero since no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: If the target sum is non-zero, the minimum number of cards is determined by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by `x` and rounding up. This ensures that the sum of the additional cards meets or exceeds the target sum using the fewest number of cards possible.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of found cards, making it suitable for large inputs within the given constraints.",
