He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but if the base is 'R', it's the Roman numeral system. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the input has two parts: the first line is a and b. But b can be 'R' which represents the Roman numeral system. Then, the next line is c in base a, which could be a very long string. My task is to convert this number into base b, without leading zeros.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the input correctly. The first line gives a and b. Wait, but sometimes b is 'R'? Oh right, so I need to check if b is 'R'. If yes, then the output should be in Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's in base 10 as a number.\n\nThen, the next part is converting the given c (base a) to base b. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the number c in base a.\n2. Convert this number into an integer (base 10).\n3. Then, convert that integer into base b, which might be Roman numerals or another base.\n\nBut wait, the second step: how do I handle the conversion of c from base a? Because c is a string in base a, possibly with leading zeros. So I need to parse each character, considering whether each digit is valid for base a.\n\nFor example, if a is 10, the digits can be 0-9. But if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9, A-F, case-insensitive perhaps?\n\nWait, the problem says c is written in base a, which may have leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. Also, it's guaranteed that the number won't be zero. So, I need to process each character of c, treating them as digits in base a.\n\nSo, for each character in c:\n- Check if it's a valid digit in base a. For example, if a is 10, digits are 0-9. If a is 13, digits are 0-9, A, B, C (since 13 is higher than 10). But wait, what about uppercase letters? The problem statement isn't clear on that. Looking back, the sample input has 'A' in one case. Oh, the note says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So the letters are uppercase, and case matters.\n\nWait, the sample input includes 'A' as a valid character. So when processing c, the letters are uppercase. So for a base a, each character must be a digit less than a. So for example, if a is 10, the digits are 0-9. If a is 12, digits are 0-9, then A (which is 10), B (11). Wait, no: 12 base would have digits 0-9, then A is 10, B is 11, because 12 is larger than 10. So any digit in c must be less than a.\n\nSo, for each character in c, I need to check if it's a valid digit in base a.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent each digit? Maybe create a dictionary that maps each possible character to its value. For example, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, up to '9' is 9. Then, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc., but only for bases higher than 10.\n\nSo, first, I'll need a helper function or a way to get the numerical value of each character in c. For that, I can have a mapping like:\n\ndigits = {\n    '0': 0,\n    '1': 1,\n    ...,\n    '9':9,\n    'A':10,\n    'B':11,\n    'C':12,\n    'D':13,\n    'E':14,\n    'F':15\n}\n\nSo, for each character in c, I look it up in this dictionary. If the character is not present, it's invalid. But according to the problem statement, the input c is correct, so we don't need to handle errors.\n\nOnce I have all the digits, I can compute the integer value by iterating through each digit and applying base a.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the number c is in base a, so each digit contributes to the total as digit * (a^position), where position starts from the right, with 0 being the least significant digit.\n\nBut since the string is read left to right, the leftmost digit is the most significant. So, for example, '123' in base 10 is 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 +3*10^0.\n\nSo, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to base `b`. The base `b` can be either a standard integer or a Roman numeral system (indicated by 'R'). The conversion involves parsing the input number, converting it to an integer, and then converting that integer to the target base.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input:** Read the bases `a` and `b`, and the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Character Mapping:** Create a dictionary to map each character to its corresponding numerical value for bases up to 16.\n3. **Convert to Integer:** Convert the string `c` from base `a` to an integer using the parsed values of each character.\n4. **Convert to Target Base:** Depending on whether the target base `b` is a Roman numeral or a standard base, convert the integer to the appropriate representation:\n   - **Roman Numeral:** Use the Roman numeral rules to construct the string representation.\n   - **Standard Base:** Convert the integer to the target base using standard division and remainder methods.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n\n    # Read input\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    while len(lines) < 2:\n        lines.append('')  # Ensure at least two lines\n    a_b_line = lines[0].strip()\n    c_line = lines[1].strip()\n\n    # Parse a and b\n    parts = a_b_line.split()\n    a = int(parts[0])\n    b = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else '10'\n\n    # Parse c in base a\n    c = c_line.strip()\n\n    # Helper: digit to value mapping\n    digit_map = {\n        '0': 0,\n        '1': 1, '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9,\n        'A': 10, 'B': 11, 'C': 12, 'D': 13, 'E': 14, 'F': 15\n    }\n\n    # Function to check if a character is valid for base a\n    def char_valid(c_char):\n        val = digit_map.get(c_char, None)\n        if val is None:\n            return False\n        return val < a\n\n    # Convert c to integer\n    num = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        val = digit_map[ch]\n        num = num * a + val\n\n    # Now, convert to base b\n    if b == 'R':\n        # Convert to Roman numerals\n        res = []\n        while num > 0:\n            for i in range(1000, 0, -1):\n                if num >= i:\n                    res.append(str(i))\n                    num -= i\n                    break\n            else:\n                for i in range(100, 0, -1):\n                    if num >= i:\n                        res.append(str(i))\n                        num -= i\n                        break\n                else:\n                    for i in range(10, 0, -1):\n                        if num >= i:\n                            res.append(str(i))\n                            num -= i\n                            break\n        print(''.join(reversed(res)))\n    else:\n        # Convert to base b\n        if b == 1:\n            print('0')\n            return\n        digits = []\n        while num > 0:\n            rem = num % b\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n            num = num // b\n        if not digits:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            print(''.join(reversed(digits)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read and split into the necessary components.\n- **Digit Mapping:** A dictionary maps each character to its respective value for easy lookup.\n- **Conversion to Integer:** The number in base `a` is converted to an integer using positional notation.\n- **Conversion to Target Base:** Depending on whether the target base is a Roman numeral or a standard base, the integer is converted accordingly. For Roman numerals, the algorithm constructs the string by iterating through possible values and subtracting as needed. For standard bases, the integer is repeatedly divided by the base to extract digits.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient and correct conversion, handling both small and large numbers, as well as different bases and the special case of Roman numerals.",
