    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. The task is to find the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears at least twice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. So, given a string like 'ababa', the output is 3 because the substring 'aba' appears twice. Oh right, and they can overlap. So for 'zzz', the substrings are 'zz' appearing twice, but wait, no—the entire string is 'zzz'. So possible substrings: 'z', 'zz', 'zzz'. The substring 'zz' appears starting at index 0 and 1. So the output is 2.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum possible length L such that there exists some substring of length L that occurs at least twice in the string. Now, how do I find that?\n\nLet me think about the approach. One straightforward way is to check all possible substrings and see which ones repeat. But since the string can be up to 100 characters, that's manageable.\n\nWait, but what's the time complexity of that approach? For each possible length from the maximum possible down to 1, we can check if any substring of that length appears more than once. Once we find the largest such L, we can return it.\n\nSo here's an outline of the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over possible lengths L, starting from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n2. For each L, check all possible substrings of that length and see if any appears more than once.\n3. The first L where this condition is true is our answer.\n4. If no such L is found (which shouldn't happen as per the problem statement), then return 0.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible L is the length of the string minus 1 because the entire string can't appear twice unless it's longer. Wait, no— for example, the string 'aaaaa' has substrings of length 4 that appear multiple times, like 'aaaa'.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The maximum possible L is the length of the string minus 1 because for a string of length N, the maximum possible substring that can appear at least twice is when it's N-1 long. Because, for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' is length 3, which is N-2 where N=5. Hmm, maybe I should consider the maximum possible L as the floor of (N/2). Or perhaps it's better to consider all L from N-1 down to 1 and stop when a solution is found.\n\nWait, but for N=1, the substring can't appear twice. So for the input with single character, the output is 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the string is non-empty and consists of lowercase letters, so for N=1, the output is 0.\n\nSo back to the approach.\n\nFor each possible L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   For each possible starting index i in s:\n\n       extract substring s[i:i+L]\n\n       check if this substring appears again in s somewhere else.\n\n   If for any L, any substring of length L appears at least twice, then return L as the answer.\n\nSo, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nWell, since the maximum string length is 100, even a brute-force approach is acceptable.\n\nSo, for each L from (len(s)-1) downto 1:\n\n   create a set to store all substrings of length L.\n\n   For each i from 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       current_sub = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if current_sub is already in the set, then return L as the answer.\n\n       else, add it to the set.\n\n   Continue until you find such L.\n\nWait, but this isn't correct. Because the same substring may not have been added yet, but may appear later in the string.\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, we check whether current_sub is in the set. If yes, then we know it's appeared before, so we can return L. Otherwise, we add it to the set.\n\nThis way, for each L, we can determine whether any substring of that length appears more than once.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nLoop L from (len(s)-1) down to 1:\n\n   create a set called seen.\n\n   loop i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       sub = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if sub in seen:\n\n           return L\n\n       else:\n\n           add sub to seen\n\n   after checking all i for this L, if no duplicates found, continue to next smaller L.\n\nIf no L is found (i.e., for all L down to 1, no duplicates), return 0.\n\nWait, but wait: for L= len(s),",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears at least twice. These occurrences can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking all possible substrings of the given string starting from the longest possible length down to the shortest. For each length, we use a set to track substrings we have seen so far. If we encounter a substring that we have already seen, we immediately return the current length as our answer. This ensures that we find the longest possible substring efficiently.\n\n1. **Iterate over possible lengths**: Start from the maximum possible length (length of the string - 1) and go down to 1.\n2. **Check each substring**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and check if they have appeared before using a set.\n3. **Return the result**: The first length where a duplicate substring is found is the answer. If no such length is found, return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = n - 1\n\nfor l in range(max_len, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        sub = s[i:i+l]\n        if sub in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(sub)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: Read the input string and determine its length.\n- **Loop through lengths**: Start from the longest possible substring length and decrease down to 1.\n- **Substring Generation and Check**: For each length, generate substrings and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, so we print the current length and exit.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently checks each possible substring length in descending order, ensuring the first valid length found is the longest possible.\n\nThis solution is efficient given the constraints, ensuring that we handle all edge cases correctly.",
