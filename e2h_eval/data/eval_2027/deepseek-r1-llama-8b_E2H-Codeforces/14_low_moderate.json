He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then count how many such n's and list them.\n\nFirst, I think I need a way to compute Z(n) quickly. But for this problem, perhaps binary search can be used to find the range of n's that give exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, but how do I find the possible n's? Let me think: For a given m, the values of n that give exactly m zeros will form a consecutive range. So I need to find the smallest n where Z(n) = m and the largest n where Z(n) = m. The count will be (largest - smallest + 1), and the numbers from smallest to largest inclusive.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Find the lower bound: the smallest n where Z(n) = m.\n2. Find the upper bound: the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n3. The count is upper_bound - lower_bound + 1.\n4. If no such n exists, output 0.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle cases where Z(n) jumps over m? Like if Z(k) = m-1, and Z(k+1) = m+1, then there are no n's with Z(n)=m.\n\nYes, so first I need to check whether m is actually achievable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n- For a given m, find the minimal n_low such that Z(n_low) >= m.\n- Similarly, find the maximal n_high such that Z(n_high) <= m.\n- Wait, no, maybe better to find the first n where Z(n) equals m, then find the last n where Z(n) equals m. Or perhaps use binary search to find the possible range.\n\nAlternatively, the function Z(n) is non-decreasing as n increases. So the set of n's satisfying Z(n)=m forms an interval [a, b], possibly empty.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n- Use binary search to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. But since Z(n) is non-decreasing, once I find the first occurrence where Z(n) >= m, I need to check if it's exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nWait, no. Because it's possible that the minimal n where Z(n)>=m may have Z(n) greater than m. So perhaps we need to find the lower and upper bounds differently.\n\nWait, here's a better idea: perform a binary search to find the lower bound where Z(n) = m. Then another binary search to find the upper bound. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the possible n's that give exactly m zeros. Since Z(n) is non-decreasing, the n's that satisfy Z(n)=m will be consecutive integers. So the lower bound is the smallest n with Z(n)=m, and the upper bound is the largest n with Z(n)=m.\n\nTo find the lower bound, perhaps find the first n where Z(n) >= m, and then decrement until Z(n) < m. Or wait, maybe not. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the process step by step.\n\nSuppose m=5. As per the example, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 because 5! has 1 zero, 6! has 1, but wait no. Wait, the example says input is 5, and the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Oh right, 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1 zero?), no, wait 6! is 720 which ends with one zero. Wait, wait, but the sample input is '1' and '5'? Wait no, looking back, the example input is ['1', '5'], and the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 because 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1 zero), 7! is 5040 (1 zero?), 8! is 40320 (1 zero?), 9",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves using binary search to efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy this condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is effectively determined by the count of multiples of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Counting Multiples of 5**: The formula to count the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   This sum continues until the division results in zero.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Range**: To find the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) = m \\) and the largest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) = m \\), we use binary search. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the range of possible values of \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no \\( n \\) exists such that \\( Z(n) = m \\), the result should be 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeroes(m):\n    def z(n):\n        count = 0\n        while n > 0:\n            n = n // 5\n            count += n\n        return count\n\n    # Find lower bound\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m  # Initial guess for upper bound\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if z(mid) < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    # Now left is the smallest n where z(n) >= m\n    # Check if it's exactly m\n    if z(left) != m:\n        return []\n    \n    # Find upper bound\n    left_upper, right_upper = left, 5 * m\n    while left_upper < right_upper:\n        mid = (left_upper + right_upper) // 2\n        if z(mid) > m:\n            right_upper = mid\n        else:\n            left_upper = mid\n    # Now left_upper is the largest n where z(n) <= m\n    # But since z(left_upper) == m, it's correct\n    count = left_upper - left + 1\n    return list(range(left, left_upper + 1))\n\nm = int(input().strip())\nif m == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    res = count_zeroes(m)\n    if not res:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(len(res))\n        if len(res) > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `z(n)`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) using the formula described.\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: We start with an initial range and adjust it using binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\).\n3. **Check Exact Match**: After finding the lower bound, we check if \\( Z(n) \\) is exactly \\( m \\). If not, there are no valid \\( n \\) values.\n4. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: Similarly, we find the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\leq m \\).\n5. **Result Calculation**: The valid \\( n \\) values form a consecutive range from the lower bound to the upper bound, inclusive. If no such range exists, the result is 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the trailing zero requirement, even for large values of \\( m \\).",
