There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house can be built on a spot, and each spot has a height between 0 and h. The profit for each spot is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges. \n\nHmm, the goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all the restrictions. So, each restriction says that from l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be <= x_i. So, for any such range, at least one of the houses in that range must be <= x_i? Or wait, no—wait, no. The tallest in that range must be <= x_i. So, that means the maximum height in that interval cannot exceed x_i. So, for each interval [l_i, r_i], all houses in that interval can't have heights that make their max exceed x_i.\n\nWait, but how do the restrictions interact? Because a spot might be part of multiple restrictions. For example, a spot could be covered by two different restrictions, each imposing a maximum height on it. So the effective maximum height for that spot would be the minimum of all the x_i's that cover it.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is figure out, for each spot, the maximum possible height it can have, considering all the restrictions that apply to it. Because each spot's height can't exceed any of the x_i's of the restrictions that include it, as well as h.\n\nBut wait, because some spots may not be covered by any restriction. For those, their height can be up to h, as long as it's allowed by other constraints. Wait, no, the problem statement says that the city has m restrictions. So, if a spot isn't covered by any restriction, then the only constraint is that its height is between 0 and h. Because each spot's height can be up to h, unless covered by a restriction.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says that each spot can have a height between 0 and h. So, even if a spot is not covered by any restriction, it's still subject to the 0 to h limit. So, the restrictions are additional constraints beyond the default 0-h per spot.\n\nSo, for each spot i:\n\nmax_height[i] = min( h, min( x_j for j where i is in [l_j, r_j] ) )\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction j applies to [l_j, r_j], and for that interval, the maximum height can't exceed x_j. So, for spot i, all the restrictions that cover i (i.e., l_j <= i <= r_j) impose that the height of spot i must be <= x_j. So, the maximum possible height for spot i is the minimum of all x_j for j covering i, and also h.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_j where the spot is within [l_j, r_j], and h. If a spot is not covered by any restriction, then the maximum is h.\n\nSo, first, I need to compute for each spot the maximum allowed height, considering all applicable restrictions and the global h.\n\nOnce we have that, the problem reduces to choosing, for each spot, a height between 0 and its computed maximum, such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nWait, but no, because the restrictions aren't just on individual spots. They are on ranges. So, for a given assignment of heights, every restriction's range must have their maximum height <= x_i. So, the initial approach of computing for each spot the maximum possible based on overlapping restrictions may not capture all constraints correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because if a spot is in multiple overlapping ranges, each with their own x_i, the maximum height of the spot is the minimum of all x_i for those ranges, right? Because each of those ranges requires that the maximum in that range is <= x_i. So, for a spot in both ranges, it can't exceed either x_i, so the maximum possible is the minimum of all x_i's of the ranges it belongs to.\n\nWait, but suppose spot i is in two ranges: range A with x=3 and range B with x=2. Then, the maximum height for spot i must be <=2, because if it's 3, then range B's maximum would be 3 which is more than x=2. So yes, the maximum height for i is min of all x_j for ranges j that include i.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_j where l_j <=i <= r_j, and h. Because any of those x_j's could limit the spot's height.\n\nIf a spot is not covered by any restrictions, then it's limited only by h.\n\nSo, the first step is to process all the m restrictions and for each spot, determine the minimal x_j among all restrictions that cover it. Then, the maximum height for that spot is the minimum of that minimal x_j and h.\n\nWait, but what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions? For example, two restrictions, one with x=5 and another with x=3. Then, the spot's maximum height is 3, because it's the lower of the two. So, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each spot i (from 1 to n), collect all the x_i's from the restrictions that include i.\n2. For each spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of these x_i's, but not exceeding h.\n   - If there are no restrictions covering i, then it's h.\n3. Now, the problem becomes: assign to each spot i a height a_i, where 0 <= a_i <= max_height[i], such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nWait, but wait! That's not entirely correct. Because the sum of squares is maximized when each a_i is as large as possible, but sometimes you have to reduce a_i to satisfy multiple overlapping constraints. Oh, but in our initial step, we've already set max_height[i] as the minimal x across all applicable restrictions, which ensures that for each spot, the maximum possible is chosen without violating any of the restrictions. So, if each spot is assigned its maximum possible height, then all the restrictions will be satisfied.\n\nBecause, for any restriction, the maximum in its range is <= x_i, because for each spot in the range, the height is <= the minimal x_j of all covering restrictions, which includes this restriction's x_i. So, the maximum in the range is the maximum of the a_i's in that range. Since each a_i is <= the minimal x_j for that spot, which includes the current restriction's x_i, the maximum in the range is <= x_i.\n\nTherefore, assigning each spot its maximum possible height (as computed in step 2) would automatically satisfy all the restrictions.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to set each spot to its maximum possible height, because this will give the highest possible sum of squares. Because squares are increasing functions, higher a_i gives more contribution.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\nCompute for each spot i, the maximum possible height as the minimum of all x_j where i is in [l_j, r_j], or h if none.\n\nThen, the sum is the sum of squares of these maximums.\n\nWait, but wait—is that always the case? Are there cases where reducing a_i would allow higher a_j's elsewhere, leading to a higher overall sum?\n\nNo, because each a_i is independent. Maximizing each a_i individually gives the maximum sum of squares. Because for any spot, a higher a_i contributes more than any possible gains from adjacent spots.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n, h, m.\n- For each spot i from 1 to n:\n   - Collect all x_j where the restriction j covers i (i.e., l_j <=i <= r_j).\n   - Compute the minimum of these x_j's. If there are none, use h.\n   - The maximum height for i is min(x_min, h)\n- Sum the squares of these maximum heights.\n\nWait, but wait. What about the example given?\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\n3 spots, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n1 1 1 → affects spot 1\n2 2 3 → affects spot 2\n3 3 2 → affects spot 3\n\nFor spot 1: x_min is 1, so max height is 1.\n\nSpot 2: x_min is 3, max is 3.\n\nSpot 3: x_min is 2, max is 2.\n\nSum is 1 +9 +4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → affects spots 2,3.\n\n3 4 7 → affects spots 3,4.\n\nSo, for each spot:\n\nSpot 1: no restrictions. Max height is 10.\n\nSpot 2: min(8). So 8.\n\nSpot 3: min(8,7) →7.\n\nSpot4: min(7)→7.\n\nSum is 10^2 +8^2+7^2+7^2=100+64+49+49=262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Read n, h, m.\n\n- For each of m restrictions, read l, r, x.\n\n- For each spot i, collect all x's from restrictions where l<=i <=r.\n\n- For each i, compute the minimum of these x's. If none, use h.\n\n- Then, the maximum a_i is the minimum between that x_min and h.\n\n- Sum squares.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the input:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, for each of m lines, read l, r, x.\n\nWe can store the restrictions as a list of tuples.\n\nThen, for each spot i in 1..n:\n\nCollect all x where i is in [l, r].\n\nCompute min_x for i as the minimum of these x's.\n\nIf no x, min_x is None, then the max height is h.\n\nElse, max_height_i = min(min_x, h)\n\nSum the squares.\n\nSo, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent the restrictions as a list of (l, r, x).\n\nFor each spot i, we can loop through all restrictions and check if l <=i <=r.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to n:\n\nmin_x = h  # default is h if no restrictions.\n\nfor each restriction in restrictions:\n\n   if l <=i <=r:\n\n      if x < min_x:\n\n          min_x = x\n\nSo, after checking all restrictions, if min_x is still h, it means no restrictions apply to i, so max height is h.\n\nOtherwise, it's min_x.\n\nSo, the code can proceed like that.\n\nLet me test this logic against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n(1,1,1)\n\n(2,2,3)\n\n(3,3,2)\n\nFor spot 1: checks first restriction, x=1. min_x=1.\n\nNo others, so max is 1.\n\nSpot 2: check second restriction, x=3. min_x=3.\n\nSpot3: third restriction, x=2. min_x=2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n(2,3,8), (3,4,7)\n\nSpot1: no restrictions. max is 10.\n\nSpot2: min(8).\n\nSpot3: min(8,7)=7.\n\nSpot4: min(7).\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions.\n\nE.g., m=2, same l and r.\n\nLike:\n\nn=5, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: l=3, r=5, x=5.\n\nRestriction2: l=3, r=5, x=4.\n\nFor spots 3,4,5:\n\nEach is covered by both restrictions. So min_x is 4.\n\nSo, their max is 4, unless h is less than 4.\n\nAnother example: spot is covered by three restrictions.\n\nSuppose for spot 4, three restrictions:\n\nx=5, x=3, x=4. So min is 3.\n\nSo, spot's max is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle this correctly.\n\nSo, now, let's write the code.\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nRead m restrictions into a list.\n\nInitialize a list for each spot's min_x.\n\nLoop over each spot i from 1 to n:\n\n   min_x = h\n\n   for each (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n       if l <=i <= r:\n\n           if x < min_x:\n\n               min_x = x\n\n   max_height = min(min_x, h)\n\n   add max_height^2 to the sum.\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, in Python, the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead the first line:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, read m lines:\n\nrestrictions = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\nThen, for each spot i in 1..n:\n\nsum_profit = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    min_x = h\n\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n        if l <= i <= r:\n\n            if x < min_x:\n\n                min_x = x\n\n    max_height = min(min_x, h)\n\n    sum_profit += max_height **2\n\nprint(sum_profit)\n\nWait, but in the sample, the first output was 14, which is correct. So, the code should work.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the input was given as ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'], but that seems to be an incorrect representation—probably the user meant the input lines.\n\nBut in the actual code, we can read the lines as per standard input.\n\nSo, the code should be okay.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nAfter reading the restrictions:\n\nrestrictions = [(1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2)]\n\nFor i=1:\n\nCheck each restriction:\n\n(1,1,1): 1<=1<=1 →x=1. min_x starts as 3, so becomes 1.\n\nOther restrictions: i=1 is not in (2,2,3) or (3,3,2). So, min_x remains 1.\n\nmax_height = min(1,3) =1.\n\nSimilarly for i=2:\n\nOnly the second restriction is triggered.\n\nx=3.\n\nmax is 3.\n\ni=3: third restriction, x=2.\n\nmax is 2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nrestrictions = [(2,3,8), (3,4,7)].\n\ni=1: no restrictions → max 10.\n\ni=2: l=2<=2<=3. x=8.\n\ni=3: in both restrictions. min(8,7)=7.\n\ni=4: in second restriction. x=7.\n\nSo, sum is 10² +8²+7²+7²=100+64+49+49=262.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a spot covered by multiple restrictions with varying x?\n\nSay, m=3, restrictions:\n\n(1,2,5), (1,3,3), (2,3,4).\n\nFor spot 1:\n\nrestrictions 1 and 2 apply. x=5 and 3 → min_x=3.\n\nmax height is 3.\n\nspot 2: restrictions 1, 2, 3. x=5,3,4 → min is 3.\n\nspot3: same as spot 2.\n\nSo, each of 1,2,3 has max 3.\n\nSo, sum is 3²*3 =27.\n\nBut if h is 6, that's the maximum.\n\nBut if h is 2, then the max is 2.\n\nSo, the code correctly captures that.\n\nAnother test case: no restrictions.\n\nn=1, h=5, m=0.\n\nsum is 5²=25.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions with varying x, but h is lower than all x's.\n\nLike, spot i is covered by x=10, x=5, x=3. h=2.\n\nThen, min_x is 2.\n\nSo, the max height is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nI think this approach will solve the problem correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house can be built on a spot with a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each spot's profit is the square of its height. The challenge is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all the given restrictions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Restrictions**: Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height. This means for any spot within the specified range, its height must be at most the minimum height imposed by any overlapping restrictions.\n2. **Determine Maximum Height per Spot**: For each spot, compute the maximum allowable height considering all applicable restrictions. If a spot is not covered by any restriction, it can reach the global maximum height.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once the maximum allowable heights for all spots are determined, compute the total profit by summing the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal_profit = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = h  # Assume no restriction, default to h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    max_height = min(min_x, h)\n    total_profit += max_height ** 2\n\nprint(total_profit)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spots, maximum height, and the number of restrictions. Each restriction is stored as a tuple containing the range and the maximum allowed height.\n2. **Processing Each Spot**: For each spot, iterate through all restrictions to find the minimum height allowed by any overlapping restriction. If no restrictions apply, the spot's height is limited by the global maximum height.\n3. **Compute Profit**: For each spot, the profit from that spot is the square of its maximum allowable height. Sum these values to get the total profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are satisfied and maximizes the profit by leveraging the properties of squares to achieve the highest possible sum.",
