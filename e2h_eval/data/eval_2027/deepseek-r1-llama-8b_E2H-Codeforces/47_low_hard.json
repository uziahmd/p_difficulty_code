During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where Neko is trying to find the optimal k that minimizes the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k). And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest one. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. So given a and b, I have to compute for each possible k, the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k), and find the k that gives the smallest such LCM.\n\nWait, but a and b can be up to 1e9, so iterating through all possible k's is impossible because k could be up to something like 1e9 as well. That approach would be way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the mathematical properties here.\n\nThe expression is LCM(a + k, b + k). Let me denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since y - x = b - a. Wait, no, wait: x = a +k, y = b +k, so y = x + (b - a). Oh right, because b = a + (b - a), so when you add k to both, y is x plus (b - a).\n\nSo the difference between y and x is fixed as d = |b - a|. Or wait, no, because if b < a, then d is a - b. So the difference between y and x is fixed as d = |a - b|.\n\nSo the two numbers are x and x + d.\n\nHmm, that might help.\n\nSo the LCM of x and x + d. I need to find x such that x is >= max(a, b) -k? Wait, no, because x = a +k, so k can be any non-negative integer, so x can be from a upwards (if a > b) or from b upwards (if b > a). Or wait, no, if a is smaller than b, then x starts at a and increases by 1 each time k increases. But in any case, x can vary, but the difference between x and y is fixed as d = |a - b|.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to assume that a ≤ b. Because if not, we can swap them. So without loss of generality, let's assume that a ≤ b. Then, the difference d is b - a.\n\nSo the two numbers are x and x + d. We need to find x such that their LCM is minimized.\n\nBut how does x relate to a and b? Well, x = a +k, so k can be 0, 1, 2, etc., making x increase.\n\nSo our goal is to find x >= a (since k is non-negative) such that LCM(x, x + d) is minimized.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x ≥ a, where x is an integer, to minimize LCM(x, x +d), and then compute k = x - a.\n\nWait, but if a > b, then the difference would be negative. So maybe it's better to compute d = |a - b| regardless. So d is always positive.\n\nSo for the general case, d is fixed as the absolute difference between a and b.\n\nSo now, the problem is to find x such that x is >= max(a, b) -k? Wait, no. Because x = a +k, which is always >= a. Similarly, y = b +k is >= b.\n\nWait, but since d is fixed, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs at certain x that is near the least common multiple of some divisors of d.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and x +d.\n\nBecause LCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/gcd(x, x +d).\n\nSince x and x +d have a gcd of g, which divides d. Because x +d -x =d, so g must divide d.\n\nSo let's write g = gcd(x, x+d). Then, g must divide d.\n\nSo, to minimize LCM(x, x +d), we can express it as x*(x +d)/g.\n\nBut since g divides d, perhaps it's optimal to choose x such that g is as large as possible, because that would reduce the denominator, thus potentially reducing the overall product.\n\nWait, but increasing g will increase the numerator. So there's a trade-off.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is chosen such that x is a multiple of g, where g is a divisor of d.\n\nBecause then, the gcd(x, x +d) would be g, and the LCM would be x*(x +d)/g.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe another approach: For each possible divisor g of d, find x such that x is a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is to recognize that the difference between the two numbers \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is fixed as \\( |a - b| \\). Let's denote this difference as \\( d \\). Thus, we need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\) and \\( x + d \\) have the smallest possible LCM.\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: The LCM of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( x + d \\) can be expressed using their greatest common divisor (GCD). Specifically, \\( \\text{LCM}(x, x + d) = \\frac{x(x + d)}{\\text{GCD}(x, x + d)} \\). Since \\( \\text{GCD}(x, x + d) \\) must be a divisor of \\( d \\), we can iterate over all divisors of \\( d \\) to find optimal \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Optimal Strategy**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\) is a multiple of \\( g \\) and \\( x \\geq \\max(a, b) \\). This ensures that \\( x \\) is the smallest possible value for each divisor, minimizing the LCM.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By iterating over all divisors of \\( d \\) and computing the corresponding \\( x \\) for each divisor, we can efficiently determine the optimal \\( k \\) without brute-forcing through all possible values of \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef minimal_lcm(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    max_x = max(a, b)\n    \n    def get_divisors(n):\n        divisors = set()\n        for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n // i)\n        return sorted(divisors)\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        x = ((max_x + (d // g - 1)) // g) * g\n        if x < max_x:\n            x += g\n        y = x + d\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and x - max_x < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = x - max_x\n        elif x > max_x:\n            pass\n    return best_k\n\na, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nprint(minimal_lcm(a, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the result is 0 because any \\( k \\) will leave both numbers equal, and their LCM is the number itself.\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: Compute all divisors of \\( d \\) where \\( d = |a - b| \\).\n4. **Iterate Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest \\( x \\) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and greater than or equal to the maximum of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n5. **Compute LCM**: For each candidate \\( x \\), compute the LCM of \\( x \\) and \\( x + d \\). Track the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n6. **Output Result**: Print the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves the minimal LCM.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the potential candidates for \\( x \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring an optimal solution without excessive computation.",
