After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. We have n students and m subjects. Each student has m marks, each from 1-9. For each subject, we need to find out which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in any subject. The count of such students is what we need to output.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line gives n and m. Then, there are n lines, each representing a student's marks for m subjects. These are given as strings, each character being a digit.\n\n2. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), determine the maximum mark among all students for that subject. Also, record which student(s) achieved that maximum.\n\nWait, but wait. For each subject, only the students with the maximum mark are considered the best. So for a subject, if multiple students have the same max, then all of them are considered best for that subject. But a student can be the best in multiple subjects.\n\nBut for the problem, a student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. So for each student, we just need to know whether they are the best in any of the m subjects.\n\nSo maybe the approach is:\n\n- For each subject, find all students who have the maximum mark in that subject.\n- For each student, if they are in the best list of any subject, count them as successful.\n\nSo how do I implement this?\n\nFirst, I'll process each subject individually.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. Maybe for each subject, keep track of the maximum mark and the list of students who achieved that.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, I can create a dictionary where the key is the subject index, and the value is a list of student indices (like their position in the input) who have the maximum mark in that subject.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- For each of the next n lines:\n   - Split the string into individual characters, each representing a mark for a subject.\n   - Convert each character to an integer.\n   - Store this as a list of lists. Like, marks[i][j] is the mark of student i for subject j.\n\nThen, for each subject j from 0 to m-1:\n\n- Iterate through all students (i from 0 to n-1) and collect their marks for subject j.\n- Find the maximum mark in that subject.\n- Collect all students whose mark is equal to this maximum.\n\nOnce I have, for each subject j, the list of top students, I can then for each student check if they are in any of these top lists.\n\nSo, for each student i, check if they are present in any of the top lists for any subject j. If yes, increment the count.\n\nHow to efficiently do this? Well, for each student, iterate through all subjects and see if they are in the top list of that subject.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject's top list, add all those students to a set. Then, after processing all subjects, the size of the set is the answer.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Because if a student is in any of the top lists for any subject, they should be considered successful. So, we can have a set that keeps track of all such students. Once we process all subjects, the size of the set is our answer.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nInitialize an empty set called successful_students.\n\nFor each subject j:\n   find the maximum mark in that subject\n   collect all students i where marks[i][j] == max_mark\n   add each such i to successful_students\n\nFinally, the size of successful_students is the answer.\n\nYes, that's efficient because each student is processed once per subject, but since n and m are small (up to 100 each), it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n lines, each line is a string of m digits.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of strings, like ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], but when reading from stdin, perhaps each line is read via input().strip().\n\nWait, the problem says the first input line is two integers, n and m. Then the next n lines describe the gradebook. So in code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nmarks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    # the line is something like '223' for m=3\n    # so, convert each character to int\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    marks.append(row)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the first student's line is '223', which for m=3 would be three marks. So yes, each line's length is m, and each character is a digit.\n\nOnce we have marks as a list of lists, where each sublist is a student's marks.\n\nThen, for each subject j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_mark = max( [marks[i][j] for i in range(n)] )\n\ntop_students = [i for i in range(n) if marks[i][j] == max_mark]\n\nAdd all these i's to the successful_students set.\n\nOnce all subjects are processed, the size of the set is the answer.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nsuccessful = set()\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = max(marks[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_val:\n            successful.add(i)\n\nprint(len(successful))\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo marks matrix is:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nProcessing each subject:\n\nSubject 0:\n\nmarks[0][0] = 2\n\nmarks[1][0] = 2\n\nmarks[2][0] = 1\n\nmax_val is 2. So students 0 and 1 are added to successful.\n\nSubject 1:\n\nmarks[0][1] = 2\n\nmarks[1][1] = 3\n\nmarks[2][1] = 1\n\nmax is 3. Only student 1 is added.\n\nSubject 2:\n\nmarks[0][2] =3\n\nmarks[1][2] =2\n\nmarks[2][2] =2\n\nmax is 3. Only student 0 is added.\n\nSo the successful set is {0,1}, size 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo marks matrix:\n\nStudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nStudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nProcessing each subject:\n\nSubject 0:\n\nmax is 9, only student 0.\n\nSubject 1:\n\nall have 1, so all 3 students are added.\n\nSubject 2:\n\nmax is 8. Students 0 and 1.\n\nSubject3: max is 2, students 0 and 1.\n\nSubject4: max is 8, students 0 and 1.\n\nSo the successful set includes:\n\nstudent 0 (added in subject0),\n\nstudent1 (added in subject1),\n\nstudent0 again,\n\nstudent1 again,\n\nso all three students are in the set.\n\nThus, the output is 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic works.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nWhat if a student is the best in more than one subject? No problem, as long as they are added once.\n\nWhat if all students are the same in all subjects? Then, all of them are in the set, because for each subject, all are the best. So the count is n.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. The single student is the best, so output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudent 0: 99\n\nStudent 1: 99\n\nIn each subject, both are best. So the successful set includes both, so output is 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo now, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nPotential issues: making sure that the marks are read correctly, especially when the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line is m characters, so stripping is necessary.\n\nWait, in the input, the lines may have leading or trailing spaces? Or are the lines exactly m characters? For example, the first sample has lines like '223' which is 3 characters for m=3. So in code, when reading each line, we can strip whitespace and then process each character.\n\nSo in code:\n\nline = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nthen, for each character in line, convert to int.\n\nThat way, any leading or trailing spaces (though probably not present) are ignored.\n\nSo the code is solid.\n\nI think that's all. Now, write the Python code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is defined as one who is the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The first line contains two integers, `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The next `n` lines describe the marks of each student for `m` subjects.\n2. **Store Marks**: Convert each student's marks into a list of integers where each element represents a mark for a subject.\n3. **Identify Top Students**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark and identify all students who achieved this maximum mark. These students are considered the best in that subject.\n4. **Track Successful Students**: Use a set to keep track of all students who are the best in any subject. The size of this set gives the number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nmarks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    marks.append(row)\n\nsuccessful = set()\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = max(marks[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_val:\n            successful.add(i)\n\nprint(len(successful))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, starting with `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of marks.\n2. **Storing Marks**: Each line of marks is converted into a list of integers and stored in a list of lists, where each sublist represents a student's marks across all subjects.\n3. **Finding Top Students**: For each subject, we find the maximum mark and then identify all students who achieved this maximum mark. These students are added to a set to ensure each student is counted only once, even if they are the best in multiple subjects.\n4. **Counting Successful Students**: The size of the set, which contains all unique students who are the best in at least one subject, is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the number of successful students by leveraging sets to avoid duplicates and iterating through each subject to find the top performers.",
