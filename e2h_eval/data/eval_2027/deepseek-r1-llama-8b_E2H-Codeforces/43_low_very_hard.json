He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A creates a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So now the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C appends some 'c's to the end. The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C adds them. It can be equal to both.\n\nThe task is to check if a given string S could have resulted from this process.\n\nLet's think about what conditions the string must satisfy.\n\nFirst, the structure of the string must be in the form a...ab...bc...c. Because each step appends letters, so the order is strict: all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's. If the string doesn't follow this order, it's invalid.\n\nSo, the first condition is that the string should consist of a non-empty sequence of 'a's followed by a non-empty sequence of 'b's followed by a non-empty sequence of 'c's.\n\nIf this is not the case, we immediately return NO.\n\nNext, after verifying the order, let's consider the counts.\n\nLetâ€™s denote:\n- count_a = number of 'a's\n- count_b = number of 'b's\n- count_c = number of 'c's\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\nC appends count_c letters, which must be equal to either count_a or count_b (or both). But wait, the count_c is the number of 'c's added by C. However, the initial string before C adds 'c's is the one with a's and b's. So, the total 'c's in the string is count_c.\n\nWait, no. Because when C appends, he appends some 'c's. So the initial string before C's step has a certain number of 'a's and 'b's. Then, C adds some 'c's, say x, such that x equals count_a or count_b (or both).\n\nBut wait, the initial string before C's step would have count_a 'a's and count_b 'b's. So, when C appends x 'c's, the total 'c's in the string is x.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid:\n\nx (count_c) must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the string must have at least one 'a' and 'b', because after B's step, there's at least one of each. So, count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1.\n\nAdditionally, the entire string must be ordered as a's first, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo, steps to solve:\n\n1. Check that the string is composed of a block of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\n3. Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. Also, since count_c is the number of 'c's, which is what C added, but C could have added any number as long as it's equal to either count_a or count_b. Wait, no: the count_c is exactly equal to the number of 'c's in the final string. And that number must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, no. Because C appends some 'c's, which is equal to count_a or count_b in the string before C adds them. So, suppose before C adds 'c's, the string has a_count = a, b_count = b. Then, C appends x 'c's, where x is either a or b. So, the total c_count is x.\n\nTherefore, in the final string, c_count must be equal to a or b.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n- The string is a followed by b followed by c.\n\n- count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nAlso, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 because B appended at least one 'b' after A.\n\nWait, but what about the initial a's? A appends some 'a's, so count_a is at least 1. B appends at least one 'b', so count_b is at least 1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCheck the structure of the string.\n\nIf the structure is correct, compute a, b, c counts.\n\nThen, check if c == a or c == b.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the string starts with a mix of a and b, like 'aabbb'? That's invalid because the a's must come first.\n\nSo, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in a particular order. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must be structured such that it consists of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's and ending with a block of 'c's. If the string does not follow this order, it is immediately invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Calculate the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This is because C appends 'c's equal to the count of either 'a's or 'b's from the string before adding 'c's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid(s):\n    # Check the structure: all a's, then b's, then c's\n    parts = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char not in ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n            return False\n    current = None\n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if current != 'a':\n                parts.append('a')\n                current = 'a'\n            else:\n                return False  # Multiple 'a's after 'a's are allowed?\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if current != 'b':\n                parts.append('current')  # Track the current part\n                current = 'b'\n            else:\n                return False  # Multiple 'b's after 'b's are allowed?\n        elif char == 'c':\n            if current != 'c':\n                parts.append('c')\n                current = 'c'\n            else:\n                return False  # Multiple 'c's after 'c's are allowed?\n    # Now check if the parts are in order a->b->c, each appearing once\n    if len(parts) != 3:\n        return False\n    if parts[0] != 'a' or parts[1] != 'b' or parts[2] != 'c':\n        return False\n    return True\n\ns = input().strip()\nif not is_valid(s):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    a = s.count('a')\n    b = s.count('b')\n    c = s.count('c')\n    if c == a or c == b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Structure Check**: The function `is_valid` checks if the string follows the correct order of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's without any interleaving or reordering.\n2. **Character Counting**: After verifying the structure, the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are determined.\n3. **Validation of Counts**: The counts are checked to ensure that the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's, as required by the problem statement.\n\nThis approach ensures that the string adheres to the specified formation process and efficiently verifies the necessary conditions.",
