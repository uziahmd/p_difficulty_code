Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. The task is to find the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears at least twice. Hmm, right. And these substrings can overlap, which is important because sometimes the maximum possible might be found in overlapping regions.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. So, for example, in the sample input 'ababa', the output is 3. Because the substring 'aba' appears starting at index 0 and again at index 2. Wait, no, wait: 'ababa' is 5 letters long. Substrings of length 3 are 'aba' (0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). Oh right, so 'aba' appears twice, once at positions 0 and 2. So the length is 3.\n\nSo the goal is to find all possible substrings, track their starting indices, and find the maximum length where there are at least two occurrences.\n\nBut considering the size of the input is up to 100 characters, we need an efficient way. So a brute-force approach might be acceptable here, but I need to think about how to structure it.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substring lengths, starting from the maximum possible down to 1.\n2. For each length L, check all possible substrings of that length.\n3. For each substring, see if it appears again in the string, possibly with overlapping allowed.\n4. If any such substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nThis approach makes sense because checking longer substrings first would allow us to return early as soon as the maximum possible is found.\n\nSo, how do I implement this?\n\nFirst, for each possible L from len(s) down to 1:\n   - For each starting index i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n      - Extract the substring s[i:i+L]\n      - Check if this substring appears again somewhere else in the string.\n      - If yes, then return L as the maximum.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently check if the substring appears again? One way is to store all substrings of length L in a set, then for each new substring, check if it's already in the set. But wait, that won't work because the same substring could appear multiple times, but if any occurrence beyond the first is found, we can note that this L is valid.\n\nAlternatively, for each substring of length L, starting at i, check whether the same substring occurs at any j >= i+1, or maybe even before i. Because the problem allows overlaps.\n\nWait, no. The occurrences can be anywhere else in the string, including before or after. So for each substring, I need to see if there's another occurrence of it, regardless of position.\n\nSo perhaps for each L, collect all the substrings of length L, and for each, check if it appears more than once.\n\nBut that could be computationally expensive for L=1, but since the maximum string length is 100, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but perhaps a smarter way is to, for each possible L, iterate through all possible substrings of that length, and for each, see if it appears again later in the string. If any such substring exists, then L is the answer.\n\nSo let's try to structure the code.\n\nThe plan is:\n\nLoop L from len(s) down to 1:\n   For each i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n       Check if substr appears again in s, starting from any position j where j != i and j + L <= len(s)\n       Or, more precisely, check if substr appears at least once more in the entire string.\n\nIf any such substr exists for current L, return L.\n\nSo how to implement the check?\n\nWell, for a given substr, we can loop through the string again, starting from position 0, and see if substr matches any other position.\n\nAlternatively, create a set of all substrings of length L. Then, for each substr, if it's in the set, and the set was built by including all substrings, but only when they are unique. Wait, no—because if a substring appears multiple times, it will be in the set once, but when processing it again, we can know it's already present.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a dictionary where the key is the substring and the value is a list of starting indices. Then, for each substr, if the list has more than one element, we can return L.\n\nBut building such a dictionary for each L could be time-consuming, but for small L, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each substr of length L, check if it appears again in the string.\n\nSo for a given substr, we can scan the string for any occurrence that's not the same starting index. For example:\n\ndef has_duplicate_substring(s, substr):\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears at least twice. These occurrences can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking all possible substrings starting from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each length, we extract all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once in the string. The first valid length we find is our answer.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible substring length and decrement down to 1.\n2. **Extract Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: For each generated substring, check if it appears again in the string. If it does, return the current length as the result.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring by leveraging early termination when the longest valid substring is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = len(s)\nresult = 0\n\nfor L in range(max_len, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: Read the input string and determine its length.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: Iterate from the maximum possible substring length down to 1.\n- **Substring Extraction**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and store them in a set to track seen substrings.\n- **Duplicate Check**: For each substring, check if it has been seen before. If a duplicate is found, print the current length and exit.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If no duplicates are found for any length, print 0.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups and iterating from the longest possible substrings first, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
