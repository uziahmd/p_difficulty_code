The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about the game Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds. In each round, both choose their moves based on their respective sequences A and B. The loser gets a red spot, except when it's a draw, then nothing happens.\n\nMy task is to compute how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm. So for each round, I need to determine who loses, and add one to their count.\n\nFirst, let's think about how the players choose their moves. Nikephoros cycles through his sequence A in order, starting from the first element each time. Similarly, Polycarpus cycles through B. But wait, no, I think they show the items in a cyclic way. Like, for each round, he shows the next item in the sequence, wrapping around as needed.\n\nWait, no. The problem says: in each round, they choose one of three items. So for each round i, the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], assuming m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k].\n\nSo for each round from 1 to n, we can get their choices by taking the (i mod m)th element of A and (i mod k)th element of B.\n\nThen, for each round, we determine the winner. If the same, no change. Else, the winner is determined by the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors.\n\nScissors beat paper.\n\nPaper beats rock.\n\nWait, so if one chooses Rock and the other Scissors, Rock wins.\n\nIf one is Paper and the other Rock, Paper wins.\n\nIf one is Scissors and the other Paper, Scissors win.\n\nOtherwise, the other player wins.\n\nSo for each round, compare the two moves. Then, determine which one loses.\n\nEach loss adds a red spot.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over each round from 0 to n-1 (since it's easier with 0-based indices). For each round i, find the move of N and P.\n\nCompare the two moves. If same, skip. Else, determine the winner.\n\nIncrement the loser's count.\n\nAt the end, output the two counts.\n\nNow, how to efficiently handle this? Since n can be up to 2e5 (200,000), we need an O(n) solution, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read sequences A and B. They are given as strings. So, for example, if A is 'RPS', then the moves cycle R, P, S, R, P, S, etc.\n\n3. For each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a. Get the move of N: A[i % len(A)].\n\n   b. Get the move of P: B[i % len(B)].\n\n   c. Compare them.\n\n   d. Determine who loses, if anyone.\n\n   e. Add 1 to their count.\n\n4. After processing all rounds, output the counts.\n\nWait, but what if the sequences are empty? No, the problem says 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000, so they are non-empty.\n\nLet me think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is 'RPS' (length 3), B is 'RSPP' (length 4).\n\nRound 0: i=0 → A[0] = 'R', B[0] = 'R' → draw. No change.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1%3] = 'P', B[1%4]='S'. So P vs S. P beats S, so N loses. So Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nWait wait, no: Wait, the problem says that the winner gives a pinch to the loser. So if N's move beats P's, then N wins, and P gets a spot. Otherwise, if P's move beats N's, then N gets a spot.\n\nSo in each round, the winner is the one whose move beats the other. The loser is the one whose move is beaten.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no action.\n\nelse:\n\ncheck if a beats b. If yes, then P loses, so increment P's count.\n\nElse, N loses, so increment N's count.\n\nSo in the sample:\n\nRound 0: R vs R → draw. No action.\n\nRound 1: P vs S → P beats S (since scissors cut paper?), wait wait wait. Wait, no: in the rules, rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nWait, wait: the rules are:\n\nRock beats scissors.\n\nScissors beat paper.\n\nPaper beats rock.\n\nSo for a pair (x, y), x beats y if:\n\nx is 'R' and y is 'S'\n\nx is 'S' and y is 'P'\n\nx is 'P' and y is 'R'\n\nSo in round 1: P vs S.\n\nP is paper, S is scissors. Does paper beat scissors? No. Because scissors beat paper. So S beats P. So in this case, the winner is S (Polycarpus), so N (Nikephoros) loses. So N gets a spot.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if Polycarpus' move is S, and N's is P. So S beats P, so Polycarpus wins, so N loses, so N gets a spot.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each round, I need to check whether N's move beats P's or not.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nfor each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % lenA]\n\n   b = B[i % lenB]\n\n   if a == b: continue\n\n   else:\n\n       if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n           # a beats b → N wins, P loses\n\n           p_count +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           # b beats a → P wins, N loses\n\n           n_count +=1\n\nWait, no. Wait, if a is 'R' and b is 'S': R beats S. So N's move is R, which beats S. So N wins, so P loses.\n\nSimilarly, if a is 'S' and b is 'P': S beats P → N wins.\n\nIf a is 'P' and b is 'R': P beats R → N wins.\n\nIn all these cases, N's move beats P's, so P loses.\n\nIn other cases: for example, a is 'R' and b is 'P': P beats R, so P wins → N loses.\n\nOr a is 'S' and b is 'R': R beats S → P's move is R, which beats S → P wins, so N loses.\n\nSo the condition for N winning is when a beats b.\n\nSo in code, for each a and b:\n\nif a beats b → P loses, so p_count +=1.\n\nElse → N loses, so n_count +=1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if a beats b, then N's move wins, so P is the loser.\n\nSo for each round where a != b, we check if a beats b.\n\nIf yes: P loses, so p_count +=1.\n\nElse: N loses, so n_count +=1.\n\nSo the code should be structured that way.\n\nSo now, the plan is clear.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nCompute lenA = len(A), lenB = len(B).\n\nInitialize n_count and p_count to 0.\n\nLoop for i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % lenA]\n\n   b = B[i % lenB]\n\n   if a == b: continue\n\n   else:\n\n       if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n           p_count +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           n_count +=1\n\nAfter all iterations, print n_count and p_count.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's see.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=7\n\nA is RPS → ['R','P','S']\n\nB is RSPP → ['R','S','P','P']\n\nRounds:\n\ni=0: A[0]=R, B[0]=R → same. No change.\n\ni=1: A[1]=P, B[1]=S → P vs S.\n\nCheck if P beats S: P is paper, S is scissors. Scissors beat paper. So S beats P. So the condition is not met, so else clause: N_count increases by 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in code, for a='P' and b='S':\n\nCheck if a beats b.\n\nIs 'P' beats 'S'? No. Because 'S' is scissors, which cuts paper. So S beats P.\n\nSo the condition (a beats b) is false. So else clause: n_count +=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for this round, N's count increases by 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, in the first round, N's move was R vs R → draw.\n\nSecond round: N's move was P vs S → P loses. So N's count is increased by 1.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nRound 1: P - S. N loses. So N's count is 1.\n\nBut according to our code, in i=1, which is the second round (since i starts at 0), the code would add 1 to n_count.\n\nYes.\n\nProceeding:\n\ni=2: A[2%3=2] is S, B[2%4=2] is P.\n\nSo S vs P.\n\nS beats P → condition is true. So P's count increases by 1.\n\nSo after this round, p_count is 1.\n\nSample explanation says in third round (i=2?), S vs P: P loses. So N gains another point.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nRound 2: S - P. P loses. So N's count becomes 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the sample says the first round is R-R, which is i=0.\n\nThen the second round is P vs S: N loses (i=1).\n\nThird round: S vs P: P loses, so N gains 1, making it 2.\n\nFourth round: R vs P: N's R beats P's P? No. Because paper beats rock. So P's move is P, which beats R. So N's move is R, which loses to P's P. So N loses, so N's count increases by 1 (to 3).\n\nFifth round: P vs R: N's P beats R → P's count increases by 1 (to 2).\n\nSixth round: S vs S → draw.\n\nSeventh round: R vs P → again, R loses to P, so N's count is 4.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 3 2.\n\nHmm, maybe my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the sample.\n\nSample explanation:\n\nIt went like this:\n\n1st round: R - R → draw.\n\n2nd: P - S → N loses (so N has 1).\n\n3rd: S - P → P loses (N gains 1, total 2).\n\n4th: R - P → P loses (N gains 1, total 3).\n\n5th: P - R → R loses (P gains 1, so total 1).\n\n6th: S - S → draw.\n\n7th: R - P → P loses (N gains 1, total 4).\n\nWait, but the sample output is 3 2.\n\nHmm, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample rounds are 1-based, so i starts at 1.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says \"each round\" from 1 to n.\n\nSo for n=7, the rounds are 1 to 7.\n\nIn each round, i ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nSo for each round, i is 0-based.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the rounds are 1-based.\n\nSo perhaps the sample explanation's first round is i=0.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nRound 1: R-R → no.\n\nRound 2: P-S → N loses.\n\nRound 3: S-P → P loses.\n\nRound 4: R-P → P loses.\n\nRound 5: P-R → R loses.\n\nRound 6: S-S → no.\n\nRound 7: R-P → P loses.\n\nSo in this case, for each round 1 to 7, the corresponding i is 0 to 6.\n\nSo for each round:\n\ni=0: R vs R → no.\n\ni=1: P vs S → N loses (n=1).\n\ni=2: S vs P → P loses (p=1).\n\ni=3: R vs P → P loses (p=2).\n\ni=4: P vs R → R beats P? No, paper beats rock. So P's move is P, which beats R. So P's move is P, N's is R. So P wins, so N loses. So n_count becomes 2.\n\ni=5: S vs S → no.\n\ni=6: R vs P → P beats R. So P wins, N loses. So n_count becomes 3.\n\nThus, total n=3, p=2, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code correctly handles this.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All rounds are draws.\n\nn=5, A=R, B=R.\n\nThen, all rounds are draws. So counts are 0 and 0.\n\nCase 2: One player always wins.\n\nn=3, A=R, B=S.\n\nSo in each round, R beats S. So P loses each time. So p_count is 3, n_count is 0.\n\nAnother case: n is very large, say 2e5. But since the code is O(n), it's manageable.\n\nNow, what about when A and B are of different lengths?\n\nYes, because for each i, the modulo is applied to each separately.\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nSo, the steps to code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nCompute lenA = len(A), lenB = len(B).\n\nInitialize n_count and p_count to 0.\n\nLoop for i in range(n):\n\n   a = A[i % lenA]\n\n   b = B[i % lenB]\n\n   if a == b: continue\n\n   if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n       p_count +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       n_count +=1\n\nPrint n_count and p_count.\n\nWait, but in the sample, for i=4, a is P, b is R.\n\nSo a is P, which beats R. So condition is met, so p_count increases by 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting another case:\n\nn=1.\n\nA='R', B='P'.\n\nSo a is R, b is P.\n\nR is beaten by P. So N's move is R, which loses to P's P. So N_count +=1.\n\nSo output is 1 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2.\n\nA='RR', B='SS'.\n\ni=0: a=R, b=S → R beats S. So P_count +=1.\n\ni=1: a=R, b=S → same as above. So P_count +=1.\n\nTotal: 2 0.\n\nSo code correctly outputs 0 2.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, for each i, in this case:\n\ni=0: a=R, b=S → R beats S → P loses, so p_count +=1.\n\ni=1: a=R, b=S → same as before → p_count +=1.\n\nSo final counts: n_count=0, p_count=2.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2.\n\nA='SR', B='RP'.\n\ni=0: a='S', b='R' → S beats R? Wait, S beats R? No. Because R beats S. So S is beaten by R.\n\nSo a='S', b='R' → R beats S. So the condition is not met. So N loses, so n_count +=1.\n\ni=1: a='R', b='P' → R is beaten by P. So N loses again. n_count +=1.\n\nSo total counts: n=2, p=0.\n\nSo output is 2 0.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after they play `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each round is played with both players choosing their moves cyclically from their respective sequences. The loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game follows the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules where Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both players choose the same move, it results in a draw with no red spots.\n2. **Cyclic Moves**: Both players cycle through their respective sequences repeatedly. For each round `i`, Nikephoros's move is given by `A[i % len(A)]` and Polycarpus's move by `B[i % len(B)]`.\n3. **Determine the Winner**: For each round, if the moves are different, determine the winner based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. The loser gets a red spot.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Loop through each round, compute the moves, and update the red spots count accordingly. This approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nlenA = len(A)\nlenB = len(B)\n\nn_count = 0\np_count = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % lenA]\n    b = B[i % lenB]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        p_count += 1\n    else:\n        n_count += 1\n\nprint(n_count, p_count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **Loop Through Rounds**: For each round `i`, determine the move for both players using modulo operations to cycle through their sequences.\n3. **Check for Draw**: If both players choose the same move, skip to the next round.\n4. **Determine Loser**: Check if the current move of Nikephoros beats Polycarpus's move. If true, increment Polycarpus's red spot count. Otherwise, increment Nikephoros's red spot count.\n5. **Output Results**: After processing all rounds, print the counts of red spots for both players.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles up to the maximum constraints and ensures that each round is processed in constant time, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
