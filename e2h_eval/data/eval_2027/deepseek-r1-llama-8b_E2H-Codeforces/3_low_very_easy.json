Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l in length. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d so that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's consider what the street looks like. It's a line from 0 to l. Each lantern covers a segment of [ai - d, ai + d], but we have to ensure that this doesn't go beyond 0 or l. Wait, no—actually, any part beyond 0 or l isn't part of the street. So each lantern's coverage is the intersection of [ai -d, ai +d] with [0, l]. But since the street is only between 0 and l, the effective coverage is max(0, ai -d) to min(l, ai +d).\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to model the entire street as being covered without worrying about individual lanterns' positions. Because the minimal d must cover the entire street.\n\nSo perhaps the problem reduces to finding the minimal d such that every point x in [0, l] is covered by at least one lantern's coverage, which is a circle (but projected onto the line).\n\nWait, but since each lantern covers a continuous interval on the line, perhaps the problem can be thought of as covering the entire line with these intervals, each of which has a certain length depending on d.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal d?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the street must be fully covered, so the union of all the intervals [a_i -d, a_i +d] must cover [0, l].\n\nSo, the problem becomes determining the smallest d where the union of all these intervals includes [0, l].\n\nTo find the minimal d, we can model the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to find the minimal d such that for every position x on the street, there exists at least one lantern whose interval [a_i -d, a_i +d] covers x.\n\nAlternatively, for each point x in [0, l], there exists an a_i such that a_i -d <=x <= a_i +d.\n\nBut considering all x is impossible, so perhaps we can find the minimal d by looking at certain critical points where the coverage changes.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal d is determined by the maximum gap between consecutive points after some kind of sorting.\n\nWait, let's sort the lanterns' positions first. Because if two lanterns are close together, their combined coverage might not require a larger d than if they were apart.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal d is determined by the maximum distance between adjacent points in the sorted list, but also considering the ends of the street.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given in the problem.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 5\n2 5\n\nSo the street is from 0 to 5. Lanterns are at 2 and 5. So what's the minimal d? The output is 2.\n\nAt d=2, the first lantern covers from 0 to 4, and the second covers from 3 to 7, but since the street ends at 5, the second covers up to 5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nWhat's the key here? The first lantern needs to cover from 0, which is a distance of 2-0 = 2 units. So d must be at least 2. Similarly, the second lantern covers from 5, but since 5 is the end, the required coverage is from 5 backward. Wait, no—because the second lantern is at 5, to cover from 5, the coverage is 5-d to 5+d. But since the street ends at 5, the coverage for the second lantern is from 5-d to 5. So to cover 5, d can be zero, but to cover the lower part, we need the first lantern to reach 5.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the street is from 0 to l. To cover the entire street, the union of the intervals [a_i -d, a_i +d] must include [0, l].\n\nSo, the minimal d is the smallest value such that for each position in [0, l], it's covered by at least one of the intervals.\n\nHow can we model this? Let's imagine that for a certain d, each lantern covers some part of the street. The union of these parts must cover the entire street.\n\nOne approach is to find all the \"",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns cover the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). The approach involves sorting the lantern positions and analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns as well as the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lanterns**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps in efficiently checking the coverage gaps.\n2. **Calculate Gaps**: Compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Additionally, consider the start (from 0) and end (to \\( l \\)) of the street as points.\n3. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The minimal \\( d \\) is determined by the maximum gap found. This ensures that each gap is covered by at least one lantern's radius.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = float(input[1])\n    a = list(map(float, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    # Consider the start and end points\n    a = [0] + a + [l]\n    \n    max_gap = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n        current_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        if current_gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = current_gap\n    \n    # Now find the minimal d such that all gaps are covered\n    d = max_gap / 2\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting Lanterns**: By sorting the lantern positions, we can easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street.\n2. **Gaps Calculation**: We calculate the distance between each pair of consecutive lanterns. The largest gap determines the minimal radius needed because it dictates the furthest point that needs coverage.\n3. **Radius Determination**: The minimal radius \\( d \\) is half of the largest gap. This ensures that the interval around each lantern covers up to the midpoint of the largest gap, thus covering the entire street.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the minimal radius by focusing on the critical gaps that determine coverage, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of input constraints.",
