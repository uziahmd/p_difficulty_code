    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an array of integers, and we need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, my goal is to remove one element such that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible element to remove, I need to compute the instability of the remaining array and then find the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, which is 10^5. If I try to iterate over each element, compute the max and min each time, that would be O(n^2) time, which is definitely too slow. Because 1e5 squared is 1e10 operations—way beyond what can be handled in the time constraints.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's note that the original array has a certain max and min. When I remove an element, the new max or min might change depending on whether the removed element was the current max, min, or something else.\n\nWait, but sometimes even if you remove an element that's not the max or min, the new max or min could change. For example, if the array has multiple elements equal to the max. So I can't just know the new max and min by looking at the original max and min; I have to consider all possibilities.\n\nThis complicates things. So what can I do?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: The element to remove is neither the current max nor the current min. Then, the new max and min will remain the same as before. So the instability remains (original_max - original_min).\n\nCase 2: The element to remove is the current max. Then, the new max will be the second largest element in the array. Similarly, if the element to remove is the current min, the new min will be the second smallest.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple occurrences of the max? Like, if the array has several max elements. For instance, suppose the array is [3, 7, 7]. The original max is 7, and there are two instances. So if I remove one 7, the new max is still 7. So the new instability would be the same as before.\n\nSo the key here is: when the element to remove is the current max, but there are other elements equal to the max, then the new max doesn't change. Only when it's the last occurrence of the max does the max decrease.\n\nSimilarly for the min.\n\nSo, perhaps I should precompute some information:\n\n- Find all the occurrences of the max value and the min value.\n\nIf the number of max elements is greater than 1, then removing one of them won't affect the max. Similarly for min.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the original max and min, and their counts.\n\n2. For each element in the array, check whether removing it affects the max or the min.\n\nBut again, doing this for each element is O(n), which is manageable.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently find for each element whether it is the current max or min, and whether there are others?\n\nLet me structure this:\n\nCompute the current max (max_val) and min (min_val). Also, count how many times max_val occurs (max_count), and similarly for min_count.\n\nThen, for each element a[i] in the array:\n\nIf a[i] is not max_val and not min_val: removing it doesn't change max or min, so the instability remains (max_val - min_val).\n\nIf a[i] is max_val:\n\n   If max_count > 1: removing it doesn't change the max_val. So the new max is still max_val. But the min remains min_val. So the instability is (max_val - min_val).\n\n   Else: the new max becomes the next highest value. So the new instability is (new_max - min_val).\n\nSimilarly for a[i] being min_val:\n\n   If min_count > 1: removing it doesn't change the min. So instability remains (max_val - min_val).\n\n   Else: new_min is next smallest, so instability is (max_val - new_min).\n\nWait, but how do I find the next highest or next lowest quickly?\n\nBecause for each a[i], if it is the only max, then the new max is the maximum of the array excluding a[i]. Similarly for min.\n\nBut computing the max and min for each exclusion would take O(n) each time, which is too slow.\n\nHmm, so we need a way to find the second max and second min without recomputing each time.\n\nWait, maybe I can precompute the second max and second min.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\n- Precompute the list of unique elements, sorted. But that might not help directly.\n\nWait, another idea: the second max is the maximum of the array except for the current max. But if there are multiple maxes, the second max is the same as the original max.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the array is [7,7,5,3]. The max is 7, and the second max is also 7.\n\nSo, when considering removing an element, the effect depends on whether that element is the only max or not.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nCompute:\n\n- global_max: the maximum value in the array.\n\n- global_min: the minimum value in the array.\n\n- count_global_max: number of times global_max appears.\n\n- count_global_min: number of times global_min appears.\n\nAlso, compute:\n\n- second_max: the maximum value in the array excluding any global_max. Or, if all elements are global_max, then it's the same as global_max.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nIf the array has multiple elements equal to global_max, then the second_max is the same as global_max.\n\nOnly when all elements except one are less than global_max, then the second_max is the next lower value.\n\nSimilarly for the second_min.\n\nSo, to compute second_max and second_min:\n\n- To find the second_max, we can scan the array and find the maximum value that is less than global_max. But if all elements are global_max, then the second_max is global_max.\n\nHow to compute that efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to sort the array and find the second max.\n\nBut sorting is O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nWait, but for n=1e5, that's manageable.\n\nSo perhaps I can proceed as follows:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the unique elements.\n\nThen, the second_max is the largest element less than the first element (unique sorted list). Or, if there are multiple first elements, like in [5,5,4], then the second_max is 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\n2. Remove duplicates to get a list of unique elements, sorted.\n\n3. If the first element is the same as the second, then the second_max is the same as the first.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nFor example, sorted array is [3,3,3,5]. The unique list is [3,5]. The second_max is 3, since after removing one 5, the max becomes 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original array has a max of 5. If I remove one 5, then the new max is 3.\n\nSo, the second_max is the maximum of the array excluding the original max elements.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the maximum of the array after removing all instances of the original max. So, if the original max occurs k times, then if k > 1, then the second_max is still the same as the original max. Otherwise, the second_max is the next highest value.\n\nWait, perhaps yes.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCompute the original max and min.\n\nCompute the count of max and min.\n\nCompute the second_max as the maximum of the array excluding all max elements.\n\nSimilarly, compute the second_min as the minimum of the array excluding all min elements.\n\nBut how to compute second_max and second_min quickly?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFind the second_max by iterating through the array and tracking the maximum value that is less than the original max.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nThis can be done in O(n) time.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n\n2. Compute global_max = max(a), global_min = min(a).\n\n3. Compute count_max = number of elements equal to global_max.\n\n4. Compute count_min = number of elements equal to global_min.\n\n5. Compute second_max:\n\n   Initialize it as -infinity.\n\n   Iterate through each element in a:\n\n      if element < global_max, then compare with second_max. Update second_max if necessary.\n\n6. Similarly, compute second_min:\n\n   Initialize as +infinity.\n\n   Iterate through each element in a:\n\n      if element > global_min, compare with second_min. Update if necessary.\n\n7. Now, for each element in a:\n\n   If the element is not global_max and not global_min:\n\n      The new instability is global_max - global_min.\n\n   Else:\n\n      If the element is global_max:\n\n          if count_max > 1:\n\n              new_max remains global_max, so instability is global_max - global_min.\n\n          else:\n\n              new_max is second_max. So instability is max(second_max - global_min, 0). Wait, because if second_max is less than global_min, that can't happen because second_max is computed as the max of elements less than global_max, which are >= global_min.\n\n              Or wait, no. Because in the array, the min is global_min, so second_max is >= global_min.\n\n              So the instability is second_max - global_min.\n\n      Similarly, if the element is global_min:\n\n          if count_min > 1:\n\n              new_min remains global_min, so instability is global_max - global_min.\n\n          else:\n\n              new_min is second_min. So instability is global_max - second_min.\n\n   Keep track of the minimum instability across all these possibilities.\n\n8. The answer is the minimum instability found.\n\nWait, but what if the array has all elements equal? Like all are 5. Then, removing one element leaves all elements as 5, so the instability is zero.\n\nIn that case, the global_max and global_min are both 5, and count_max = count_min = n.\n\nWhen processing each element:\n\nEach element is either global_max or global_min (since all are same). So for any element, count_max is more than 1 (since n>1), so the new instability is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput array is [1,3,3,7]. Global_max is 7, count_max=1. Global_min is 1, count_min=1.\n\nSecond_max is 3. Second_min is 3.\n\nNow, for each element:\n\n- If the element is 1:\n\n   It's the global_min. Since count_min=1, removing it will set the new min to second_min=3. So instability is 3-3=0? Wait no, because the global_max is 7. So the new array is [3,3,7], the max is 7, min is 3. So instability is 4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the new array after removing 1 is [3,3,7]. Max is 7, min is 3. So 7-3=4.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, when you remove 7, the array becomes [1,3,3], with max 3 and min 1, giving 2.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my logic is flawed.\n\nWait, in the first sample, the initial max is 7, count_max=1. So when you remove 7, the second_max is 3. So the new instability is 3-1=2.\n\nAh right, but according to my earlier logic, when I remove an element that is the global_max, and count_max is 1, the new instability is second_max - global_min.\n\nWhich is 3-1=2. That's correct.\n\nBut for the element 1, which is the global_min, count_min is 1, so removing it gives a new min of second_min=3. So the new instability is global_max (7) - 3 =4.\n\nSo when considering all elements, the minimal instability comes from removing 7, giving 2, which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nAnother sample is the second one: [1,100000].\n\nglobal_max is 1e5, count_max=1.\n\nglobal_min is 1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max is 1.\n\nsecond_min is 1e5.\n\nWhen you remove 1e5, the new array is [1], so the instability is 0.\n\nWhen you remove 1, the new array is [1e5], so instability is 0.\n\nThus, the minimal is 0.\n\nSo the logic works.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,4,3]. Here, global_max is 5, count_max=2.\n\nglobal_min is 3, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max is 4 (since when you remove all 5s, the max is 4).\n\nsecond_min is 4 (because when you remove 3, the next min is 4).\n\nWait, no. Wait, when calculating second_min, we look for the minimum of elements greater than global_min.\n\nIn the array [5,5,4,3], when we remove 3, the array becomes [5,5,4], the min is 4. So yes, second_min is 4.\n\nSo, for each element:\n\nIf the element is 5:\n\n   It's the global_max, count_max is 2>1. So removing one 5 leaves global_max as 5. So the instability is 5-3=2.\n\nIf the element is 4:\n\n   Not max or min. So instability remains 5-3=2.\n\nIf the element is 3:\n\n   It's the global_min, count_min=1. Removing it, the new min is second_min=4. So instability is 5-4=1.\n\nSo the minimal instability is 1.\n\nWhich is achieved by removing 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute global_max = max(a), global_min = min(a).\n\ncount_max = a.count(global_max)\n\ncount_min = a.count(global_min)\n\nCompute second_max:\n\nInitialize to -infinity.\n\nIterate through each num in a:\n\n   if num < global_max:\n\n       if num > second_max:\n\n           second_max = num\n\nSimilarly for second_min:\n\nInitialize to +infinity.\n\nIterate through each num in a:\n\n   if num > global_min:\n\n       if num < second_min:\n\n           second_min = num\n\nWait, no. For second_min, we want the smallest number larger than the global_min.\n\nWait, no: the second_min is the minimum of the elements that are strictly greater than the global_min. Because, when you remove the global_min (if it's only present once), the new min is the next smallest element.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for second_min, we collect all elements that are greater than the global_min, and find the minimum among them.\n\nSimilarly, for second_max, collect all elements less than global_max and find the maximum among them.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsecond_max = -infinity\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num < global_max:\n\n        if num > second_max:\n\n            second_max = num\n\nif all elements are equal to global_max, then second_max remains -infinity, but in that case, when you remove an element (which is the max), the new array has all elements as max, so the new max is the same as the old. So the code needs to handle that.\n\nWait, but in the case where all elements are global_max, then for any element, if you remove it, the new array's max is still global_max. So for second_max, it's also global_max.\n\nWait, but in that case, during the iteration for second_max, all nums are equal to global_max, so none are less than it. So second_max remains -infinity.\n\nSo in that scenario, when you remove a max element (which is the case for all elements), count_max is n (since all are max). So when you remove one, count_max becomes n-1>1. So the new max remains the same.\n\nSo, for the case where all elements are same, the code correctly computes the new instability as 0.\n\nWait, but when all elements are same, the second_max is -infinity, which would cause issues.\n\nSo perhaps we need to handle that as a special case.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because when all elements are same, the second_max is -infinity, but when processing any element, if it's a max, count_max is more than 1 (since n>=2). So when you process it, the new instability is global_max - global_min.\n\nBut since all are same, global_max == global_min, so the instability is 0.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nOnce I have global_max, global_min, second_max, second_min, count_max, count_min.\n\nNow, for each element in a:\n\n   if element is not global_max and not global_min:\n\n       candidate = global_max - global_min\n\n   else:\n\n       if element == global_max:\n\n           if count_max > 1:\n\n               candidate = global_max - global_min\n\n           else:\n\n               candidate = max(second_max - global_min, 0)  # but since second_max >= global_min, it's safe.\n\n       elif element == global_min:\n\n           if count_min > 1:\n\n               candidate = global_max - global_min\n\n           else:\n\n               candidate = max(global_max - second_min, 0)\n\n       else:\n\n           # This shouldn't happen because element is either max or min.\n\n           pass\n\n   keep track of the minimum candidate.\n\nWait, but in the case where the array is [5,5,4,3], and we remove 3:\n\nelement is 3, which is global_min.\n\ncount_min is 1, so candidate is global_max (5) - second_min (4) = 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: [7,7,5,3]. When you remove 7 (count_max>1), the new instability is 7-3=4.\n\nBut if you remove 3, the new array's min becomes 5, so instability is 7-5=2.\n\nWhich is better.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can loop through each element, compute the candidate instability, and track the minimum.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nRead n, then the array a.\n\nCompute global_max = max(a)\n\nglobal_min = min(a)\n\ncount_max = a.count(global_max)\n\ncount_min = a.count(global_min)\n\nCompute second_max:\n\nsecond_max = -infinity\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num < global_max:\n\n        if num > second_max:\n\n            second_max = num\n\nif second_max is still -infinity, meaning all elements are global_max:\n\n    second_max = global_max\n\nSimilarly for second_min:\n\nsecond_min = +infinity\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num > global_min:\n\n        if num < second_min:\n\n            second_min = num\n\nif second_min is +infinity, meaning all elements are global_min:\n\n    second_min = global_min\n\nWait, no. Because if all elements are global_min, then when you remove one, the new min is the same as the others, so the second_min is global_min.\n\nBut in our code, for second_min, it's initialized to infinity.\n\nBut when all elements are global_min, then in the loop, all nums are equal to global_min, so no change to second_min. Thus, second_min remains infinity.\n\nSo, in that case, after the loop, we need to set second_min to global_min.\n\nSimilarly for second_max.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nCompute second_max:\n\nsecond_max = -inf\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num < global_max:\n\n        if num > second_max:\n\n            second_max = num\n\nif second_max == -inf:\n\n    second_max = global_max\n\nCompute second_min:\n\nsecond_min = inf\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num > global_min:\n\n        if num < second_min:\n\n            second_min = num\n\nif second_min == inf:\n\n    second_min = global_min\n\nWait, but what if the array has all elements as global_min, but n>1. Then, when you remove one, the new min is the same as the others, which is global_min. So the instability is 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, for each element in a:\n\n   if a[i] is not global_max and not global_min:\n\n       candidate = global_max - global_min\n\n   else:\n\n       if a[i] == global_max:\n\n           if count_max > 1:\n\n               candidate = global_max - global_min\n\n           else:\n\n               candidate = second_max - global_min\n\n       else:  # a[i] is global_min\n\n           if count_min > 1:\n\n               candidate = global_max - global_min\n\n           else:\n\n               candidate = global_max - second_min\n\n   keep track of the minimal candidate.\n\nFinally, output the minimal candidate.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmin_instability = infinity\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num != global_max and num != global_min:\n\n        current = global_max - global_min\n\n    else:\n\n        if num == global_max:\n\n            if count_max > 1:\n\n                current = global_max - global_min\n\n            else:\n\n                current = second_max - global_min\n\n        else:  # num is global_min\n\n            if count_min > 1:\n\n                current = global_max - global_min\n\n            else:\n\n                current = global_max - second_min\n\n    if current < min_instability:\n\n        min_instability = current\n\nprint(min_instability)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has only one element? Well, according to the problem statement, n >=2. So no problem.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\na = [1,3,3,7]\n\nglobal_max=7, count_max=1.\n\nglobal_min=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max is 3.\n\nsecond_min is 3.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n1: it's min. count_min=1. So current is 7-3=4.\n\n3: not max or min. current is 4.\n\n3: same as above.\n\n7: it's max, count_max=1. So current is 3-1=2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\na = [5,5,4,3]\n\nglobal_max=5, count_max=2.\n\nglobal_min=3, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max=4.\n\nsecond_min=4.\n\nProcessing elements:\n\n5: is max, count_max>1. current is 5-3=2.\n\n5: same as above.\n\n4: not max/min. current is 2.\n\n3: is min, count_min=1. current is 5-4=1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\na = [2,2,2,2]\n\nglobal_max=2, count_max=4.\n\nglobal_min=2, count_min=4.\n\nsecond_max is 2.\n\nsecond_min is 2.\n\nFor each element, when it's 2, which is both max and min.\n\ncount_max>1 and count_min>1.\n\nSo current is 0 for all elements.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\na = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nglobal_max=5, count_max=1.\n\nglobal_min=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max=4.\n\nsecond_min=2.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n1: is min. count_min=1. current is 5-2=3.\n\n2: not max/min. current is 4.\n\n3: same as above.\n\n4: same as above.\n\n5: is max, count_max=1. current is 4-1=3.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nWhich is achieved by removing 2,3, or 4.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove 2, the new array is [1,3,4,5]. The max is 5, min is 1. Instability is 4.\n\nSame as if you remove any of the middle elements.\n\nSo the code correctly finds that.\n\nWait, no, according to the code, for any element that is not max or min, the candidate is 5-1=4. So the minimal is 4.\n\nWait, but according to the code, the candidate is 4 for all non-max/min elements. So the minimal is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, handling the edge cases:\n\nCase when all elements are same: returns 0.\n\nCase when n=2: returns 0 if both are same, else max - min when one is removed.\n\nWait, no. For n=2, [a, b], if a != b.\n\nWhen you remove a, the array is [b], so instability is 0.\n\nSame for removing b. So the minimal is 0.\n\nWait, but according to the code:\n\nglobal_max is max(a, b).\n\nglobal_min is min(a, b).\n\ncount_max is 1 or 2.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSuppose a=1, b=100000.\n\nglobal_max is 1e5, count_max=1.\n\nglobal_min is 1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max is 1 (because when you exclude 1e5, the remaining is 1).\n\nsecond_min is 1e5.\n\nNow, for each element:\n\nIf you remove 1e5: current is second_max (1) - global_min (1) → 0.\n\nIf you remove 1: current is global_max (1e5) - second_min (1e5) → 0.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, a=[3, 1, 1].\n\nglobal_max=3, count_max=1.\n\nglobal_min=1, count_min=2.\n\nsecond_max is 1.\n\nsecond_min is 1.\n\nProcessing elements:\n\n3: is max, count_max=1. So current is 1-1=0.\n\n1: is min, count_min=2. So current is 3-1=2.\n\n1: same as above.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct because removing 3 leaves [1,1], instability 0.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles this.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[5,5]. Both are same. Then, count_max=2, count_min=2.\n\nsecond_max is 5, second_min is 5.\n\nFor each element, they are both max and min. So when processing:\n\ncurrent = global_max - global_min = 0.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, a=[5,5,6].\n\nglobal_max=6, count_max=1.\n\nglobal_min=5, count_min=2.\n\nsecond_max is 5.\n\nsecond_min is 5.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n5: it's min, count_min=2>1. So current is 6-5=1.\n\n5: same.\n\n6: it's max, count_max=1. So current is 5-5=0.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct because removing 6 leaves two 5s, instability 0.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for large n=1e5, using a.count() function may be O(n) each time. So for n=1e5, doing a.count(global_max) could be O(n), which is acceptable as it's part of the overall O(n) steps.\n\nBut perhaps, for efficiency, we can avoid using a.count.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can count the occurrences of global_max and global_min in a single pass.\n\nLike:\n\ncount_max = 0\n\ncount_min = 0\n\nglobal_max = max(a)\n\nglobal_min = min(a)\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num == global_max:\n\n        count_max +=1\n\n    if num == global_min:\n\n        count_min +=1\n\nThat's O(n) time.\n\nSo, perhaps that's better.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nglobal_max = max(a)\n\nglobal_min = min(a)\n\ncount_max = 0\n\ncount_min = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num == global_max:\n\n        count_max +=1\n\n    if num == global_min:\n\n        count_min +=1\n\n# Compute second_max\n\nsecond_max = -float('inf')\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num < global_max:\n\n        if num > second_max:\n\n            second_max = num\n\nif second_max == -float('inf'):\n\n    second_max = global_max\n\n# Compute second_min\n\nsecond_min = float('inf')\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num > global_min:\n\n        if num < second_min:\n\n            second_min = num\n\nif second_min == float('inf'):\n\n    second_min = global_min\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num != global_max and num != global_min:\n\n        current = global_max - global_min\n\n    else:\n\n        if num == global_max:\n\n            if count_max > 1:\n\n                current = global_max - global_min\n\n            else:\n\n                current = second_max - global_min\n\n        else:  # num is global_min\n\n            if count_min > 1:\n\n                current = global_max - global_min\n\n            else:\n\n                current = global_max - second_min\n\n    if current < min_instability:\n\n        min_instability = current\n\nprint(min_instability)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, for second_max, the condition is num < global_max. What if there are no such nums? Like, all elements are global_max.\n\nIn that case, second_max remains -inf, and then we set it to global_max.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nglobal_max=7, count_max=1.\n\nglobal_min=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max is 3.\n\nsecond_min is 3.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n1: min, count_min=1. current is 7-3=4.\n\n3: not max/min. current is 4.\n\n3: same.\n\n7: max, count_max=1. current is 3-1=2.\n\nmin is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n1 100000\n\nglobal_max=100000, count_max=1.\n\nglobal_min=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max=1.\n\nsecond_min=100000.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n1: min, count_min=1. current is 100000 - 100000 = 0.\n\n100000: max, count_max=1. current is 1-1=0.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\na = [5,5,4]\n\nglobal_max=5, count_max=2.\n\nglobal_min=4, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max=5.\n\nsecond_min= ?\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nglobal_min is 4.\n\nCompute second_min: look for numbers >4.\n\nIn the array, 5 and 5 are greater than 4.\n\nThe second_min is the minimum of these, which is 5.\n\nSo, second_min is 5.\n\nSo, for each element:\n\n5: is max, count_max>1. current is 5-4=1.\n\n5: same as above.\n\n4: is min, count_min=1. current is 5-5=0.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is achieved by removing 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5\n\na = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]\n\nglobal_max=10, count_max=1.\n\nglobal_min=6, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max=9.\n\nsecond_min=7.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n10: max, count_max=1. current is 9-6=3.\n\n9: not max/min. current is 10-6=4.\n\n8: same as 9.\n\n7: same.\n\n6: min, count_min=1. current is 10-7=3.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nWhich is achieved by removing 10 or 6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, considering the constraints, the code is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: Compute the global maximum (`global_max`) and global minimum (`global_min`) of the array.\n2. **Count Occurrences**: Determine how many times `global_max` and `global_min` appear in the array.\n3. **Compute Second Max and Min**: Calculate the second highest value (`second_max`) and the second lowest value (`second_min`) in the array. These values help determine the effect of removing an element that is either the current max or min.\n4. **Evaluate Each Element**: For each element in the array, consider the effect of removing it:\n   - If the element is neither the max nor the min, the instability remains the same.\n   - If the element is the max, check if there are other max elements; if not, use the second max.\n   - If the element is the min, check if there are other min elements; if not, use the second min.\n5. **Track Minimum Instability**: Keep track of the minimum instability encountered during the evaluation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nglobal_max = max(a)\nglobal_min = min(a)\n\ncount_max = 0\ncount_min = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    if num == global_max:\n        count_max += 1\n    if num == global_min:\n        count_min += 1\n\n# Compute second_max\nsecond_max = -float('inf')\nfor num in a:\n    if num < global_max:\n        if num > second_max:\n            second_max = num\nif second_max == -float('inf'):\n    second_max = global_max\n\n# Compute second_min\nsecond_min = float('inf')\nfor num in a:\n    if num > global_min:\n        if num < second_min:\n            second_min = num\nif second_min == float('inf'):\n    second_min = global_min\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor num in a:\n    if num != global_max and num != global_min:\n        current = global_max - global_min\n    else:\n        if num == global_max:\n            if count_max > 1:\n                current = global_max - global_min\n            else:\n                current = second_max - global_min\n        else:  # num is global_min\n            if count_min > 1:\n                current = global_max - global_min\n            else:\n                current = global_max - second_min\n    if current < min_instability:\n        min_instability = current\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the array `a`.\n- **Global Max and Min**: The maximum and minimum values of the array are computed.\n- **Counting Occurrences**: The number of times the max and min values appear in the array are counted.\n- **Second Max and Min**: These values are determined by iterating through the array and finding the next highest and lowest values after excluding the global max and min.\n- **Evaluating Elements**: For each element, the potential new instability is calculated based on whether the element is the max, min, or neither.\n- **Tracking Minimum Instability**: The minimum instability across all possible removals is tracked and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible instability in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
