Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game where two players, Homer and Marge, take turns picking digits from a number A, which has 2n digits. Each player makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers S1 and S2, which are built by appending the leftmost digit of A each time.\n\nHmm, right. So the initial number A is given, and each turn, the leftmost digit is taken and added to either S1 or S2. The choice of who takes the digit is up to the players to decide before each move, but they have to make exactly n moves each. We need to find the sequence of H and M (Homer and Marge) that maximizes the sum S1 + S2.\n\nWait, how is the sum calculated? Oh, because S1 is Homer's number and S2 is Marge's, but we want the total prize, which is S1 + S2. So maximizing the sum of the two numbers.\n\nSo, the key is to choose for each digit whether to assign it to H or M in such a way that when all digits are assigned, the sum of the two numbers is as large as possible.\n\nBut wait, how does the order of taking digits affect the sum? Because each digit is taken from the left, so the order in which they're taken matters for the numbers' magnitudes.\n\nLet me think: Each digit contributes to the sum based on its position in S1 and S2. For example, if a high digit is assigned to an earlier position in S1 or S2, it contributes more.\n\nWait, no, the actual contribution depends on the place value. For instance, a digit in the hundreds place contributes more than one in the tens place. So, the earlier digits are more significant.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy would be to assign higher digits to the higher positions in both S1 and S2. But since each digit can only go to one of the two, perhaps the best approach is to pair the highest available digits with the highest possible positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to split the digits into pairs of highest and assign each pair to H and M in a way that maximizes their combined value.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: the total sum S1 + S2 can be thought of as the sum of the digits multiplied by their respective place values. So, for each position in the resulting numbers, we want the sum of the digits in that position across S1 and S2 to be as large as possible.\n\nWait, let's model this. Let's say after all assignments, each digit is placed in some position in S1 or S2. The sum is the sum of all digits multiplied by 10^k, where k is their position within their respective number.\n\nSo for each digit, depending on whether it's assigned to S1 or S2, it will contribute to a certain power of 10 in that number. The idea is to maximize the sum by assigning higher digits to higher place values.\n\nWait, but the place values depend on the order of the digits in S1 and S2. For example, the first digit taken by H is the most significant in S1, then the second, etc. Similarly for M.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal approach is to select for each pair of digits, which goes to H and which to M, such that the sum of their contributions is maximized.\n\nWait, let's consider all the digits in order. The first digit in A is the first to be picked. Assigning it to H gives S1 a higher value, while assigning it to M might give M a higher value. But since both need to make n moves, perhaps the order of selection isn't just about individual digits but about the entire structure.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe a dynamic programming approach could work here.\n\nYes, dynamic programming might be the way to go. Because for each step, we have a state that represents how many digits have been processed, how many moves each player has made so far, and the current state of S1 and S2.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 18, 2n is 36 digits. So the state space would be manageable.\n\nWait, what defines the state? The number of digits taken so far (let's call it pos, starting from 0 to 36). And for each player, how many moves they have made. But since each must make exactly n moves, the state can track the count for each player: h and m, which start at 0 and go up to n.\n\nBut also, the state needs to represent the current numbers S1 and S2. But since the numbers can be up to 36 digits, storing them as part of the state is impossible due to memory constraints.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, how else can we model the state without tracking the entire numbers?\n\nAlternative",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, such that their combined score from a given number is maximized. Each player must make exactly `n` moves, and each move consists of taking the leftmost digit of the number and appending it to their respective score.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each digit's contribution to the total score depends on its position (place value) in the resulting numbers. To maximize the sum, higher digits should be placed in the most significant positions possible. We can achieve this by using dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the best way to assign digits to each player up to each step.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming State**: Define a state `dp[pos][h][m]` where:\n   - `pos` is the current position in the string.\n   - `h` is the number of digits assigned to Homer so far.\n   - `m` is the number of digits assigned to Marge so far.\n\n2. **State Transition**: For each position, decide whether to assign the current digit to Homer or Marge, updating the state accordingly and keeping track of the maximum possible score.\n\n3. **Memoization**: Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.\n\n4. **Maximize Score**: At each step, compute the maximum possible score by considering all valid transitions and update the DP table accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(pos, h, m):\n        if pos == len(A):\n            return 0\n        res = 0\n        current_digit = A[pos]\n        # Assign to Homer\n        if h < n:\n            score = dp(pos + 1, h + 1, m) + int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - h - 1))\n        else:\n            score = dp(pos + 1, h, m)\n        # Assign to Marge\n        if m < n:\n            score_m = dp(pos + 1, h, m + 1) + int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - m - 1))\n        else:\n            score_m = dp(pos + 1, h, m)\n        # Choose the maximum between assigning to H or M\n        max_score = max(score, score_m)\n        # If both assignments are same, choose the one with H to have more leading digits\n        if score == score_m and h < n:\n            return max_score + 0  # no change needed as max is already considered\n        # Also, if both have same, but prefer H has more digits earlier\n        return max_score\n        \n    max_score = dp(0, 0, 0)\n    \n    # Now reconstruct the path\n    path = []\n    pos = 0\n    h = 0\n    m = 0\n    while pos < len(A):\n        current_digit = A[pos]\n        # Check if assigning to H is better\n        if h < n:\n            score_h = dp(pos + 1, h + 1, m) + int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - h - 1))\n            if score_h > dp(pos + 1, h, m):\n                path.append('H')\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                path.append('M')\n        else:\n            path.append('M')\n            m += 1\n        pos += 1\n    \n    print(''.join(path))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming**: The solution uses a DP approach to explore all possible ways of assigning digits to the two players, ensuring that each player makes exactly `n` moves.\n- **Memoization**: The `lru_cache` decorator is used to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations, significantly improving efficiency.\n- **State Transition**: At each step, the algorithm decides whether to assign the current digit to Homer or Marge based on which assignment leads to a higher score, considering the place value of the digit.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and optimal, handling all edge cases and constraints effectively.",
