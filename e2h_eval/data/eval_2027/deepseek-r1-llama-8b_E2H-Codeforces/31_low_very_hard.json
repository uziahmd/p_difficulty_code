Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero, but the absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But since some are missing, we need to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to achieve this.\n\nWait, no. Wait. The way the problem is phrased: Vanya found some cards, but he needs the sum of all found (including the new ones) to be zero. So initially, he found n cards, but he might need to find more to make the total sum zero. We need to find the minimal number of such cards.\n\nSo, the input gives us the n found cards, and x, which is the maximum absolute value any card can have.\n\nOur task is to compute the minimal number of additional cards needed, each with a value between -x and x (inclusive), such that when added to the existing sum, the total becomes zero.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call this S. We need the total sum after adding some new cards to be zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be equal to -S. Let's denote the sum of the new cards as T. So T = -S.\n\nNow, each new card contributes a value between -x and x. So, each new card can contribute at most x towards the desired sum T. Therefore, the minimal number of cards required is the ceiling of |T| / x. Because each card can contribute up to x, so if |T| is k*x, then k cards are needed. If it's more than k*x, then k+1 is needed.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, each card can add up to 2. So 3 cards would give 6, which is enough. But 5/2 is 2.5, so the ceiling is 3. So yes, the minimal number is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, there's another consideration: what if the required T is zero? Then no new cards are needed. That's straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute the required sum T = -S.\n3. If T is zero, output 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n5. Output this number.\n\nBut wait, is there any other condition? Like, for example, in the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nThe sum S is (-2) + (-2) = -4. So T is 4.\n\nEach card can contribute at most 3. So 4 / 3 is approximately 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So two cards are needed, each with 2, giving 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2.\n\nWe need the sum of new cards to be -2. Since each card can contribute up to 2 in absolute value, the minimal number is 1, because -2 is within the allowed range. So one card is needed.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what if T is not achievable exactly with some combination of cards? Because each new card can be any value between -x and x, including zero.\n\nWait no, because the sum of the new cards can be any integer. Because each card can contribute any integer from -x to x, including zero. So the sum T can be any integer, positive or negative.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, each new card can be any integer between -x and x. So the sum of any number of such cards can be any integer between k*(-x) and k*x, where k is the number of cards.\n\nBut when T is known, the minimal k is the minimal number such that |T| <= k*x. Because each card can contribute up to x towards the sum. So the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nWait, that seems right.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCalculate S = sum of found cards.\n\nIf S is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute T = -S.\n\nCompute the minimal k as ceil(|T| / x). Output k.\n\nSo how do we implement this?\n\nIn Python, we can read the inputs, compute the sum, then proceed.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nCase 1: Found cards sum to zero",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The sum of the new cards must be equal to the negative of the sum of the found cards to make the total sum zero.\n3. **Compute Minimum Cards Needed**: The minimum number of additional cards required is determined by the absolute value of the required sum divided by the maximum allowed value per card, rounded up to the nearest integer. This ensures that each card contributes as much as possible towards reaching the required sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t = -s\n    k = abs(t) // x\n    if k * x < abs(t):\n        k += 1\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. We then read the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum `s` of the found cards.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the sum `s` is zero, no additional cards are needed, so we print 0.\n4. **Required Sum Calculation**: Calculate the required sum `t` as the negative of `s`.\n5. **Determine Minimum Cards**: Calculate the minimum number of cards needed by dividing the absolute value of `t` by `x`, rounding up to ensure we cover any remainder.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution in constant time, ensuring it handles all edge cases correctly.",
