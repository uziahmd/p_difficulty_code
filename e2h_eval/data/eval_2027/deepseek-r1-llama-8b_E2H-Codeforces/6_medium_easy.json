Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x and they don't overlap. Also, the total cost should be as minimal as possible. If it's impossible, we return -1.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, each voucher has a start (li), end (ri), and cost (costi). The duration is ri - li + 1. So for two vouchers i and j, their durations must add up to x. Also, they shouldn't intersect, meaning either voucher i ends before voucher j starts or vice versa.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. For each voucher, calculate its duration.\n2. Find all pairs of vouchers where the sum of their durations is x.\n3. Among those pairs, check if they are non-overlapping.\n4. Among all valid pairs, find the one with the minimum total cost.\n5. Return the minimum cost, or -1 if no such pair exists.\n\nBut wait, checking all possible pairs could be O(n^2), which might be acceptable since n is up to 2e5. Wait, no—wait, n is up to 2e5? No, the input says n can be up to 2e5? Or is it 2*10^5? Wait, the problem statement says 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105. Oh, right, because 2*10^5 is 200000, which is manageable, but O(n^2) would be 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way.\n\nLet me think: for each voucher i, I can look for vouchers j such that the duration of j is x - duration(i), and j doesn't overlap with i.\n\nHow can I efficiently find such j?\n\nIdea: group vouchers by their duration. So, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher i, I can check if there's a duration d = x - duration_i in the dictionary. For those vouchers j in the d group, I need to ensure that j doesn't overlap with i.\n\nBut even then, for each i, looping through all j in the d group could be O(n), leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible.\n\nWait, maybe pre-process the vouchers in a sorted order. Because to check if j comes after i, perhaps we can use binary search.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a list, sorted by their end time (ri).\n- For each voucher i, compute its duration di.\n- Compute target duration dj = x - di.\n- If dj is not present in the duration groups, skip.\n- Else, for each voucher j in the dj group, we need to check if j starts after i ends, or ends before i starts.\n- But how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, but if the vouchers are sorted by their end times, then for any j in the dj group, if j's start is >= i's end, then they don't overlap. Otherwise, if j's end < i's start, same thing.\n\nBut checking each j in the dj group is still O(n) per i, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: for each duration d, have the vouchers sorted by their end time. Then, for a given i, when looking for j with duration dj = x - di, perform a binary search on the j's to see if any j's end is <= i's start (so j comes before i and doesn't overlap) or j's start is >= i's end (so j comes after i and doesn't overlap).\n\nWait, but j can be either before or after i. So for each i, I need to find j's that are either entirely before i or entirely after.\n\nSo, for each i, I can:\n\n1. For j's with duration dj, find those whose end <= i's start. So j's are completely before i. The minimal cost among these will contribute to the overall minimum.\n\n2. Similarly, find j's whose start >= i's end. These are completely after i.\n\nBut how to efficiently find these j's for each i.\n\nAnother approach: for each duration d, keep the list of vouchers sorted by their end time. Then, for each i, to find j's with duration dj, we can split into two cases: j's end <= i's start, and j's start >= i's end.\n\nWait, but for each i, the j's can be from any part of the list. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, we can store them in a structure that allows us to query quickly for i's that have duration di such that dj = x - di, and j is compatible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the data structures.\n\nLet me create a dictionary, say duration_map, where each key is a duration, and the value is a list of tuples (ri, costi). This list is sorted by ri.\n\nThen, for each voucher i, with duration di, I compute dj = x - di.\n\nIf dj is not in duration_map, continue.\n\nElse, for vouchers j in duration_map[dj], we need to find those j where j ri <= i li, or j li >= i ri.\n\nSo, for j's in duration_map[dj], we can split them into two parts:\n\n- Those where j ri <= i li: these are compatible and come before i.\n\n- Those where j li >= i ri: these are compatible and come after i.\n\nWe need to find the minimal cost in both subsets.\n\nBut how?\n\nSince the j's are sorted by ri, for the first case (j ri <= i li), all j's up to some point will satisfy j ri <= i li. So we can perform a binary search to find the largest j ri <= i li, and then consider all j's up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case, we can find all j's where j li >= i ri. Since the j's are sorted, perhaps we can find the first j li >= i ri and then consider all j's from that point onwards.\n\nBut wait, for the second case, j li >= i ri doesn't mean that j's start is after i's end. Because j's start could be in between i's start and end. So, j's end could be >= i's start, but if j's start is within [i.start, i.end], then their intervals would overlap.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition for j to be non-overlapping with i is that j's interval is entirely before i's or entirely after.\n\nSo, for j to be non-overlapping with i, either:\n\nj ri < i li, or j li > i ri.\n\nSo, for j's in duration_map[dj], we need to find those j where j ri < i li OR j li > i ri.\n\nSo for each i, the j's that are compatible are either:\n\n- j's with j ri < i li (and thus, j is entirely before i)\n\nOR\n\n- j's with j li > i ri (and thus, j is entirely after i)\n\nBut in this case, j's can be in any part of the duration_map[dj] list.\n\nSo, for each i, for each j in duration_map[dj], we need to check whether j ri < i li OR j li > i ri.\n\nBut that's O(k) for each i, where k is the number of j's in duration_map[dj].\n\nWhich is again O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\nSo that approach won't work for n=2e5.\n\nHence, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nFor each possible duration d, pre-sort the vouchers with duration d by their end times.\n\nThen, for a voucher i of duration di, we look for vouchers j of duration dj = x - di.\n\nWe can split j's into two groups:\n\n1. Those whose end times are <= i's start time.\n\n2. Those whose start times are >= i's end time.\n\nFor each group, we can find the minimal cost quickly.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nFor group 1: j's end <= i li.\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the sorted list of j's end times to find the maximum j ri <= i li. All j's up to that index are candidates.\n\nAmong these, we need the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for group 2: j's li >= i ri.\n\nAgain, the j's are sorted by ri. So perhaps we can find the first j where j li >= i ri. All j's from that index onwards are candidates. Among these, find the minimal cost.\n\nSo, the steps for each i are:\n\na. Compute dj = x - di.\n\nb. If dj is not present in duration_map, skip.\n\nc. Else, for j's in duration_map[dj], get the list sorted by ri.\n\nd. For group 1 (j ri <= i li):\n\n   i. Binary search to find the last j in the list where j ri <= i li.\n\n   ii. If such j exists, find the minimal cost in the sublist up to that index.\n\ne. For group 2 (j li >= i ri):\n\n   i. Binary search to find the first j in the list where j li >= i ri.\n\n   ii. If such j exists, find the minimal cost in the sublist from that index.\n\nf. Take the minimal cost from both groups, if any exist.\n\ng. Update the global minimal cost if this is lower.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nEach duration's j list is sorted by ri. So for each i, when processing group 1, we can find the largest j ri that is <= i li. Using binary search, we can find the position where j ri is just <= i li. All j's up to that position are eligible for group 1.\n\nFor group 2, we need j li >= i ri. Since the j's are sorted by ri, but we're considering their li as the key, not ri. Wait, no. The j's are sorted by ri, but each j has li and ri. So, in the list, the j's are ordered by ri, which may not be the same as li.\n\nSo, for group 2, the j's may not be ordered by li. Hence, to find j's with j li >= i ri, we need to scan through the entire list and find the first j where li >= i ri.\n\nBut that's O(k) again for each i, which is not feasible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of sorting by ri, for each duration d, sort the j's by li. So for group 2, we can perform a binary search on j's li >= i ri.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each duration d, we'll have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by ri (for group 1)\n\n- Sorted by li (for group 2)\n\nSo, when processing group 1, we look for j ri <= i li, using the ri-sorted list.\n\nWhen processing group 2, we look for j li >= i ri, using the li-sorted list.\n\nThat way, both can be done in O(log k) time.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess for each duration d:\n\n   - Two sorted lists: one sorted by ri (for group 1), another sorted by li (for group 2).\n\n- For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute di = ri - li + 1.\n\n   b. Compute dj = x - di. If dj < 0, skip (since durations are positive).\n\n   c. Check if dj is in duration_map.\n\n   d. If not, continue.\n\n   e. For group 1:\n\n      i. Get the list of j's with duration dj, sorted by ri.\n\n      ii. Binary search to find the largest j ri <= i li.\n\n      iii. If found, find the minimal cost in the sublist up to that index.\n\n   f. For group 2:\n\n      i. Get the list of j's with duration dj, sorted by li.\n\n      ii. Binary search to find the first j li >= i ri.\n\n      iii. If found, find the minimal cost in the sublist starting at that index.\n\n   g. Take the minimal cost from both groups, if any.\n\n   h. Update the global minimal cost.\n\nThis way, for each i, the processing is O(log k), where k is the number of j's in duration_map[dj]. Since k can be up to n, but log n is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation steps.\n\nFirst, read all vouchers, compute their durations, and group them by duration.\n\nFor each duration d, create two sorted lists:\n\n- sorted_ri: sorted by j.ri in ascending order.\n\n- sorted_li: sorted by j.li in ascending order.\n\nAlso, for each d, store the list of costs, so that for a certain range in the sorted_ri or sorted_li list, we can quickly find the minimal cost.\n\nWait, but for group 1, we need the minimal cost among j's with j ri <= i li.\n\nIn the sorted_ri list, all j's up to a certain index have j ri <= i li. So for the minimal cost, we need the minimal value in the sublist up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for group 2, all j's from a certain index onwards have j li >= i ri. We need the minimal cost in that sublist.\n\nSo, for each duration d, and for each of the two sorted lists, we need to have a prefix min and a suffix min.\n\nAh, right! So for each sorted_ri list, for each index i, we can precompute the minimal cost from 0 to i. Similarly, for the sorted_li list, precompute the minimal cost from i to the end.\n\nYes, that's the way to go.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nFor each duration d:\n\n   a. Sort the j's by ri to form sorted_ri.\n\n   b. Compute a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost in sorted_ri[0..i].\n\n   c. Sort the j's by li to form sorted_li.\n\n   d. Compute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost in sorted_li[i..end].\n\nThen, for each i:\n\n   a. For group 1:\n\n      i. In sorted_ri, find the largest j where j.ri <= i.li.\n\n      ii. If such an index exists, the minimal cost is prefix_min[index].\n\n   b. For group 2:\n\n      i. In sorted_li, find the first j where j.li >= i.ri.\n\n      ii. If such an index exists, the minimal cost is suffix_min[index].\n\nThen, the minimal cost for group 1 and group 2 is considered, and the overall minimal is updated.\n\nThis way, each i is processed in O(log k) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read each voucher, compute duration, and group by duration.\n\nFor each duration d:\n\n   - Collect all j's, then create sorted_ri and sorted_li.\n\n   - For sorted_ri, compute prefix_min.\n\n   - For sorted_li, compute suffix_min.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i:\n\n   di = duration_i.\n\n   dj = x - di.\n\n   If dj is negative or not in duration_map, skip.\n\n   Else:\n\n      For group 1:\n\n         Use binary search on sorted_ri of dj's to find the largest j.ri <= i.li.\n\n         If found, get the minimal cost from prefix_min up to that index.\n\n      For group 2:\n\n         Use binary search on sorted_li of dj's to find the first j.li >= i.ri.\n\n         If found, get the minimal cost from suffix_min starting at that index.\n\n      The minimal cost from both groups is considered, and the global minimal is updated.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\nImplementing the binary search correctly for group 1 and group 2.\n\nAlso, note that in group 1, the j's are sorted by ri, so binary search is based on j.ri <= i.li.\n\nIn group 2, j's are sorted by li, so binary search is based on j.li >= i.ri.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in group 2, the j's are sorted by li, so to find the first j where li >= i.ri, we can perform a binary search for i.ri and find the insertion point, then take the elements from that point onwards.\n\nSimilarly, for group 1, the j's are sorted by ri, so to find the largest j.ri <= i.li, we can perform a binary search for i.li and find the rightmost index where j.ri <= i.li.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nLet's think about the data structures.\n\nEach duration d will have:\n\n- A list of j's, each represented as a tuple (li, ri, costi).\n\nThen, for each d:\n\n   sorted_ri = sorted(j's, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n   sorted_li = sorted(j's, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n   prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_ri)\n   current_min = infinity\n   for i in range(len(sorted_ri)):\n       current_min = min(current_min, sorted_ri[i][2])\n       prefix_min[i] = current_min\n\n   suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_li)\n   current_min = infinity\n   for i in range(len(sorted_li)-1, -1, -1):\n       current_min = min(current_min, sorted_li[i][2])\n       suffix_min[i] = current_min\n\nWait, no. For the suffix_min, for each i, it's the minimal cost from i to the end.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute prefix_min:\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_ri[0].cost\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ri[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, for suffix_min:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_li[-1].cost\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_li[i].cost)\n\nSo, in code, for each d in duration_map:\n\n   # For group 1\n   sorted_ri = sorted(j for j in duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n   prefix_min = []\n   if len(sorted_ri) > 0:\n       current_min = float('inf')\n       for j in sorted_ri:\n           current_min = min(current_min, j[2])\n           prefix_min.append(current_min)\n   \n   # For group 2\n   sorted_li = sorted(j for j in duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n   suffix_min = []\n   if len(sorted_li) > 0:\n       current_min = float('inf')\n       for j in reversed(sorted_li):\n           current_min = min(current_min, j[2])\n           suffix_min.insert(0, current_min)\n   # Now, suffix_min is built from the end towards the start.\n\nWait, no. For suffix_min, for each position i, it's the minimal cost from i to end.\n\nSo, the correct way is to loop from the end to the beginning.\n\nLike:\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_li)\ncurrent_min = float('inf')\nfor i in range(len(sorted_li)-1, -1, -1):\n    current_min = min(current_min, sorted_li[i][2])\n    suffix_min[i] = current_min\n\nYes.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i, process as follows:\n\ndi = duration_i = ri - li + 1\n\ndj = x - di\n\nif dj not in duration_map, continue.\n\nElse, get the sorted_ri and prefix_min, and sorted_li and suffix_min for dj.\n\nFor group 1:\n\nUsing the sorted_ri list, find the largest j where j.ri <= i.li.\n\nWe can use bisect module for this.\n\nbisect_right gives us the insertion point, so the index is the insertion point minus 1.\n\nBut since the list is sorted, we can do:\n\nimport bisect\n\nmax_ri_idx = bisect.bisect_right([j[1] for j in sorted_ri], i_li) - 1\n\nWait, but in Python, creating a list each time is inefficient. Instead, we can use a key function that returns j.ri.\n\nWait, but the sorted_ri is already sorted by j.ri, so the bisect can be done on the list of j.ri.\n\nAlternatively, for each sorted_ri list, we can extract the j.ri into a separate list for bisect, but that's not efficient for large n.\n\nAn alternative is to write a custom bisect function that works with the sorted_ri list and the key.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to write a helper function.\n\nWait, perhaps the bisect module can be used with a key parameter, but I don't think it's available. So, for the bisect, perhaps we can pass a lambda that extracts the j.ri.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a list of j.ri for the sorted_ri, and use bisect on that.\n\nBut for each i, creating such a list is O(k), which is not feasible. So, perhaps during preprocessing, for each sorted_ri, we can create a list of j.ri, and similarly for sorted_li.\n\nYes, that's a good idea.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nFor each d in duration_map:\n\n   # For group 1, create a list of j.ri in sorted_ri\n   # and a list of j.ri for bisect.\n\n   sorted_ri_list = [j[1] for j in sorted_ri]\n   # Similarly for group 2:\n   sorted_li_list = [j[0] for j in sorted_li]\n\nThen, during processing each i:\n\nFor group 1:\n\ntarget = i_li\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ri_list, target) - 1\n\nif index >=0:\n\n   min_cost_group1 = prefix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_cost_group1 = infinity\n\nFor group 2:\n\ntarget = i_ri\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_li_list, target)\n\nif index < len(sorted_li_list):\n\n   min_cost_group2 = suffix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_cost_group2 = infinity\n\nThen, the minimal cost for this i is min(min_cost_group1, min_cost_group2).\n\nWait, but in group 2, the j's are sorted by li, so all j's from index onwards have li >= target.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n   l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n   duration = r - l + 1\n\n   vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration) )\n\ngroup_vouchers = {}\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n   d = voucher[3]\n\n   if d not in group_vouchers:\n\n       group_vouchers[d] = []\n\n   group_vouchers[d].append(voucher)\n\nNow, for each d in group_vouchers, preprocess the sorted_ri and sorted_li lists, along with their respective sorted_ri_list, prefix_min, sorted_li_list, and suffix_min.\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor d in group_vouchers:\n\n   j_list = group_vouchers[d]\n\n   # Group 1: sorted by ri, and prefix min\n\n   sorted_ri = sorted(j_list, key=lambda x: x[1])  # sorted by ri\n\n   sorted_ri_list = [j[1] for j in sorted_ri]\n\n   prefix_min = []\n\n   if len(sorted_ri) > 0:\n\n       current_min = float('inf')\n\n       for j in sorted_ri:\n\n           current_min = min(current_min, j[2])\n\n           prefix_min.append(current_min)\n\n   else:\n\n       prefix_min = []\n\n   # Group 2: sorted by li, and suffix min\n\n   sorted_li = sorted(j_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n   sorted_li_list = [j[0] for j in sorted_li]\n\n   suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_li)\n\n   if len(sorted_li) > 0:\n\n       current_min = float('inf')\n\n       for i in range(len(sorted_li)-1, -1, -1):\n\n           current_min = min(current_min, sorted_li[i][2])\n\n           suffix_min[i] = current_min\n\n   else:\n\n       suffix_min = []\n\n   preprocessed[d] = {\n\n       'sorted_ri_list': sorted_ri_list,\n\n       'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n\n       'sorted_li_list': sorted_li_list,\n\n       'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n\n   }\n\nNow, for each voucher i:\n\nglobal_min = infinity\n\nfor i in vouchers:\n\n   l, r, c, di = i\n\n   dj = x - di\n\n   if dj not in preprocessed:\n\n       continue\n\n   # Process group 1\n\n   # Get group 1's data\n\n   data = preprocessed[dj]\n\n   sorted_ri_list = data['sorted_ri_list']\n\n   prefix_min = data['prefix_min']\n\n   # Find the largest j where j.ri <= l\n\n   target = l\n\n   idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ri_list, target) - 1\n\n   if idx >=0:\n\n       group1_cost = prefix_min[idx]\n\n   else:\n\n       group1_cost = float('inf')\n\n   # Process group 2\n\n   sorted_li_list = data['sorted_li_list']\n\n   suffix_min = data['suffix_min']\n\n   target = r\n\n   idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_li_list, target)\n\n   if idx < len(sorted_li_list):\n\n       group2_cost = suffix_min[idx]\n\n   else:\n\n       group2_cost = float('inf')\n\n   # Total cost for this i is min of group1 and group2\n\n   total_cost = min(group1_cost, group2_cost)\n\n   if total_cost < global_min:\n\n       global_min = total_cost\n\nAfter processing all i, if global_min is still infinity, output -1, else output global_min.\n\nWait, but what if dj is zero? Well, since durations are ri - li +1, which is at least 1, so dj can't be zero unless di is x, but x can be anything.\n\nWait, no: if x is 2, and di is 2, then dj is 0. But in the problem statement, vouchers have a duration of ri - li +1, which is at least 1. So, dj can't be zero unless x is di +0, which is only possible if di is x, and dj is zero, but in that case, j's duration must be zero, which is impossible.\n\nSo, in code, when dj is less than 1, we can skip, but since di >=1 and x >=2, dj can be zero only when di =x.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\ndj = x - di.\n\nIf di = x, then dj=0. But since j's duration is ri - li +1 >=1, so j can't have duration 0. So, in that case, group_vouchers[dj=0] is empty.\n\nThus, in code, for each i, if dj is not present in preprocessed, we can skip.\n\nSo, in code, during processing each i, if dj is not in preprocessed, continue.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nWait, wait, no, let me compute the durations:\n\nVoucher 1: l=1, r=3 → 3 days.\n\nVoucher 2: l=1, r=2 → 2 days.\n\nVoucher3: l=5, r=6 → 2 days.\n\nVoucher4: l=1, r=2 → 2 days.\n\nSo group_vouchers:\n\nd=3: [voucher1]\n\nd=2: [voucher2, voucher3, voucher4]\n\npreprocessed:\n\nFor d=3:\n\nsorted_ri is [(1,3,4)] → sorted_ri_list is [3]\n\nprefix_min is [4]\n\nsorted_li is [(1,3,4)] → sorted_li_list is [1]\n\nsuffix_min is [4]\n\nFor d=2:\n\nsorted_ri is sorted by ri:\n\nvoucher2 has r=2, voucher4 has r=2, voucher3 has r=6.\n\nWait, wait no. Let's list all vouchers in group d=2:\n\nThey are voucher2, voucher3, voucher4.\n\nvoucher2: l=1, r=2, cost=5.\n\nvoucher3: l=5, r=6, cost=1.\n\nvoucher4: l=1, r=2, cost=4.\n\nSo, sorted_ri is sorted by r:\n\nvoucher2 and voucher4 have r=2, voucher3 has r=6.\n\nSo sorted_ri is [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3]\n\nsorted_ri_list is [2, 2,6]\n\nprefix_min is [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1]\n\nSo prefix_min is [5,4,1]\n\nsorted_li is sorted by l:\n\nvoucher2 has l=1, voucher4 has l=1, voucher3 has l=5.\n\nSo sorted_li is [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3]\n\nsorted_li_list is [1,1,5]\n\nsuffix_min is computed from the end.\n\nvoucher3 has cost 1 → suffix_min[2] =1.\n\nvoucher4 has cost4. min(4,1) =1 → suffix_min[1]=1.\n\nvoucher2 has cost5. min(5,1) =1 → suffix_min[0]=1.\n\nSo, for group 2, any j's from index 0 onward have l >= target.\n\nNow, for each voucher i:\n\nLet's process each i.\n\nVoucher1: l=1, r=3, c=4, di=3.\n\ndj =5-3=2.\n\nCheck group d=2.\n\nGroup1:\n\ntarget = l=1.\n\nIn sorted_ri_list of d=2: [2,2,6]\n\nbisect_right of 1 is 0, so idx =-1. So group1 is inf.\n\nGroup2:\n\ntarget = r=3.\n\nIn sorted_li_list [1,1,5], find first j.l >=3.\n\nbisect_left finds the position where 3 would be inserted. 5 is at index 2. So idx=2.\n\nsuffix_min[2] is 1.\n\nSo group2 cost is 1.\n\nTotal cost is min(inf, 1) →1.\n\nUpdate global_min to 1.\n\nNext, voucher2: l=1, r=2, c=5, di=2.\n\ndj=5-2=3.\n\nCheck group d=3.\n\nGroup1:\n\ntarget=1.\n\nIn sorted_ri_list of d=3: [3]. So bisect_right(1) is 0, idx=-1 → group1 is inf.\n\nGroup2:\n\ntarget=2.\n\nIn sorted_li_list of d=3: [1]. bisect_left(2) is 1, which is beyond the list. So group2 is inf.\n\nSo no contribution.\n\nVoucher3: l=5, r=6, c=1, di=2.\n\ndj=5-2=3.\n\nGroup1:\n\ntarget=5.\n\nIn sorted_ri_list of d=3: [3]. 3 <5 → idx =0, but 3<=5.\n\nprefix_min[0] is4.\n\nGroup2:\n\ntarget=6.\n\nIn sorted_li_list of d=3: [1]. bisect_left(6) is 1 → beyond list, group2 is inf.\n\nSo total cost is min(4, inf) →4.\n\nCompare with global_min (1). So no change.\n\nVoucher4: l=1, r=2, c=4, di=2.\n\ndj=5-2=3.\n\nGroup1:\n\ntarget=1.\n\nsorted_ri_list of d=3 is [3]. 3>1 → no j's. group1 is inf.\n\nGroup2:\n\ntarget=2.\n\nbisect_left in sorted_li_list [1] for 2 is 1, beyond. group2 is inf.\n\nNo contribution.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 5.\n\nWait, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, no, in the sample input, the correct selection is voucher1 and voucher3.\n\nWait, what's their durations?\n\nVoucher1 has di=3, voucher3 has dj=2. 3+2=5.\n\nAre they non-overlapping?\n\nVoucher1 ends at 3, voucher3 starts at5. So yes.\n\nSo in the code, when processing voucher1, group2 would find j's with l>=3.\n\nLooking at j's in d=2 group, the sorted_li_list is [1,1,5].\n\ntarget is 3. bisect_left finds the first j with l >=3.\n\nLooking at the list [1,1,5], 3 is inserted at index 2.\n\nSo j's from index 2 have l >=3.\n\nIn the suffix_min for index 2, the minimal cost is 1.\n\nSo group2 cost is 1.\n\nThus, when processing voucher1, the cost is 4 +1=5.\n\nBut in the code above, the calculation is min(group1_cost, group2_cost). group1 is inf, group2 is 1.\n\nSo total cost is 1. But wait, no: the group2 cost is the cost of j, which is 1, but the i's cost is 4. So the total cost is 4+1=5.\n\nBut in the code, the group1 cost is the j's cost, but when processing i, the group1 is j's cost, and group2 is j's cost.\n\nWait, no. Because for group1, the j's are vouchers before i, so their cost is added to i's cost.\n\nWait, no. Because in group1, j's are before i, so the total cost is i's cost plus the j's cost.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the code, when processing i, group1_cost is the minimal cost of j's in group1, which is the cost of j. So the total cost is i's cost + j's cost.\n\nBut in the code, I have:\n\ntotal_cost = min(group1_cost, group2_cost)\n\nWait, no. That's incorrect.\n\nBecause, for group1, the j's are before i. So the total cost is i's cost plus the j's cost.\n\nSimilarly for group2.\n\nSo the code is currently only taking the j's cost, not adding i's cost.\n\nAh, that's a mistake.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nFor group1:\n\nmin_j_cost = group1_cost\n\ntotal_cost_group1 = i.c + min_j_cost\n\nSimilarly for group2.\n\nSo in code:\n\ngroup1_cost is the minimal j's cost.\n\ngroup2_cost is the minimal j's cost.\n\nThen, total_cost = min(\n\n   (i.c + group1_cost) if group1_cost is not inf,\n\n   (i.c + group2_cost) if group2_cost is not inf,\n\n   else inf,\n\n)\n\nAh, that's the mistake. So I forgot to include i's cost.\n\nSo in the previous example, when processing voucher1 (cost 4), the group2 cost is 1 (from voucher3). So the total cost is 4 +1=5, which is correct.\n\nIn the code, the current calculation is min(1, ...), which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code needs to be fixed.\n\nSo, for each i, the group1 and group2 are j's cost, and the total cost is i.c + j's cost.\n\nSo the code should compute:\n\nif group1_cost is not inf:\n\n   total1 = i's cost + j's cost.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem requires that the two vouchers are chosen, so the total cost is i's cost plus j's cost.\n\nSo, for each i and j, the total cost is voucher_i's cost + voucher_j's cost.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\nWe are choosing two vouchers, so the problem is to choose two vouchers.\n\nSo, the code must be adjusted to consider this.\n\nSo, in the code, for each voucher i and j, the total cost is cost_i + cost_j.\n\nThus, for each i and j, the cost is cost_i + cost_j.\n\nSo, in the code, for each voucher, when considering i and j, the cost is cost_i plus cost_j.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the two vouchers are i and j. So, the minimal cost is the sum of the cost_i and cost_j.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsum_cost = cost_i + cost_j.\n\nSo, when selecting two vouchers, the sum is cost_i + cost_j.\n\nSo, in the code, for each voucher i, when considering j, the cost is the sum of the two.\n\nSo, the code needs to track the sum of the two.\n\nThus, in the sample input:\n\nVoucher1: cost4, duration3, cost is4.\n\nVoucher3: cost1, duration1.\n\nSo, sum is 4+1=5.\n\nSo, the code should compute 4+1=5.\n\nSo, the code needs to track the sum of the two vouchers.\n\nThus, the initial approach is to, for each i and j, compute the sum of their durations, check if they are non-overlapping, and find the minimal cost.\n\nBut the problem is to compute the minimal sum of the two.\n\nThus, the code should:\n\nFor each i, for each j != i, if durations add to x, and non-overlapping, compute the sum of their cost.\n\nSo, the code needs to process each i and j.\n\nBut back to the code.\n\nSo, in the code, when processing i, the group1 and group2 are j's, and their cost is added to i's cost.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nWhen",
