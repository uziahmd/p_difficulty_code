            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain substrings after each modification of a string S. Hmm, the key points are:\n\n- Each modification appends either '0' or '1' to S.\n- After each modification, I need to find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented as some substring of S in Morse code.\n- The output should be modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, wait. So each time we add a character to S, we have to compute this count. But how?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which substrings of S correspond to valid English letters. Because not all possible binary strings are valid. The note says that four specific strings don't correspond to any letter: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring of S that translates to one of these invalid codes shouldn't be counted.\n\nSo for each possible substring of S, if its Morse code representation is valid (i.e., it's not one of those four), then it contributes to the count.\n\nBut considering all possible substrings each time seems computationally heavy, especially since m can be up to 3000. So I need an efficient way to track this.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe I can keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at each position.\n\nWait, another approach: for each position i in S, I can compute the number of valid substrings ending exactly at i. Then, the total count would be the sum of these values across all positions.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each i, I look back at all possible j < i, and see if the substring S[j..i] is a valid Morse code. If it is, then it contributes 1 to the count. But doing this naively would be O(m^2), which for m=3e3 is about 9 million operations—manageable, perhaps, but maybe tight.\n\nAlternatively, I can find a way to represent this with states that can be updated efficiently.\n\nWhat defines a valid Morse code? It's a string of length 1-4, consisting of 0s and 1s, except those four invalid ones.\n\nSo for each new character added to S, I can check the last few characters to form substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4. For each possible length l (1<=l<=4), I can see if the current substring ending at i with length l is valid. If yes, then add 1 to the count.\n\nWait, but for each i, we can look back up to 4 steps. That would be manageable.\n\nLet me think: when processing the i-th character, I can consider all substrings ending at i of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4. For each such length l, I get a substring of l bits. I need to check whether this substring is valid.\n\nIf the substring is valid, it contributes 1 to the total count. So for each i, the number of valid substrings added is equal to the number of l's (1<=l<=4) where the substring is valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each new character, check all possible substrings ending at this character, of lengths 1 to 4 (if possible).\n- For each substring, check if it's one of the allowed Morse codes.\n- Sum the count for each i and accumulate the total.\n\nBut how to represent the allowed Morse codes? We can precompute a set containing all valid Morse codes except those four invalid ones.\n\nWait, the allowed Morse codes are all possible 1-4 length binary strings except \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So the total valid codes are 30 - 4 = 26, as given.\n\nSo the idea is to precompute a set of all valid Morse codes. Then, for any substring of length 1-4, we can check if it's in this set.\n\nSo let's create a set allowed_codes = {'0', '1', '00', '01', '10', '11', '000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111', '0000', '0001', '0010', '0011' is invalid, etc.} Wait no, I should include all possible except the four invalid ones.\n\nWait, the invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So the allowed codes are all the other 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 - 4 = 30 -4 =26.\n\nSo for each possible l from 1 to 4, and for each possible combination of 0s and 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to an initially empty string. Each modification appends either a '0' (dot) or '1' (dash) to the string. The goal is to count all valid Morse code sequences that can be formed from any substring of the modified string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Morse Codes**: Each Morse code sequence corresponds to an English letter except four invalid sequences: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". We need to check if any substring of the modified string matches these invalid sequences.\n2. **Efficient Checking with Sliding Window**: For each new character added to the string, we check all possible substrings ending at this character of lengths 1 to 4. We use a sliding window approach to efficiently check each substring.\n3. **Precompute Valid Codes**: We precompute all valid Morse code sequences except the four invalid ones and store them in a set for quick lookup.\n4. **Dynamic Counting**: Maintain a running total of valid substrings as each character is added. For each new character, check all possible substrings ending at this character and update the count based on whether they form valid Morse codes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\nallowed_codes = {\n    '0', '1', '00', '01', '10', '11', '000', '001', '010', '011',\n    '100', '101', '110', '111', '0000', '0001', '0010', '0011'  # Wait, no, 0011 is invalid\n}\n\n# Wait, correction: allowed_codes should exclude the invalid ones\nallowed_codes = set()\nfor l in range(1, 5):\n    for bits in itertools.product('01', repeat=l):\n        s = ''.join(bits)\n        if s not in ['0011', '0101', '1110', '1111']:\n            allowed_codes.add(s)\n\n# Now, allowed_codes contains all valid Morse codes\n\nm = int(input())\nS = []\ntotal = 0\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    S.append(c)\n    \n    current = []\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(4):\n        if i >= len(S):\n            break\n        substr = ''.join(S[-i-1:])  # substring of length i+1\n        if substr in allowed_codes:\n            count += 1\n    total += count\n    print(total % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Precomputation**: We generate all valid Morse code sequences except the four invalid ones and store them in a set for quick access.\n- **Sliding Window Check**: For each new character added to the string, we check all substrings ending at this character of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is found in the set of allowed codes, it contributes to the count.\n- **Efficiency**: By checking only the last few characters (up to 4), we ensure that the solution runs efficiently even for the maximum input size, keeping the time complexity manageable.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid Morse code substrings after each modification, providing the required results modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).",
