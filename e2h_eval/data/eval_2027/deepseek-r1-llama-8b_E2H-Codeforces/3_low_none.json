Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l in length. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d so that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to model the street as a line segment from 0 to l. Each lantern covers an interval around its position ai. The coverage for each lantern is [ai - d, ai + d], but we need to clamp this to the ends of the street because if ai - d is less than 0, the lower bound is 0, and similarly for the upper end.\n\nWait, no. Because the street is from 0 to l. So for any lantern, its coverage is from max(0, ai -d) to min(l, ai +d). The union of all these intervals must cover [0, l].\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the smallest d such that the union of all these intervals is exactly [0, l].\n\nHow do I compute the minimal d?\n\nI think the approach is to find the maximum distance between consecutive coverage areas. The minimal d will be determined by the largest gap between the coverage of two adjacent lanterns.\n\nBut wait, how are the lanterns ordered? Because if they're not sorted, the gaps could be between non-consecutive lanterns. Or perhaps the maximum gap is between the coverage of two adjacent lanterns when sorted.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if the lanterns are sorted in order, the gaps between their coverage areas can be considered. The largest such gap will dictate the required d.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in increasing order.\n2. Compute the coverage for each lantern as [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)].\n3. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, check the gap between their coverage areas. The maximum gap determines the necessary d.\n4. Additionally, we need to account for the start and end of the street. For example, the first lantern's coverage must cover from 0, and the last lantern's must cover to l. Otherwise, the gap before the first or after the last lantern is unaccounted for.\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage is determined by each lantern's d. So for the entire street to be covered, the union of all [max(0, ai-d), min(l, ai+d)] must include [0, l]. So the minimal d is the minimal value such that this condition holds.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as covering the street with intervals that expand symmetrically around each ai. The minimal d is the smallest radius where all points between 0 and l are covered.\n\nThis feels similar to interval covering problems. So perhaps binary search can be used here.\n\nYes, binary search on d. For a given d, we can check if all points on the street are covered by at least one lantern. If yes, then we can try a smaller d. If no, we need to increase d.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Sort the lanterns' positions.\n- Binary search for the minimal d:\n   - For a mid value of d, compute the coverage intervals.\n   - Check if the union of these intervals covers [0, l].\n- Once the minimal d is found, output it with sufficient precision.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the binary search boundaries.\n\nThe minimal possible d is 0 (but that only works if all lanterns are at the same point and l is 0, which isn't the case). The maximum possible d is when the first lantern is at 0 and the last at l, so d would be max(l/2, ...). But more accurately, the maximum needed d would be when the first lantern's rightmost coverage is as far as possible, and the last's leftmost is as far as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial low can be 0, and high can be l. Because for d = l, the first lantern (if at 0) covers from 0 to l, but that's overkill. But for the binary search, setting high to l is safe.\n\nSo the binary search process would be something like:\n\nlow = 0\nhigh = l\nwhile high - low > epsilon (like 1e-10):\n   mid = (low + high)/2\n   if all points are covered with mid:\n      high = mid\n   else:\n      low = mid\nFinally, return high.\n\nBut how to implement the 'all points are covered' check efficiently.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns cover the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). The approach involves using binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( d \\) that ensures complete coverage.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps us systematically check the coverage intervals.\n2. **Binary Search for Minimum \\( d \\)**: We perform a binary search on the possible values of \\( d \\). The search range is from 0 to \\( l \\), which is the maximum possible length of the street.\n3. **Check Coverage for Mid \\( d \\)**: For each midpoint value of \\( d \\) during the binary search, we compute the coverage interval for each lantern. The coverage of a lantern at position \\( ai \\) with radius \\( d \\) is [max(0, \\( ai - d \\)), min(\\( l \\), \\( ai + d \\))]. We then check if the union of these intervals covers the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\).\n4. **Adjust Search Range**: If the current midpoint \\( d \\) ensures full coverage, we try a smaller \\( d \\) by adjusting the upper bound of the search range. Otherwise, we increase the lower bound to try a larger \\( d \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    def is_covered(d):\n        prev_end = 0\n        for ai in a:\n            start = max(0, ai - d)\n            end = min(l, ai + d)\n            if start > prev_end:\n                return False\n            prev_end = end\n        return prev_end >= l\n    \n    low = 0.0\n    high = l\n    eps = 1e-10\n    for _ in range(100):\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if is_covered(mid):\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(high))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to efficiently compute the coverage intervals and check for gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Binary Search**: Binary search is used to efficiently narrow down the minimum \\( d \\). It works by repeatedly checking if the current guess for \\( d \\) covers the entire street and adjusting the search range based on the result.\n- **Coverage Check**: For each guess \\( d \\), the function `is_covered` checks if the union of all coverage intervals from the lanterns spans the entire street. If it does, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimal \\( d \\) efficiently, even for the upper limits of the problem constraints.",
