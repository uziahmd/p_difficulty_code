The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns located on a coordinate line. There are n+2 towns, numbered 0 to n+1. We build towers in towns 1 through n each with a probability of 1/2, independently. Then, we need to assign signal powers to these towers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n2. Each of the other towns (1 to n) gets exactly one signal.\n\nWe need to calculate the probability that such an assignment is possible after the towers are built. The output should be this probability modulo 998244353, expressed as x * y^{-1} mod MOD where x/y is the reduced fraction.\n\nHmm. So the key is to determine for a given set S of built towers (where S is a subset of {1, 2, ..., n}), whether there exists a way to assign signal powers p_i to each tower i in S such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nFirst, let's think about what conditions must hold for a valid assignment.\n\nEach town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. That means for each town j, there must be exactly one tower i in S such that |j - i| < p_i. Also, town 0 must not be covered: so there must be no tower i in S with |0 -i| < p_i → which implies p_i ≤ i. Similarly, town n+1 must not be covered: so for any i in S, |(n+1) -i| < p_i → p_i > (n+1 -i). But wait, since i is at most n, (n+1 -i) is at least 1. So p_i must be greater than (n+1 -i), which is not possible because p_i can be at most n. Wait, but if (n+1 -i) < p_i, then p_i must be ≥ (n+1 -i) + 1? Or is it strictly less? Wait, the condition is |c - i| < p_i. For c = n+1, that's (n+1 -i) < p_i. So p_i must be > (n+1 -i). Since p_i is an integer, p_i must be ≥ (n+1 -i + 1) → p_i ≥ (n+2 -i).\n\nBut wait, p_i can't exceed n because the maximum possible is n. So for some i, n+2 -i might be larger than n. For example, when i=1, n+2 -1 = n+1. So p_i would have to be at least n+1, but that's impossible. So in that case, it's impossible to cover town 0 or n+1 without violating their constraints.\n\nWait, but for town 0, the condition is that for any i in S, |0 -i| < p_i. So p_i must be > i. Because 0 is at position i=0, but our towers are in positions 1..n. So for each i, p_i must be > i, otherwise town 0 would be covered. So p_i must be ≥ i+1.\n\nSimilarly, for town n+1, for each i in S, |(n+1) -i| < p_i. The distance is (n+1 -i), so p_i must be > (n+1 -i). So p_i ≥ (n+1 -i) + 1 = (n+2 -i).\n\nSo putting these together, for each i in S, p_i must satisfy:\n\np_i ≥ max(i+1, n+2 -i).\n\nAdditionally, the coverage areas must exactly cover each town j from 1 to n exactly once.\n\nThis seems like a partitioning problem. Each tower's coverage interval is [i - (p_i-1), i + (p_i-1)]. These intervals must not overlap except at their endpoints, and they must cover exactly the towns 1 to n.\n\nWait, but the coverage is all towns c where |c - i| < p_i. So the coverage is (i - p_i +1) to (i + p_i -1), inclusive? No, wait, because |c -i| < p_i means c can be i-p_i +1, i-p_i +2, ..., i, ..., i+p_i -1. So yes, the coverage is the interval [i - p_i +1, i + p_i -1].\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a set of non-overlapping intervals (except possibly at endpoints) that exactly cover [1, n], with each interval centered at some i in S, and each interval's length determined by p_i, which must satisfy",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 through n, we can assign signal powers such that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, while towns 0 and n+1 are not covered at all.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once by the radio towers.\n   - Towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower's signal.\n   - The signal power of each tower must be set such that it covers a specific range of towns without overlapping with others except at their endpoints.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Each tower's signal must cover a unique segment of towns.\n   - The coverage intervals must form a partition of the towns from 1 to n without any gaps or overlaps.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - Use dynamic programming to count the valid configurations of towers and their signals.\n   - Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid ways to cover the first `i` towns.\n   - For each town `i`, consider the farthest town `j` that can be covered starting from `i`. Update `dp[j]` based on the valid configurations.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - Calculate the total number of valid configurations and divide by the total possible configurations (which is \\(2^n\\)).\n   - Use modular arithmetic to compute the result modulo 998244353.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# Precompute factorial and inverse factorial modulo MOD\nmax_n = n\nfact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n    fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n\ninv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\ninv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\nfor i in range(max_n -1, -1, -1):\n    inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n\ndef comb(a, b):\n    if a < b or b < 0:\n        return 0\n    return fact[a] * inv_fact[b] % MOD * inv_fact[a - b] % MOD\n\n# Now compute dp\ndp = [0] * (n + 2)\ndp[0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    for j in range(i, min(n, i + n)):\n        if j > n:\n            break\n        k = j - i + 1\n        if k >= 1 and (k <= n - i + 1):\n            dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[i-1]) % MOD\n\ntotal = dp[n]\n# The probability is total / 2^n\n# Compute total * inv(2^n) mod MOD\npow2 = pow(2, n, MOD)\ninv_pow2 = pow(pow2, MOD-2, MOD)\nans = total * inv_pow2 % MOD\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming Setup**: `dp[i]` tracks the number of valid ways to cover up to the `i-th` town.\n- **Combination Calculation**: Using precomputed factorials and modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations.\n- **Probability Calculation**: The result is the number of valid configurations divided by the total possible configurations, computed using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the valid configurations and compute the required probability within the constraints.",
