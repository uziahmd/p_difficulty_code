The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns arranged on a coordinate line. There are n+2 towns, numbered 0 to n+1. We build towers in towns 1 through n each with probability 1/2, independently. Then, we need to assign signal powers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n2. Each of the towns 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nThe goal is to find the probability that after building the towers, it's possible to set the signal powers correctly.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to figure out is under what configurations of built towers this is possible. Because once the configuration is fixed, we can determine whether a valid assignment exists or not.\n\nSo let's model this. For each possible subset S of {1,2,...,n}, where each element is included with probability 1/2, we need to check if there's a way to assign p_i (the power for tower i) such that:\n\n- For town 0: no signal. So any tower that could reach 0 must not be present. Wait, a tower at i can reach 0 only if i - 0 < p_i. So p_i must be less than i. But since i >=1, p_i is at least 1. So for i=1, p_1 has to be 1 because if p_1 was 2, then |0 -1| =1 <2, so 0 would receive a signal. So for any configuration, if tower 1 is built, its p must be 1, which means only town 1 is covered.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, town 0 must not receive any signal. So for any tower i, the p_i must be chosen so that |0 -i| >= p_i. Which implies that p_i <= i.\n\nSimilarly, for town n+1, any tower j has |j - (n+1)| < p_j. To avoid this, p_j must be <= (n+1 -j).\n\nWait, but wait: the towns are 0,1,...,n+1. So for a tower j, the condition is that p_j <= min(i) where i is such that j -i is as big as possible. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think that for the ends, town 0 must not be covered by any tower. So for any j, p_j must be <= j. Because |0 -j| = j, so p_j must be <=j. Otherwise, 0 would get a signal.\n\nSimilarly, for town n+1, any j must have p_j <= (n+1 -j). Because |(n+1) - j| = (n+1-j), so p_j must be <= (n+1-j).\n\nBut also, all the towns 1..n must be covered exactly once. So the coverage from the towers must form a partition of these towns.\n\nThis seems similar to tiling or covering intervals without overlaps.\n\nLet me think of the problem as arranging the towers such that their coverage ranges don't overlap and together cover exactly the towns 1..n.\n\nEach tower j can cover a range [j - (p_j -1), j + (p_j -1)]. But since p_j must be chosen such that it doesn't reach 0 or n+1, the effective range is [max(1, j - (p_j -1)), min(n, j + (p_j -1))].\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the coverage of a tower j is [j - (p_j -1), j + (p_j -1)] but clipped to [1, n], and also ensuring that 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nSo for each tower j, the maximum possible coverage is [j - (p_j -1), j + (p_j -1)], but p_j must be chosen so that j - (p_j -1) >=1 and j + (p_j -1) <=n. Or wait, no: p_j just needs to be <= j for 0 to not be covered, and p_j <= (n+1 -j) for n+1 to not be covered. So the actual coverage is [j - (p_j -1), j + (p_j -1)] intersected with [1, n]. But this must not include 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the coverage for each tower j as [a_j, b_j], where a_j = j - (p_j -1) and b_j = j + (p_j -1), but a_j >=1, b_j <=n, and a_j <=b_j.\n\nBecause p_j can vary, but must be at least 1, so the coverage can be as small as just j (if p_j=1). The larger p_j is, the more coverage.\n\nNow, for all the towers present, their coverage intervals must exactly tile the towns 1..n without overlapping. So the union of their intervals is 1..n, and they are pairwise disjoint.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding subsets S of {1, ..., n} such that when each j in S is assigned a p_j, the intervals [a_j, b_j] as defined above exactly partition 1..n.\n\nHmm, but how can we count the number of such valid subsets S? Because each subset S corresponds to a possible configuration, and for each such S, we can choose p_j's accordingly.\n\nWait, but the assignment of p_j's depends on the interval coverage. For each S, we need to see if there's a way to assign p_j's such that their intervals form a partition of 1..n.\n\nSo the question is, for a given S, does there exist a partition into intervals covered by the towers in S?\n\nI think that this is equivalent to the towers in S forming a set of non-overlapping intervals that exactly cover 1..n.\n\nSo perhaps the structure is similar to certain combinatorial structures, like tilings or domino tiling, but perhaps more general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is similar to counting the number of ways to partition the line into certain blocks, each covered by a single tower.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the concept of \"dominoes\" or intervals that cover the line without overlapping.\n\nBut how do the intervals relate to the towers?\n\nWait, each tower j in S can have a coverage interval of length 2p_j -1, centered at j. The minimal coverage is 1 (p_j=1), maximal is up to 2n-1, but constrained by the edges.\n\nBut for the coverage not to reach 0 or n+1, p_j must be <= j and p_j <= (n+1 -j). So p_j can be at most min(j, n+1-j).\n\nWait, for example, when j is near the center, the maximum p_j is j, because n+1-j might be larger.\n\nBut perhaps for a tower j to be part of a valid configuration, it must be that the coverage interval can be adjusted by choosing p_j to fit into the partition.\n\nHmm, maybe it's helpful to model this as a graph where each node represents a position, and edges represent possible transitions based on the coverage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet's consider the problem as follows: for a line of m towns, how many ways can we place towers and assign p_j's such that the coverage is correct.\n\nBut the problem here is that the presence of towers is random, but their assignments are dependent on their positions.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the valid configurations as certain binary structures, and then calculating the number of such configurations.\n\nWait, another thought: the problem requires that the coverage of the towers exactly covers the entire 1..n without overlaps, and that each town is covered exactly once.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a perfect matching in some way, but for intervals.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a tiling problem where each tile can be of varying lengths, depending on the p_j's.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as a dynamic programming problem, where dp[i] represents the number of ways to cover the first i towns.\n\nWait, but the DP state needs to account for which towers are placed and their coverage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed in terms of independent sets of towers that form a partitioning of the towns.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for patterns or examples.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nFor n=2, the output is 1/4. The valid configurations are when both 1 and 2 are built. Then, each has p=1, covering their respective town.\n\nAnother sample: n=3. The valid configurations are when all three towers are built, and each has p=1, covering exactly their town. Or when only tower 2 is built, with p=2, covering towns 1 and 3. So the total number of valid subsets is 2, each with probability 1/(2^3) = 1/8, but in the sample, the probability is 1/4. Oh wait, no: the sample says that the real answer is 1/4. So perhaps the valid configurations are when either {1,2,3} are all present, or only {2} is present.\n\nWait, but for {2} being present, p=2 covers towns 1 and 3. That leaves town 2 to be covered by itself, which is not in S. So wait, no: in that case, town 2 is not covered because S is {2}, but p_j is 2, so [1,3]. So town 2 is covered, and 1 and 3 as well. But wait, for n=3, the towns are 1,2,3. So in this case, all are covered. But town 0 and 4 are not covered, which is correct.\n\nSo for n=3, the valid S are:\n\nS={1,2,3}: assign p=1 to each, so coverage is 1, 2, 3.\n\nS={2}: assign p=2, coverage is 1,2,3.\n\nSo the total number of valid S is 2, each with probability 1/(2^3) = 1/8. So 2 * 1/8 = 1/4.\n\nSo the probability is 2 / 8 = 1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nHmm. So for n=3, the valid S are those subsets that form a partitioning of the towns via their coverage.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the number of subsets S where S is a set of non-overlapping intervals that exactly cover 1..n.\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage of each tower j in S is [j - (p_j-1), j + (p_j-1)], but p_j can be chosen to make this interval as small as 1 (if p_j=1), or larger.\n\nSo the key is that the coverage intervals must form a partition of 1..n, and each interval must be centered at some j in S.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as a way to tile the line with certain segments, each of which is centered at a tower in S.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because for each position, you can choose to place a tower that covers a single town, or a tower that covers more, but in a way that builds upon previous choices.\n\nWait, for example, in the case of n=3, the valid subsets are:\n\n- Place a tower at 2, which can cover all three towns.\n\nOr place towers at 1, 2, 3, each covering a single town.\n\nSo the number of valid subsets is 2.\n\nFor n=2, the only valid subset is {1,2}.\n\nWait, so for n=1, what happens? Well, n=1: the towns are 0,1,2.\n\nWe must build a tower at 1, else 0 and 2 won't be covered, but since n=1, 0 and 2 are the ends.\n\nIf the tower is built, then p_1 must be 1, so coverage is only 1. So yes, it's valid.\n\nSo the probability is 1/2.\n\nSo for n=1, the answer is 1/2.\n\nWait, but according to the sample outputs, when n=5, the probability is 5/32.\n\nHmm, okay, so perhaps the number of valid subsets S is f(n), and the probability is f(n) / (2^n).\n\nSo our task reduces to computing f(n), the number of valid subsets S, and then compute f(n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD, where inv is the modular inverse.\n\nSo the main problem is to compute f(n), the number of subsets S for which the coverage can be assigned to exactly cover 1..n.\n\nSo how do we compute f(n)?\n\nHmm, perhaps f(n) satisfies a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose I have a line of length m. How can I place towers to cover it?\n\nCase 1: The last town is covered by a tower placed at m. Then, the tower at m can cover only m (p=1). So before m, the rest (1..m-1) must be covered.\n\nCase 2: The last two towns m-1 and m are covered by a single tower at m-1 with p=2. So the tower at m-1 covers m-1-1+1= m-1 and m-1+1= m. So in this case, the tower at m-1 covers m-1 and m, and the rest is up to m-2.\n\nWait, but what if m-1 is covered by a tower at m-2 with p=2? Then m-2 covers m-3 and m-2, and m-1 is covered by m-1's tower.\n\nNo, perhaps I'm complicating things.\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me try to see:\n\nf(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2)\n\nWait, for example:\n\nn=1: f(1)=1 (only {1} is valid)\nn=2: f(2)=1 (only {1,2})\nn=3: f(3)=2\nn=4: Let's see.\n\nFor n=4:\n\nPossible valid subsets:\n\nOption 1: All individual towers (each covers a single town). So S = {1,2,3,4}. Valid.\n\nOption 2: Tower at 2 covers 1-2-3, but wait, p=3 would cover 0 to 4, which includes 0. So no, that's invalid. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no. If S={2}, then p_2 must be 2, which covers towns 1,2,3. But town 4 is not covered. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, maybe another option: S={1,3,4}.\n\nTower 1 covers 1, p=1.\n\nTower 3 covers 2,3 (p=2).\n\nTower 4 covers 4, p=1.\n\nSo the coverage is 1, 2-3, 4. So that works.\n\nSo this is another valid subset.\n\nSimilarly, S={2,4}:\n\nTower 2 has p=2, covering 1,2,3.\n\nTower 4 has p=1, covering 4.\n\nSo coverage is correct.\n\nSo for n=4, the valid subsets are:\n\n- {1,2,3,4}\n- {2,4}\n- {1,3,4}\n- {1,2,4}\n\nWait, wait, let me list all possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps the correct approach is to model f(n) as the number of valid subsets, and find a recurrence.\n\nWait, let's think of the problem as a tiling problem where each tile can be of size 1 or 2.\n\nBecause, for each position i, you can decide whether to place a tower that covers only i (size 1) or a tower that covers i and i+1 (size 2). Because in the case of a tower at i with p=2, it covers i and i+1.\n\nBut wait, for a tower at i, p can be 1 or more, as long as it doesn't reach beyond 0 and n+1.\n\nWait, for example, a tower at i can cover a span of 1 (p=1), 3 (p=2), etc., but only if it doesn't include 0 or n+1.\n\nBut in the case where i is near the ends, the maximum p is limited.\n\nBut perhaps the recurrence can be built assuming that for each position, the next step is to decide whether to place a single tower or a pair.\n\nWait, for n=1: 1 way.\n\nn=2: 1 way.\n\nn=3: 2 ways.\n\nn=4: Let's see.\n\nIf I think of it as f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), then:\n\nf(1)=1, f(2)=1.\n\nf(3)=f(2)+f(1)=2.\n\nf(4)=f(3)+f(2)=3.\n\nf(5)=f(4)+f(3)=5.\n\nWhich aligns with the third sample, where n=5 gives 5/32.\n\nYes! Because for n=5, f(5)=5, so 5/(2^5) =5/32.\n\nSo the pattern seems to follow the Fibonacci sequence, where f(n) is the (n)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, but let's test for n=4. According to the above, f(4)=3.\n\nWhat are the valid subsets for n=4?\n\nCase 1: All individual towers: {1,2,3,4} â†’ valid.\n\nCase 2: Towers at 2 and 4. Tower 2 covers 1,2,3; Tower 4 covers 4 â†’ valid.\n\nCase 3: Towers at 1,3,4. Tower 1 covers 1; Tower 3 covers 2,3; Tower4 covers4 â†’ valid.\n\nCase4: Towers at 2,3,4. Tower2 covers 1,2,3; Towers3 and4 cover 3 and4, but wait, that would lead to overlapping coverage. So no, that's invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way. Maybe I missed some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that f(n) = fib(n) is correct, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for n=4, according to the formula, f(4)=3.\n\nSo the valid subsets are:\n\n1. {1,2,3,4}\n2. {2,4}\n3. {1,3,4}\n4. {2,3,4}? No, because if 2 covers 1-3, and 4 covers 4, that's fine.\n\nWait, but {2,4} is one subset.\n\nAnother subset could be {1,2,4}: Tower 1 covers 1, tower2 covers 2-3, tower4 covers4. That's valid.\n\nSo for n=4, f(4)=4?\n\nBut according to the earlier idea, f(4)=3, which contradicts.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial assumption about the recurrence is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model f(n) as the number of ways to tile a line of length n, where each tile is either a single square or a domino (covering two squares).\n\nIn that case, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).\n\nWhich for n=1, f(1)=1.\n\nn=2: f(2)=2? Or 1?\n\nWait, in the tiling problem, for n=2, you can have two tiles of size 1, or one tile of size 2. So f(2) is 2.\n\nBut according to our problem for n=2, the only valid subset is {1,2}, because if any of them are missing, the coverage can't be achieved.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as f(n) being the (n)th Fibonacci number, but shifted.\n\nWait, for n=1, f(1)=1.\n\nn=2, f(2)=1.\n\nn=3, f(3)=2.\n\nn=4, f(4)=3.\n\nn=5, f(5)=5.\n\nWhich fits the Fibonacci sequence starting at f(1)=1, f(2)=1.\n\nSo f(n) = fib(n), where fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nIn that case, the number of valid subsets is equal to the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nSo for n=2, f(2)=1; for n=3, f(3)=2; for n=5, f(5)=5.\n\nThat seems to fit the samples.\n\nSo now the problem reduces to computing the nth Fibonacci number modulo 998244353, and then multiplying it by the inverse of 2^n modulo 998244353.\n\nWait, but wait: the sample for n=3, the probability is 1/4. Which is 2 / 8 = 1/4. So yes, f(3) is 2, 2/(2^3) = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for n=5, f(5) is 5, 5/(2^5) =5/32.\n\nSo the general formula is f(n) = fib(n), and the probability is fib(n) / 2^n.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute fib(n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD, where inv(2^n) is the modular inverse of 2^n modulo MOD.\n\nBut wait, for n=1, the probability is 1/2, which is 1/2. So yes, f(1)=1, 1/2^1=1/2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute fib(n), the nth Fibonacci number, where fib(1) = 1, fib(2) = 1, fib(3)=2, etc.\n\n2. Compute inv_2 = 499122177, which is the inverse of 2 modulo 998244353.\n\n3. Compute inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD).\n\n4. The result is (fib(n) * inv_2_pow_n) mod MOD.\n\nSo now, the problem is to compute fib(n) efficiently for n up to 2e5.\n\nComputing Fibonacci numbers up to 2e5 is feasible with O(n) time and O(1) space, since we can compute them iteratively.\n\nSo the steps for the code are:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Compute fib(n) using iterative approach.\n\n- Compute the modular inverse of 2^n modulo 998244353. Since 2 and MOD are coprime, we can compute the inverse using pow(2, n, MOD) and then taking the inverse, which is pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)^n mod MOD.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the inverse of 2^n is (inverse of 2)^n mod MOD.\n\nSince MOD is a prime, the inverse of 2 is 499122177, which is 2^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nSo inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nThen, inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute fib(n).\n\nCompute inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD).\n\nResult is (fib(n) * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD.\n\nSo now, let's test this approach with the samples.\n\nSample 1: n=2.\n\nfib(2) = 1.\n\ninv_2 = 499122177.\n\ninv_2_pow_2 = (499122177)^2 mod MOD.\n\nCompute 499122177^2: 499122177 * 499122177.\n\nBut 499122177 is 2^(-1) mod MOD, so 2^(-2) is (2^(-1))^2.\n\nSo 2^(-2) mod MOD is 748683265.\n\nSo 1 * 748683265 mod MOD is 748683265, which matches the sample.\n\nSample 2: n=3.\n\nfib(3) = 2.\n\ninv_2_pow_3 = (748683265)^3 mod MOD.\n\nWait, but 748683265 is 1/8 mod MOD.\n\nSo 1/8 mod MOD is 748683265.\n\nSo 2 * (1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4, which is 748683265 mod MOD.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample 3: n=5.\n\nfib(5) = 5.\n\ninv_2_pow_5 is 1/(32) mod MOD.\n\nSo 5/32 = 5 * inv(32) mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv(32): since 32 = 2^5, inv(32) = inv(2)^5 mod MOD.\n\nWhich is 748683265^5 mod MOD.\n\nBut 748683265 is 1/2 mod MOD, so 1/32 is 748683265^5.\n\nBut for the purposes of calculation, we can compute it as pow(748683265, 5, MOD).\n\nBut regardless, the code will handle it.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute fib(n) mod MOD.\n\nImplementing an iterative approach:\n\nInitialize a and b as fib(1) and fib(2), which are both 1.\n\nFor each step from 3 to n:\n\nc = (a + b) mod MOD.\n\na = b.\n\nb = c.\n\nAfter n steps, b is fib(n).\n\nSo for n=1, return 1.\n\nFor n=2, return 1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will read n, compute fib(n), compute inv_2_pow_n as pow(499122177, n, MOD), then multiply fib(n) by inv_2_pow_n modulo MOD.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about n=0? According to the problem statement, n starts from 1.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ninv_2 = (pow(2, MOD-2, MOD))  # precompute\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # compute fib(n)\n    a, b = 1, 1\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        fib = 1\n    else:\n        for _ in range(3, n+1):\n            c = (a + b) % MOD\n            a, b = b, c\n        fib = b\n    # compute inv_2^n mod MOD\n    inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD)\n    res = (fib * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\n    print(res)\n\nWait, but wait for n=1:\n\nfib is 1, inv_2_pow_1 is 499122177.\n\nSo 1 * 499122177 mod MOD is 499122177, which is 1/2, correct.\n\nSimilarly for n=2: 1 * inv_2^2 = 748683265.\n\nSo code looks correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nn=2: output 748683265.\n\nn=3: output 748683265.\n\nn=5: 5 * inv(32) mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv(32) as pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)^5 mod MOD.\n\nBut the sample expects 5 * inv(32) mod MOD to be 842268673.\n\nSo the code should compute that.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 through n, we can set their signal powers such that each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal, and towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal. The probability should be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be reduced to finding valid configurations of towers where each tower's coverage interval does not overlap with others and exactly covers the towns from 1 to n. This is similar to tiling a line segment where each tile can cover either a single town or two adjacent towns.\n\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The number of valid configurations for n towns follows the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the nth Fibonacci number gives the count of valid configurations.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result must be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently. We also need to compute modular inverses, especially for powers of 2.\n\n4. **Efficient Computation**: Using an iterative approach, we compute the nth Fibonacci number in O(n) time. We precompute the modular inverse of 2 once and then raise it to the power n to get the modular inverse of 2^n.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ninv_2 = pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Compute Fibonacci(n)\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        fib = 1\n    else:\n        a, b = 1, 1\n        for _ in range(3, n + 1):\n            c = (a + b) % MOD\n            a, b = b, c\n        fib = b\n    \n    # Compute inv(2)^n mod MOD\n    inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD)\n    \n    res = (fib * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input value n is read.\n2. **Special Cases**: If n is 0, the output is 0 as there are no towns.\n3. **Fibonacci Calculation**: For n >= 1, the nth Fibonacci number is computed iteratively.\n4. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The modular inverse of 2^n is computed using the precomputed modular inverse of 2 raised to the power n.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is the product of the Fibonacci number and the modular inverse of 2^n, taken modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required probability using properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal for large values of n.",
