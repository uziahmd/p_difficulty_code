His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where each participant has points from two tours. The teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x points. We need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have, given the possible permutations of the results.\n\nHmm. So the input gives us two lists of points: a for the first tour and b for the second. But they're in arbitrary order. Our task is to figure out what's the maximum and minimum rank Vasya can have, considering all possible pairings between a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but wait. Because the actual pairing isn't known. So for each participant, their total points are a_p + b_q, but we don't know which a corresponds to which b.\n\nSo, how do we model this? I think the approach is to consider all possible pairings of a and b, compute the sum for each participant, then sort them in descending order to get the ranks.\n\nBut since n can be up to 105, trying all possible permutations would be computationally expensive—like n! possibilities, which is way too big even for n=10. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem. Each a_i is connected to each b_j, and we choose a perfect matching such that the sum for Vasya (i,j) is >=x, and then compute the best and worst possible rankings.\n\nBut even with that, finding all possible pairings is impractical. So perhaps there's another way.\n\nLet me think differently. For any possible pairing, each participant's total is a_p + b_q. Then the ranking is determined by the sorted list of these sums. Vasya's rank is determined by how many participants have a higher sum than his.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, Vasya should have the highest possible sum. To maximize his sum, we need to pair a's and b's such that Vasya's sum is as large as possible, which would make him rank 1 or as high as possible.\n\nWait, but wait. The best possible rank for Vasya is when he is the top scorer. How do we arrange the a and b to make that happen?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best rank is determined by how much Vasya can contribute in terms of the maximum possible sum.\n\nWait, but the problem allows the jury to assign places arbitrarily when there are ties. So for the best case, we can imagine that Vasya is given the highest possible rank, which is 1. But whether that's possible depends on whether someone else can have a higher sum.\n\nWait no. If Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then he will be in the first place. Otherwise, if others have higher sums, he can't be first.\n\nSo to find the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, given the constraints.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya has a sum of at least x. So the maximum possible sum for Vasya is when he takes the maximum a_i plus the maximum b_j, provided that their sum is >=x.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the other participants also have their own a and b. So for example, suppose a has [5,3] and b has [4,6]. Then pairing 5+6=11, 3+4=7. So Vasya's sum is 11. Others' sums are 7. So he is first.\n\nAlternatively, if Vasya's a is 3 and b is 6, sum 9. Others' sums are 5+4=9. So in this case, both have 9. Then depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can be first or not.\n\nWait, but for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya is placed as high as possible. So in this case, he can be first.\n\nSo the best rank is 1 if there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x and is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible sum for Vasya is when he takes the maximum a and maximum b. Because adding those two will give the highest possible sum, but only if their sum is >=x.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Because if the maximum a is paired with some other b, and that gives a higher sum than other pairs.\n\nWait, no. The maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum a plus maximum b, because that's the largest possible sum he can have. So for the best case, Vasya can have that sum. Then, if that sum is >=x, then in the best case, he can be first.\n\nBut wait, perhaps other participants have a sum larger than that? No, because the maximum a plus maximum b is the largest possible sum any participant can have. So if Vasya's sum is equal to that, then he is tied for first place. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Suppose the maximum a is 10 and maximum b is 20. Then the sum is 30. Other participants have sums like 15, 25, etc. So Vasya's sum is 30, which is the highest. So he's first.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the best possible is 1, provided that Vasya's sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there exists i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So Vasya can have a sum that is at least x.\n\nSo for the best case, we can set Vasya's sum to the maximum possible (max_a + max_b), as long as that sum is >=x.\n\nWait, but suppose that the maximum a plus maximum b is less than x. Then Vasya's sum can't be that, but the problem states that there exists a pair with sum >=x. So in that case, the maximum sum Vasya can have is the next possible maximum.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: the problem states that it's guaranteed that there exists i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So in any case, Vasya's sum can be >=x.\n\nSo for the best case:\n\n- Find the maximum possible sum Vasya can have, which is the maximum a plus maximum b.\n\nBut wait, only if a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nIf the maximum a plus maximum b is >=x, then Vasya can take that sum, making him the first.\n\nOtherwise, perhaps we need to find the next possible maximum sum for Vasya that is >=x.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that it's guaranteed that some a_i + b_j >=x. So regardless of what, Vasya can have a sum of at least x.\n\nSo for the best case, the best possible is 1. Because Vasya can arrange to have the maximum possible sum, which makes him first.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because perhaps when you pair the max a with the max b, some other pair might have a higher sum.\n\nNo, because max_a plus max_b is the highest possible sum any participant can have. So if Vasya has that sum, he is first.\n\nSo for the best case, Vasya can be first.\n\nWait, but what about if the sum of max_a and max_b is less than x? Then, he can't achieve that sum. So he needs to choose a different a and b whose sum is >=x, but not the maximum possible. However, the problem states that it's guaranteed that some a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nSo in that case, the maximum sum Vasya can have is the maximum possible sum that is >=x. So for the best case, that sum will be as high as possible, which may or may not be the global maximum.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternative approach for the best rank:\n\nThe best possible rank is 1 if and only if there exists a way to pair a and b such that Vasya's sum is >=x and is the maximum possible among all participants.\n\nBut how can we determine that?\n\nWell, the maximum possible sum for any participant is max_a + max_b. So if Vasya can have that sum, then he is first.\n\nSo the question becomes: is there a way to pair a's and b's such that Vasya's sum is max_a + max_b and that sum is >=x.\n\nIf yes, then the best rank is 1.\n\nElse, perhaps we can find the next highest possible sum that is >=x.\n\nBut since the problem says that some a_i + b_j >=x, then it's possible for Vasya to have at least x.\n\nWait, but to have the best possible rank, perhaps Vasya's sum is the maximum possible that is >=x.\n\nSo, let's compute the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, given that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nBut perhaps that sum is the same as the maximum a plus maximum b. So in that case, Vasya can be first.\n\nSo for the best case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is 1 for both best and worst.\n\nIn that sample, all a and b are 1, so every participant has a sum of 2. So regardless of how you pair, all have 2. So Vasya can be first, or last, depending on the jury's choice.\n\nSo in that case, best is 1, worst is 5.\n\nSo perhaps the best case is always 1, but the worst case varies.\n\nWait, but in the second sample, the output is '1 5'.\n\nSo for the best case, Vasya can be first.\n\nSo perhaps the best case is always 1.\n\nBut wait, let's think of a scenario where Vasya can't have the maximum sum.\n\nSuppose a = [5, 3], b = [4,6]. So the maximum a is 5, maximum b is 6, sum is 11.\n\nNow, x is 10.\n\nSo Vasya can take 5+6=11, which is >=10. So he can be first.\n\nAnother scenario: a = [5,3], b = [4,6], x=12.\n\nThen 5+6=11 <12. So he can't take that. But 3+6=9 <12. 5+4=9 <12. 3+4=7 <12. Wait, but the problem says it's guaranteed that some a_i +b_j >=x. So in this case, x can't be 12 because 5+6=11<12, 3+6=9, 5+4=9, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says it's guaranteed that there exists i and j such that a_i +b_j >=x. So in my example, if x=12, then a and b must have a pair that sums to >=12. So in that case, perhaps the a and b arrays are different.\n\nLet me correct the example: a = [10,3], b = [5,8]. So maximum a is 10, maximum b is 8, sum 18.\n\nx=17.\n\nVasya can take 10+8=18 >=17. So he can be first.\n\nAnother example: a = [3,3], b=[4,4]. x=6.\n\nEach a +b is 7 or 8. So Vasya can have sum 8, which is maximum. So he is first.\n\nSo in all these cases, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, so perhaps the best possible rank is always 1, as long as Vasya's sum is >=x. Because he can choose the maximum possible sum, making him the top scorer.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nHmm, perhaps. Because if Vasya can have the maximum sum, then regardless of how others are paired, he will be first.\n\nSo for the best case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo for the best rank, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but wait. What if Vasya cannot have the maximum sum? Like, for example, in the sample where all a and b are 1, then the sum is 2 for everyone. So Vasya can be first or last. But according to the problem statement, the teacher needs to report the best and worst possible ranks. So the best possible is 1.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nSo for the best case, the answer is always 1.\n\nWait, but what if Vasya cannot reach the maximum sum? Because the maximum sum is achieved by someone else, but Vasya can't take that pairing.\n\nWait, but how? Because the a and b are given, but not fixed. So for the best case, Vasya can choose any possible pairing that allows him to have a sum >=x, and in such a way that his sum is as high as possible.\n\nSo to maximize his sum, he should choose the highest possible a and b.\n\nSo the best possible sum for him is max_a + max_b, provided that a_i and b_j exist such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nIf that sum is >=x, then he can be first.\n\nSo the best rank is 1.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to computing the worst possible rank.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo for the worst case, we need to find the maximum possible rank that Vasya can have, given that his sum is >=x.\n\nHow can we compute that?\n\nIdea: To minimize Vasya's rank, we need to pair the a's and b's in such a way that as many participants as possible have a sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nSo to find the worst case, we need to find the minimal possible number of participants who have a sum > Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWe need to find a pairing where Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but still >=x), and as many others as possible have sums greater than or equal to Vasya's.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and as many other participants have sums greater than Vasya's as possible.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n2. For each such pair, compute the sum s = a_i + b_j.\n\n3. Then, for each s, count how many participants have a sum > s.\n\n4. The worst possible rank is s's position in the sorted list (counting how many are above).\n\nBut since the a and b are given in arbitrary order, but the pairings are unknown, the worst case is determined by choosing a pairing that maximizes the number of participants with sum > s, where s is Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but how can we model this without knowing the pairing?\n\nAlternative approach: To find the minimal possible number of participants who have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum, given that Vasya's sum is >=x.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to model the worst case as follows:\n\nTo maximize Vasya's rank, we need to minimize the number of participants with sum > Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible a_i and b_j pair where a_i + b_j >=x, compute the number of participants that can have a sum greater than a_i + b_j.\n\nThe worst possible rank for Vasya is the maximum possible number of participants that can have a sum > a_i + b_j, over all possible a_i, b_j pairs where a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nSo the worst case is the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than Vasya's sum, for some possible pairing.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nSo for each possible a_i and b_j pair where a_i + b_j >=x, calculate the number of other participants that can have a sum > (a_i + b_j), given that the other a's and b's are optimally paired.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For each possible a_i and b_j that can be assigned to Vasya (i.e., a_i + b_j >=x), compute the minimal possible number of participants who have a sum > Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, no. Because for the worst case, we want as many participants as possible to have a sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nSo for each possible a_i and b_j (with a_i + b_j >=x), we can pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum > (a_i + b_j).\n\nThe worst case is the maximum possible of (number of participants with sum > s) across all possible s (where s is a_i + b_j >=x).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible a_i and b_j where a_i + b_j >=x, compute s = a_i + b_j.\n\n2. For each such s, compute the maximum possible number of participants who have a sum > s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\n3. The worst case is the maximum of these numbers across all possible s.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each s (which is a possible sum for Vasya), find the maximum possible number of participants that can have a sum > s.\n\nHow to compute that?\n\nFor a given s, to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > s, we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Take all a and b, excluding a_i and b_j.\n\n- Pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that as many as possible have a sum > s.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, the remaining a's and b's can be paired in any way, but their sum must be as high as possible.\n\nBut for the maximum number of participants with sum >s, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's such that as many as possible have sums >s.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each possible a_i and b_j that can be Vasya's pair:\n\n- Let s = a_i + b_j.\n\n- Now, from the remaining a's and b's, we need to pair them in a way that as many as possible have sum >s.\n\nSo for each a_k and b_l, we can pair them if a_k + b_l > s.\n\nBut how?\n\nIt's similar to a bipartite graph where edges exist between a's and b's if a + b > s.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching in this graph, which represents the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right because each a can be paired with one b, and vice versa.\n\nSo the maximum number of pairs where a + b > s is the maximum possible for the remaining a's and b's.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum bipartite matching where edges connect a and b if a + b > s.\n\nThe maximum number of such pairs is the maximum possible number of participants with sum >s.\n\nSo for each possible s (each possible a_i + b_j >=x), compute the maximum number of pairs (a, b) in the remaining a's and b's that sum to >s. That maximum is the number of participants with sum >s, thus contributing to Vasya's rank.\n\nSo the worst possible rank for Vasya is the maximum of (number of participants with sum >s) +1 (since Vasya is counted as well).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each possible a_i and b_j where a_i + b_j >=x:\n\n   a. Compute s = a_i + b_j.\n\n   b. For the remaining a's and b's, find the maximum number of pairs (a', b') where a' + b' >s.\n\n   c. The worst case for this s is (number of such pairs) +1.\n\n2. The overall worst case is the maximum of all these values across all possible s.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute for each possible (a_i, b_j) pair that can be Vasya's sum (>=x), the maximum number of other participants that can have sum >s. Add 1 to get the rank, and keep track of the maximum rank.\n\nSo the worst case is the maximum of these ranks.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently.\n\nGiven that n is up to 105, and for each of the n^2 possible (i,j) pairs, we have to process O(n^2) operations, it's manageable.\n\nBut how do we compute, for a given s, the maximum number of pairs (a', b') where a' + b' >s.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn efficient way to compute this is to model it as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSort the remaining a's and b's.\n\nLet's sort the a's in ascending order.\n\nSort the b's in ascending order.\n\nThen, for each a in a's, try to find the smallest b in b's such that a + b > s. Once a is matched to the smallest possible b that satisfies the condition, the remaining a's can be matched to larger b's.\n\nThis is similar to the classic two pointers approach used in the \"maximum pairs\" problem.\n\nWait, here's the idea:\n\nSort a's in ascending order.\n\nSort b's in ascending order.\n\nFor each a in a's, starting from the smallest, find the smallest b in b's that hasn't been used yet and satisfies a + b > s.\n\nOnce a is matched to such a b, increment the count and mark both as used.\n\nThis way, we maximize the number of pairs with a + b >s.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nSo for a given s, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the a's (excluding a_i) in ascending order.\n\n2. Sort the b's (excluding b_j) in ascending order.\n\n3. Use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum number of pairs where a + b > s.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n\nInitialize i =0 (for a's), j=0 (for b's).\n\ncount =0\n\nWhile i < len(a_sorted) and j < len(b_sorted):\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] > s:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nSo this gives the maximum possible pairs.\n\nBecause by taking the smallest a and the smallest b that can form a pair, we leave the larger a's and b's to possibly form more pairs.\n\nYes, this should correctly find the maximum number of pairs.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each possible (i, j) where a_i + b_j >=x:\n\n   s = a_i + b_j\n\n   create a list of a's excluding a_i.\n\n   create a list of b's excluding b_j.\n\n   sort the a's in ascending order.\n\n   sort the b's in ascending order.\n\n   use the two pointers approach to find the number of pairs where a + b >s.\n\n   add 1 (for Vasya) to get the rank.\n\n   keep track of the maximum rank found.\n\nThe worst case is the maximum rank across all possible (i,j) pairs.\n\nSo now, the plan is to implement this.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe'll need to loop through all possible i and j (from 0 to n-1).\n\nFor each i and j, check if a[i] + b[j] >=x.\n\nIf yes:\n\n   compute s = a[i] + b[j]\n\n   create a list of a's excluding a[i]: a_rest = a[:i] + a[i+1:]\n\n   similarly, b_rest = b[:j] + b[j+1:]\n\n   sort a_rest in ascending order.\n\n   sort b_rest in ascending order.\n\n   use two pointers to find the maximum number of pairs where a +b >s.\n\n   the number of such pairs is the count.\n\n   total_rank = count +1.\n\n   update the worst_case if total_rank is larger.\n\nOnce all (i,j) are processed, output the best (always 1) and the worst_case.\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, x=2\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo for any (i,j), a_i +b_j =2 >=x=2.\n\nSo for any i and j, s=2.\n\nThen, the a_rest has 4 elements, same with b_rest.\n\nWhen sorted, a_rest and b_rest are [1,1,1,1].\n\nUsing the two pointers approach:\n\ni=0, j=0: 1+1=2>2? No, equal. So move i to 1.\n\ni=1, j=0: 1+1=2>2? No. Move i to 2.\n\nSame until i=4, j=0: 1+1=2>2? No. So count remains 0.\n\nSo the maximum number of pairs is 0. So total_rank is 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the worst case is 5, not 1.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, in the sample, all participants have sum 2.\n\nSo when Vasya's sum is 2, all other participants also have sum 2.\n\nThus, the number of participants with sum >2 is 0. So the rank is 1 (as Vasya is first in the best case, but in the worst case, he is last, but according to our approach, the worst case is 1).\n\nBut the sample output is 1 5.\n\nSo something is wrong with my reasoning.\n\nAh, wait. The problem statement says that the sum is the sum of points. Participants with the same sum can be arranged in any order.\n\nSo in the worst case, Vasya can be last.\n\nBut according to our approach, when s=2, the number of participants with sum>2 is 0, so the worst case rank is 1.\n\nBut in reality, the worst case is 5.\n\nSo what's wrong here.\n\nAh, perhaps because the approach counts the number of participants with sum>s, but in reality, participants can have sum ==s, and thus, in the worst case, Vasya can be ranked last.\n\nSo the approach is incorrect.\n\nBecause, in the sample, all participants have sum 2, so when s=2, the number of participants with sum>s is zero, but the number of participants with sum==s is four (others), leading to Vasya being last.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the rank is based on the sum. So participants with higher sum come before those with lower.\n\nThose with equal sum can be ordered arbitrarily.\n\nSo, in the worst case, Vasya can be placed after all others with sum==s.\n\nSo the worst case is when all other participants have sum >=s.\n\nWait, no. Because if others have sum ==s, they can be placed either before or after Vasya.\n\nSo the worst case is when Vasya is placed last among all participants with sum ==s.\n\nThus, the number of participants with sum >=s is n, and in the worst case, Vasya is last among them.\n\nSo the worst case is when the number of participants with sum >=s is n, and Vasya is placed last.\n\nSo for the worst case, the rank is the number of participants with sum >=s, which is n.\n\nWait, but in the sample, when s=2, all participants have sum 2, so the number of participants with sum >=2 is 5. So Vasya's worst case is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo in our approach, for a given s, the worst case rank is the number of participants with sum >=s.\n\nWait, but how can we compute that.\n\nBecause for a given s, the number of participants with sum >=s is the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i +b_j >=s.\n\nBut since the pairing is done after excluding a_i and b_j, perhaps that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the a_rest and b_rest are the other participants, and their pairing can lead to some of them having sum >=s.\n\nBut Vasya's sum is s.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor a given s, the worst case is when as many participants as possible have sum >=s.\n\nBecause in the worst case, Vasya is placed last among all participants with sum >=s.\n\nSo for each possible s, the worst case rank is the number of participants who can have sum >=s, given the optimal pairing.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible s (all possible a_i + b_j >=x), compute the number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nThe worst case rank is that number.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each possible (i,j) where a_i +b_j >=x:\n\n   s = a_i +b_j\n\n   count = 0\n\n   for each participant k in 1..n:\n\n      if a_k + b_l > s for some l (after pairing), then count +=1\n\n   So the worst case rank is count.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the number of participants with sum >=s is the maximum possible, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nSo to find the maximum possible number of participants with sum >=s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can model this as:\n\nAfter selecting Vasya's a_i and b_j, the remaining a's and b's can be paired in a way that as many as possible of them have a sum >=s.\n\nBecause s is the sum of a_i +b_j.\n\nSo for the remaining a's and b's, we need to find the maximum number of pairs (a', b') where a' +b' >=s.\n\nThe maximum possible is the maximum number of such pairs.\n\nThus, for a given s, the number of participants with sum >=s is 1 (Vasya) + the maximum number of pairs (a', b') where a' +b' >=s.\n\nSo for each possible s, compute the maximum number of (a', b') pairs with a' +b' >=s.\n\nAdd 1 to get the total participants with sum >=s.\n\nThat is the worst case rank.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each possible (i,j) where a_i +b_j >=x:\n\n   s = a_i +b_j\n\n   create a_rest = a[0..i-1] + a[i+1..n-1]\n\n   create b_rest = b[0..j-1] + b[j+1..n-1]\n\n   sort a_rest in ascending order.\n\n   sort b_rest in ascending order.\n\n   find the maximum number of pairs (a', b') where a' +b' >=s.\n\n   total = 1 + max_pairs_count.\n\n   update the worst_case if total is larger.\n\nSo the key is to find for a_rest and b_rest, the maximum number of pairs with a' +b' >=s.\n\nThis is a standard problem, which can be solved with a two-pointer approach.\n\nLet's see how to do this.\n\nSort a_rest in ascending order.\n\nSort b_rest in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i=0, j= len(b_rest)-1.\n\ncount =0\n\nLoop:\n\nif a_rest[i] + b_rest[j] >=s:\n\n   count +=1\n\n   j -=1\n\n   i +=1\n\nelse:\n\n   i +=1\n\nContinue until i exceeds len(a_rest) or j <0.\n\nThis approach finds the maximum possible pairs.\n\nSo for each s, the number of pairs is the maximum possible.\n\nThus, the worst case rank for that s is 1 + count.\n\nSo in the sample, when s=2:\n\na_rest has 4 elements of 1, b_rest has 4 elements of 1.\n\nWe try to pair them:\n\ni=0, j=3: 1+1=2 >=2: yes. count=1, i=1, j=2.\n\ni=1, j=2: 1+1=2 >=2: yes. count=2, i=2, j=1.\n\ni=2, j=1: 1+1=2 >=2: yes. count=3, i=3, j=0.\n\ni=3, j=0: 1+1=2 >=2: yes. count=4.\n\nSo total is 1+4=5, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nCompute for each possible (i,j) where a_i +b_j >=x:\n\n   s = a_i +b_j\n\n   a_rest = a without a_i\n\n   b_rest = b without b_j\n\n   sort a_rest in ascending order\n\n   sort b_rest in ascending order\n\n   find the maximum number of pairs (a', b') in a_rest and b_rest where a' + b' >=s.\n\n   total = 1 + max_pairs_count.\n\n   update worst_case if total is larger.\n\nThus, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead a and b as lists.\n\nbest_rank =1.\n\nworst_rank =1.\n\nmax_worst =1.\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   for j in range(n):\n\n       if a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n           s = a[i] +b[j]\n\n           #

So overall, O(n^3 log n). For n=105, 105^3 is 1.16e6, multiplied by log n, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize by pre-sorting a and b, and for each (i,j), subtract a[i] and b[j], then process the rest.\n\nAlternatively, for each (i,j), we can collect the a_rest as a list, but without a[i], and same for b_rest.\n\nBut the current approach is straightforward.\n\nTesting this approach on the sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nFor each (i,j), a[i]+b[j] =2 >=x=2.\n\nSo for each (i,j), s=2.\n\na_rest has 4 ones, same for b_rest.\n\nAfter sorting, a_rest is [1,1,1,1], same for b_rest.\n\nThen, in the while loop:\n\ni_ptr=0, j_ptr=3: 1+1=2 >=2: count=1, i_ptr=1, j_ptr=2.\n\ni_ptr=1, j_ptr=2: 1+1=2 >=2: count=2, i_ptr=2, j_ptr=1.\n\ni_ptr=2, j_ptr=1: 1+1=2 >=2: count=3, i_ptr=3, j_ptr=0.\n\ni_ptr=3, j_ptr=0: 1+1=2 >=2: count=4, i_ptr=4, j_ptr=-1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\ncount is 4.\n\ntotal =4+1=5.\n\nSo for each (i,j), the worst case is 5.\n\nSo the worst_rank is 5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\nWait, the sample output is 1 5.\n\nWait, but according to our code, for each possible (i,j) where a_i +b_j >=x=2, compute s and the worst case.\n\nIn this case, the a is [1,1,1,1,1], and b is [4,3,5,6,4,4].\n\nWait, no, wait: the second line is '6 7' and third line is '4 3 5 6 4 4'?\n\nWait, wait, the input is:\n\nSecond line is a1 a2 ... an: 5 numbers.\n\nThird line is b1 ... bn: 6 numbers.\n\nWait, wait, but the first sample's input is:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the second sample, the input is:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n6 7\n\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given in arbitrary order, and we need to consider all possible pairings of these results to find the optimal ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best possible rank for Vasya is always 1. This is because if Vasya can achieve the maximum possible sum of points from the two tours, he will be placed first by the jury, regardless of other participants' sums.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to consider all possible pairings of the points from the two tours such that Vasya's total points are at least `x`. For each valid pairing, we calculate how many other participants can have a higher or equal total points than Vasya. The worst case rank is determined by the scenario where Vasya ends up last among participants with the same or higher total points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmax_worst = 1\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if a[i] + b[j] >= x:\n            s = a[i] + b[j]\n            a_rest = []\n            for k in range(n):\n                if k != i:\n                    a_rest.append(a[k])\n            b_rest = []\n            for k in range(n):\n                if k != j:\n                    b_rest.append(b[k])\n            a_rest.sort()\n            b_rest.sort()\n            \n            count = 0\n            i_ptr = 0\n            j_ptr = len(b_rest) - 1\n            while i_ptr < len(a_rest) and j_ptr >= 0:\n                if a_rest[i_ptr] + b_rest[j_ptr] >= s:\n                    count += 1\n                    i_ptr += 1\n                    j_ptr -= 1\n                else:\n                    i_ptr += 1\n            total = count + 1\n            if total > max_worst:\n                max_worst = total\n\nprint(\"1\", max_worst)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of participants `n` and the minimum points `x` that Vasya must have. It then reads the points from the two tours into lists `a` and `b`.\n\n2. **Iterating Over Possible Pairs**: For each possible pair `(i, j)` where the sum of `a[i]` and `b[j]` is at least `x`, we consider this as Vasya's score `s`.\n\n3. **Creating Remaining Lists**: We create lists `a_rest` and `b_rest` excluding the current `a[i]` and `b[j]` respectively.\n\n4. **Sorting**: The remaining points are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing checks.\n\n5. **Finding Maximum Pairs**: Using a two-pointer technique, we find the maximum number of pairs in `a_rest` and `b_rest` where the sum is at least `s`. This count helps determine how many participants can have a higher or equal score than Vasya.\n\n6. **Updating Worst Case**: The worst possible rank is updated based on the maximum number of participants who can have a higher or equal score than Vasya for each valid pairing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute both the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, considering all valid configurations of the tour results.",
