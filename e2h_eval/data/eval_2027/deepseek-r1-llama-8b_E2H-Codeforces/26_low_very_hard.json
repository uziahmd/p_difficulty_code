Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, z. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is: Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. The triangle is non-degenerate if x + y > z.\n\nHmm, so the conditions are:\n\n1. x is between A and B (inclusive)\n2. y is between B and C (inclusive), but also y >= x because x ≤ B ≤ y.\n3. z is between C and D (inclusive), but also z >= y because y ≤ C ≤ z.\n4. Also, x + y > z for the triangle to be valid.\n\nWait, but wait—since z is at least y, the triangle condition x + y > z must hold. So for each possible triplet (x, y, z) in the allowed ranges, we need to check if x + y > z.\n\nBut directly iterating through all possible x, y, z would be too slow because A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, which makes the triple loop O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1)) way too big. That's not feasible.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's note that for fixed x and y, z must satisfy two conditions:\n\n- z ≥ max(y, (x + y - 1)/2 + 1) → because z must be ≥ y and x + y > z → z < x + y → since z is an integer, the maximum z can be is x + y - 1. But wait, no: since z ≥ y, so z must be at least the maximum of y and something else.\n\nWait, more precisely, the triangle condition is x + y > z. Since z is an integer, the maximum possible z is x + y - 1. But also, z must be at least y because of the constraints.\n\nSo for a given x and y, z can range from max(y, (x+y-1)/something?) Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nz must be ≥ y (from the constraints) and also z < x + y. Since z is an integer, the maximum z can be is x + y - 1. But also, since z must be ≥ y, the lower bound for z is y, and the upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo for each x and y, the number of possible z is the number of integers between max(y, (x + y - 1) ? No, wait, z needs to be less than x + y, so z can be up to x + y -1. But also, z can't exceed D. So the upper limit is min(D, x + y - 1). And the lower limit is C (since z must be ≥ C), but wait no: z is between C and D. Oh right, z must be ≥ C. So the lower limit is max(C, y), but since y is ≤ C, because y is between B and C, then max(C, y) is C. Because y can be as high as C, so z starts from C.\n\nWait, no: the constraints are z must be ≥ C and z must be ≥ y. Since y can be up to C (because B ≤ y ≤ C), then z must be ≥ y, which is already ≥ C. Or wait, y is between B and C, so y could be equal to C. So when y is C, then z must be ≥ C. When y is less than C, then z must be ≥ y, but since y ≤ C, then z can be as low as y. Wait no: no, because z is constrained to be ≥ C regardless of y. Because z is between C and D.\n\nWait, no: looking back, the constraints on z are C ≤ z ≤ D. So z has to be at least C, regardless of y.\n\nWait, no: the original constraints were A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D. So yes, z is between C and D. So for any x and y, z must be ≥ C, and also ≥ y (since y is ≤ C, but wait, y is ≤ C, so C is ≥ y. So z must be ≥ C. Because C is the maximum possible value for y.\n\nWait, no: for example, if y is 3 and C is 5, then z must be ≥ 5, which is larger than y. So in that case, z",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\) holds. A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, specifically \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the constraints on \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), we can break down the problem into manageable parts:\n   - \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).\n   - \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\).\n   - \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\).\n   \n2. **Triangle Inequality**: For a valid triangle, \\(x + y > z\\) must hold. Since \\(z\\) must be at least \\(C\\) and at most \\(D\\), we need to find the range of \\(z\\) for each valid pair \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n3. **Efficient Counting**: Instead of iterating through all possible triplets, we can iterate over \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and compute the valid range for \\(z\\) efficiently.

For each pair \\((x, y)\\), it calculates the valid range for \\(z\\) based on the triangle inequality condition \\(x + y > z\\). By counting the integers within this range, the solution accumulates the total number of valid triangles without explicitly iterating over all possible triplets, ensuring efficiency even for large input sizes.",
