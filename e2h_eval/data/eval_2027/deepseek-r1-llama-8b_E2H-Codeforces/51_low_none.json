Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the guest's and host's names, their letters should exactly match the pile, with no extra letters and no missing ones.\n\nHmm, right. So, the input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile. I need to check if combining the first two gives exactly the same letters as the third.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to process each string into a collection of letters, counting the frequency of each letter. Because the order doesn't matter—what matters is the count of each character.\n\nSo, for each of the three strings (guest, host, pile), I can create a frequency dictionary. Then, the sum of the frequencies from guest and host should equal those from the pile.\n\nWait, but in what way? Oh right, because the total letters in guest + host should be exactly equal to the pile. So, the combined frequency of all letters in guest and host must match the frequency in the pile.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. For each line, create a frequency count of each character.\n3. Check if the sum of guest and host's frequencies equals the pile's frequencies.\n4. If yes, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the sum? Well, for each character in guest and host, add their counts. Then compare with the pile's counts.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, thinking about how to implement this in Python.\n\nI can use the collections.Counter class from the collections module. It can count the occurrences of each character in a string.\n\nSo, for example, Counter(\"SANTACLAUS\") will give me a dictionary-like object where each key is a character and the value is its count.\n\nThen, I can compute the sum of the guest and host Counters by adding them together.\n\nOnce I have the combined Counter, I can compare it to the pile's Counter. If they are equal, then output YES; else NO.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the three lines. Let's call them guest, host, pile.\n- Create counter_g = Counter(guest)\n- Create counter_h = Counter(host)\n- combined = counter_g + counter_h (since adding Counters adds their counts)\n- Create counter_p = Counter(pile)\n- Compare combined == counter_p. If yes, print YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the order of operations? Like, sometimes, the sum might have more letters than the pile or vice versa. But the Counter's __eq__ method correctly checks whether all counts are equal.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nFor example, empty strings? But the problem statement says each line is not empty. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: all letters are the same. Like guest is 'A', host is 'A', pile is 'AA'—should return YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'A', host is 'B', pile is 'AB'—yes. Pile is 'BA'—also yes.\n\nWhat if the guest is longer than the combined pile? Or the pile is longer? Well, the Counter comparison would catch that, because the counts would differ.\n\nSo, let's outline the code.\n\nFirst, import Counter from collections.\n\nRead the three lines. Note that in the sample input, the input is given as ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]. So, each line is read as a single string, stripping any newlines.\n\nWait, in Python, reading via input() may include a trailing newline. So perhaps better to read each line using input().strip() to remove leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, compute the counters.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people might forget to strip, but the problem says each line is not empty. So, maybe just using input().strip() is safe.\n\nSo, counter_g = Counter(guest)\ncounter_h = Counter(host)\ncombined = counter_g + counter_h\ncounter_p = Counter(pile)\n\nif combined == counter_p:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\nWait, no—the actual input is three lines, each line being the guest, host, pile.\n\nSo, for the first sample, guest is SANTACLAUS, host is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given pile of letters can be used to exactly form the names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the combined letters of the guest's and host's names match exactly with the letters in the pile, considering both the frequency and the count of each letter.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Count Frequencies**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each letter in the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n3. **Combine Frequencies**: Sum the frequencies of the guest's and host's names to get a combined frequency counter.\n4. **Compare Frequencies**: Check if the combined frequency counter matches the frequency counter of the pile. If they match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately check for both the presence and absence of each letter in the correct quantities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncounter_g = Counter(guest)\ncounter_h = Counter(host)\ncombined = counter_g + counter_h\ncounter_p = Counter(pile)\n\nprint(\"YES\" if combined == counter_p else \"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as three separate strings, each representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters respectively.\n2. **Frequency Counting**: Using `collections.Counter`, we convert each string into a dictionary where keys are characters and values are their counts.\n3. **Combining Frequencies**: The combined frequency counter is created by adding the guest's and host's counters.\n4. **Comparison**: The combined counter is compared against the pile's counter. If they are equal, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names exactly, so we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
