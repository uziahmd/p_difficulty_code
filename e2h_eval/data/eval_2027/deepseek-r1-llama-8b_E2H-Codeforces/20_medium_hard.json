    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about binary strings and choosing certain values for each string such that a multiset of these strings is 'beautiful'. And we need to count the number of ways to choose these c_s values so that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nWe are given n, k, f. We consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to n. For each such string s, we choose c_s from 0 to k. Then, the multiset is beautiful if for every string s (of any length), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. \n\nWait, but the multiset itself is of strings of length exactly n. So when considering s of length less than n, their prefixes would be longer strings. Wait no—no, wait, the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So for example, if s is \"0\", then any string in the multiset that starts with \"0\" will contribute to s's count. Because for s being a prefix, the strings in the multiset must have s as a prefix. So if the multiset contains \"00\", \"01\", etc., they all start with \"0\".\n\nSo for each string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut wait, the multiset is of length exactly n. So for a string s of length m < n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts for all strings t in the multiset where t starts with s.\n\nWait no: Each string in the multiset is of length exactly n. So for s of length m, the count is how many of these n-length strings have s as a prefix. For example, if s is \"0\", then all n-length strings starting with 0 will contribute. The count is the number of such strings in the multiset.\n\nSo for each s, c_s must be ≥ the number of n-length strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So the constraints on c_s are that for each s, the count of n-length strings in the multiset that start with s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nOur goal is to choose c_s for all s (each from 0 to k) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to count the number of such choices.\n\nHmm. So how do we model this?\n\nI think the key is to model this as a combinatorial problem where for each possible subset of strings, we compute whether it's beautiful, but since n can be up to 15, which is manageable with bitmask-like approaches, perhaps.\n\nWait, but 2^15 is 32768, which is manageable for some steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a tree structure. Each node represents a prefix, and the edges represent adding a bit (0 or 1). Then, the count for each node is how many times its corresponding string appears in the multiset. The constraints are that for each node s, the sum of all descendants (including itself) in the tree cannot exceed c_s.\n\nBut the c_s values are variables we can set, and we want the maximum possible multiset size (i.e., sum of all counts for leaves of the tree) to be exactly f. So for each possible way of setting the c_s's, the maximum size is determined by how tight the constraints are.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible size is determined by the minimal c_s along each path. Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps the maximum size is constrained by the minimum possible sum based on the c_s's.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For the multiset to be as large as possible, each c_s must be as large as possible. So for each string s, the number of times s can appear in the multiset is limited by c_s minus the sum of the counts of all its proper prefixes. Because any string t that is a proper prefix of s would also be a prefix of s.\n\nWait, no. Because for a string s of length m, any string t that is a proper prefix of s (i.e., t is a prefix of s but not equal to s) will have s as one of their possible extensions. So the count for s contributes to all of its prefixes. So the constraints are that for each s, the count of s in the multiset (call it x_s) plus the sum of x_t for all t that are proper supersets of s (but wait, no—proper supersets? No, because s is a prefix of t. So t is a longer string, and s is a prefix of t. So for s, the count x_s contributes to all of its prefixes. So for s, the sum over all t that are proper supersets of s (i.e., s is a prefix of t) of x_t must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of x_t for all t that are s followed by any bits. So for example, if s is \"0\", then any string starting with \"0\" in the multiset (like \"00\", \"01\", etc.) contributes to this count. So for s = \"0\", the sum of x_{00}, x_{01}, x_{10}, x_{11} ... up to length n must be ≤ c_0.\n\nBut for s of length m, the sum is x_{s followed by 0} + x_{s followed by 1} + ... + x_{s followed by whatever to make length n}.\n\nSo for each s, the constraint is:\n\nsum_{t is a superstring of s} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nBut since the multiset is of exactly length n, the x_t's are the counts of each n-length string. So for s of length m < n, the x_t's are the counts of strings that have s as a prefix.\n\nSo the constraints are for each s:\n\nsum_{t is a superstring of s} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the goal is to maximize the total size of the multiset, which is the sum of x_t for all t of length n.\n\nWe need to choose c_s's such that the maximum possible size is exactly f.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s's (each between 0 and k) such that the maximum possible sum is f.\n\nHmm. Now, how can we model this?\n\nI think dynamic programming might be useful here. But the state would need to capture the current constraints and how they affect the maximum possible sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a tree where each node is a string, and the edges are adding a 0 or 1. Then, the constraints form a system where for each node, the sum of its children (plus itself if it's a leaf) is bounded by c_s.\n\nWait, but in this case, each leaf in the tree (each n-length string) has x_t as the count. So for a non-leaf node s (which is a prefix of some leaves), the sum of x_t for all its children (the leaves that start with s) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for node s, the sum includes all its descendants. So for a node s of length m, the sum is x_{s0}, x_{s1}, ..., x_{s followed by any bits to reach n}.\n\nSo, for the root (empty string), the sum is all x_t's, which must be ≤ c_{empty}. But wait, the empty string isn't considered in our problem because s ranges from length 1 to n. So maybe the root is not part of the constraints.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, s is any binary string of length from 1 to n. So the empty string is not included. So the constraints are for all s of length 1..n.\n\nEach s has a certain number of children in the trie. For example, s could be \"0\", which has two children: \"00\", \"01\", etc., depending on n.\n\nWait, but for n=2, \"0\" has two children: \"00\" and \"01\". So the sum of x_{00} and x_{01} must be ≤ c_0.\n\nSimilarly, for s = \"00\", it has only one child: \"000\" if n>2, but for n=2, it has none. So for s=\"00\" and n=2, the sum is just x_{00}, which must be ≤ c_{00}.\n\nSo the constraints form a hierarchical structure where each s's c_s must be at least the sum of its children's x_t's.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign c_s's such that for all s, sum_{children of s} x_t ≤ c_s. Then, the total x's is the sum of all x_t's, which is to be maximized.\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose c_s's (each between 0 and k) such that the maximum possible total is exactly f.\n\nWait, but the c_s's are what we choose, not the x_t's. So for a given set of c_s's, the maximum possible total is the maximum sum of x_t's that satisfy all the constraints. So the problem is to choose c_s's such that this maximum is exactly f.\n\nSo the approach is: for each possible way of assigning c_s's (each between 0 and k), compute the maximum possible size of the multiset under those c_s's, and count how many such assignments result in the maximum being exactly f.\n\nBut since n can be up to 15, which implies 2^15 -1 strings, which is 32767, and k can be up to 2e5, enumerating all possible c_s's is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the constraints.\n\nThe maximum possible size is determined by the constraints imposed by the c_s's. For each s, the sum of x_t's for its children (including itself if it's a leaf) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThis forms a system of inequalities:\n\nFor each s, sum_{t ∈ children(s)} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nThe objective is to maximize sum x_t.\n\nSo the maximum is achieved when for each s, the sum equals c_s. Because increasing any x_t would allow us to increase the total sum, but subject to the constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because each x_t is part of multiple constraints. For example, x_{00} is part of the constraints for \"0\", \"00\", etc.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: x_t is the count for the specific string t. For each s that is a prefix of t, x_t contributes to the sum for s.\n\nSo, for each s, the sum of x_t for all t that start with s (i.e., are in the subtree of s) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nTo maximize the total sum, we should set each sum as high as possible, i.e., equal to c_s.\n\nBut this is only possible if the system allows it. So the maximum sum is the sum over all x_t, which is the sum of all x_t for t of length n.\n\nBut the constraints are that for each s, sum_{t is s followed by any bits} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nSo the maximum sum is the minimum, over all possible s, of (c_s minus the sum of x_t for the ancestors of s). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum sum is determined by the tightest constraint in the system. But how?\n\nHmm. Perhaps the maximum possible sum is the minimum, for each s, of (c_s) multiplied by the product of 2^{n - |s|} }, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the minimum over s of (c_s * 2^{n - |s|}), but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, let's think of the root s being the empty string (though it's not considered in our problem). For the empty string, the sum of all x_t's is the total sum. So c_{empty} must be >= the total sum. But since the empty string isn't part of the problem, perhaps that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, but the empty string is not part of the problem because s starts from length 1. So the constraints for the problem are for s of length 1..n.\n\nEach s of length m has 2^{n-m} possible extensions. So for each s, the maximum possible sum of x_t's for its children is c_s.\n\nSo, for the maximum sum, we can think recursively. The maximum sum is the sum of x_t's, which is the sum for all s of the maximum possible x_t's under the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the minimum over all s of (c_s * 2^{n - |s|} ), but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the sum of x_t for its children.\n\nWait, no. Let's think for a simple case.\n\nTake n=1. There are two possible strings: \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nEach c_0 and c_1 must be ≥ the number of times \"0\" and \"1\" are present, respectively.\n\nSo for n=1, the maximum sum is min(c_0, a) + min(c_1, b), where a and b are the counts for \"0\" and \"1\". But to maximize the sum, a can be up to c_0 and b up to c_1.\n\nSo the maximum sum is c_0 + c_1.\n\nBut wait, in this case, each string is a leaf. So for s=\"0\", sum x_t is x_{0}, which must be ≤ c_0. Similarly for s=\"1\", x_1 ≤ c_1. So the maximum sum is x_0 + x_1, which is up to min(c_0, x_0) + min(c_1, x_1).\n\nWait, no. Because x_0 can be up to c_0, and x_1 can be up to c_1. So the maximum sum is c_0 + c_1.\n\nAh, right. So for n=1, the maximum sum is c_0 + c_1.\n\nIn this case, the maximum is simply the sum of c_s's for s of length 1.\n\nWhat about n=2?\n\nConsider s=\"0\", which has two children: \"00\" and \"01\". The sum x_{00} + x_{01} ≤ c_0.\n\nSimilarly, s=\"1\" has two children: \"10\" and \"11\", sum x_{10} + x_{11} ≤ c_1.\n\nAdditionally, s=\"00\" has no children, so x_{00} ≤ c_{00}.\n\nSame for \"01\", \"10\", \"11\".\n\nSo the maximum sum is x_{00} + x_{01} + x_{10} + x_{11}.\n\nBut the constraints are:\n\nx_{00} ≤ c_{00}\nx_{01} ≤ c_{01}\nx_{10} ≤ c_{10}\nx_{11} ≤ c_{11}\nx_{00} + x_{01} ≤ c_0\nx_{10} + x_{11} ≤ c_1\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible sum S = x_{00} + x_{01} + x_{10} + x_{11}.\n\nSubject to all the above constraints.\n\nHow can we find the maximum S in terms of the c_s's?\n\nWell, S is the sum of all four x's. Let's express S as:\n\nS = (x_{00} + x_{01}) ) + (x_{10} + x_{11}) ) = c_0' + c_1', where c_0' is min(c_0, x_{00}+x_{01}) and c_1' is min(c_1, x_{10}+x_{11}).\n\nBut since x_{00} <= c_{00}, x_{01} <= c_{01}, x_{10} <= c_{10}, x_{11} <= c_{11}, the maximum possible S is:\n\nmin( c_0 + c_1, c_0 + c_{01}, c_0 + c_{00}, c_1 + c_{10}, c_1 + c_{11}, c_{00} + c_{01} + c_{10} + c_{11} } )\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum S is the minimum of (c_0 + c_1, c_0, c_1, c_{00} + c_{01}, c_{10} + c_{11} ).\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S is the minimum of the following:\n\nc_0 + c_1,\nc_0 + (c_{01} + c_{00}),\nc_1 + (c_{10} + c_{11}),\nc_{00} + c_{01} + c_{10} + c_{11},\nand each individual c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible S is the minimum of (c_0 + c_1, c_0 + c_1, c_0, c_1, c_{00} + c_{01}, c_{10} + c_{11}, c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10}, c_{11} ). But that feels wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum S is the minimum of (c_0 + c_1, c_0, c_1, c_{00} + c_{01}, c_{10} + c_{11} ). Because:\n\n- c_0 is the maximum of x_{00} + x_{01}, which is part of S.\n- c_1 is the maximum of x_{10} + x_{11}, which is part of S.\n- So S can't exceed c_0 + c_1.\n- Also, each x_{00} can't exceed c_{00}, x_{01} can't exceed c_{01}, etc. So the sum S can't exceed the sum of all c's for the individual x's, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum S is the minimum of all the c_s's multiplied by their respective 2^{n - |s|}.\n\nWait, for n=1, each s is of length 1, and 2^{1 - 1} is 1. So for each s, c_s * 1. Summing them gives the maximum S, which aligns with the earlier observation.\n\nFor n=2, each s of length 1 has 2^{2-1} = 2 possible x's. So for s of length 1, the maximum contribution is c_s * 2. For s of length 2, it's c_s * 1.\n\nSo the maximum S would be the minimum of (c_0 * 2, c_1 * 2, c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10}, c_{11}).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem to fit the earlier n=2 case.\n\nWait, let's take an example from the problem statement.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nThe output is 3.\n\nThe explanation says that the possible c_0 and c_1 assignments are:\n\n1. c_0=0, c_1=2: the multiset can have two \"1\"s. So the maximum S is 2.\n\n2. c_0=1, c_1=1: multiset can have \"0\" and \"1\", S=2.\n\n3. c_0=2, c_1=0: multiset can have two \"0\"s, S=2.\n\nSo for n=1, the maximum S is c_0 + c_1.\n\nIn this case, to have S=2, we need c_0 + c_1 = 2.\n\nBut in the sample, the allowed c_0 and c_1 are such that their sum is exactly 2.\n\nSo the number of pairs (c_0, c_1) where c_0 + c_1 = 2, and each c_i is between 0 and 42.\n\nPossible options:\n\nc_0=0, c_1=2 → valid.\n\nc_0=1, c_1=1 → valid.\n\nc_0=2, c_1=0 → valid.\n\nThese are three options, which matches the sample.\n\nSo for n=1, the maximum S is c_0 + c_1.\n\nWhich fits with the idea that for each s of length 1, the maximum contribution is c_s multiplied by 2^{n - |s|} = 1, so sum is c_0 * 1 + c_1 * 1.\n\nSo perhaps the general formula for the maximum S is the minimum of c_s multiplied by 2^{n - |s|}, for all s of length 1..n.\n\nYes! That makes sense.\n\nBecause for each s of length m, the maximum number of strings that can have s as a prefix is 2^{n - m}. Because each such string is s followed by any combination of 0s and 1s until length n.\n\nSo the maximum x_{s followed by any bits} is c_s.\n\nThus, for each s, the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree rooted at s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible sum S is the minimum, over all s of length 1..n, of (c_s × 2^{n - |s|}).\n\nBecause for each s, the sum of x_t's in its subtree can't exceed c_s × 2^{n - |s|}.\n\nSo S_max = min_{s} (c_s × 2^{n - |s|}).\n\nAnd our goal is to choose c_s's such that S_max is exactly f.\n\nWait, but wait: S is the sum of x_t's, which are the counts of the n-length strings. So S is the sum of x_t's for all t in the multiset.\n\nBut each x_t is constrained by the c_s's for all s that are prefixes of t.\n\nSo the maximum sum is indeed the minimum of (c_s × 2^{n - |s|}) across all s of length 1..n.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of assignments of c_s's (each between 0 and k) such that the minimum of (c_s × 2^{n - |s|}) is exactly f.\n\nBut wait, because the minimum is taken over all s, including those longer than others. So for s of longer length, 2^{n - |s|} is smaller. So the minimum is more likely to be determined by the longer s.\n\nFor example, for n=2, the s's of length 2 contribute c_s × 1, while s's of length 1 contribute c_s × 2. So the minimum will likely come from the s's of length 2.\n\nBut not necessarily. It depends on their c_s values.\n\nSo, the problem now is to count the number of ways to assign c_s's (each 0<=c_s<=k) such that the minimum of (c_s × 2^{n - |s|}) for all s of length 1..n is exactly f.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can model this as follows: for each s, let d_s = c_s × 2^{n - |s|}. We need the minimum of all d_s to be exactly f.\n\nSo, for each s, d_s >= f, except for at least one s where d_s = f.\n\nWait, no. Because the minimum is f, which means that for at least one s, d_s = f, and for all s, d_s >= f.\n\nSo, the condition is:\n\n- For all s, d_s >= f.\n\n- There exists at least one s where d_s = f.\n\nBut since d_s = c_s × 2^{n - |s|}, and c_s can be up to k, we need:\n\nc_s ≥ ceil(f / 2^{n - |s|} ), for all s.\n\nBut wait, for each s, c_s must be chosen such that c_s × 2^{n - |s|} ≥ f, except for at least one s where c_s × 2^{n - |s|} = f.\n\nWait, but this is not correct. Because the minimum of all d_s's is f, which implies that for all s, d_s >= f, and at least one s has d_s = f.\n\nSo, for each s, c_s must be >= f / (2^{n - |s|} ), but since c_s is an integer, c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - |s|})) ?\n\nWait, no. Because d_s is c_s multiplied by 2^{...}, which could be a fractional value if c_s is not chosen as an integer.\n\nWait, no. c_s is an integer between 0 and k, inclusive. So for each s, d_s = c_s × 2^{n - |s|} must be at least f, except for at least one s where it's exactly f.\n\nWait, no. Because the minimum is f, so all d_s's must be >=f, and at least one must be exactly f.\n\nSo, for each s, c_s must be >= floor( (f) / (2^{n - |s|}) ) ? Or is it ceiling?\n\nWait, no. Because d_s is c_s × 2^{n - |s|} >= f.\n\nSo, c_s >= f / (2^{n - |s|}).\n\nSince c_s is an integer, c_s must be >= ceil( f / (2^{n - |s|}) ), unless f is zero, but since f can be up to 2e5, that's unlikely.\n\nWait, no. For example, if f is 3 and 2^{n - |s|} is 2, then c_s must be >= 2 (since 2*2=4 >=3), but 1*2=2 <3, so c_s must be >=2.\n\nSo, yes, for each s, c_s must be >= ceil( f / (2^{n - |s|} )).\n\nBut wait, if f is zero, then all c_s's can be zero. But in that case, the maximum S would be zero, but f is given as positive in the sample inputs.\n\nWait, but f can be zero. But according to the problem statement, f is given as 1 ≤ f ≤ 2e5. So f is at least 1.\n\nSo, for each s, c_s must be >= ceil( f / (2^{n - |s|} )).\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because c_s can be anything as long as c_s × 2^{n - |s|} >=f.\n\nSo, c_s can be any integer >= ceil( f / (2^{n - |s|} )).\n\nBut for some s, 2^{n - |s|} could be larger than f, so c_s can be zero, but that would make d_s =0, which is less than f, which is invalid. So for all s, c_s must be >= ceil(f / (2^{n - |s|} )).\n\nWait, no. Because for the minimum d_s to be f, all d_s must be >= f, and at least one must be exactly f.\n\nSo, for each s, c_s × 2^{n - |s|} >= f.\n\nSo, c_s >= ceil( f / (2^{n - |s|} ) ), but since c_s is an integer.\n\nBut wait, 2^{n - |s|} could be larger than f, so f/(2^{n - |s|}) could be less than 1. So, in that case, c_s can be 0 or more, but 0 × something is zero, which is less than f. So that's not allowed.\n\nThus, for all s, c_s must be >= ceil( f / (2^{n - |s|} ) ), but since c_s can't be less than that, otherwise d_s would be less than f, making the minimum less than f.\n\nThus, the constraints are:\n\nFor each s, c_s >= ceil( f / (2^{n - |s|} ) )\n\nAnd for at least one s, c_s × 2^{n - |s|} = f.\n\nWait, no. Because the minimum d_s is f. So, for all s, d_s >= f, and at least one s has d_s = f.\n\nSo, the steps to compute the number of valid c_s assignments are:\n\n1. For each s of length m (1 <= m <=n), compute the required minimum c_s: c_s_min = ceil( f / (2^{n - m} ) )\n\n   But wait, since 2^{n -m} can be very large, perhaps larger than f, which would make c_s_min = 1 if f is positive.\n\n   Wait, for example, if n=15, m=15, 2^{0}=1. So c_s_min = f.\n\n   If m=14, 2^{1}=2. So c_s_min = ceil(f/2).\n\n   For m=13, 2^2=4, c_s_min = ceil(f/4), etc.\n\n2. For each s, c_s must be >= c_s_min.\n\n   Additionally, for each s, c_s can be up to k.\n\n   So, for each s, the allowed c_s is in [c_s_min, k].\n\n   But, for some s, if c_s_min > k, then there's no solution for that s. So the entire assignment is invalid.\n\n3. After ensuring that for all s, c_s_min <= k, we need to count the number of assignments where for at least one s, c_s × 2^{n - m} = f.\n\nBecause the minimum of all d_s's is exactly f, not higher.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute c_s_min for each s.\n\n- Check that for all s, c_s_min <= k. Otherwise, the answer is zero.\n\n- Then, for the valid c_s_min assignments, find the number of ways to assign c_s's such that at least one s has c_s × 2^{n - m} == f.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, because the condition is that the minimum d_s is exactly f. So all d_s's are >=f, and at least one is exactly f.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each s, compute c_s_min = ceil( f / (2^{n - m} ) )\n\n- For each s, c_s can be >= c_s_min and <=k.\n\nBut for some s, c_s_min may be greater than k, which would make the assignment impossible. So in that case, the answer is zero.\n\nOnce all c_s_min <=k, proceed.\n\nThen, the total number of valid assignments is the number of ways to assign c_s's in their ranges, such that for at least one s, c_s × 2^{n -m} ==f.\n\nWait, but how to compute this.\n\nWait, for each s, let's define a variable that indicates whether c_s × 2^{n -m} is exactly f.\n\nWe need the sum over all s of the possibilities where at least one s satisfies this condition.\n\nBut inclusion-exclusion comes into play.\n\nBut n can be up to 15, which suggests that the inclusion-exclusion approach might be feasible.\n\nWait, but n can be 15, which gives 32767 s's. That's way too big for inclusion-exclusion.\n\nSo, alternative approaches are needed.\n\nAnother angle: For each s, check whether c_s × 2^{n -m} can be f.\n\nIf for a particular s, 2^{n -m} does not divide f, then c_s can't be such that c_s × 2^{n -m} = f. So for such s, it's impossible for s to be the one that achieves equality.\n\nSo, for s to contribute to the count, f must be divisible by 2^{n -m}.\n\nWait, no. Because c_s is an integer. So for c_s × 2^{n -m} = f, f must be divisible by 2^{n -m}.\n\nOtherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo, for each s, we can precompute whether f is divisible by 2^{n -m}.\n\nIf not, then s can't be the one to achieve equality, so it can't contribute to the count.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Precompute for each s whether f is divisible by 2^{n -m}.\n\n   If not, then s can't be the one that sets d_s =f.\n\n2. For each s that satisfies f mod 2^{n -m} =0, compute c_s = f / 2^{n -m}.\n\n   Then, check if c_s >= c_s_min and <=k.\n\n   If yes, then s can be a candidate to contribute.\n\n3. Now, the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments where at least one s (from the candidates) is assigned c_s = f / 2^{n -m}, and all other s's are assigned c_s >= c_s_min.\n\nBut this is tricky because for different s's, their c_s's may interfere.\n\nWait, but in our initial step, we have c_s_min = ceil( f / (2^{n -m} ) ), so for s where c_s = f/(2^{n -m} ), we have to ensure that c_s >= c_s_min.\n\nBut f is divisible by 2^{n -m}, so f/(2^{n -m}) is an integer. Let's denote this as c_s_target.\n\nThen, c_s_target must be >= c_s_min.\n\nElse, even if f is divisible by 2^{n -m}, if c_s_target < c_s_min, then assigning c_s = c_s_target would violate the constraints.\n\nWait, but c_s_min is the minimal c_s required for s. So, if c_s_target < c_s_min, then it's impossible to assign c_s = c_s_target, because it would be below the required minimum.\n\nSo, for each s where f is divisible by 2^{n -m}, compute c_s_target = f / 2^{n -m}.\n\nCheck if c_s_target >= c_s_min.\n\nIf yes, then s is a possible candidate to contribute to the count.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For each s:\n\n   a. Compute m = len(s).\n\n   b. Compute divisor = 2^{n -m}.\n\n   c. If f % divisor !=0: s can't be a candidate.\n\n   d. Else, c_s_target = f / divisor.\n\n      i. Compute c_s_min = ceil( f / divisor ). But wait, since divisor divides f, f / divisor is integer, so c_s_min = f / divisor.\n\n      ii. So, c_s_target must be >= c_s_min.\n\n      iii. If yes, then s is a candidate.\n\nSo, s is a candidate if:\n\n- f is divisible by 2^{n -m}.\n\n- c_s_target >= c_s_min.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor each s:\n\n   Compute divisor = 2^{n - m}\n\n   If f % divisor != 0: skip.\n\n   Else:\n\n      c_s_target = f / divisor\n\n      c_s_min = ceil( f / divisor )\n\n      Since f is divisible by divisor, c_s_min = f / divisor.\n\n      So, check if c_s_target >= c_s_min.\n\n      Which is always true because c_s_target = f / divisor.\n\n      Wait, but c_s_min is f / divisor, so c_s_target is equal to c_s_min.\n\n      So, for s to be a candidate, c_s_target >= c_s_min, which is always true.\n\n      So, for each s where f is divisible by 2^{n -m}, s is a candidate.\n\nSo, for each s where f is divisible by 2^{n -m}, we can consider s as a possible point where d_s =f.\n\nThus, the problem now is to count the number of assignments where for at least one s in S (S being the set of s's where f is divisible by 2^{n -m}), c_s is assigned to f / 2^{n -m}, and all other s's are assigned to >= c_s_min.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can model this as inclusion-exclusion, where for each s in S, the number of assignments where s is the one that sets d_s=f, and all others are >= their c_s_min.\n\nBut S can be large, up to 32767 elements, which makes inclusion-exclusion computationally infeasible.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCompute the total number of valid assignments where all s's have c_s >= c_s_min, and subtract the number of assignments where all s's have c_s >= c_s_min and for all s in S, c_s > c_s_target.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another way: The total number of valid assignments is the product for all s of (number of choices for c_s) where c_s >= c_s_min and <=k.\n\nBut from this, we need to subtract the assignments where the minimum d_s is strictly greater than f.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm. So the initial total is T = product_{s} (max(0, k - c_s_min + 1)).\n\nBut if for any s, c_s_min >k, then T=0.\n\nOtherwise, T is the product.\n\nBut we need to count the number of assignments where the minimum d_s is exactly f.\n\n",
