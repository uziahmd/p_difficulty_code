The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house ai, but importantly, she must do all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order of tasks matters here.\n\nHmm, wait. Oh right, because for task i, she needs to have completed all j < i first. So the tasks must be processed in the order of their indices, not necessarily the order they appear in the input.\n\nWait no, the input is given as a list of a_1 to a_m. But the problem says that for each i-th task, she must be in a_i and have completed all j < i. So perhaps the tasks are in order from 1 to m, and for each step, she has to go to a_i. But the initial position is 1, and then she can move around as needed.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the tasks are processed in the order of increasing i. Because for each i, she must be at a_i before moving on to the next task. So the sequence is 1 → a_1 → a_2 → ... → a_m, but considering that after each a_i, she might have to loop around the ring road.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be in ai and have completed all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order is: she does task 1 (i=1), then task 2 (i=2), up to task m (i=m). So the sequence is a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. But the initial position is 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial position is 1, which is a_0, perhaps. Then, she needs to go through the tasks in order. For each task i, she must be at a_i, having already done all j < i.\n\nSo the starting point is 1, then she goes to a_1, then from there to a_2, and so on until a_m. But how does she get from one a_i to a_{i+1}?\n\nAh, right, because the ring road is circular. So the distance between two points can be calculated as the minimal steps required to go clockwise or counter-clockwise. But since the traffic is one-way and clockwise, she can only move in the clockwise direction. So when moving from a house to another, she has to go in the clockwise way.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ringroad is a one-way street in the clockwise direction. So the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, meaning that each time she moves, she goes to the next higher-numbered house, wrapping around after n.\n\nWait, no. Because the ringroad is a circle. So house 1 is next to house 2, which is next to house 3, and so on, until house n, which is next to house 1 again. So moving from any house x to x+1 takes one unit of time, and moving from n to 1 takes one unit as well.\n\nBut since the ring is one-way, she can't go back. So if she is at house 3, she can only go to 4, then 5, etc., or wrap around to 1, 2, etc., depending on how far she is from the target.\n\nWait, no. The ringroad is one-way, and the direction is fixed as clockwise. So each movement must be to the next house in the clockwise direction. So the movement is always from x to x+1 mod n. So moving from x to y can only be done if y is in the clockwise direction from x, but since the ring is circular, she can take a path that wraps around.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time. So each step is to the next house in the clockwise direction. So, for example, if you're at house 3 and want to get to house 1, you have to pass through 4, 5, ..., n, 1, which would take (n - 3 + 1) steps. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal path is to go the other way, but wait, the ring is one-way, so she can't go counter-clockwise. So she can only move in the clockwise direction, which means that the path from x to y is the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because sometimes, going the other way could be shorter. But in this",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house 1 and can only move clockwise along the ringroad. Each task must be completed in the order of their indices, i.e., from task 1 to task m.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the ringroad is one-way and clockwise, moving from a house `x` to `x+1` takes one unit of time. If Xenia is at house `n`, moving to house 1 also takes one unit of time.\n2. **Task Completion Order**: Tasks must be completed in the order of their indices. For each task `i`, Xenia must be at house `a_i` after completing all previous tasks.\n3. **Path Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of tasks, calculate the minimal time required to move from the current house to the next task's house. This involves computing the clockwise distance between the two houses.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntime = 0\n\ncurrent_pos = 1  # Starting position is house 1\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    # Calculate the minimal steps from current_pos to a\n    if a >= current_pos:\n        steps = a - current_pos\n    else:\n        steps = (n - current_pos) + a\n    time += steps\n    current_pos = a\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with the initial time set to 0.\n2. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task in the given order:\n   - Determine the minimal steps needed to move from the current position to the task's house in the clockwise direction.\n   - Update the total time with these steps.\n   - Update the current position to the task's house.\n3. **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal time required by considering the movement constraints on the ringroad and processing tasks in the correct order.",
