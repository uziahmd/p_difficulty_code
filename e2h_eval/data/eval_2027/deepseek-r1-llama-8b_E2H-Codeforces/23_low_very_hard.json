In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, each with a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). The goal is to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu, which is either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, right. So the task is to determine, for each possible scenario, what's the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, \"1s 2s 3s\" is a shuntsu already, so the output for that would be zero. Similarly, if all three are the same like \"9m 9m 9m\", then it's a koutsu, so output is zero.\n\nBut when the initial three don't form a mentsu, we need to compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form at least one.\n\nSo, for each of the three starting hands, I need to consider all possible ways to add tiles (including duplicates) to form a mentsu, and find the smallest number required.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says that after drawing, the total number of tiles increases by one for each drawn. So, the initial count is three, and each draw adds one, making four, five, etc., until a mentsu is found.\n\nBut the output is the minimal number of draws needed across all three initial hands.\n\nWait no: Wait, the problem says, she has three tiles. She can draw any tiles, including those already in her hand. She needs to find the minimal number of tiles to draw so that her entire collection (initial three plus drawn) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nSo the problem is, given the initial three tiles, find the minimal number of tiles to add to make the total set contain a mentsu.\n\nEach tile added can be any possible suited tile, including duplicates of existing ones.\n\nSo for each possible way to form a mentsu (any triplet or sequence), calculate how many tiles are missing from the initial three, then the minimal number of draws is the minimal such missing count across all possible mentsu options.\n\nWait, but the initial set plus the drawn tiles must have at least one mentsu. So perhaps there's more than one possible mentsu that can be formed, and we need to choose the one that requires the least number of draws.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible mentsu options.\n2. For each mentsu option, calculate how many tiles are already present in the initial hand.\n3. The number of tiles needed to complete this mentsu is (3 - current count).\n4. Find the minimal such value across all mentsu options.\n\nBut how do I enumerate all possible mentsu options?\n\nMentsu can be either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nTriplet: consists of three identical tiles. So for each tile type (like 1m, 2m, etc.), check if adding two of them would create a triplet.\n\nSequence: consists of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, look for sequences like 1,2,3; 2,3,4; up to 7,8,9. For each such sequence, check if the initial set has any of the three tiles, and how many are missing.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each possible triplet or sequence:\n- Determine how many tiles of that type are already present in the initial set.\n- The required tiles to add are 3 minus the count present.\n- Keep track of the minimal required across all possibilities.\n\nThen, the minimal of these values is the answer.\n\nBut wait, the initial three tiles may already form a mentsu. So in that case, the minimal is zero.\n\nSo first, check if any mentsu is already present. If yes, return 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to find the minimal draws.\n\nNow, let's structure this.\n\nFirst, process the input.\n\nThe input is three strings, each is a tile. For example, \"1s 2s 3s\" is a sequence, so minimal draws is zero.\n\nSo, let's parse each of the three into a list, maybe as a dictionary or something.\n\nBut for checking, perhaps it's easier to represent the tiles as a set, but also keep track of their counts. Because for a triplet, you need exactly three of the same tile. So, if the initial set has two of a tile, you'd need one more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps represent the initial hand as a frequency map, where for each tile, we know",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her hand.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). Tokitsukaze starts with three tiles and can draw any additional tiles, including duplicates of her current ones.\n2. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. If they do, no extra tiles are needed.\n3. **Generate All Possible Mentsu**: Enumerate all possible triplets and sequences that could be formed using the given tiles and any additional tiles.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Draws**: For each possible mentsu, determine how many more tiles are needed to complete it. Track the minimum number of draws required across all possible mentsu.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef read_input():\n    return sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n\ndef get_suits():\n    return {'m': 0, 'p': 1, 's': 2}\n\ndef get_numbers():\n    return [str(i) for i in range(1, 10)]\n\ndef is_triplet(tiles, tile):\n    return tiles.get(tile, 0) >= 3\n\ndef is_sequence(tiles, suit, start):\n    count = 0\n    for num in get_numbers():\n        tile = num + suit\n        count += tiles.get(tile, 0)\n    return count >= 3\n\ndef find_min_draws(initial):\n    min_draws = 3  # worst case, add all 6 missing tiles for a new mentsu\n    current_tiles = {}\n    for tile in initial:\n        current_tiles[tile] = current_tiles.get(tile, 0) + 1\n    \n    # Check for existing mentsu\n    for tile in current_tiles:\n        if current_tiles[tile] >= 3:\n            return 0\n    for suit in get_suits().keys():\n        for num in get_numbers():\n            if (int(num) == 1 and int(num) + 2 <= 9) or (int(num) == 7 and int(num) + 2 <= 9):\n                if is_sequence(current_tiles, suit, num):\n                    return 0\n    # Generate all possible triplets\n    for tile in current_tiles:\n        count = current_tiles[tile]\n        if count < 3:\n            needed = 3 - count\n            if needed < min_draws:\n                min_draws = needed\n    # Generate all possible sequences\n    for suit in get_suits().keys():\n        for start_num in get_numbers():\n            if start_num > 7:\n                continue\n            required = {f\"{start_num}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+1}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+2}{suit}\"}\n            present = 0\n            for t in required:\n                present += current_tiles.get(t, 0)\n            needed = 3 - present\n            if needed < min_draws:\n                min_draws = needed\n    return min_draws\n\ntiles = read_input()\nprint(find_min_draws(tiles))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three strings representing the initial tiles.\n2. **Check for Triplet or Sequence**: The function `find_min_draws` checks if the initial tiles already form a triplet or sequence. If they do, it returns 0.\n3. **Evaluate Possible Mentsu**: For each possible triplet and sequence, the function calculates how many more tiles are needed to complete it and keeps track of the minimum number of draws required.\n4. **Output Result**: The function prints the minimum number of draws needed to form at least one mentsu.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible ways to form a mentsu and find the optimal solution with minimal computational overhead.",
