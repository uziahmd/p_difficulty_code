Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l in length. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d so that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to model the street as a line segment from 0 to l. Each lantern covers an interval around its position. The union of all these intervals must cover the entire [0, l] segment.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal d where the coverage of all lanterns, each with radius d, covers the entire street.\n\nHow do I find this minimal d?\n\nAn initial thought is that the minimal d is determined by the gaps between the coverage areas of adjacent lanterns. So, perhaps we can sort the lantern positions and then check the maximum gap between consecutive coverage regions.\n\nWait, but the lanterns might not be sorted. So maybe the first step is to sort them.\n\nBut wait, some lanterns might be at the same position, or their coverage areas might overlap. So, the idea is to find all the critical points where the coverage starts or ends, and then compute the maximum required d based on those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum distance from any point on the street to the nearest lantern. Because if d is at least this maximum, then every point is covered.\n\nYes! That makes sense. Because for each point x on the street, the distance to the nearest lantern is some value. The minimal d must be at least the maximum of all these distances.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each point x in [0, l], find the closest lantern to x.\n2. The maximum of these minimal distances across all x is the required d.\n\nBut computing this for every x is impossible because l can be up to 1e9, which is way too big. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but the lanterns are discrete. So the minimal distance function has certain breakpoints where it changes. These breakpoints are the positions of the lanterns.\n\nSo, instead of considering every x, we can consider the intervals between the lanterns and compute the maximum required d in each interval.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Sort the lanterns' positions.\n- For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the maximum required d in the interval between them.\n- Also, consider the areas before the first lantern and after the last lantern.\n- The overall maximum of these is the answer.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo let's formalize this.\n\nLet's sort the lanterns in increasing order: a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n.\n\nWe can add sentinel values at 0 and l to handle the edges. Or perhaps just process the beginning and end separately.\n\nFor each i from 0 to n (where a_0 is 0 and a_{n+1} is l), we need to consider the interval [a_i, a_{i+1}].\n\nWait, no. Maybe it's better to think of the street as divided into regions by the lanterns. Between two lanterns, the coverage may leave a gap. So for each such region, the required d is the maximum of (the distance from the left lantern to the start of the region) and (the distance from the right lantern to the end of the region).\n\nWait, perhaps another way: For each interval between two lanterns, say a_prev and a_next, the street is from a_prev to a_next. But since each lantern covers d units on either side, the region [a_prev - d, a_prev + d] is covered. Similarly for a_next.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each lantern covers from a_i - d to a_i + d. So the coverage is continuous, but when two lanterns are close, their coverages may merge.\n\nWait, but the key is that the entire [0, l] must be covered. So any point x must be within d of at least one lantern.\n\nSo, for each x in [0, l], find the nearest a_i, and compute the distance to that a_i. The maximum of these is the minimal d needed.\n\nSo, the maximum of min distances across all x is our answer.\n\nNow, how to compute this maximum efficiently without iterating over all x.\n\nSince the street is a line, and the lanterns are points on it, the minimal distance function is piecewise linear and convex. So the maximum occurs either at one of the endpoints of the intervals between lanterns or at the edges.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum minimal distance will occur at one of the points where the coverage of the lanterns just touches. So perhaps the maximum is determined by the largest gap between two lanterns.\n\nWait, for example, if two lanterns are spaced very far apart, then the midpoint between them would require a certain d to be covered. The maximum of such midpoints would determine d.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is the maximum of the following:\n\n- The distance from the first lantern to 0.\n- The distance from the last lantern to l.\n- For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum of (distance from the previous lantern to current) / 2, and (current - previous) / 2, but wait, maybe it's (current - previous)/2, but that's only if the two lanterns are the only ones covering that area.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each interval between two consecutive lanterns, a_prev and a_current.\n\nIn the interval [a_prev, a_current], the coverage from a_prev is up to a_prev + d, and the coverage from a_current is down to a_current - d. So the combined coverage is [a_prev - d, a_prev + d] ∪ [a_current - d, a_current + d]. But if a_prev + d < a_current - d, then there's a gap between a_prev +d and a_current -d, which is (a_current - a_prev - 2d). So to cover this gap, we need a_prev +d >= a_current -d, which implies a_current - a_prev <= 2d.\n\nSo for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d is at least (a_current - a_prev)/2. But wait, that's not entirely correct. Because if a_prev is close to 0, then the required d could be the distance from 0 to a_prev, but maybe that's already covered by the next lantern.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- The distance from the first lantern to 0.\n- The distance from the last lantern to l.\n- Half the distance between each consecutive pair of lanterns.\n\nBecause for each pair, the maximum coverage needed is that the two lanterns together cover the space between them. So the minimal d must be at least half the distance between them.\n\nAlso, the first lantern needs to cover from 0 to a_1, so d must be at least a_1. Similarly, the last lantern must cover from a_n to l, so d must be at least l - a_n.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the first lantern is at a_1. Then, the coverage from it is from a_1 -d to a_1 +d. To cover 0, a_1 -d must be <=0, so d must be >= a_1.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern is at a_n. To cover l, a_n +d must be >=l, so d >= l - a_n.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of a_1, (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for all consecutive pairs, and (l - a_n).\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n\n2. Compute the initial candidate for d as the first lantern's position, since it needs to cover from 0.\n\n3. Compute the candidate as the last lantern's position's distance from l.\n\n4. For each consecutive pair in the sorted list, compute the distance between them, divide by 2, and compare to the current maximum.\n\n5. The maximum of all these is the required d.\n\nYes! That seems manageable.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n7 15\n\nPositions: 15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWait, no, the input is:\n\nWait, the first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0'\n\nSo n=7, l=15.\n\nThe lanterns are at positions: 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nAfter sorting: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nNow, let's compute the candidates.\n\nFirst, a_1 is 0. So the distance from 0 to 0 is 0. So d must be at least 0.\n\nWait, no, wait. The first lantern is at 0. So to cover 0, the coverage is 0-d to 0+d. Since 0 is the starting point, the coverage starts at 0. So the distance from 0 is 0, so d can be 0 here? But that can't be, because other points may require a larger d.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express.\n\nThe first lantern is at a_1=0. So the coverage from it starts at 0, but to cover the rest of the street, the next lanterns may contribute. So the required d is the maximum of a_1 (which is 0) and other factors.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is 2. So let's see what the algorithm would compute.\n\nWait, the sorted list is 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCompute:\n\nd_candidate = max(0, (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2, (15-14)).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the last part is (l - a_n) = 15-15=0.\n\nWait, let's compute each step:\n\nd_candidate starts as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern: 0. So d_candidate is max(0, 0) = 0.\n\nThen, for each consecutive pair:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: (3-0)/2=1.5. So d_candidate becomes 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and5: 2/2=1. No change.\n\nBetween5 and7: 2/2=1. No change.\n\n7 to9: 2/2=1.\n\n9 to14: 5/2=2.5. Now d_candidate is 2.5.\n\n14 to15: 1/2=0.5. No change.\n\nAdditionally, the last part is l - a_n =15-15=0.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5. But the sample output is 2. So my logic is wrong here.\n\nWait, what's happening.\n\nIn the second sample, the output is 2. So according to the problem statement, with d=2, the first lantern covers 0 to 4, and the second covers 3 to 5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nWait, why did the algorithm compute 2.5 as the required d?\n\nAh, because in the algorithm, it took the maximum of (14-9)/2=2.5, which is higher than 2.\n\nSo clearly, the algorithm's logic is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so what's wrong with the initial approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is not considering that multiple lanterns may cover the same area, so the maximum isn't just the maximum of the first, last, and the midpoints between consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when there are more than two lanterns in a region, the required d is determined not just by the midpoint between two, but by the overlapping of all.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nIn the sample case, the sorted lanterns are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nEach lantern's coverage is [x -d, x +d].\n\nWe need to ensure that all points in [0,15] are covered.\n\nWhat's the minimal d?\n\nLooking at the interval between 9 and14: the coverage from 9 is [9-d,9+d], and from14 is [14-d,14+d]. We need 9+d >=14 -d. So 2d >=5 → d>=2.5.\n\nWait, but in the sample, d=2 is sufficient because 9+2=11, which covers up to 11, and 14-2=12, so 11 to12 is covered by both. Wait, but 12 is less than 14-2=12. So 9+2=11, and 14-2=12. So between 11 and12, it's covered by both. So the entire street is covered.\n\nWait, but according to the algorithm, the maximum required is 2.5, which is not the case in the sample.\n\nSo the initial approach is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm should also consider the coverage beyond the next lantern.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm should compute for each interval [a_prev, a_current], the required d is the maximum of (a_prev +d >= a_current -d) and also the distance from a_prev to 0, and the distance from a_current to l.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to, for each interval between two consecutive lanterns, compute the maximum of (a_current - a_prev)/2 and the maximum between the left and right edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each interval [a_prev, a_current], the minimal d needed to cover that interval, considering the coverage from a_prev and a_current.\n\nSo for the interval between a_prev and a_current:\n\nThe coverage from a_prev is a_prev -d to a_prev +d.\n\nThe coverage from a_current is a_current -d to a_current +d.\n\nThese two must overlap or meet. So the union of the two must cover [a_prev, a_current].\n\nWait, but a_prev and a_current are points on the street, and the coverage from each lantern is a circle (interval) around them.\n\nSo the distance between a_prev and a_current is s = a_current - a_prev.\n\nTo cover the entire [a_prev, a_current], the sum of the two coverage radii must be at least s.\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage from a_prev is a_prev +d, and from a_current is a_current -d. So to cover [a_prev, a_current], a_prev +d must be >= a_current -d → 2d >= s → d >= s/2.\n\nBut also, the coverage from a_prev must reach a_prev, which it does, but we have to make sure that the entire interval is covered.\n\nWait, but if d >= s/2, then the coverage from a_prev extends to a_prev +d >= a_prev + s/2, and the coverage from a_current extends to a_current -d <= a_current - s/2.\n\nIf s/2 is added to a_prev, and subtracted from a_current, then a_prev + s/2 + (a_current - a_prev - s/2) = a_current. So the two coverages just touch.\n\nThus, the minimal d for the interval [a_prev, a_current] is s/2.\n\nBut in the sample case, the interval between 9 and14 is 5, so d must be at least 2.5. However, the sample uses d=2, which is less than 2.5, yet it works.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the sample, the lanterns are at 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nWith d=2, the coverage from 9 is 7 to 11, and from14 is 12 to16. So in the interval [9,14], the coverage from 9 is up to 11, and from14 starts at 12. So the middle part from 11 to12 is covered by both. So the entire [9,14] is covered.\n\nBut according to the previous logic, the required d would be 2.5, but it's possible with d=2.\n\nSo why is that?\n\nAh, because in the interval between 9 and14, the coverage from 9 and14 overlaps in the middle. So even though the distance is 5, the required d is 2.5, but in reality, with d=2, it's covered because the two lanterns' coverage overlaps in the middle.\n\nWait, that suggests that the initial approach was incorrect because it only considers the maximum of the midpoints between consecutive lanterns, but perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum of:\n\n- The first lantern's position (distance from 0).\n- The last lantern's position (distance from l).\n- For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) / 2 and (a_{i} - a_{i-1}) / 2? Or wait, perhaps it's the maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1})/2 and (the required to cover the edges).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach: The minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- The first lantern's position (since it must cover from 0 to a_1 -d)\n- The last lantern's position (since it must cover from a_n +d to l)\n- For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1})/2 and the distance from the first lantern to 0, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute for each pair of consecutive lanterns a_prev and a_current:\n\nThe minimal d such that a_prev +d >= a_current -d.\n\nWhich simplifies to d >= (a_current - a_prev)/2.\n\nBut wait, in the sample, a_prev=9, a_current=14.\n\n(14-9)/2=2.5. So d must be at least 2.5. But in the sample, d=2 is sufficient.\n\nSo that's conflicting.\n\nWait, what's the issue here.\n\nAh, perhaps the initial approach doesn't account for the fact that other lanterns may contribute to covering the area between a_prev and a_current.\n\nIn the sample, between 9 and14, there's a lantern at14, which when d=2, covers up to 16, but the street ends at15. So the coverage from14 is 12 to16, but the street is only up to15. So the coverage in the interval [9,14] is 9-11 (from9) and 12-14 (from14). But wait, the point at12 is covered by both.\n\nSo the entire interval [9,14] is covered by the two lanterns with d=2.\n\nBut according to the previous approach, the required d is 2.5.\n\nSo the initial approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for other lanterns contributing to the coverage in the interval.\n\nThus, the minimal d is determined not only by the consecutive lanterns but also by all the lanterns in the region.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to find, for each point on the street, the minimal distance to any lantern. The maximum of these is the required d.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the coverage as a series of intervals and find the maximum required d.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is either:\n\n- The distance from the first lantern to 0.\n\n- The distance from the last lantern to l.\n\n- The maximum of the distances at the midpoints between consecutive lanterns.\n\nBut that's not working for the sample.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIn the sample, the first lantern is at0, which requires d>=0.\n\nThe last lantern is at15, which requires d>=0.\n\nThe consecutive lanterns are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nThe consecutive differences are 3,2,2,2,5,1.\n\nHalf of each is 1.5,1,1,1,2.5,0.5.\n\nThe maximum is 2.5.\n\nBut the sample uses d=2.\n\nSo why is the initial approach giving a wrong result.\n\nAh! Because the initial approach is not considering that the coverage from other lanterns may bridge the gap.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each consecutive pair a_prev and a_current, the required d is the maximum of (a_prev +d >= a_current -d), and also the distance from a_prev to 0, and the distance from a_current to l.\n\nBut that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute for each consecutive pair a_prev and a_current, the minimal d that ensures that their combined coverage covers the interval [a_prev, a_current].\n\nWhich is:\n\nWe need a_prev +d >= a_current -d → d >= (a_current -a_prev)/2.\n\nBut in the sample, the pair 9 and14 has (14-9)/2=2.5, but with d=2, the coverage from 9 is 7 to 11, and from14 is12 to16. So the interval [9,14] is fully covered by these two.\n\nSo why is d=2 sufficient even though (14-9)/2=2.5>2.\n\nAh, because the lanterns between9 and14 (like 14 itself) contributes to the coverage.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because it's only considering consecutive pairs, but in reality, the required d is influenced by all lanterns in a certain area.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to model the entire coverage as a series of events, and for each point on the street, find the minimal distance to any lantern.\n\nThe maximum of these minimal distances is the required d.\n\nBut since the street is a line, and the lanterns are sorted, perhaps we can represent the minimal distance function as a series of intervals and compute the maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the street as a list of points, and for each interval between two lanterns, compute the minimal distance within that interval.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can iterate through the sorted lanterns and keep track of the previous lantern's coverage.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nSort the lanterns in increasing order.\n\nInitialize the previous coverage as a_prev -d, and the current coverage as a_prev +d.\n\nAs we move through each lantern, we can compute the minimal d required to cover the gap between the previous coverage and the current lantern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as the cumulative coverage.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps.\n\n1. Sort the lanterns in increasing order: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n\n2. Add sentinel values at 0 and l. Or perhaps not, since the first and last lanterns may cover the edges.\n\n3. Initialize variables:\n\n   - prev_end: the furthest point covered by the previous lanterns.\n\n   - d: the current required d.\n\n4. For each lantern in the sorted list:\n\n   a. The current lantern is a_i.\n\n   b. The new coverage starts at a_i -d and ends at a_i +d.\n\n   c. The maximum of prev_end and a_i -d is the new start.\n\n      - If the new start is less than a_i -d, then d is insufficient.\n\n      - Wait, no. Wait, the previous coverage ends at prev_end. The current lantern's coverage starts at a_i -d. So the gap between prev_end and a_i -d must be covered.\n\n      So, the required d must be at least (a_i -d - prev_end), but this is only possible if a_i -d > prev_end.\n\n      Or, more accurately, the maximum distance between the two points is covered by their combined d.\n\n      Alternatively, the required d must satisfy a_i -d <= prev_end, meaning the current coverage starts before or at the end of the previous coverage.\n\n      Otherwise, there's a gap between prev_end and a_i -d.\n\n      So, the required d must be such that a_i -d <= prev_end.\n\n      Which can be rewritten as d >= a_i - prev_end.\n\n      Wait, but a_i is greater than prev_end (since they are sorted), so a_i - prev_end is positive.\n\n      So d must be at least (a_i - prev_end).\n\n      Wait, that makes more sense.\n\n   So, for each a_i in the sorted list:\n\n   - The required d is the maximum of the current required d and (a_i - prev_end).\n\n   - Update prev_end to max(prev_end, a_i +d).\n\n   - But wait, since d is what we're trying to find, perhaps this is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it as:\n\nprev_end is the furthest point covered so far.\n\nFor the current a_i, the earliest point it can cover is a_i -d.\n\nWe need a_i -d <= prev_end, otherwise, there's a gap between prev_end and a_i -d.\n\nSo, to avoid a gap, d must be >= (a_i - prev_end).\n\nBut also, the current a_i's coverage ends at a_i +d, so the new prev_end is the maximum of prev_end and a_i +d.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the right approach.\n\nLet me try to model it step by step.\n\nInitialize:\n\nprev_end = 0 (since we need to cover from 0)\n\ncurrent_max_d = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in sorted list:\n\n   current_start = a_i - current_max_d\n\n   if current_start > prev_end:\n\n       # There's a gap between prev_end and current_start.\n\n       # So d must be at least current_start - prev_end.\n\n       required_d = current_start - prev_end\n\n       current_max_d = required_d\n\n       # Now, update the prev_end to a_i + current_max_d.\n\n       prev_end = max(prev_end, a_i + current_max_d)\n\n   else:\n\n       # No gap, so the current_max_d can be updated if necessary.\n\n       # But we need to ensure that a_i + current_max_d >= l.\n\n       # Wait, perhaps after processing all lanterns, we also need to check the end.\n\n       pass\n\nAfter processing all lanterns, also check the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the code would look like this:\n\nsort the lanterns.\n\nprev_end = 0\n\nmax_d = 0\n\nfor a in sorted_ait:\n\n    current_start = a - max_d\n\n    if current_start > prev_end:\n\n        # gap exists; required d is current_start - prev_end\n\n        required_d = current_start - prev_end\n\n        max_d = required_d\n\n        # After this, the current coverage is a + max_d.\n\n        # So the new prev_end is the maximum between prev_end and a + max_d.\n\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, a + max_d)\n\n    else:\n\n        # no gap; but need to extend the coverage.\n\n        # The new coverage is a + max_d.\n\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, a + max_d)\n\n# After all lanterns, check if the last coverage covers l.\n\nif prev_end < l:\n\n    # Need to cover from prev_end to l.\n\n    required_d = l - prev_end\n\n    max_d = max(max_d, required_d)\n\nSo, in the sample:\n\nsorted_a = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nprev_end=0, max_d=0.\n\nProcess 0:\n\ncurrent_start=0-0=0 <= prev_end=0.\n\nprev_end becomes max(0, 0+0)=0.\n\nNo change to max_d.\n\nProcess 3:\n\ncurrent_start=3-0=3>0.\n\nrequired_d=3-0=3.\n\nmax_d=3.\n\nprev_end = max(0, 3+3=6).\n\nNow, prev_end is 6.\n\nProcess 5:\n\ncurrent_start=5-3=2 <=6.\n\nprev_end becomes max(6,5+3=8).\n\nNo change to max_d.\n\nProcess7:\n\ncurrent_start=7-3=4 <=8.\n\nprev_end becomes max(8,7+3=10).\n\nNo change.\n\nProcess9:\n\ncurrent_start=9-3=6<=10.\n\nprev_end becomes max(10, 9+3=12).\n\nNo change.\n\nProcess14:\n\ncurrent_start=14-3=11 <=12.\n\nprev_end becomes max(12,14+3=17).\n\nNo change.\n\nProcess15:\n\ncurrent_start=15-3=12 <=17.\n\nprev_end becomes max(17,15+3=18).\n\nAfter processing all, check if prev_end >=15.\n\nYes, 18>=15.\n\nSo max_d is 3.\n\nBut the sample expects 2.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, this approach is not working.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the logic.\n\nWait, let's think about the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the minimal d is 2.\n\nSo according to the approach above, when processing the lantern at14, the current_start is 14-2=12, which is less than prev_end=12.\n\nSo no gap. Then, prev_end is set to max(12,14+2=16).\n\nAfter all lanterns, prev_end is 16, which is >=15. So the required d is 2.\n\nBut in the approach above, the max_d was 3, which is incorrect.\n\nSo where is the mistake?\n\nAh, I think the approach is missing that the d can be determined not just by the previous lanterns, but also by the next ones.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach should be to find for each lantern, the required d based on the next lantern as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider all possible lanterns that could influence the coverage in a certain area.\n\nAnother approach: the required d must be such that every point on the street is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances from any point x in [0,l] to the nearest lantern.\n\nTo compute this, we can model the street as a list of points, and for each point, compute the distance to the nearest lantern.\n\nThe maximum of these is the required d.\n\nBut for large l, it's impossible to compute this for every point.\n\nSo the alternative is to find the maximum of the minimal distances in the intervals between the lanterns.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum occurs either at the edges of the street, or in the middle of a group of lanterns that are spaced in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is the maximum of:\n\n- The distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n\n- The distance from l to the last lantern.\n\n- The maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1})/2 for consecutive lanterns.\n\nBut in the sample, the maximum of (a_i -a_{i-1})/2 is 2.5, but the sample uses 2.\n\nSo why is that acceptable.\n\nAh, because the lantern at14 covers up to14+2=16, which is beyond l=15. So the coverage from14 starts at14-2=12, which is within the previous coverage.\n\nWait, perhaps the required d is not just the maximum of the midpoints, but also considering that other lanterns can help in covering the gaps.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- The first lantern's position.\n\n- The last lantern's position.\n\n- For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1})/2.\n\nBut in the sample, the first lantern is at0, so that's 0.\n\nThe last is at15, which is 0.\n\nThe maximum of (a_i -a_{i-1})/2 is 2.5.\n\nBut sample uses d=2.\n\nSo why is that possible.\n\nWait, perhaps because the lanterns after 9 contribute to covering the area.\n\nWait, when d=2, the coverage from9 is7 to11, from14 is12 to16, and from15 is13 to17.\n\nSo the entire street from0 to15 is covered.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, the maximum (a_i -a_{i-1})/2 is2.5, which is higher than2.\n\nSo the initial approach gives an overestimation.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as the maximum of:\n\n- The first lantern's position.\n\n- The last lantern's position.\n\n- For each consecutive pair, the maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1})/2 and the required d to cover the area between a_{i-1}+d and a_i -d.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n1. The distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n\n2. The distance from the last lantern to l.\n\n3. The maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1})/2 for all consecutive lanterns.\n\nBut in the sample, the third term is 2.5, which is larger than the required d=2. So this suggests that this approach is still incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each consecutive pair a_prev and a_current, the required d is the maximum between (a_current - a_prev)/2 and the required d to cover the edges.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about how to compute the maximum minimal distance.\n\nLet me think of the street as a line, and for each point x, compute the minimal distance to any lantern.\n\nThe maximum of these is d.\n\nTo compute this, we can note that the function is piecewise linear, and the maximum occurs either at the edges (0 or l) or at a point where the function changes direction.\n\nBut how to find these points.\n\nAlternative Idea: Find all the critical points where the minimal distance changes, which are the lantern positions and the midpoints between consecutive lanterns.\n\nCompute the minimal distance at each of these points and take the maximum.\n\nBut for the sample, the midpoints are 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 12.5, 15.5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother Idea: Think of the problem as the street being a real line, and the lanterns create certain coverage regions. We need to find the minimal d such that the union of these regions covers the entire street.\n\nThe minimal d is the smallest value where all points are covered.\n\nThis is equivalent to the maximal distance from any point to the nearest lantern.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances from any point to the nearest lantern.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the point x where the minimal distance to any lantern is maximized.\n\nSo the goal is to find x where min_{ai} |x - ai| is as large as possible.\n\nThe maximum of this min is the required d.\n\nSo, how can we find this maximum?\n\nIt's the Chebyshev center of the set of lanterns on the line.\n\nThe Chebyshev center is the point that minimizes the maximum distance to the points.\n\nWait, but in this case, the Chebyshev center is the point that maximizes the minimal distance to the points.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nThe Chebyshev center is the point that minimizes the maximum distance to all given points. So, it's the center of the minimal enclosing circle.\n\nBut in this problem, we want the maximum minimal distance, which is the opposite.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum minimal distance is achieved at the center of the largest gap between two points.\n\nSo, for the sorted lanterns, the largest gap is between two points a and b. The center of this gap is (a+b)/2. The minimal distance at this point is (b-a)/2.\n\nThus, the maximum minimal distance is the maximum of:\n\n- The first lantern's distance to 0.\n\n- The last lantern's distance to l.\n\n- The maximal gap between any two consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nSo, the initial approach was correct, but the sample seems to contradict this.\n\nWait, in the sample, the largest gap is between9 and14, which is5. So the minimal distance at the midpoint is2.5.\n\nBut the sample uses d=2, which is less than2.5.\n\nSo why is that allowed?\n\nBecause the lantern at14, when d=2, covers up to16, which is beyond l=15.\n\nSo the coverage from14 starts at12, which is within the coverage of9 (up to11). So the entire interval is covered.\n\nThus, the minimal d is2, but the maximum gap is5, which would suggest a required d of2.5.\n\nSo, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the initial approach is not sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the lanterns further along can help cover the gaps.\n\nThus, the problem is more complex than initially thought.\n\nAlternative Idea: The required d is the maximum of the minimal required d for each interval between two lanterns, considering all possible ways to cover the interval.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy.\n\nWait, perhaps for each pair of lanterns a and b, the minimal d needed to cover the area between a and b, given that there are other lanterns in between.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- The first lantern's position (distance from 0).\n\n- The last lantern's position (distance from l).\n\n- The maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) / 2 for all consecutive lanterns.\n\nBut in the sample, this gives 2.5, but the correct answer is2.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the required d is the maximum of the first and last terms, plus the maximum of the midpoints minus some consideration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps",
