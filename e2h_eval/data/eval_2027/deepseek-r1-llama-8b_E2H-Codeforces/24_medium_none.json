She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two types of actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right, but within the currently available tabs (since some might have been closed).\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position.\n\nSo the challenge is to determine the optimal sequence of moves and closures that minimizes the total time.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial state. All tabs are open, so a=1, b=n. The cursor is at pos.\n\nShe needs to end up with tabs l to r. So any tabs before l must be closed, as well as any after r.\n\nWait, no: Wait, the initial state is that all tabs are open. She needs to close all tabs except those in [l, r]. So the steps involve moving the cursor to certain positions and then closing tabs either to the left or right.\n\nBut when she closes tabs, the boundaries change. For example, if she closes tabs to the left of i, then a becomes i because all lower-numbered tabs are gone. Similarly for closing to the right.\n\nSo the order in which she does the closing matters. It could be more efficient to first close on one side and then the other.\n\nI think the approach here is to model all possible paths and find the minimal time. But since n is up to 100, perhaps a BFS approach would work, considering the state as (current position, a, b). But wait, a and b are dynamic and depend on which tabs have been closed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute the necessary steps.\n\nLet me think about the steps required:\n\n1. If there are tabs to the left of l, they need to be closed. Similarly for tabs to the right of r.\n\nSo, first, she may need to move to the leftmost tab in [l, r], which is l, and close the left tabs. Or, she could move to a position where she can close the left quickly, perhaps not necessarily l.\n\nWait, no. Because the left closure would close all tabs to the left of the current position. So to close all left tabs (those less than l), she needs to be at position l, because any position >= l will leave at least l in place, but the left closure would close everything before l.\n\nSimilarly, for the right closure, she needs to be at position r.\n\nBut what if l is larger than the current position? Or r is smaller?\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- Move to the left boundary of the target segment (l) and close the left.\n- Then, move to the right boundary (r) and close the right.\n\nOr:\n\n- Close the right first, then the left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can do one closure first, then the other, and see which is faster.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering both possibilities: closing left first or right first, and choose the one with the least steps.\n\nBut let's formalize this.\n\nCase 1: She first closes the left, then the right.\n\nCase 2: She first closes the right, then the left.\n\nWe can calculate the steps required for each case and choose the minimum.\n\nWait, but sometimes one of these options isn't needed. For example, if l == 1, she doesn't need to close the left. Similarly, if r == n, she doesn't need to close the right.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute the steps required for both options (if applicable) and pick the minimum.\n\nBut how do we compute the steps for each option?\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFor Case 1: Close left, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n\na) Move from initial position 'pos' to position 'l' (but wait, maybe not directly). Because when she moves, the cursor can only go to adjacent unclosed tabs.\n\nWait, but initially, all tabs are open, so the movement is unrestricted except for the current position.\n\nWait, in the initial state, the cursor can move freely between 1 and n.\n\nBut after some tabs are closed, the movement is constrained.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial movement is unconstrained because all tabs are open. So the cursor can move from any position to any other in any order.\n\nHmm, but the problem says that each second, she can move left or right, but only within the current a and b.\n\nWait, the description says: \"she can move the cursor to the left or right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i-1, a) or to the tab min(i+1, b))\".\n\nAh, so the movement is bounded by the current a and b. But initially, a=1, b=n.\n\nSo, during the process, a and b change as tabs are closed.\n\nSo, the steps involve moving and possibly changing a and b.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal approach is to find the minimal steps to reach certain points and perform the necessary closures.\n\nLet me model the problem as such.\n\nFirst, determine whether she needs to close the left and/or right.\n\nIf l > 1, she needs to close the left.\n\nIf r < n, she needs to close the right.\n\nSo, for each possibility, calculate the steps required.\n\nLet me think about each case.\n\nCase A: No need to close anything. That is, when l=1 and r=n. Then the answer is 0.\n\nCase B: Need to close both sides.\n\nCase C: Only need to close left.\n\nCase D: Only need to close right.\n\nSo, the first thing is to check whether she needs to close left and/or right.\n\nIf both are needed, then evaluate both strategies: close left first, then right; or close right first, then left.\n\nIf only one is needed, then compute the steps for that.\n\nSo, for example, if only left needs to be closed:\n\n- She needs to move to l, and close the left.\n\nWait, no. Because closing the left at position l will close all tabs before l.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nMove from pos to l, then perform left closure.\n\nBut the movement can be done optimally: the minimal steps is |pos - l|.\n\nBecause each step is moving one position, and the path is direct.\n\nThen, the closure takes 1 second.\n\nSo, total steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if only right needs to be closed.\n\nShe needs to move to r, then close the right.\n\nSteps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what if she is already at the correct position?\n\nLike, in the sample input where n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So she needs to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5,6). So she can:\n\n- Move to 2 (cost 1 step), close left (cost 1). Then, move to 4 (cost 2 steps), close right (cost 1). Total 5 steps.\n\nAlternatively, another approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps moving to 4 first, then closing right, then moving to 2 and closing left. How much steps would that take?\n\nInitial pos is 3.\n\nMove to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nThen, move from 4 to 2: 2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 1+1+2+1 =5 steps. Same as before.\n\nSo, same cost.\n\nSo, perhaps the order doesn't matter in terms of steps, but the movement steps are the same.\n\nWait, but what if l and r are closer to one side.\n\nFor example, suppose l is 50, r is 100, and pos is 30. So, to close left, she needs to go to 50, which is 20 steps, then close left (1 step). To close right, she needs to go from 50 to 100, 50 steps, then close right (1 step). Total steps: 21 + 50 + 2 = 73.\n\nAlternatively, close right first: go from 30 to 100 (70 steps), close right (1 step). Then, go back to 50 (50 steps), close left (1 step). Total steps: 70+1+50+1= 122 steps. So clearly, closing left first is better.\n\nSo, the order in which you do the closures affects the total steps. Hence, for cases where both left and right need to be closed, we have to consider both possibilities: close left first, then right; or close right first, then left. Choose the one with the minimal steps.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Determine if we need to close left (i.e., l > 1) and/or right (r < n).\n\n2. If neither is needed, return 0.\n\n3. Else, if only left is needed:\n\n   - Steps: move from pos to l, close left. Steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\n4. Else, if only right is needed:\n\n   - Steps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\n5. Else (both needed):\n\n   - Compute steps for both orders:\n\n      a) Close left first:\n\n         - Move to l: |pos - l| steps.\n\n         - Close left: 1 step.\n\n         - Now, a is l, so b is still n. But to close the right, we need to get to r.\n\n         So, move from l to r: |r - l| steps.\n\n         Close right: 1 step.\n\n         Total: |pos-l| + 1 + |r-l| +1.\n\n      b) Close right first:\n\n         - Move to r: |pos - r| steps.\n\n         - Close right: 1 step.\n\n         - Then, move from r to l: |r - l| steps.\n\n         - Close left: 1 step.\n\n         Total: |pos - r| +1 + |r - l| +1.\n\n   - Take the minimum of a) and b).\n\nBut wait, after closing left first, the a becomes l, so the movement is limited to l <= i <= b.\n\nBut in the case where we close left first, the movement from l to r is allowed because r >= l.\n\nSimilarly, when closing right first, after closing right, the b becomes r, and movement is allowed between a and r.\n\nSo, the movement steps are as described.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the a is l, but the b is still n until we close the right.\n\nSo, when moving from l to r after closing left, the cursor can move freely between l and n, so the movement is |r - l| steps.\n\nSame for moving from r to l after closing right.\n\nSo, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the algorithm is:\n\nCheck if l > 1 and r < n.\n\nIf not, return 0.\n\nElse, depending on the situation, compute the steps.\n\nSo, let's code this.\n\nWait, but let's think about edge cases.\n\nFor example, when l=1 and r=n, then nothing is to be closed. So steps are zero.\n\nAnother case: when l=1 and r <n: need to close right.\n\nAnother case: when r=n and l>1: need to close left.\n\nNow, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3 2 4\n\nSo, l=2>1, r=4<6.\n\nSo, need to close left and right.\n\nSo, compute both strategies.\n\nStrategy 1: close left first.\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nThen, move to 4: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: 1+1 + 2 +1 =5.\n\nStrategy 2: close right first.\n\nMove from 3 to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nThen, move to 2: 2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nTotal: 1+1 +2+1=5.\n\nSo both strategies give 5 steps.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input: ['6 3 1 3']\n\nHere, l=1, r=3. So, only right needs to be closed.\n\nr=3 <6, so she needs to close right.\n\nSo, steps: move from 3 to 3 (no steps), then close right. So 0+1=1 step.\n\nThird sample input: 5 2 1 5.\n\nNo tabs to close, so steps 0.\n\nSo, the code should handle these cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nNeed to close left and right.\n\nStrategy 1: close left first.\n\nMove to 3: 1 step. Close left: 1.\n\nMove to 5: 2 steps. Close right: 1.\n\nTotal: 4 steps.\n\nStrategy 2: close right first.\n\nMove to 5: 1 step. Close right:1.\n\nMove to 3: 2 steps. Close left:1.\n\nTotal: 4 steps.\n\nSame.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=5, l=4, r=8.\n\nNeed to close left and right.\n\nStrategy1: close left first.\n\nMove from 5 to 4: 1 step. Close left:1.\n\nThen, move from4 to8:4 steps. Close right:1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+4+1=7.\n\nStrategy2: close right first.\n\nMove from5 to8:3 steps. Close right:1.\n\nMove from8 to4:4 steps. Close left:1.\n\nTotal: 3+1+4+1=9.\n\nSo strategy1 is better.\n\nThus, the code correctly chooses the minimal steps.\n\nSo, now the plan is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nIf l ==1 and r ==n:\n\n   print(0)\n\nElse:\n\n   Check if l >1 or r <n.\n\n   If neither, print 0.\n\n   Else:\n\n      left_needed = (l >1)\n\n      right_needed = (r <n)\n\n      if not left_needed and right_needed:\n\n          steps = |pos - r| +1\n\n      elif left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n          steps = |pos - l| +1\n\n      else:\n\n          # Both needed.\n\n          option1 = (|pos - l| +1) + (|r - l| +1)\n\n          option2 = (|pos - r| +1) + (|r - l| +1)\n\n          steps = min(option1, option2)\n\n      print(steps)\n\nWait, no. Because for the case where both are needed, option1 is closing left first, which requires moving from pos to l, then to r.\n\nOption2 is closing right first, then moving to l.\n\nWait, no. In option2, after closing right, the cursor is at r. Then, to close the left, she needs to move to l.\n\nSo, the movement steps are |r - l|.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    move_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n\n    move_to_r_after_left = abs(r - l)\n\n    option1 = move_to_l + 1 + move_to_r_after_left + 1\n\n    move_to_r_initial = abs(pos - r)\n\n    move_to_l_after_right = abs(r - l)\n\n    option2 = move_to_r_initial + 1 + move_to_l_after_right +1\n\n    steps = min(option1, option2)\n\nelse:\n\n    if left_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) +1\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) +1\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nBut wait, what if l == r? Like, when l=r, but say l=3, r=3, and n=5. So, she needs to close all tabs except 3.\n\nIn that case, she can close left and right.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=1 and r=2, n=3. So, she needs to close the right (tabs 3). So steps: move to 2, close right (1 step). Or, if she is at position 3, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, no. If l=1 and r=2, she needs to close tabs 3. So, she can close right by moving to 2 (if not already there), then close right.\n\nBut in code:\n\nleft_needed = l>1? 1>1 is false, so no.\n\nright_needed = r <n? 2 <3 is true.\n\nSo, steps = |pos - r| +1.\n\nSo, if pos is 2, steps are 0 +1=1.\n\nIf pos is 3, steps are 1 (move to 2) +1=2.\n\nWait, but in that case, she can't just close right while at pos=3. Because closing right when at 3 would close all to the right of 3, but since n=3, that's nothing. So, perhaps she needs to move to 2, then close right.\n\nWait, yes. Because when she's at 3, closing right would have no effect because there are no tabs to the right of 3. So, she needs to move to 2 and close right.\n\nSo, code correctly computes that.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=1 and r= n.\n\nSo, steps 0.\n\nAnother case: when l=5, r=5, n=10.\n\nShe needs to close all except 5.\n\nSo, left and right are both needed.\n\nSo, compute option1: move to 5, close left (1), then move to 5 again (0), close right (1). Total steps: |pos -5| +1 +0 +1.\n\nOption2: move to 5, close right (1), then move to 5 (0), close left (1). Same steps.\n\nSo, regardless of order, it's |pos-5| +2.\n\nSo, code handles that.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nSo, she needs to close left and right.\n\nOption1: close left first.\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nMove to 4: 2 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal:5.\n\nOption2: close right first.\n\nMove to4:1 step.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nMove to2:2 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal:5.\n\nSame.\n\nSo, code returns 5.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute whether left_needed and right_needed.\n\nIf both are not needed, output 0.\n\nElse, if only one is needed, compute steps.\n\nElse, compute both options and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, let's write the code.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif not left_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelif not right_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    # Both needed.\n\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n    steps = min(option1, option2)\n\nprint(steps)\n\nWait, but wait. What about when l == r?\n\nIn that case, r - l is 0, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nleft_needed=True, right_needed=True.\n\noption1: |3-2| =1 +1 + (4-2)=2 +1 --> 1+1+2+1=5.\n\noption2: |3-4|=1 +1 +2+1=5.\n\nmin is 5.\n\nSample 2:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nright_needed=True.\n\nsteps: |3-3| +1=0+1=1.\n\nSample3:\n\n5 2 1 5: both not needed. steps 0.\n\nAnother test case where l=1 and r=5, n=5: steps 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3.\n\nleft_needed: True, right_needed: False.\n\nsteps: |3-2| +1=1+1=2.\n\nSo, she moves from 3 to 2, then closes left.\n\nThus, steps=2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=3, r=4.\n\nleft_needed=True, right_needed=False.\n\nWait, wait no: r=4 <5, so right_needed is True.\n\nSo, in this case, both needed.\n\noption1: move to3: 2 steps.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nthen move to4:1 step.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nTotal: 2+1+1+1=5.\n\noption2: move to4:1 step.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nthen move to3:1 step.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+1+1=4.\n\nSo, option2 is better.\n\nSo code would compute option1 as 2+1+1+1=5, option2 as 1+1+1+1=4.\n\nSo steps=4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code works.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser.
