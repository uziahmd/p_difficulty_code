He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then count how many such n's and list them.\n\nFirst, I think I need a way to compute Z(n) quickly. Also, I need to find the smallest n where Z(n) equals m, and then see how far it goes.\n\nWait, but sometimes there might be a range of n's that give the same Z(n). For example, when m=5, looking at the example, 5! has 1 zero, 6! has 2, wait no, the example says when m=1, the output is 5. So maybe I'm mixing up the example.\n\nWait, the example input was ['1', '5'], and the output was ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. Wait, for m=1, the only n is 5 because 5! is 120 which has one zero. But 6! is 720, which has two zeros. So why does the first sample output show 5 as the only one? Oh right, because the first part of the output is for m=1, which gives k=1 and the single value 5. The second part is for m=5, which gives zero values, meaning no n exists with exactly five trailing zeros.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n such that Z(n) = m.\n2. Check if the next number (n+1) also has Z(n+1) = m. If yes, find the maximum possible n where Z(n) = m.\n3. The range of n's is from the minimal n to maximal n, inclusive.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal and maximal n for a given m?\n\nI recall that for some m, there might be multiple consecutive n's that have the same Z(n). For example, let's say m=5: perhaps 24! has 5 zeros, 25! adds more because 25 contributes two 5s. Wait, but maybe not. Let's think.\n\nWait, let's calculate Z(24) and Z(25):\n\nZ(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4.\n\nZ(25) = 25//5 + 25//25 =5 +1=6.\n\nWait, so between 24 and 25, the number of zeros increases by 2. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, the output is 0.\n\nBut how about for m=6: n=25, 26, etc., up to 29.\n\nWait, Z(25) is 6. What about Z(26): 26//5=5, 26//25=1 → total 6. Similarly for 27,28,29: same as 25. But when we get to 30, Z(30) is 30//5=6 +30//25=1 → 7. So for m=6, the n's are 25,26,27,28,29 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo the approach is: for a given m, find the lower bound (the first n where Z(n)=m) and the upper bound (the last n where Z(n)=m), and then all n from lower to upper are valid.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find these bounds?\n\nOne approach is to use binary search to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m, and then check if Z(n) is exactly m. Then, find the next n where Z(n) > m, and the minimal n is somewhere in between.\n\nAlternatively, since the function Z(n) is monotonically increasing, for each m, the possible n's form a contiguous range. So the steps are:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that Z(n) = m. Let's call this left.\n2. Find the largest n such that Z(n) = m. Let's call this right.\n3. The count is right - left + 1. If no such n exists, output 0.\n\nSo the key is to find left and right.\n\nTo find left, we can perform a binary search on n. We need to find the smallest n where Z(n) == m. Wait, but binary search requires knowing the condition. Maybe it's better to find the first occurrence where Z(n) >= m, and then check if Z(n) is m, and adjust accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, find the largest n where Z(n) <= m. But wait, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to find the minimal n where Z(n) = m, and then find the maximal n where Z(n) = m. How?\n\nFor finding the left boundary:\n\n- Use binary search to find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n- Once found, check if Z(n) is equal to m. If not, then no solution exists.\n\n- If it is equal, then that's the left boundary.\n\nBut wait, what if Z(n) is larger than m? Then, perhaps the left is n-1 or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\nWe need to find the first n where Z(n) equals m.\n\nBut binary search isn't straightforward here because Z(n) can jump over m. For example, if m=5, Z(n) could go from 4 to 6, skipping 5.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to find the first n where Z(n) >= m, and then check whether Z(n) is m. If it is, then left is n. Else, there's no solution.\n\nWait, but suppose m is 5, and the minimal n where Z(n)>=5 is 25, and Z(25)=6>5. So no solution.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Binary search for the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n2. Check if Z(n) is exactly m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the largest n where Z(n) <= m. Wait, but that's not correct because Z(n) can be higher than m after some point.\n\nWait, perhaps once we have the left, we can incrementally check for the right.\n\nAlternatively, after finding the left, we can keep incrementing n until Z(n) exceeds m, keeping track of the maximum n where Z(n) is still m.\n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose m=5.\n\nWe find that Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6. So the first n where Z(n)>=5 is 25, but Z(25)=6 !=5. So no solution.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nFind the first n where Z(n)>=6. That would be 25, which has Z=6. So left=25.\n\nThen, we need to find the maximum n where Z(n)=6.\n\nCheck n=25: Z=6.\n\nn=26: Z=26//5=5, 26//25=1 → 6.\n\nn=27: same as above.\n\nn=28: same.\n\nn=29: same.\n\nn=30: Z(30)=30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7>6. So the maximum n is 29.\n\nSo right is 29.\n\nThus, the count is 29-25+1=5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n\n   a. Use binary search to find the first n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n   b. Check if Z(n) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n2. Now, find the maximum n where Z(n) = m.\n\n   a. Start from left, and keep incrementing n until Z(n) becomes greater than m.\n\n   b. The previous n is the maximum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a function to compute Z(n).\n\nThen, implement a binary search function to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m.\n\nOnce that is found, check if Z(n) is m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find the maximum n by starting from left and incrementing until Z(n) > m.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search?\n\nThe minimal possible n is 0, but since n must be positive, start from 1.\n\nWait, for m=0, but the problem says m starts from 1.\n\nWait, the constraints are m >=1.\n\nSo, for the binary search:\n\nlow = 0, high = 5*m (since 5*m is a rough upper bound for n, because each 5 contributes at least one zero.)\n\nWait, but in reality, for m=5, 5*5=25, which is the correct n where Z(n)=6.\n\nSo, setting high to 5*m is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, using a higher initial high, like 1e18, is acceptable.\n\nBut for efficiency, 5*m is a good starting point.\n\nSo, the binary search will find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n\nOnce found, check if Z(n) == m. If not, return 0.\n\nElse, proceed to find the right.\n\nNow, for the binary search function.\n\nLet me think of the binary search logic.\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if Z(mid) < m:\n\n       low = mid + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       high = mid\n\nAt the end, low should be the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n\nWait, but for example, when m=6:\n\nlow starts at 0, high=30.\n\nmid is 15: Z(15)=3 <6 → low=16.\n\nmid is (16+30)/2=23: Z(23)=4+0=4<6 → low=24.\n\nmid is (24+30)/2=27: Z(27)=5 + 1=6 ≥6 → high=27.\n\nNow, mid=(24+27)/2=25.5 → 25. Check Z(25)=6≥6 → high=25.\n\nLoop continues until low and high converge to 25.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the binary search seems to work.\n\nOnce we have low, which is the first n with Z(n)>=m, we check if Z(low) == m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, we need to find the maximum n where Z(n) ==m.\n\nHow?\n\nStart from low, and keep checking n+1, n+2, etc., until Z(n) >m.\n\nThe maximum is the last n before Z(n) exceeds m.\n\nSo, for example, in the case of m=6:\n\nlow=25.\n\nCheck Z(25)=6.\n\nCheck 26: Z=6.\n\nCheck 27: same.\n\nCheck 28: same.\n\nCheck 29: same.\n\nCheck 30: Z=7>6 → stop.\n\nSo the maximum is 29.\n\nSo, code-wise, after finding low, we can loop from low upwards, and for each n, compute Z(n). If Z(n) exceeds m, break.\n\nThe maximum is the last n where Z(n) was equal to m.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute low via binary search.\n\nif Z(low) != m → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   current_max = low\n\n   while True:\n\n       next_n = current_max +1\n\n       if Z(next_n) > m:\n\n           break\n\n       current_max = next_n\n\nSo, the count is current_max - low +1.\n\nSo now, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, write a helper function count_trailing_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThe helper function can be implemented as:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThat's efficient enough.\n\nNow, the binary search.\n\nImplement a function find_min_n(m) that returns the minimal n where Z(n)>=m.\n\nBut wait, the binary search is within a function.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low =0\n    high =5*m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    # After loop, low is the minimal n where Z(n)>=m\n    return low\n\nThen, after finding low, check if count_trailing_zeros(low) ==m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, find the maximum n where Z(n)==m.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nRead m from input.\n\nHandle the case where m is 0: but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nSo, proceed.\n\nCompute low.\n\nIf Z(low) !=m → print 0.\n\nElse, find current_max.\n\ncurrent_max = low\n\nloop:\n\ncurrent_max +=1\n\ncompute Z(current_max)\n\nif Z(current_max) >m → break.\n\nElse, continue.\n\nOnce loop breaks, collect all n from low to current_max, inclusive.\n\nThen, output the count and the numbers.\n\nWait, but what if current_max is very large? Like, for m=10^5, the current_max could be up to around 5e5 or something. Looping could take O(5e5) steps, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    res=0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        res +=n\n    return res\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low=0\n    high=5*m\n    while low<high:\n        mid=(low+high)//2\n        z=count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z<m:\n            low=mid+1\n        else:\n            high=mid\n    return low\n\nlow = find_min_n(m)\nif count_trailing_zeros(low)!=m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    current_max=low\n    while True:\n        current_max +=1\n        z=count_trailing_zeros(current_max)\n        if z>m:\n            break\n    # Now, the numbers are from low to current_max-1 inclusive\n    count = current_max - low\n    print(count)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, current_max))))\n\nWait, wait. Wait, in the loop, current_max starts at low.\n\nIn the loop, current_max is incremented by 1, and checked.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, current_max is low. So, in the loop, we check current_max +1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nThe initial current_max is low, which is the first n with Z(n)=m.\n\nWe want to find the largest n where Z(n)=m.\n\nSo, we can start by setting current_max to low.\n\nThen, in the loop, check n=current_max+1.\n\nIf Z(n) >m → break.\n\nElse, set current_max to n.\n\nContinue.\n\nSo, for m=6, low=25.\n\ncurrent_max is 25.\n\nLoop:\n\nn=26: Z=6 → current_max=26.\n\nn=27: Z=6 → current_max=27.\n\nn=28: same → current_max=28.\n\nn=29: same → current_max=29.\n\nn=30: Z=7>6 → break.\n\nSo current_max is 29.\n\nThus, the numbers are from 25 to 29 inclusive, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code needs to output all n from low to current_max inclusive.\n\nWait, no: because after the loop, current_max is the first n where Z(n) >m.\n\nSo the last n where Z(n)=m is current_max-1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nafter the loop, the max n is current_max-1.\n\nSo, the range is from low to current_max-1, inclusive.\n\nThus, the count is current_max-1 - low +1 = current_max - low.\n\nAnd the numbers are [low, low+1,..., current_max-1].\n\nThus, in code:\n\ncount = current_max - low\n\nprint(count)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(low, current_max))))\n\nBecause range is exclusive on the upper end, so range(low, current_max) includes low, low+1,..., current_max-1.\n\nSo, in the code, after the loop, we have:\n\nnumbers = list(range(low, current_max))\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTesting the example:\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nCompute low: find the minimal n where Z(n)>=1.\n\nBinary search:\n\nlow=0, high=5.\n\nmid=2 → Z(2)=0 <1 → low=3.\n\nmid=(3+5)/2=4 → Z(4)=0 <1 → low=5.\n\nmid=5: Z(5)=1 >=1 → high=5.\n\nLoop ends, low=5.\n\nCheck Z(5)=1 ==1 → yes.\n\nThen, find current_max.\n\ncurrent_max=5.\n\nCheck 6: Z(6)=1+1=2>1 → break.\n\nSo current_max remains 5.\n\nNumbers are 5 to 5, so output 1 and 5.\n\nSample Output is '5' followed by '5'.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nCompute low:\n\nbinary search finds minimal n where Z(n)>=5.\n\nLet's see:\n\nWhat is Z(20): 20//5=4, 20//25=0 → 4.\n\nZ(21)=4, ..., Z(24)=4.\n\nZ(25)=5+1=6.\n\nSo for m=5, the binary search would find low=25, but Z(25)=6≠5 → output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nlow=25.\n\ncurrent_max=25.\n\ncheck 26: Z=6.\n\ncurrent_max becomes 26.\n\ncheck 27: same.\n\ncurrent_max=27.\n\ncheck 28: same.\n\ncurrent_max=28.\n\ncheck 29: same.\n\ncurrent_max=29.\n\ncheck 30: Z=7>6 → break.\n\nSo numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 → 5 numbers.\n\nThus, code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about m=0? Well, according to the problem statement, m starts from 1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, what about the edge case where m is very large?\n\nFor example, m=1e5.\n\nWe need to compute the binary search correctly.\n\nBut since the binary search is O(log(5e5)) steps, it's manageable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the code may take time when the current_max is large, but since each step increments by 1 and computes Z(n), it's O(k) time where k is the number of n's in the range. For m=1e5, this could be up to 5e5 steps, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut wait, for m=1e5, what is the number of n's?\n\nWell, the trailing zeros increase by 1 when n is a multiple of 5 but not 25, 125, etc.\n\nWait, the number of n's can vary. For m=1e5, the number of n's is likely to be small.\n\nBut for the code, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nFind the minimal n where Z(n)>=2.\n\nZ(5)=1 <2.\n\nZ(6)=1 → wait no.\n\nWait, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1 (because 6//5=1), Z(7)=1, ..., Z(9)=1.\n\nWait, no: 10//5=2 → Z(10)=2.\n\nSo the minimal n is 10.\n\nCheck Z(10)=2.\n\nThen find current_max:\n\ncurrent_max starts at 10.\n\nCheck 11: Z=2.\n\ncurrent_max=11.\n\nCheck 12: Z=2.\n\n... up to 14.\n\nCheck 15: 15//5=3, 15//25=0 → Z=3>2 → break.\n\nSo current_max is 14.\n\nNumbers are 10,11,12,13,14 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo the output is 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nSo code should correctly output this.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.

Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the count of 5s in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\).
