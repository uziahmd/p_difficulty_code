Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about moving between blocks in Crazy Town. Each block is a region divided by roads, which are lines on the plane. Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, but the movement is only allowed if they share a border of non-zero length. So each step is crossing one road.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from my home's block to the university's block.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model how each road affects the possible path. Since each step is a cross over a single road, maybe the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points. Or wait, perhaps it's similar to the concept of planar regions and the number of lines you need to cross.\n\nWait, think about it: in a plane divided by multiple lines, each line can potentially separate the space into two. The minimal steps would be the number of lines that separate the two points in such a way that each step crosses one line.\n\nSo, perhaps for each road, I can check whether my home and the university lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, then crossing that road is necessary. The total count of such roads would be the minimal steps required.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each road that separates the two points adds one step. So the answer is the count of roads where the home and university are on different sides.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each road, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of such roads. That's the minimal number of steps.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nFor each line ax + by + c = 0, compute the value of (ax1 + by1 + c) and (ax2 + by2 + c) for the home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2). If the signs of these two values are different, it means they are on opposite sides of the line, so we need to cross this line. Therefore, increment the count.\n\nBut wait, what if the value is zero? Well, the problem statement says that neither home nor university lie on any road, so the values will never be zero. So no need to handle that case.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\n- Read the home coordinates (x1, y1).\n- Read the university coordinates (x2, y2).\n- Read n, the number of roads.\n- Initialize a counter to 0.\n- For each road:\n   - Read a, b, c.\n   - Compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n   - Compute val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n   - If val1 * val2 < 0, then the points are on opposite sides. Increment counter.\n- Output the counter as the answer.\n\nThat sounds manageable. Now, let's test this logic against the example.\n\nIn the sample input, the first case has two roads. Let's see:\n\nFirst road: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. Home is (1,1), which is above, university is (-1,-1), which is also above (since y is -1, but wait, wait. Wait, the line is y=0. So home is y=1, which is above; university is y=-1, which is below. So for this line, the signs are opposite. So count increases by 1.\n\nSecond road: 1x + 0y -3 = 0 → x=3. Home is x=1 (left of 3), university is x=-1 (also left of 3). So same side. So no increment.\n\nSo total count is 1. But the sample output is 2. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait wait, maybe I misunderstood the sample input. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the sample input has two test cases. Oh right, because the problem seems to have two outputs. Wait, no, looking back: the problem says output the answer for each case. So the first part is the home and university, then the second is with three roads.\n\nWait, no, in the sample input, the first line after the initial two lines is '2' meaning n=2, then two roads. The output is 2 and 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the first test case.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the first test case:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nHome: (1,1)\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\nn=2\nRoads:\n0 1 0 → y=0\n1 0 0 → x=0\n\nWait, for the first road (y=0): home is y=1 (positive), university y=-1 (negative). So opposite sides. So count +=1.\n\nSecond road (x=0): home x=1 (positive), university x=-1 (negative). Opposite sides. So count becomes 2.\n\nAh, I see! So both roads separate the two points. So the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic is correct.\n\nAnother example: when there are three roads, perhaps all three separate the points, leading to a count of 3.\n\nSo the approach is solid.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nWe need to read the input correctly. The first two lines are home and university. Then n, followed by n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo, read x1, y1 from the first line. x2, y2 from the second. Then n from third line. Then loop n times, reading a, b, c each time.\n\nCompute for each line:\n\nval1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 <0 → increment.\n\nFinally, print the count as an integer.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if the points are the same? Well, according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that home and university are not on any road, but they could be in the same block. So in that case, the count is 0.\n\nAnother case: multiple lines, some separating, others not.\n\nI think this approach handles all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling very large numbers: but in Python, integers can be big, so no problem.\n\n- Overflow: but since the constraints are up to 1e6, and a, b, c are up to 1e6 in magnitude, their product could be up to 1e12, but Python handles that.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nRead the first line: x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nSecond line: x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount =0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 <0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nLine 1: 0x +1y +0 → y=0. val1=1, val2=-1 → product is negative → count 1.\n\nLine 2: 1x+0y+0 → x=0. val1=1, val2=-1 → product is negative → count 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nSame home and university.\n\nn=3\n\nLines:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0. home is x=1, univ x=-1 → opposite → count +=1.\n\n0 1 0 → y=0. same as before → count +=1.\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y =3. home: 1+1=2 <3 → val1=2-3= -1. univ: -1 + (-1) =-2 <3 → val2=-2-3=-5. Both negative → same side. So no count.\n\nThus total is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a road defined by a line equation, and the movement is allowed only if the two blocks share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads in Crazy Town are represented as lines on a plane. Each line divides the plane into two regions. To move from one region to another, you must cross a line (road). The goal is to find the minimum number of such crossings needed to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road (line), check if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the line. If they do, crossing this road is necessary. The total number of such necessary crossings gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each line, compute the value of the line equation at the coordinates of the home and the university.\n   - If these values have opposite signs, it means the home and university are on opposite sides of the line, and thus this line must be crossed.\n   - Count the number of such lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of roads, making it efficient even for the upper constraint of 300 roads.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads. Each road's coefficients (a, b, c) are then read.\n- **Line Evaluation**: For each line, the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates is computed.\n- **Crossing Check**: If the product of these values is negative, the points are on opposite sides of the line, indicating a necessary crossing.\n- **Count Steps**: The total count of such necessary crossings is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps required by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their regions on a plane.",
