They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find all winning integers x such that there's a permutation p of 1 to 2^n where the team with skill x becomes the champion. The tournament structure is a knockout style with each phase determining which teams move on based on the given string s.\n\nFirst, let me understand the tournament structure and how the phases work. The tournament has n phases. In each phase i (starting from 0 maybe?), the number of games is 2^(n-i), and each game reduces the number of teams by half. Wait, no: in the first phase, the number of games is 2^{n-1} because you have 2^n teams, so each pair plays once, resulting in 2^{n-1} winners. Then the second phase has 2^{n-2} games, etc., until the nth phase has one game that determines the champion.\n\nWait, no: the problem statement says that in the first phase, the teams are split into pairs, so 2^{n-1} games. Then the next phase has 2^{n-2} games, but wait, no—after the first phase, 2^{n-1} teams remain. So the next phase would be 2^{n-1 -1} = 2^{n-2} games? Because each game eliminates one team, so each game leaves the winner plus the losers. Wait, the number of games in phase i is 2^{n-i}, and the number of teams after phase i is 2^{n-i}.\n\nWait, let me think again. Initially, 2^n teams. After phase 1, they play 2^{n-1} games, each eliminating one team, so 2^{n-1} winners remain. Then phase 2 has 2^{n-2} games, which will leave 2^{n-2} winners. This continues until phase n, which has 1 game, leaving one winner as the champion.\n\nSo for each phase i (from 0 to n-1, perhaps?), the number of games is 2^{(n-1) - i}, since in the first phase it's 2^{n-1}, then 2^{n-2}, etc., down to 1 game in the last phase.\n\nNow, the string s is of length n, where each character s_i represents the outcome of the i-th phase. Wait, no: s_i is the result of the i-th phase. Wait, the problem statement says, \"s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase...\". So phase 0 is the first phase, phase 1 is the next, up to phase n-1.\n\nWait, no: the first phase is the initial grouping into pairs. Then the second phase is the next level, etc. So the string s has n characters, each corresponding to a phase from 1 to n? Or perhaps 0 to n-1? Let me check the problem statement: \"s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase...\". So the phases are numbered from 1 to n? Or 0 to n-1?\n\nWait, the example input is:\n\nFor the first sample input:\n3\n101\n\nThe output is 4 5 6 7, 2, 2 3.\n\nWait, let's see what that means. For n=3, the tournament has 8 teams, 7 games total. Phases are 3 in total.\n\nEach phase has s_i as follows: s_0=1, s_1=0, s_2=1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string s has length n, which is 3 in this case. So for i=0,1,2.\n\nSo phase 0: s[0] is '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nPhase 1: s[1] is '0' → lower skill wins.\n\nPhase 2: s[2] is '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nIn each phase, the matches are determined as follows: in phase 0, it's the initial groupings into 4 matches (since 2^3-1=7 games, but wait no—wait, 2^3 is 8 teams, phase 0 has 4 games (since 8/2=4), producing 4 winners. Phase 1 has 2 games (4/2=2), producing 2 winners. Phase 2 has 1 game (2/2=1), producing the champion.\n\nSo each phase i (from 0 to n-1) corresponds to s[i].\n\nNow, for each phase, the way teams are paired depends on their previous outcomes. For example, in phase 0, it's the initial pairing: 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. But in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all winning integers x such that there exists a permutation p of integers from 1 to 2^n where the team with skill x wins the tournament. The tournament structure is a knockout style with each phase determining which teams move on based on the given string s.\n\n### Approach\nThe tournament consists of n phases. In each phase i (from 0 to n-1), the number of games is 2^(n-i). Each game results in the elimination of one team, and the winner moves on to the next phase. The outcome of each phase is determined by the corresponding character in the string s. If s[i] is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nTo find all winning integers, we can model the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a match, and the edges represent the winners of each match. The key idea is to determine the possible ranges of skill values that can win at each stage of the tournament, considering the outcomes dictated by the string s.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Each phase is represented by s[i], for i from 0 to n-1\n    # We will simulate the tournament for all possible permutations\n    # But since 2^18 is way too big, we need a smarter approach\n    # Instead, we can model the possible winners at each level of the tournament\n    \n    # Let's represent the current set of possible candidates for each position\n    # We'll track the range of possible values that can reach each position after each phase\n    \n    # Initialize: At phase 0, each match is between two consecutive pairs\n    # So the first phase has 2^(n-1) matches, each reducing two numbers into one\n    # We can model this as a list of possible intervals or sets\n    \n    # For each phase, we'll compute the possible winners\n    # We can represent the possible winners as a list of tuples (min_val, max_val)\n    \n    # Initially, each pair in the first phase is (2k-1, 2k), so min is 2k-1 and max is 2k\n    # After phase 0, the winners are the larger of the two (if s[0] is '1') or the smaller (if '0')\n    \n    # We can represent the possible ranges after each phase using intervals\n    # We'll process each phase and update the possible ranges\n    \n    # The final answer is the union of all possible x that can be the champion\n    \n    # Let's model the tournament in layers:\n    # Each layer corresponds to a phase\n    # Each layer has 2^i matches, resulting in 2^(n - i - 1) winners\n    # Wait, maybe it's easier to process each phase step by step\n    \n    # Let's create a list of possible intervals for each position after each phase\n    # Each interval represents the possible minimum and maximum values that can reach that position\n    \n    # Initialize the starting points for each match in phase 0\n    # The initial matches are (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2^k-1, 2^k)\n    # For phase 0, each match's result depends on s[0]\n    phase = 0\n    current_matches = []\n    for i in range(0, n):\n        # For phase i, the matches are grouped into 2^(n-i) groups, each with 2 matches\n        # Wait, no.

For each phase, determine the possible winners based on the previous phase's winners and the current s[i]\n        # 2. Use a list of intervals to represent the possible winners at each phase\n        # 3.

Each phase reduces the number of possible winners by half, and the intervals are adjusted based on whether the lower or higher-skilled team wins in that phase. After processing all phases, the union of the final intervals gives all possible winning integers x. The algorithm efficiently narrows down the possible winners at each stage, ensuring that all valid champions are identified.",
