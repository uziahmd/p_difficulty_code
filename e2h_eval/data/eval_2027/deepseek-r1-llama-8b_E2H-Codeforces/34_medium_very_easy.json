And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is probably not going to work because that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved. For each possible window of size k, I need to sum those k elements, add all those sums together, and then divide by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1). That makes sense.\n\nBut if I do it naively by sliding a window and adding each time, that's O(n*k), which is definitely not feasible when n is 2e5. So I need a smarter way.\n\nOh right! Prefix sums can help here. Because with prefix sums, I can compute the sum of any subarray in constant time after preprocessing.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array of the sleep times.\n2. For each window from i=0 to i=(n-k), calculate the sum as prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n3. Sum all these window sums and then divide by the number of windows.\n\nYes, that sounds efficient. The prefix sum array will take O(n) time and space, and then computing each window is O(1). So overall, the time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Read n and k.\n- Read the list of a's.\n- Compute the prefix sum array. The prefix sum at index i is the sum of the first i elements. But wait, sometimes it's 1-based or 0-based. I need to decide. Maybe 0-based, where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. So for the window starting at index i (0-based) and of length k, the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nWait, let's make sure: the prefix sum array has size n+1, where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], ..., prefix[n] = sum(a).\n\nSo for a window starting at position i (0-based) and of length k, the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]. But since the windows are k-length, the starting indices go from 0 to (n - k) inclusive. So the number of windows is n - k + 1.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nOnce I have all the window sums, I need to compute the total sum of all these window sums, then divide by (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nWait, but what about handling very large numbers? Since a_i can be up to 1e5, and n is up to 2e5, the total sum could be up to 2e10, which is manageable in Python as it handles big integers.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to print the average with at least six decimal places. So I'll calculate the total sum as a float or double and then format the output accordingly.\n\nLet me think about some test cases.\n\nTake the example given:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nThe windows are [3,4], [4,7], summing to 7 and 11. Total is 18, divided by 2 gives 9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nAnother example:\n\nInput:\n1 1\n10\n\nOnly one window, sum is 10, average is 10.\n\nThird example:\n\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo there are 8-2+1 =7 windows.\n\nCompute each window:\n\n1+2 =3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=101123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nSum all these:\n\n3 +6 =9; 9+100004=100013; +101123 →201136; +579 →201715; +1245 →203,960; +790 →204,750.\n\nTotal sum is 204750. Divided by 7: 204750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... So output is that.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line has two integers, n and k. The second line has n integers.\n\nIn Python, I can read the input using input().split().\n\nSo:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute the prefix sum.\n\nprefix = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, compute the sum of each window.\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(n -k +1):\n    total += prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]\n\naverage = total / (n -k +1)\n\nThen, print it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but the output requires at least six digits, but the examples have ten. So perhaps we can just print with 10 digits after the decimal point.\n\nSo print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average)).\n\nWait, but what about floating point precision? Well, Python's float is precise enough for most cases, but since the sum can be very large, perhaps we should use integer division and then represent as a float.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using floating points for the prefix sums might cause issues, but I think in this case, since all a_i are integers, the sum is an integer. So using integers for prefix is better.\n\nYes, so the variables can be kept as integers until the end.\n\nSo code steps are correct.\n\nTesting the code on the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nprefix becomes [0,3,7,14]\n\nsumming the two windows: 3+4=7, 4+7=11. Sum is 18, average 9.\n\nSecond example: n=1, k=1, a=10. sum is 10, average 10.\n\nThird example: as before.\n\nSo the code should handle these correctly.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if k=1? Then each a_i is a window, so the average is the same as the average of all a's.\n\nAnother edge case: n=k. So only one window, which is the entire array. So average is the sum divided by 1.\n\nWhat about n=2, k=2: sum of the whole array, average is sum/(1).\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nAnother edge case: when k=0? Wait no, the constraints say 1<=k<=n, so no.\n\nWhat about when n is 2e5 and k is 2e5? Then the loop runs once, sum is the total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, about the computation of the average.\n\nIn Python, when you do integer division, using / will give a float. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead a.\n\nCompute prefix.\n\nCompute total as the sum of all window sums.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nWait, also note that the problem says the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is <=1e-6. So printing 10 digits is more than sufficient.\n\nSo the code should be something like:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\ntotal = 0\nwindow_count = n - k + 1\nfor i in range(window_count):\n    total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\naverage = total / window_count\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the third example, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 decimal digits? Or more?\n\nWait, the sample output shows:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nSo the third output is printed with 10 decimal digits but perhaps more? Hmm, but the problem statement says to output at least 6. So to match the examples, perhaps it's better to print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample outputs, the third one is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 digits after the decimal. So perhaps the code should output exactly 10 decimal digits.\n\nThus, the code uses .10f, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on given sleep records for consecutive days. The solution should efficiently handle large input sizes and ensure precision in the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given `n` days of sleep data and `k` consecutive days as a week. We need to compute the average sleep time over all possible windows of size `k`. The number of such windows is `n - k + 1`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Directly summing each window of size `k` would be inefficient for large `n`. Instead, using a prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time after preprocessing.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: This helps in efficiently calculating the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of the first `i` elements.\n   - **Sliding Window Technique**: Using the prefix sum array, we can quickly compute the sum of each window of size `k`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time due to the linear computation of the prefix sum array and the sliding window technique. This ensures efficiency even for large input sizes.\n\n5. **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with up to 10 decimal places to meet the required precision constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal = 0\nwindow_count = n - k + 1\nfor i in range(window_count):\n    total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n\naverage = total / window_count\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep times array.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: For each possible window of size `k`, compute the sum using the prefix sum array. Accumulate these sums to get the total sleep time across all windows.\n4. **Average Calculation**: Compute the average sleep time by dividing the total sleep time by the number of windows.\n5. **Output**: Print the average with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure accuracy within the problem's constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures accurate results with optimal performance.",
