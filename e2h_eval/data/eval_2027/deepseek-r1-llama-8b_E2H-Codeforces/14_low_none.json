He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then count how many such n's and list them.\n\nFirst, I think I need a way to compute Z(n) quickly. Also, I need to find the smallest n where Z(n) equals m, and then see how far it goes.\n\nWait, but sometimes multiple n's can have the same Z(n). For example, as in the sample input, m=1: 5! is 120, which has one zero. But 6! is 720 (one zero too?), wait no. Wait 5! is 120, which has 1 trailing zero. 6! is 720, which also has 1 trailing zero? Or wait, no, 6! is 720, which ends with one zero as well. So wait, why does the sample say that for m=1, the output is 5?\n\nWait, let me check. Oh wait, no. Let me compute:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero.\n6! = 720 → 1 zero.\n7! = 5040 → 1 zero.\n8! = 40320 → 1 zero.\n9! = 362880 → 1 zero.\n10! = 3628800 → 2 zeros.\n\nSo for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. So five numbers. Hence the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, the minimal n where Z(n) = m is found, and then we check how many consecutive n's have Z(n) equal to m before the next increment.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the lower bound where Z(n) = m. Let's call this lower_n.\n\n2. Find the upper bound where Z(n) = m. It's the maximum n where Z(n) = m before Z(n+1) exceeds m.\n\n3. The number of such n's is upper_n - lower_n + 1.\n\nBut how do I find lower_n and upper_n efficiently?\n\nI think a binary search approach would work here. Since Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. So for a given m, the possible n's form a contiguous range, and we can find the starting point and the ending point.\n\nSo first, I'll write a helper function to compute Z(n). That's straightforward.\n\nThen, perform a binary search to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. But wait, since Z(n) increases by at least 1 each time n crosses a multiple of 5, perhaps more, but in any case, for a given m, the minimal n where Z(n) = m is the lower bound, and the maximal n is the upper bound.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that for the lower bound, Z(n) is exactly m. So perhaps the binary search should find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m, and then check if Z(n) is m. If not, then there are zero solutions. Wait, no, because m could be zero, but in our problem m starts from 1.\n\nWait, no. The problem says m can be 1 up to 100000. So for each m, there must be at least one n where Z(n) is m, right? Or wait, no. For example, if m is larger than what's possible for some n, but I think for the constraints given, m is up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for example, when m is 0, the only n is 0, but in our case m starts from 1.\n\nSo, let me proceed.\n\nImplementing a binary search to find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m. But after finding that n, I need to check whether Z(n) is indeed m. Because if the binary search finds n where Z(n) is larger than m, but the minimal such n, then perhaps there's a gap between n and n-1.\n\nWait, but that can't happen because Z(n) is non-decreasing as n increases. So once Z(n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. Additionally, we need to list these integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Formula for Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes \\( Z(n) \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, we use binary search. We first find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). If \\( Z(n) \\) is exactly \\( m \\), we then find the largest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) \\) remains \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Count and List Valid \\( n \\) Values**: Once the bounds are found, we count the number of valid \\( n \\) values and list them in increasing order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower_bound(m):\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m  # Initial range\n    lower_n = -1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z >= m:\n            if z == m:\n                lower_n = mid\n            right = mid - 1\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    return lower_n\n\ndef find_upper_bound(m, lower_n):\n    if lower_n is None or count_zeroes(lower_n) != m:\n        return None\n    left, right = lower_n, 5 * m\n    upper_n = -1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z == m:\n            upper_n = mid\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return upper_n\n\nm = int(input())\nif m == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    lower_n = find_lower_bound(m)\n    if lower_n is None:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper_n = find_upper_bound(m, lower_n)\n        if upper_n is None:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            count = upper_n - lower_n + 1\n            print(count)\n            if count > 0:\n                print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n + 1))))\n            else:\n                print()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeroes Function**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) using the formula described.\n2. **find_lower_bound Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\).\n3. **find_upper_bound Function**: This function finds the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\) starting from the lower bound found.\n4. **Main Logic**: The main logic reads the input \\( m \\), checks if \\( m \\) is zero, and then uses the helper functions to determine the valid range of \\( n \\) values. It prints the count and the list of valid \\( n \\) values.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and handles the constraints effectively.",
