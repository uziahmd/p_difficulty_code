The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot. My task is to calculate how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm, right. So each round, both choose their move based on their respective sequences. The key is that each uses a cyclic sequence: for example, if A is \"RPS\", then the moves go R, P, S, R, P, S, etc. Similarly for B.\n\nSo for each round i (from 0 to n-1), we need to determine who wins, and increment their red spot count accordingly.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. And the sequences can be up to 1000 characters each. So, we need an efficient way to compute this without doing O(n) operations per step, because 2e5 * 1000 is 2e8, which might be a bit tight for Python.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 2e5 steps with each step taking O(1) would be okay. Because 2e5 is manageable. But if for each step, I have to loop through the sequences to find their current move, that could be expensive. So maybe precompute the move for each player for each possible round.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, let's think about precomputing the move for each player at each step.\n\nFor example, for each round i, the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], since the sequence cycles every m steps. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nOnce we have both moves for the i-th round, we determine the winner and add to the respective count.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, A, B.\n2. Precompute the moves for each player for all possible rounds, but wait, n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable by just computing on the fly for each round.\n3. For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Compute a_move = A[round_number % len(A)]\n   b. Compute b_move = B[round_number % len(B)]\n   c. Determine if a beats b, b beats a, or it's a draw.\n4. If a beats b: Polycarpus gets a spot.\n5. Else if b beats a: Nikephoros gets a spot.\n6. Else: no one gets a spot.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in each round, the winner is the one whose move beats the other. So if a_move beats b_move, then a wins, so Polycarpus loses and gets a spot. If b_move beats a_move, then a loses and gets a spot. Otherwise, it's a draw, no spots.\n\nSo for each round:\n\nif a beats b: Poly gets +1\nelse if b beats a: Nike gets +1\nelse: nothing.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize two counters, nike_red and poly_red, to 0.\n- For each round in 0 to n-1:\n   get a_move = A[(i) % len_A]\n   get b_move = B[(i) % len_B]\n   check if a beats b: if yes, poly_red +=1\n   else if b beats a: nike_red +=1\n   else: do nothing.\n\nSo the main thing is to efficiently compute a_move and b_move for each i.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, and each step being O(1), this should be manageable.\n\nNow, the question is: how to represent the sequences as strings, and then for each i, find the corresponding character.\n\nIn Python, strings are zero-based. So for a given i, the index is i mod len_A for A, same for B.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nRead A as a string, stripping any newlines.\n\nSame for B.\n\nCompute len_A = len(A), len_B = len(B).\n\nInitialize counters to 0.\n\nLoop i from 0 to n-1:\n\na_char = A[i % len_A]\n\nb_char = B[i % len_B]\n\nThen determine the outcome.\n\nHow to determine if a_char beats b_char?\n\nWe can have a helper function or a lookup.\n\nAlternatively, we can represent the beats as a dictionary or something.\n\nFor example, beats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nBecause:\n\nRock(R) beats Scissors(S)\n\nScissors(S) beat Paper(P)\n\nPaper(P) beats Rock(R).\n\nSo for a given a and b:\n\nif b is the value that a beats, then a beats b, so a wins.\n\nElse",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games. Each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B` for both players.\n2. **Cyclic Move Calculation**: For each round, determine the move of each player using their respective cyclic sequences.\n3. **Determine Winner**: For each round, check if the move of the first player (Nikephoros) beats the move of the second player (Polycarpus). If it does, Polycarpus gets a red spot. If the move of Polycarpus beats Nikephoros's move, then Nikephoros gets a red spot. If it's a draw, no one gets a red spot.\n4. **Count Red Spots**: Maintain counters for the number of red spots each player accumulates.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nlen_A = len(A)\nlen_B = len(B)\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike_red = 0\npoly_red = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % len_A]\n    b_move = B[i % len_B]\n    \n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue  # Draw, no red spots\n    \n    if beats[a_move] == b_move:\n        # Nikephoros wins, Poly gets a spot\n        poly_red += 1\n    else:\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nike gets a spot\n        nike_red += 1\n\nprint(nike_red, poly_red)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **Cyclic Move Calculation**: For each round `i`, the move of each player is determined by cycling through their respective sequences using modulo operations.\n3. **Determine Winner**: Using a dictionary to map each move to the move it beats, the code checks if either player's move beats the other's. If so, the appropriate counter is incremented.\n4. **Count Red Spots**: The counters for the red spots are updated based on who loses each round, and the results are printed at the end.\n\nThis approach ensures that each round is processed efficiently in constant time, making the solution scalable even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
