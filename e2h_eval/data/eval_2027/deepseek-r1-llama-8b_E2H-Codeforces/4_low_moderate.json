The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm. The key here is to figure out who loses each round based on their strategies and then count the losses for each.\n\nLet me break down the problem. Each player has their own sequence of moves that they cycle through. So, for example, if Nikephoros's sequence is \"RPS\" and Polycarpus's is \"RSPP\", he'll play R, P, S, R, P, S, etc., and similarly for the other.\n\nFor each round i (from 1 to n), we need to determine what each plays. Then, decide who wins and add a point to the loser.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each round, determine the move of both players.\n2. Determine the winner of that round.\n3. Add a red spot to the loser.\n4. After all rounds, sum up the red spots for each.\n\nBut wait, with n up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to compute this without simulating each round step by step. Because if n is 200,000 and each sequence is up to 1000, that's manageable, but we need to find a pattern or a way to calculate the total without looping each round.\n\nWait, but let's think: for each possible pair of moves, how often does each outcome happen over the cycles of A and B.\n\nBecause the sequences are cyclic, perhaps we can model this as the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of A and B. Then, for each possible pair (a from A, b from B), determine how many times each pair occurs in the first LCM(n, lenA, lenB) rounds, multiply by the number of full cycles, and handle the remaining rounds.\n\nAlternatively, since n could be up to 2e5, which is manageable, maybe just simulate each round efficiently.\n\nBut wait, simulating each round is O(n), which is acceptable because n is up to 2e5, which is manageable in Python.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the move for each player for each round, up to n rounds.\n\nFor each player, their move in the i-th round is determined by the i-th position in their cyclic sequence.\n\nBut computing this for each i might be time-consuming if done naively. Wait, but for each i, the index is i mod m for A, and i mod k for B.\n\nSo, for i from 0 to n-1:\n\n- a_move = A[i % len_A]\n- b_move = B[i % len_B]\n\nThen, determine if a beats b, b beats a, or draw.\n\nSo, for each round, compute whether a beats b, and increment the loser's count accordingly.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, A, B.\n\n2. Compute the length of A and B: lenA = len(A), lenB = len(B).\n\n3. Initialize two counters: nike_red and poly_red to 0.\n\n4. For each round in 0 to n-1:\n\n   a. Compute the current move for each player:\n\n      a_move = A[ (round_num) % lenA ]\n\n      b_move = B[ (round_num) % lenB ]\n\n   b. Compare the two moves:\n\n      - If a beats b: Poly loses, add 1 to nike_red.\n\n      - Else if b beats a: Nike loses, add 1 to poly_red.\n\n      - Else: no change.\n\n5. After processing all rounds, output the two counts.\n\nWait, but wait! In the sample input, let's see:\n\nSample Input:\n7\nRPS\nRSPP\n\nSample Output:\n3 2\n\nLet me see:\n\nRound 1 (i=0):\n\nA[0] = 'R', B[0] = 'R' → Draw. No points.\n\nRound 2 (i=1):\n\nA[1] = 'P'; B[1] = 'S' → P beats S? Wait, no. Wait, the rules are:\n\nRock beats Scissors.\n\nScissors beat Paper.\n\nPaper beats Rock.\n\nSo, let's think:\n\nIf a_move is 'R' and b_move is 'S' → R beats S → a wins, so b loses. So in this case, a is Nikephoros, so Poly gets a red spot.\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the loser is the one who gets pinched. So in each round, the person whose move is beaten loses.\n\nSo, when a_move beats b_move: a wins",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on each player after they play a specified number of rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each player follows a cyclic strategy for their moves, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game is played in rounds where each player cycles through their respective sequences of moves. The loser of each round gets a red spot. We need to count the red spots for each player after all rounds.\n2. **Cyclic Moves**: Each player's moves are cyclic. For example, if a player's sequence is \"RPS\", they will play 'R' in the first round, 'P' in the second, 'S' in the third, and then repeat from the start.\n3. **Efficient Round Simulation**: Given the constraints, simulating each round directly is feasible. For each round, determine the move of each player based on their cyclic sequence and check who wins.\n4. **Determine Winners**: For each round, compare the moves using the game rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock). The loser gets a red spot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nlenA = len(A)\nlenB = len(B)\n\nnike_red = 0\npoly_red = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % lenA]\n    b_move = B[i % lenB]\n    \n    # Determine who loses\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n        # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n        poly_red += 1\n    elif (b_move == 'R' and a_move == 'S') or (b_move == 'S' and a_move == 'P') or (b_move == 'P' and a_move == 'R'):\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n        nike_red += 1\n\nprint(nike_red, poly_red)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B` for each player.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: For each round `i`, compute the current move for both players using modulo operations to cycle through their sequences.\n3. **Determine Loser**: Check if the current move of one player beats the other. If so, increment the red spot count for the loser.\n4. **Output Results**: After processing all rounds, print the total red spots for each player.\n\nThis approach ensures that each round is processed efficiently, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
