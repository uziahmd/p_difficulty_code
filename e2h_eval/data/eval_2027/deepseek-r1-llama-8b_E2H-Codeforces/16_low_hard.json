Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about moving between blocks in Crazy Town. Each block is a region divided by roads, which are lines on the plane. Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, but the movement is only allowed if they share a border of non-zero length. So each step is crossing one road.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from my home's block to the university's block.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model how each road affects the possible path. Since each step is a cross over a single road, maybe the minimal steps correspond to the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each time you cross a road, you move into a new block. But if two roads intersect, that might complicate things. Or perhaps not—because each road is considered separately.\n\nSo the approach could be: for each road, determine whether the home and the university are on the same side or different sides. If they are on different sides, then that road must be crossed exactly once. The total number of such roads will give the minimal steps.\n\nOh right! Because each such road acts as a barrier that needs to be crossed once. So the minimal steps would be equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each road (line), check if the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nThis makes the problem manageable because we can process each line independently.\n\nHow do we check if two points are on the same side or opposite sides of a line?\n\nThe line equation is a*i + b*j + c = 0. For a point (x, y), substituting into the equation gives a value. The sign of this value determines which side of the line the point is on.\n\nFor example, if the value is positive, the point is on one side; if negative, on the other.\n\nSo for each road, compute the value for home (h_val) and university (u_val). If h_val * u_val < 0, then they are on opposite sides, so this road contributes to the step count.\n\nBut wait, what if h_val is zero? No, the problem states that neither home nor university lie on any road. So h_val and u_val can't be zero.\n\nThus, for each line, compute the sign of (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c). If their product is negative, increment the count.\n\nThe result is the minimal number of steps.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome is (1,1)\nUniversity is (-1,-1)\nn=2\nRoads:\n0 1 0 → line y=0\n1 0 0 → line x=0\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first road is 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0. Home is on positive side. University is 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1<0. So they are on opposite sides. So this road counts as 1 step.\n\nSecond road is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0. Home is positive, university is 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1<0. Again, opposite. So total steps 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case in the sample:\n\nAfter that, another test case with n=3 roads. Hmm, but the output is also 2. Let me see why.\n\nWait, perhaps some lines don't contribute because the home and university are on the same side. So the count is the number of lines where they are on opposite sides.\n\nSo yes, the logic seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Read home (x1,y1), university (x2,y2).\n- For each of the n roads:\n   - Compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   - Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   - If s1 * s2 < 0, count +=1\n- Output count as the answer.\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, let's think about the data types. The coordinates can be up to 1e6, but since the computation is done as integers, no issues with precision.\n\nSo now, in code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from the first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from the second line.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen for each of the next n lines, read a, b, c.\n\nFor each a, b, c, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a road defined by a line equation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The town is divided into blocks by roads (lines). Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. Each road can be represented by the equation \\( ax + by + c = 0 \\). To determine if you need to cross a road, check if your home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation for both your home and university. If these values have opposite signs, it means they are on opposite sides of the road, and thus you must cross this road.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Read the coordinates of your home and university.\n   - For each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides by evaluating the line equation at these points.\n   - Count the number of such roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n   - The count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1 = int(input[idx]); y1 = int(input[idx+1]); idx += 2\n    x2 = int(input[idx]); y2 = int(input[idx+1]); idx += 2\n    n = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx]); b = int(input[idx+1]); c = int(input[idx+2]); idx +=3\n        s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count +=1\n    print(count)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Evaluating Roads**: For each road, the line equation is evaluated at the coordinates of the home and university. If the results have opposite signs, it indicates that the road must be crossed.\n- **Counting Crossings**: The number of such crossings (roads separating the home and university) is counted and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps needed by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their evaluation at specific points.",
