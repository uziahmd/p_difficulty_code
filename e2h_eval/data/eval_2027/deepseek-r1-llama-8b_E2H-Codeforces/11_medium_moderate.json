A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on these resources.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nWe have n friends. They bought k bottles of drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nFor salt, they have p grams.\n\nEach toast per friend needs nl milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast. So for each toast, all friends take some amount. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, wait. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt for each toast. So for one toast, each friend requires these amounts. So for a total of t toasts, each friend will have t * nl ml, t * 1 slice, and t * np grams.\n\nBut since there are n friends, the total resources needed would be:\n\nTotal drink required: t * n * nl\nTotal lime slices: t * n (since each friend uses one slice per toast)\nTotal salt: t * n * np\n\nBut the total available resources are:\n\nDrink: k * l\nLime slices: c * d\nSalt: p\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nt * n * nl <= k * l --> t <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\nt * n <= c * d --> t <= (c*d)/n\nt * n * np <= p --> t <= p/(n * np)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values, because each resource imposes a limit on t.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the total drink available: drink = k * l\n2. Compute the total slices available: slices = c * d\n3. Compute the total salt available: salt = p\n4. For each resource, calculate how many toasts it can support:\n   - drink_toast = drink // (n * nl)\n   - slices_toast = slices // n\n   - salt_toast = salt // (n * np)\n5. The maximum possible t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nThen, output t.\n\nWait, but in the example given, let's check.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink = 4*5=20\nslices =10*8=80\nsalt=100\n\nn=3, nl=3, np=1.\n\ndrink_toast: 20/(3*3)=20/9=2.222... → floor is 2.\nslices_toast:80/3=26.666… → floor 26.\nsalt_toast:100/(3*1)=33.333 → floor 33.\n\nMinimum is 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink=1000.\nc=1, d=19 → slices=19.\np=90.\n\nnl=4, np=3.\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink_toast = 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20=50.\nslices_toast=19/5=3.8 → 3.\nsalt_toast=90/(5*3)=90/15=6.\n\nMinimum is 3. So output 3.\n\nThird sample: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, drink=1000*1000=1,000,000?\nWait, wait no: k=1000, l=1000 → 1000*1000=1,000,000 mL.\n\nc=25, d=23 → slices=575.\nsalt=p=1.\n\nnl=50, np=1.\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink_toast: 1e6 / (10 *50) = 1e6 /500 =2000.\n\nslices_toast:575 /10=57.5 →57.\n\nsalt_toast:1/(10*1)=0.1 →0.\n\nSo the minimum is 0. So output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nWe need to read the inputs as integers.\n\nThe input is a single line with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink = k * l\nslices = c * d\nsalt = p\n\ncompute t_drink = drink // (n * nl)\nt_slices = slices // n\nt_salt = salt // (n * np)\n\nt = min(t_drink, t_slices, t_salt)\n\nOutput t.\n\nWait, but what if any of these divisions result in zero? Like in the third sample where t_salt is zero, so overall t is zero.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases, including when any of the denominators are larger than the numerators, leading to zero.\n\nSo, in Python, the code structure is:\n\nRead the input line, split into 8 integers.\n\nCalculate each component as described.\n\nCompute t as the minimum.\n\nPrint t as a string.\n\nTesting with the samples.\n\nSample 1: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ndrink = 20, slices=80, salt=100.\n\nt_drink=20/(3*3)=2, t_slices=80/3=26, t_salt=100/(3*1)=33. So min is 2.\n\nSample 2: n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\ndrink=1000, slices=19, salt=90.\n\nt_drink=1000/(5*4)=50, t_slices=19/5=3, t_salt=90/(5*3)=6. Min is 3.\n\nSample3: n=10, drink=1000*1000=1e6, slices=25*23=575, salt=1.\n\nt_drink=1e6/(10*50)=2000, t_slices=575/10=57, t_salt=1/(10*1)=0. So min is 0.\n\nSo the code works for these.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- What if n is larger than the slices or salt?\n\nLike, if n=10, slices=5. Then t_slices is 0.\n\nSimilarly, if salt is less than n * np, then t_salt is zero.\n\nAnother case: when one of the resources is just enough for t, others are more.\n\nE.g., n=2, drink=10, nl=3. So drink allows 10/(2*3)=1.666 →1 toast.\n\nIf slices allow 5 toasts, and salt allows 100, then min is 1.\n\nSo, code must handle integer division correctly.\n\nIn Python, using integer division with // operator.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of strings, then convert to integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_slices = total_slices // n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toast_drink, toast_slices, toast_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, checking for possible issues.\n\nWhat if n is zero? But according to the problem statement, all input numbers are positive integers. So n >=1.\n\nSo no division by zero.\n\nAnother thing: since all variables are up to 1000, their products can be up to 1e6 or higher, but in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nThus, the code should work for all cases.\n\nSo, I think this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource, and the goal is to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: Each friend needs a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a specific amount of salt for each toast. We need to calculate the maximum number of such toasts each friend can make given the available resources.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n3. **Determine Resource Limits**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts it can support:\n   - Drink limit: Total drink divided by the amount needed per toast per friend.\n   - Lime slices limit: Total slices divided by the number of friends.\n   - Salt limit: Total salt divided by the amount needed per toast per friend.\n4. **Compute Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum value among the three calculated limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_slices = total_slices // n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toast_drink, toast_slices, toast_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers which are read and split into respective variables.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt are computed.\n- **Resource Limits**: For each resource, the maximum number of toasts it can support is calculated using integer division to ensure whole numbers.\n- **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The smallest value among the three resource limits is taken as the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends can toast the same number of times without running out of any resource.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required values using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
