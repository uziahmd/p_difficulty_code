Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any will do.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, given a regular polygon with n sides, we need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on the sides adjacent to v2. The angle at v2 should be as close to 'a' degrees as possible. And among all possible angles, we need the one that's closest, and if there's a tie, any solution is acceptable.\n\nWait, but how is this angle formed? Oh right, in a regular polygon, each internal angle can be calculated. For a regular n-gon, the internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But when considering the angle formed by three points, I think it's the external angle or something else.\n\nNo, wait. Wait, the problem isn't about the internal angle of the polygon itself but the angle formed by three points in the polygon. So, for example, if we pick three consecutive vertices, the angle at the middle vertex would be 60 degrees for a triangle (since each internal angle is 60), but for a square, picking three consecutive vertices would form a 90-degree angle.\n\nWait no, maybe not. Let me think: in a square, each internal angle is 90 degrees. But if you take three consecutive vertices, say 1,2,3, then the angle at vertex 2 is actually the internal angle of the square. So yes, it's 90 degrees. But what about other configurations?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. So the angle is formed by two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. These points are on the sides of the polygon, meaning that v1 and v3 are connected through v2, but perhaps not adjacent to it. Or wait, maybe v1 and v3 are on the sides that are adjacent to v2. Hmm, the problem says that v1 and v3 lie on its sides. Oh, wait, the problem says \"v1 and v3 lie on its sides\"—so probably, the two sides that meet at v2. So for a regular polygon, each vertex is connected to two others. So v1 and v3 must be on those two sides.\n\nSo for example, in a square, the sides are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1. If v2 is 2, then the sides are 1-2 and 2-3. So v1 could be 1, and v3 could be 3. Then the angle at 2 is the internal angle of the square, which is 90 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe v1 is 4 and v3 is 3, but wait, does that make sense? Because the side opposite to 2 is 4-1. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in a regular polygon, each vertex is part of two edges. So for vertex v2, the two adjacent vertices are v_prev and v_next. So for example, in a square:\n\n1 connected to 2 and 4.\n2 connected to 1 and 3.\n3 connected to 2 and 4.\n4 connected to 3 and 1.\n\nSo for vertex 2, the sides are 1-2 and 2-3. So any v1 and v3 must be on those two sides. So v1 can be 1 or 3, and similarly for v3.\n\nWait no, because the sides are 1-2 and 2-3. So v1 can be 1, and v3 can be 3. Or v1 can be 3 and v3 can be 1. Or maybe even if they are further apart? No, because the sides are just the immediate next and previous vertices.\n\nSo the angle at v2 is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 on those two sides.\n\nSo for a regular n-gon, each angle formed by choosing v_prev and v_next to v2 will form a certain fixed angle. What is that angle?\n\nWait, in a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. So for each vertex, the angle between the two adjacent edges is equal to the internal angle of the polygon. Wait, no. Wait, the internal angle is the angle inside the polygon at a vertex. For a regular polygon, the internal angle is given by (n-2)*180 /n. So for a triangle, it's 60 degrees; for a square, 90 degrees, etc.\n\nBut when we pick three points, the angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2-v1 and v2-v3. These are two edges of the polygon that are adjacent to v2. So the angle between these two edges is the internal angle of the polygon. So for a regular polygon, each such angle is fixed as the internal angle.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean that the only possible angle is the internal angle, but in the sample input, for n=4 and a=67, the answer was 45 degrees. So that suggests that my understanding is wrong.\n\nHmm, wait looking back at the sample input. In the second sample, n=4, a=67. The output was 2 1 3, which forms a 45-degree angle. Because in a square, the internal angle is 90 degrees, but when you choose non-consecutive points, perhaps the angle is different.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample says that the output is 2 1 3, which is a 45-degree angle. How is that possible?\n\nWait, let's visualize the square. Let's label the vertices 1,2,3,4 in order. So 2 is connected to 1 and 3. So if we pick v1 as 1 and v3 as 3, then the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But the sample says that for a=67, the angle 45 degrees is chosen because it's closer.\n\nWait, that suggests that sometimes the angle is not the internal angle. So perhaps the angle is determined by the number of steps between the selected points.\n\nAh! Maybe I was thinking about the internal angle, but the problem allows for selecting vertices that are not adjacent. So for example, in the square, the angle can be 45 degrees if v1 and v3 are two steps apart.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the polygon as a circle, and the points are placed equally around the circumference. Then, the angle formed by three points can be determined based on the arcs between them.\n\nYes! So, in a regular polygon, all points lie on a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\nSo, for any three points v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 can be computed based on the arcs that the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 subtend at the center.\n\nLet me think about that. The angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but not sure. Wait, no. Wait, the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle formed by two chords in a circle (like v2 is the vertex) is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the angle is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. Wait, the angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The angle at v2 is an inscribed angle that intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't contain v2.\n\nSo the measure of the angle at v2 is (arc(v1, v3)) / 2, where arc(v1, v3) is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that is opposite to v2.\n\nBut wait, the central angle between v1 and v3 is k*(360/n), where k is the number of steps between them along the circumference. The arc can be the minor or major arc. But since the polygon is convex and regular, the minor arc is the one that is less than 180 degrees.\n\nWait, but the angle at v2 depends on which arc we are taking. So for two points v1 and v3, the angle at v2 is (d/2), where d is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. So in this case, the angle at v2 is formed by the two chords v2v1 and v2v3. The intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not pass through v2.\n\nSo the angle at v2 is (arc_length / 2), where arc_length is the length of that intercepted arc.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angle between two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So the distance between v1 and v3 in terms of steps around the polygon is k, where k can be 1, 2, ..., up to floor(n/2).\n\nWait, for example, in a square, n=4. The central angle between two consecutive vertices is 90 degrees. So between any two vertices, the possible step counts are 1, 2, or 3 (but step count beyond 2 is the same as n - step count). So for v1 and v3, the step count is the minimal number of edges between them along the perimeter.\n\nSo, for a square, if v1 is 1 and v3 is 3, the step count is 2. So the arc length is 2 * 90 = 180 degrees. The angle at v2 (vertex 2) is 180/2 = 90 degrees. But the sample input shows that for a=67, the optimal angle is 45 degrees, which is half of 90. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the sample input, n=4, a=67. The output was 45 degrees. So the angle is 45 degrees. How is that achieved?\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is formed by choosing v1 and v3 such that the intercepted arc is smaller. Like, maybe stepping over just one edge. For example, in the square, if v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, that's a step count of 1 (from 1 to 4 is one edge in the square). So the arc length is 90 degrees, angle at v2 is 45 degrees. That makes sense.\n\nSo the angle can vary depending on how far apart v1 and v3 are around the polygon.\n\nSo for any polygon, the angle at v2 can be any value that is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 (the arc not containing v2). So the possible angles are multiples of (360/(2n)) degrees, perhaps?\n\nWait, the arc length is k*(360/n) degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3. So the angle is (k*(360/n))/2 = (k*180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, for example, in the square, n=4. So k can be 1, 2, 3, but since k>2 is the same as 4-k, which is 2, etc. So for k=1: angle is (1*180)/4=45 degrees. For k=2: angle is (2*180)/4=90 degrees. For k=3: same as k=1, angle 45.\n\nSo, for a square, the possible angles are 45 and 90 degrees.\n\nSo for the sample input where a=67, the closest is 45, since 67 is closer to 45 than to 90. Hence, the output is 45 degrees.\n\nIn the third sample input, a=68. Then, 90 is closer than 45. So the angle is 90 degrees.\n\nSo the approach is to find, for each possible vertex v2, and for each possible step k (from 1 to floor(n/2)), the angle is (k*180)/n degrees. Then, find the angle closest to a, and return the corresponding v1, v2, v3.\n\nBut how do we represent v1 and v3 given a v2 and k?\n\nWait, for a given v2, the step k is the number of steps from v2 to v1 in one direction, and v3 is k steps in the other direction, but wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, for a given v2, the adjacent vertices are v_prev and v_next. Then, for k steps, v1 can be v_prev, v_prev-1, etc., and v3 can be v_next, v_next+1, etc. Wait, maybe not. Or perhaps, for each v2, the possible k is the number of steps between v1 and v3, which is the number of steps along the polygon's perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given v2, the points v1 and v3 can be located by moving k steps clockwise and counter-clockwise from v2, but since the polygon is regular, the order might matter.\n\nAlternatively, for a given v2, the points v1 and v3 can be selected such that the arc between them is k steps, leading to an angle of (k*180)/n degrees.\n\nSo for each v2, and for each possible k (from 1 to floor(n/2)), compute the angle, and see if it's the closest to a.\n\nBut since the problem requires us to find any of the optimal solutions, perhaps we can find the best possible angle for some v2 and k, and then construct the triplet accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find v1 and v3 given v2 and k?\n\nLet's think about the structure of the polygon. Each vertex is numbered from 1 to n in order. So for a given v2, the positions of v1 and v3 can be found by moving k steps clockwise and counter-clockwise, respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for each v2, the minimal step count between v1 and v3 is k. So v1 can be any vertex that is k steps away from v3 in either direction.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given v2, the possible pairs (v1, v3) are such that the step count between v1 and v3 is k steps. So for example, in a square:\n\nv2 is 2. Then, for k=1, the possible pairs are (1,3) and (3,1). Because 1 is one step before 2, and 3 is one step after 2. The step count between 1 and 3 is 2 steps, which is equivalent to n - 2 steps. Wait, but earlier calculation showed that for k=1, the angle is 45 degrees, but the step count between v1 and v3 is 2 steps.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me re-examine the sample.\n\nIn the square example, when the output is 2 1 3, the angle is 45 degrees. So v2 is 2, v1 is 1, v3 is 3. The step count from 1 to 3 is 2 steps, which is n/2. So the angle is (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees? But according to the sample, the angle is 45.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between the step count and the angle.\n\nAlternative approach: let's model the regular polygon as a circle with n equally spaced points. Each point is at an angle of (360/n)*i degrees, where i is the index (starting from 0). So, for a polygon with n=4, the points are at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°, etc.\n\nIf we have three points v1, v2, v3, their positions are at angles θ_v1, θ_v2, θ_v3.\n\nThe angle at v2 is the angle between the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. Using vector math, this angle can be computed using the dot product formula.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Since all points are on a circle, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, not passing through v2.\n\nWait, yes! Because the inscribed angle theorem states that the angle formed by two points on a circle, with the vertex on another point, is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (arc_length / 2), where arc_length is the measure of the arc that is not containing v2 between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, to find the angle, we need to determine the arc length between v1 and v3 that does not include v2.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the total circumference is 360 degrees. So the arc length between v1 and v3 can be k*(360/n) degrees, where k is the minimal number of steps between them. So for v1 and v3, the minimal step count is min(d, n-d), where d is the absolute difference in their indices.\n\nWait, but the arc not containing v2 can be either the minimal arc or the maximal. So depending on whether v2 is in the minimal arc or the maximal arc, the intercepted arc for the angle could be the minimal or the maximal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. For any pair of points v1 and v3, the intercepted arc for the angle at v2 is the one that does not include v2. So the size of this arc is the minimal possible between the two possible arcs between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nIn a square, n=4. Suppose v2 is 2, v1 is 1, v3 is 3. The minimal arc between v1 and v3 is 180 degrees (two steps, each 90 degrees). The maximal arc is also 180 degrees. So the angle at v2 is 90 degrees.\n\nBut in the sample, when a=67, the angle chosen is 45 degrees, which comes from a minimal arc of 90 degrees (k=1 step, each step 90 degrees).\n\nSo for that case, v1 is 1 and v3 is 4 (which is one step ahead of 2 in the other direction). Then, the arc between v1 and v3 is 90 degrees, so the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nAh! So for a given v2, the minimal step count between v1 and v3 can be k steps in one direction or (n-k) steps in the other. So the intercepted arc can be either k*(360/n) or (n-k)*(360/n), whichever is smaller.\n\nWait, but since the intercepted arc is the one not containing v2, the size of that arc is the minimal between the two possible arcs.\n\nWait, no. Because for any two points, the arc not containing v2 is either the minimal or maximal. For instance, in a square, if v2 is 2, and v1 is 1, v3 is 4, then the arc from 1 to 4 not containing 2 is 90 degrees, which is the minimal. So the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nSo the angle is (min_arc)/2, where min_arc is the minimal arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2.\n\nSo to compute the angle, for each possible pair v1, v2, v3, we calculate the minimal arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2, then divide by 2.\n\nBut considering that the problem has n up to 105, trying all possible triplets is computationally expensive (n^3 possibilities). So we need a smarter way.\n\nThe key is to realize that for each v2, the possible angles are determined by the number of steps k between v1 and v3. Since the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2.\n\nWait, no. Because the arc not containing v2 could be the minimal or maximal. So for a given k, the angle can be (k*180)/n or ( (n -k)*180 )/n, whichever is applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the possible angles are generated by varying k from 1 to m, where m is the maximum possible step count that leads to an angle less than or equal to 180. Because the minimal arc is <= 180.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the possible angles are (k*180)/n, where k ranges from 1 to floor(n/2). Because beyond that, the steps would wrap around and the minimal arc would be n -k, which is less than or equal to n/2.\n\nSo for each v2, the possible angles are (k * 180)/n for k=1,2,...,m where m = floor(n/2).\n\nSo, for each v2, we can compute all possible angles and keep track of the ones that are closest to 'a'.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over each possible v2 (from 1 to n).\n2. For each v2, iterate over k from 1 to m (where m is floor(n/2)).\n3. Compute the angle for this k as (k * 180)/n degrees.\n4. Check if this angle is a candidate for being the closest to 'a'.\n5. Keep track of the triplet (v1, v2, v3) that gives the closest angle. If multiple triplets give the same minimal difference, any can be chosen.\n6. After checking all possibilities, output the triplet with the minimal difference.\n\nBut how to find v1 and v3 for each v2 and k?\n\nOnce we know v2 and k, we can determine v1 and v3.\n\nFor a given v2 and k:\n\n- v1 is the vertex that is k steps clockwise from v2.\n- v3 is the vertex that is k steps counter-clockwise from v2.\n\nWait, no. Because if k is the number of steps in the arc not containing v2, then v1 and v3 are k steps apart in that arc.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is: for a given v2 and k, v1 is (v2 - k) mod n, and v3 is (v2 + k) mod n. But since the polygon is circular, we need to handle modulo operations correctly.\n\nWait, let's think about the numbering. Let's suppose the polygon is numbered 1, 2, ..., n in a clockwise order.\n\nFor a given v2, the k steps clockwise would be v2 - k (mod n). But since the numbering is 1-based, subtracting 1, then adding, and then adding 1 again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider the vertices as 0-based. So, for a given v2 (converted to 0-based), v1 is (v2 -k) mod n, and v3 is (v2 +k) mod n.\n\nBut then, for 1-based numbering, we'd add 1 back.\n\nWait, let's formalize:\n\nFor v2 in 1-based numbering:\n\nv_prev = v2 - 1\nv_next = v2 + 1\n\nBut if v2 is 1, v_prev is n.\n\nSo, to get v_prev and v_next in 0-based:\n\nv_prev_0 = (v2 -1) % n\nv_next_0 = (v2) % n\n\nThen, for k steps:\n\nv1_0 = (v_prev_0 -k) % n\nv3_0 = (v_next_0 +k) % n\n\nBut wait, if k is larger than the number of steps in one direction, this may not work. Wait, no, because k is up to floor(n/2), so it's manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given v2, the k steps can be taken in both directions, but since the minimal arc is considered, the steps are k in one direction.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given v2, the minimal arc is k steps, so v1 is k steps before v2 (in the direction that doesn't include v2), and v3 is k steps after v2 in the same direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nFor each v2, and for each possible k (1<=k<=m), the triplet is (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k), but considering the polygon's circular nature.\n\nWait, but in 1-based numbering, the steps may go beyond n, so we need to adjust.\n\nFor example, in a square (n=4):\n\nv2=2 (1-based).\n\nk=1: v1 is 1 (2-1=1), v3 is 3 (2+1=3).\n\nThe angle is (1*180)/4=45 degrees.\n\nk=2: v1 is 0 (2-2=0, which is 4 in 1-based), v3 is 4 (2+2=4). So the angle is (2*180)/4=90 degrees.\n\nSo the triplet for k=1 is (1,2,3), which is the sample's first output.\n\nSo, in code, for a given v2, and k, we can compute v1 and v3 as follows:\n\nv1 = (v2 -k) if (v2 -k) > 0 else n -k +1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to convert everything to 0-based, perform the calculations, then convert back.\n\nSo:\n\nv2_0 = v2 - 1\nv1_0 = (v2_0 - k) % n\nv3_0 = (v2_0 + k) % n\n\nThen, v1 = v1_0 +1, v2 = v2_0 +1, v3 = v3_0 +1.\n\nWait, but let's test this.\n\nFor v2=2, which is 1-based, v2_0=1.\n\nk=1: v1_0=0, v3_0=2.\n\nv1=1, v2=2, v3=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nk=2: v1_0=(1-2)= -1 mod4=3, v3_0=(1+2)=3 mod4=3.\n\nv1=4, v3=4.\n\nWait, but that's a problem because v1 and v3 are the same. But the problem requires three distinct vertices.\n\nWait, but in the case where k equals n/2 (if n is even), then v1 and v3 are the same vertex. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo, for each k, we need to ensure that v1 and v3 are distinct from v2 and each other.\n\nWait, but for k=1 and n=4, v1=1, v3=3. They are distinct.\n\nWait, but for k=2 and n=4, v1=4, v3=4. So same vertex, which is invalid.\n\nSo in this case, for k=2, the triplet is (4,2,4), which is invalid because v1 and v3 are the same.\n\nThus, for even n, when k = n/2, the triplet would have v1 == v3, which is invalid. So in such cases, we must skip k =n/2.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each v2 in 1..n:\n\n   for k in 1..m, where m = floor( (n-1)/2 )\n\n      compute the angle as (k*180)/n\n\n      compute v1 and v3 as (v2 -k) mod n and (v2 +k) mod n\n\n      if v1 != v3, and both are within 1..n, then consider this triplet.\n\nSo, in code, after converting to 0-based:\n\nv1_0 = (v2_0 -k) %n\n\nv3_0 = (v2_0 +k) %n\n\nif v1_0 == v3_0: skip, since v1 and v3 are same.\n\nElse:\n\n   compute the angle, and track the minimal difference.\n\nSo now, the algorithm becomes:\n\nInitialize the best angle difference as infinity.\n\nbest_triplet = None.\n\nFor each v2 in 1..n:\n\n   for k in 1..m:\n\n      compute angle = (k * 180) /n\n\n      compute v1_0 = (v2-1 -k) %n\n\n      v3_0 = (v2-1 +k) %n\n\n      v1 = v1_0 +1\n\n      v3 = v3_0 +1\n\n      if v1 == v3: continue\n\n      current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n\n      if current_diff < best_diff:\n\n          update best_diff and best_triplet\n\n      elif current_diff == best_diff:\n\n          if this triplet is lexicographically smaller, update.\n\nAfter considering all triplets, output the best_triplet.\n\nWait, but what about the direction? Because for k steps, the arc can be in either direction. Wait, no. Because for any k, the minimal arc is k steps, so the angle is (k*180)/n. But if we take k steps in the other direction, that's (n-k)*180/n degrees, but that's larger than 180, so the minimal arc is k steps.\n\nWait, no. Because for k up to m = floor(n/2), the minimal arc is k steps. So for each v2, we don't need to consider the other direction because it's already covered by k.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2 and k, the angle is (k*180)/n degrees, and for k up to m.\n\nSo, the code needs to loop for each v2, then for each k from 1 to m.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 105, and for each v2, up to 52 iterations (for m=52), the total number of triplets is 105 *52 = 5460, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is feasible.\n\nNow, the question is, for each triplet, compute the angle, and track the one closest to 'a'.\n\nBut wait, what about the other possible angles? Because, for a given v2 and k, is that the only possible angle, or are there other possibilities?\n\nNo, because for a given v2 and k, the angle is fixed as (k*180)/n degrees. So, for each v2 and k, we can compute that angle, and compare it against a.\n\nSo, the steps in code are:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute m = (n // 2)\n\nInitialize best_diff to a very large number.\n\nbest_v1, best_v2, best_v3 = None, None, None.\n\nFor v2 in 1 to n:\n\n   for k in 1 to m:\n\n      angle = (k * 180) /n\n\n      # compute v1 and v3\n\n      v2_0 = v2 -1\n\n      v1_0 = (v2_0 -k) %n\n\n      v3_0 = (v2_0 +k) %n\n\n      v1 = v1_0 +1\n\n      v3 = v3_0 +1\n\n      if v1 == v3:\n\n          continue\n\n      # compute the difference\n\n      diff = abs(angle - a)\n\n      # compare to best_diff\n\n      if diff < best_diff:\n\n          best_diff = diff\n\n          best_v1, best_v2, best_v3 = v1, v2, v3\n\n      elif diff == best_diff:\n\n          # if this triplet is lex smaller, update\n\n          if (v1, v2, v3) < (best_v1, best_v2, best_v3):\n\n              best_v1, best_v2, best_v3 = v1, v2, v3\n\nFinally, print best_v1, best_v2, best_v3.\n\nWait, but wait: what about the case where the minimal difference is achieved by an angle that is exactly a? Then, the triplet is chosen.\n\nBut what about the other possible triplets that have the same angle? We can choose any.\n\nAnother thing to note: for some n and a, the optimal angle could be achieved by different k's for different v2's. So, the code must check all possibilities.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 15\n\nn=3, a=15.\n\nEach v2 is 1,2,3.\n\nFor each v2 and k:\n\nSince m =1.\n\nFor v2=1:\n\nk=1.\n\nangle = (1*180)/3 =60.\n\nv1_0 = (0-1) mod3 =2 → v1=3.\n\nv3_0= (0+1) mod3=1 → v3=2.\n\nSo triplet is (3,1,2). The angle is 60.\n\nDifference |60-15|=45.\n\nFor v2=2:\n\nk=1.\n\nangle=60.\n\nv1_0=1-1=0 → v1=1.\n\nv3_0=1+1=2 → v3=3.\n\ntriplet is (1,2,3). Same angle.\n\nFor v2=3:\n\nk=1.\n\nv1_0=2-1=1 → v1=2.\n\nv3_0=2+1=3 → v3=1.\n\nSo triplet is (2,3,1). Angle is 60.\n\nSo all triplets have angle 60, which is the only possible angle for n=3.\n\nSo the output can be any of them. The sample output is 1 2 3.\n\nSample Input 2:4 67.\n\nFor each v2:\n\nv2=1.\n\nk can be 1 and 2.\n\nk=1: angle=45.\n\nv1_0=0-1= -1 mod4=3 →v1=4.\n\nv3_0=0+1=1 →v3=2.\n\ntriplet (4,1,2). angle 45.\n\nk=2: angle=90.\n\nv1_0=0-2=2 →v1=3.\n\nv3_0=0+2=2 →v3=3.\n\nv1 and v3 are same → skip.\n\nv2=2.\n\nk=1: angle 45.\n\nv1_0=1-1=0 →v1=1.\n\nv3_0=1+1=2 →v3=3.\n\ntriplet (1,2,3). angle 45.\n\nk=2: angle 90.\n\nv1_0=1-2= -1 →3 →v1=4.\n\nv3_0=1+2=3 →v3=4.\n\nv1 and v3 are same → skip.\n\nv2=3.\n\nk=1: angle 45.\n\nv1_0=2-1=1 →v1=2.\n\nv3_0=2+1=3 →v3=4.\n\ntriplet (2,3,4). angle 45.\n\nk=2: angle 90.\n\nv1_0=2-2=0 →v1=1.\n\nv3_0=2+2=4 →v3=5 mod4=1.\n\nv1=1, v3=1 → same → skip.\n\nv2=4.\n\nk=1: angle 45.\n\nv1_0=3-1=2 →v1=3.\n\nv3_0=3+1=4 →v3=5 mod4=1.\n\ntriplet (3,4,1). angle 45.\n\nk=2: angle 90.\n\nv1_0=3-2=1 →v1=2.\n\nv3_0=3+2=5 mod4=1 →v3=2.\n\nv1 and v3 same → skip.\n\nSo, for all v2 and valid k, the possible angles are 45 and 90.\n\nFor a=67, 45 is closer (67-45=22 vs 90-67=23).\n\nSo the best triplet is any of the triplets with angle 45. The sample output is 2 1 3.\n\nBut according to the code, it would choose the first encountered triplet with angle 45. But the sample's output is 2 1 3.\n\nIn our code, for v2=2, k=1: triplet is (1,2,3). That's one possible option.\n\nBut the sample's output is 2 1 3. Wait, no. Wait, the sample's output is '2 1 3', which is v2=2, v1=1, v3=3.\n\nWait, in our code, for v2=2, k=1: v1=1, v3=3. So the triplet is (1,2,3).\n\nBut the sample's output is '2 1 3'—wait, no, the sample's output is '2 1 3' is the second output line, but the first line is '1 2 3'.\n\nWait, perhaps the code would find (1,2,3) as the first triplet, but the sample expects another triplet.\n\nBut the problem statement says that any of the optimal solutions is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code's logic is correct.\n\nAnother test case: sample input 3:4 68.\n\nn=4, a=68.\n\nPossible angles are 45 and 90.\n\nCompute |45-68|=23, |90-68|=22.\n\nSo 90 is closer. So the code will select a triplet with angle 90.\n\nFor v2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves calculating the angles formed by different configurations of vertices and selecting the one closest to 'a'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular convex n-gon can be inscribed in a circle where each vertex is equally spaced. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at any vertex v2 formed by two other vertices v1 and v3 can be determined using the inscribed angle theorem. This angle is half the measure of the arc intercepted by the points v1 and v3 on the circumcircle of the polygon.\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Configurations**: For each vertex v2, we consider all possible pairs of vertices (v1, v3) such that the angle at v2 is minimized. This is done by iterating over possible step counts k from 1 to m, where m is the maximum step count that results in an angle less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n4. **Finding the Optimal Angle**: For each configuration, compute the angle and track the configuration that gives the angle closest to 'a'. If multiple configurations yield the same minimal difference, any can be chosen.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v1 = best_v2 = best_v3 = None\n\nm = n // 2\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n + 1):\n    for k in range(1, m + 1):\n        angle = (k * 180) / n\n        v2_0 = v2 - 1\n        v1_0 = (v2_0 - k) % n\n        v3_0 = (v2_0 + k) % n\n        v1 = v1_0 + 1\n        v3 = v3_0 + 1\n        if v1 == v3:\n            continue\n        current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if current_diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = current_diff\n            best_v1, best_v2, best_v3 = v1, v2, v3\n        elif current_diff == best_diff:\n            if (v1, v2, v3) < (best_v1, best_v2, best_v3):\n                best_v1, best_v2, best_v3 = v1, v2, v3\n\nprint(f\"{best_v1} {best_v2} {best_v3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n2. **Initialization**: Variables to track the best angle difference and the corresponding vertices are initialized.\n3. **Loop Through Vertices**: For each vertex v2, loop through possible step counts k.\n4. **Calculate Angle**: For each k, compute the angle using the formula (k * 180) / n.\n5. **Determine Vertices**: Calculate the positions of v1 and v3 based on the current v2 and k.\n6. **Check Validity**: Ensure v1 and v3 are distinct from each other and v2.\n7. **Update Best Configuration**: Track the configuration with the smallest angle difference. In case of ties, the lexicographically smaller configuration is chosen.\n8. **Output Result**: Print the vertices of the optimal configuration.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible configurations within the constraints, ensuring the closest angle to 'a' is found.",
