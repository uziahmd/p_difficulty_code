    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How?\n\nFor each ring, the perimeter is calculated. But since the plate is a grid, the number of cells in a ring is the perimeter of the rectangle minus 4 (because the four corners are counted twice when adding the perimeters of the sides). Wait, no. Let me think: for a rectangle with width w and height h, the perimeter is 2*(w + h) -4. Because each side contributes w or h cells, but the four corners are counted once each, so subtracting 4 duplicates.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the perimeter is actually 2*(width + height) - 4. Because each of the four sides has a certain number of cells, but the corners are shared between two sides. For example, a 3x3 square has a perimeter of 8 cells: top row (3), right column (excluding top which is already counted), bottom row (3), left column (excluding top). So 3+ (3-2) +3 + (3-2) = 3+1+3+1=8. Alternatively, 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Yes, that formula works.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current width is w_i = w - 4*(i-1), and height h_i = h -4*(i-1). The number of cells in that ring is 2*(w_i + h_i) -4.\n\nBut we need to calculate the sum of cells for all k rings.\n\nWait, but what if w_i or h_i becomes less than 3? Because each ring must form a valid rectangle. If either is less than 3, then the ring can't be formed, right? Or does the problem ensure that k is such that all rings up to k can be formed?\n\nLooking back at the input constraints: k is given such that 1 ≤k ≤ floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if w=3 and h=3, min is 3, (3+1)/4 is 1, floor is 1, so k can be 1. So in that case, the first ring is 3x3, which gives 8 cells.\n\nAnother example: input '7 9 1' gives output 28. Let's see:\n\nRing 1: w=7, h=9. Cells = 2*(7+9)-4 = 32-4=28. So yes.\n\nAnother example: input '7 9 2'. So ring 1 is 7x9, 28 cells. Ring 2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. Cells: 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute w_i = w -4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute the perimeter cells for this ring: 2*(w_i + h_i) -4\n   d. Sum all these perimeters.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read w, h, k from input.\n- Initialize total =0\n- For i from 1 to k:\n   compute current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n   compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   if current_w <3 or current_h <3: break? Because further rings would not exist.\n   else: add 2*(current_w + current_h) -4 to total.\n- Wait, but according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that all rings up to k are possible. So perhaps we don't need to handle cases where current_w or h is less than 3, as k is chosen correctly.\n\nThus, the code can proceed safely.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3. 2*(3+3)-4= 12-4=8. So output is 8.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1.\n\nAs above, 28.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2.\n\nSum 28 + (3*5)= 28+12=40.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nRing1:5x5: 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\nRing2:5-4=1, h=5-4=1. Wait, but 1x1 can't form a ring. Hmm, but according to the problem statement, k is constrained such that all rings are possible. So for w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 6/4=1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. So trying k=2 is beyond allowed.\n\nSo in our code, since k is provided within the allowed range, we don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into three integers: w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total=0.\n\nLoop for i in range(1, k+1):\n\ncurrent_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\ncells = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\ntotal += cells\n\nPrint total.\n\nThat's simple.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSecond:7 9 1 →28.\n\nThird:7 9 2→28+12=40.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1 →16.\n\nAnother test: w=5, h=9, k=2.\n\nRing1:5x9 →2*(5+9)-4=28.\n\nRing2:5-4=1, 9-4=5 →1x5. Perimeter is 2*(1+5)-4=12-4=8. Total 36.\n\nSo code should output 36.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, writing the Python code.\n\nWe need to read from stdin, process, and output.\n\nThe code will be:\n\nRead the input line, split into w, h, k.\n\nCompute the sum as described.\n\nPrint the sum as an integer.\n\nIn Python, something like:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    cw = w - 4*(i-1)\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n    # since k is within constraints, cw and ch are >=3\n    total += 2*(cw + ch) -4\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the samples:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1 →28.\n\nSample3:7 9 2 →40.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=9, k=2 →28+8=36.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of rings. Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one, and each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells (2 cells on each side).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring forms a border around a rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells for each subsequent ring.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is calculated using the perimeter of the rectangle formed by that ring. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by \\(2 \\times (w + h) - 4\\).\n3. **Summing Up Cells**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the number of cells in that ring and sum them up to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    cw = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    ch = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    total += 2 * (cw + ch) - 4\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`, representing the number of rows, columns, and rings respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the current width and height of the rectangle for that ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula \\(2 \\times (current\\_width + current\\_height) - 4\\) and add this value to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all `k` rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing up their perimeters, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
