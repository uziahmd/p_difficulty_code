The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So the i-th task can only be done after she's handled all earlier ones. My goal is to find the minimum time she needs to finish all her tasks.\n\nHmm, let's think about the example they gave. In the first test case, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks: 3,2,3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. That makes sense because she has to go through each required house in the order that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? It seems like for each task, she needs to reach the required house at the earliest possible moment, considering the previous tasks.\n\nI think the key here is to process the tasks in the order of their indices. Since each task depends on the completion of all previous ones, we can sort the tasks in increasing order of their positions. But wait, no, because the problem says that the i-th task must be completed after all j-th tasks where j < i. So the order of processing is fixed as per the original sequence. Or is it?\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, the second line is m integers a1, a2,..., am. These represent the tasks in order. So for task 1, she just needs to be at a1 when she's done with task 1. Then, for task 2, she must be at a2 after completing tasks 1 and 2. Wait, no, the note says that multiple consecutive tasks can be in one house. So perhaps the order of processing isn't necessarily the order of the array, but more about the dependencies.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\"\n\nOh right! So for the i-th task, she must have already completed all tasks before i. So the order in which she does the tasks is determined by their indices. So she must perform the first task, then the second, then the third, etc., up to the m-th task. And each task requires her to be at ai at some point.\n\nWait, no. Because the way it's phrased is that to do the i-th task, she needs to be in ai. But since she can't do the i-th task until all j < i are done, she must have already visited a1, a2, ..., ai.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal approach is to arrange the tasks in such a way that when she is moving from one to the next, she covers all necessary points in the minimal path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal time is the sum of the distances between consecutive required houses, considering that each required house is visited exactly once, but in the order that allows her to loop around the ring as needed.\n\nWait, that sounds familiar. Like the traveling salesman problem on a circular track. Hmm.\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Suppose we have all the required houses (a1, a2, ..., am). We need to visit them in an order that allows us to move from each to the next, possibly looping around the ring, but minimizing the total distance.\n\nBut what's the correct order to visit these houses to satisfy all the task dependencies?\n\nWait, since each task i requires her to be at ai after all j < i are done, perhaps the order in which she visits the ai's is the order of their indices. So she must process a1, then a2, then a3, etc. But that might not always be optimal because perhaps a1 is far away from a2, but a3 is close.\n\nNo, wait. Because each task must be done in the order of their indices. So she can't skip any. So the order is fixed as 1, 2, 3, ..., m.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that for the i-th task, she must be at ai at the time she completes all tasks before i. So the i-th task can't be started until she's at ai. So she must have arrived at ai after all the previous tasks are done.\n\nSo the tasks must be processed in the order of their indices. So for each task i, she must be at ai after all j < i are completed.\n\nSo the order of visiting the houses is 1, then 2, then 3, etc., up to m. But in terms of movement, it's possible that she could have visited some of these earlier in the process, but couldn't start the i-th task until she arrives at ai.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct. Because she can't do the i-th task until she's at ai. So if, for example, she passes ai earlier, she can't do the i-th task until she returns there.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal path is to visit each ai in order, starting from 1, then to a2, then a3, and so on. But sometimes, you might have to go back around the ring to cover all the required points efficiently.\n\nSo the minimal time would be the sum of the distances between each pair of consecutive required points, considering the shortest path on the ring.\n\nWait, but the ring is circular. So the distance between two points can be the minimum of clockwise or counter-clockwise. But since traffic is one-way clockwise, she can't go counter-clockwise. Oh right! Because the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So moving from a house to the next in the clockwise direction takes 1 unit of time, but you can't go the other way.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\" But the ring is one-way, and the traffic is clockwise. So when you're moving, you can only go in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, but the ring is a loop. So moving clockwise, each step increases the house number by 1 modulo n.\n\nSo for example, if she's at house 4 and wants to get to house 1, she has to go through 4 → 1, but that's impossible because the ring is one-way. Or wait, maybe house 4 is connected to house 1, but since the traffic is clockwise, she can't move from 4 to 1. She can only move clockwise, meaning from 4, the next is 1, but that's the same as moving from 4 to 1, which is allowed?\n\nWait, perhaps the ring is arranged such that each house has a next and previous, but the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, maybe the ring is a cycle where each node points to the next in clockwise direction. So house 1 is connected to 2, 2 to 3, ..., n-1 to n, and n to 1. But since it's one-way and traffic is only clockwise, you can't go from 1 to n, because that would be counter-clockwise.\n\nWait, no. Because if the ring is arranged so that the next node is the next in clockwise direction, then house n's next is 1. So yes, you can go from n to 1, but that's the same as moving clockwise.\n\nSo the movement is possible in both directions, but only in the way that follows the ring's structure. So moving from a lower-numbered house to a higher-numbered house is moving clockwise, while moving from a higher to a lower is moving counterclockwise, but that's allowed as well, because the ring is bidirectional in terms of movement—only the direction of traversal is constrained by the one-way traffic.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe ring is a circular arrangement where each house has two neighbors. The traffic is one-way, and it's clockwise. So the direction of movement is strictly clockwise. So for example, house 1 can only move to 2, 2 to 3, etc., and house n can only move to 1.\n\nWait, no. Because if the ring is a cycle, then each house is connected to its next and previous. But if the traffic is one-way and clockwise, then from any house, you can only move to the next house in the clockwise direction. So for house 1, the next is 2; for house 2, next is 3, ..., for house n, next is 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because then the ring would have a cycle that goes 1→2→...→n→1, which is a single direction.\n\nWait, but in that case, moving from n to 1 is moving against the traffic. Because traffic is clockwise, which implies that you can't go from n to 1 directly. Or perhaps the movement is allowed, but in a way that the overall direction is maintained.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of the ring as a directed cycle. Each house has an outgoing edge to the next house in clockwise direction. So house 1 points to 2, 2 to 3, ..., n-1 to n, and n points to 1. So moving from 1 to 2 is allowed, 2 to 3, etc., and n to 1 is allowed. So the movement is possible in both directions, but the direction is fixed as the ring's natural order.\n\nWait, no. Because if the ring is directed, then you can't move against the direction. So if the direction is clockwise, then you can only move in the order of 1→2→3→...→n→1. So in this case, from 1, you can only go to 2, not to n.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the ring is a directed cycle, where each node has exactly one outgoing edge—the next node in the clockwise direction. So from each node, you can only move to the next node in the clockwise direction.\n\nIn that case, the minimal path between two nodes is the minimal steps required when moving in the directed way.\n\nFor example, the distance between house x and y is the minimal number of steps when moving from x to y in the directed ring. Since the ring is directed, you can't go the other way.\n\nSo for house 1 and house 4 in a 4-house ring:\n\nThe directed edges are 1→2, 2→3, 3→4, 4→1.\n\nSo to go from 1 to 4, you have to go 1→2→3→4, which is 3 steps. Alternatively, could you take 1→4 via 4's incoming edge? No, because the direction is one-way.\n\nSo in this scenario, the distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n, but only if y >=x. Otherwise, it's (n - x + y) mod n.\n\nWait, no. Because if the ring is directed, then moving from x to y is only possible if y is in the direction of the ring. So for x=4, y=1, the only way is to go 4→1, which is 1 step.\n\nWait, yes. So the distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n if y >= x, else (n - x + y) mod n.\n\nWait, but in the directed case, moving from x to y may not be possible unless y is reachable in the directed path.\n\nWait, in this problem, since the ring is a directed cycle, every node is reachable from any other, because it's a single cycle covering all nodes. So for any x and y, there is a directed path from x to y.\n\nSo the distance between x and y is the minimal number of steps to go from x to y in the directed ring. Which is equal to (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - (x - y)).\n\nWait, no. Wait, for x=4, y=2, in a 4-node ring:\n\nThe directed path is 4→1→2. So distance is 2 steps.\n\nWhich is (2 -4 +4) mod 4 = (2) mod4=2. Or, using the formula, (y -x) mod4. But (2-4) mod4 is (-2 mod4)=2. So that works.\n\nWait, so the distance from x to y is (y -x) mod n. Because for x=4, y=2, (2-4) mod4 = (-2 mod4)=2.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nSo for any two houses, the distance is (y -x) mod n.\n\nWait, but in our example earlier, when moving from 1 to 4, the distance is 3 steps (1→2→3→4). (4-1) mod4=3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: from 3 to 1 in a 4-node ring, (1-3) mod4= (-2 mod4)=2 steps. But wait, in the directed ring, 3→4→1 is two steps. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the distance is (y -x) modn.\n\nSo that's a key insight.\n\nNow, back to the problem. We need to find the minimal time for Xenia to complete all her tasks.\n\nShe starts at house 1.\n\nEach task i (from 1 to m) requires her to be at a_i after completing all j <i tasks.\n\nSo the order of processing is 1, 2, ..., m.\n\nWait, no. Because the i-th task can only be done after all j <i are done. So she must process the tasks in the order of their indices.\n\nSo for each task i, she must arrive at a_i after finishing all j <i.\n\nSo the order of visiting a_i is 1, a2, a3, ..., am.\n\nBut since she can't jump around, she must find a path that starts at 1, then goes to a2, then to a3, etc., ensuring that each step's distance is added.\n\nWait, but perhaps she can revisit some houses multiple times. But to minimize the total time, it's better to visit each required house exactly once, in the order that allows the minimal path.\n\nWait, but the required houses may have overlapping positions. For example, in the sample input, the tasks are 3,2,3, so a1=3, a2=2, a3=3. So she needs to be at 3 (task1), then 2 (task2), then 3 again (task3).\n\nBut the minimal path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So she goes from 1 to 2 (distance 1), then 2→3 (distance 1), 3→4 (distance 1), 4→1 (distance 1), 1→2 (distance 1), 2→3 (distance 1). Total 6 steps.\n\nSo the path includes revisiting 2 and 3 multiple times.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal approach is to process each a_i in order, but whenever a_i is less than the current position, she might have to loop around.\n\nSo how do we model this?\n\nIdea: The minimal time is the sum of the distances from the starting point to a1, then from a1 to a2, then a2 to a3, and so on, up to am.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, a1=3, a2=2, a3=3.\n\nSo the path is 1→3 (distance 2?), but that's not the case. Wait, in the sample input, the path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So the movement is from 1 to 2 (distance 1), then 2→3 (distance 1), 3→4 (distance 1), 4→1 (distance 1), then 1→2 (distance 1), 2→3 (distance 1). Sum is 6.\n\nBut according to the distance formula, the distance from 1 to 3 is (3-1) mod4=2. So 1→3 directly would take 2 steps, which is better than going via 2 and 4.\n\nBut in the sample, why doesn't she take that path?\n\nBecause she has to process the tasks in the order of their indices. So first task is 3 (a1=3), which she must reach after task 0 (which she's at 1). So she needs to get to 3 as soon as possible.\n\nBut then comes task 2, which is a2=2. So she must be at 2 after completing task1 and task2.\n\nWait, no. Because the second task is a2=2. So after completing task1, she can choose to go to 2 at any time, but she can't do the second task until she's at 2.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal path is to collect all the required points in the order of their task indices, but sometimes you have to make detours.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the distances between consecutive required points, considering the order of their task indices.\n\nWait, but how to determine the order of the required points.\n\nWait, the required points are a1, a2, a3, ..., am. They can be in any order. So the minimal path would involve visiting these points in the order that minimizes the total distance, but ensuring that each point is visited in the correct order based on their task index.\n\nWait, no. Because each task i must be processed after all j <i, regardless of where a_i is located. So she can't process a2 before a1 is processed.\n\nBut the processing of the i-th task can happen at any time after all j <i are done, but before starting j >=i.\n\nSo the order of visiting the required points is determined by their task indices.\n\nSo the path must include a1, then a2, then a3, etc., but the movement between them can be optimized.\n\nSo the minimal time is the sum of the distances from the current position to the next required point, in the order of the task indices.\n\nWait, but the current position after each task is the next required point.\n\nSo the initial position is 1.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to m:\n\ncurrent_pos is updated to a_i, and the distance from current_pos to a_i is added.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the sample input, a1 is 3, a2 is 2, a3 is 3.\n\nSo initial position is 1. She needs to get to 3. So the distance is (3-1) mod4=2. So she moves 1→2→3, taking 2 steps.\n\nThen, from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod4 = (-1 mod4)=3 steps. So 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps.\n\nThen, from 2 to 3: (3-2) mod4=1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2+3+1=6. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo that approach seems to give the correct result.\n\nSo the algorithm is as follows:\n\nSort the tasks in the order of their indices (i=1 to m). For each task i, calculate the distance from the current position to a_i. Sum all these distances.\n\nBut wait, the current position after task i is a_i.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ncurrent_position = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each i from 1 to m:\n\n    distance = (a_i - current_position) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_position = a_i\n\nSo that's the idea.\n\nWait, let's test this on the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1, a_i=3.\n\ndistance = (3-1) mod4=2. total_time=2. current_position=3.\n\ni=2, a_i=2.\n\ndistance=(2-3) mod4= ( -1 ) mod4=3. total_time=5. current_position=2.\n\ni=3, a_i=3.\n\ndistance=(3-2) mod4=1. total_time=6. current_position=3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nSo a1=2, a2=3, a3=3.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_position=1.\n\ni=1: distance 2-1=1. total=1. current=2.\n\ni=2: distance (3-2)=1. total=2. current=3.\n\ni=3: distance (3-3)=0. total remains 2.\n\nSo output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=5, m=3, a=[5,4,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\ni=1: a=5. distance (5-1)=4. total=4. current=5.\n\ni=2: a=4. distance (4-5) mod5= (4-5)= -1 mod5=4. So 4 steps. total=8. current=4.\n\ni=3: a=3. distance (3-4)= -1 mod5=4. total=12.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the path would be 1→5→4→3, which is 4 steps (1→5), then 5→4 is 4 steps (since 5→1 is 1 step, 1→2→3→4 is 3 steps, total 4 steps). Then 4→3 is 1 step (4→5→1→2→3 is 4 steps, but that's wrong. Wait, no. Wait, the distance from 4 to 3 is (3-4) mod5= ( -1 ) mod5=4. So movement is 4→5→1→2→3, which is 4 steps.\n\nSo the total is 4+4+4=12.\n\nIs there a shorter path? Let's see.\n\nAlternative path: 1→5→4→3: that's 4 steps from 1→5, 4→5 is 1 step (since 4's next is 5), then 5→4 is 4 steps (5→1 is 1, 1→2 is 1, 2→3 is 1, 3→4 is 1. So 4 steps). Then 4→3 is 4 steps. So total 4+4+4=12.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1: a=5. distance (5-1)=4. total=4. current=5.\n\ni=2: a=3. distance (3-5)= -2 mod5=3. So 3 steps. total=7.\n\nPath: 1→5 (4 steps), then 5→1 (1 step), 1→2 (1), 2→3 (1). Total steps: 4+3=7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list of a's.\n\n- For each task i from 0 to m-1 (assuming zero-based), process a[i], but wait no. Because the i-th task is a1, a2, etc. So the order is from first to last.\n\nSo for each i in 0..m-1:\n\n   a_i is the (i+1)-th task.\n\n   compute distance from current position to a_i.\n\n   add to total.\n\n   update current position.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nread a = list of integers.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor each x in a:\n\n    distance = (x - current) % n\n\n    total += distance\n\n    current = x\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait: in Python, modulo can behave differently for negative numbers. Let's test.\n\nFor x=2, current=3: (2-3)=-1 mod4=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, for x=3, current=2: (3-2)=1 mod4=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nInput is 4 3, a = [3,2,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nx=3: (3-1)=2 mod4=2. total=2. current=3.\n\nx=2: (2-3)=-1 mod4=3. total=5. current=2.\n\nx=3: (3-2)=1. total=6.\n\nOutput is 6.\n\nSecond sample input: 4 3, a=[2,3,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nx=2: 2-1=1. total=1. current=2.\n\nx=3:3-2=1. total=2. current=3.\n\nx=3:0. total remains 2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,3]. Output is 4 +3=7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo now, implementing this in Python.\n\nWe need to read the input, process the a list, and compute the total.\n\nHandling the inputs:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. First line is n and m, second line is m integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, initialize current =1, total=0.\n\nLoop over each x in a:\n\n    dist = (x - current) %n\n\n    total +=dist\n\n    current =x\n\nPrint(total)\n\nWait, but wait: the problem statement says that the houses are 1-based.\n\nYes, the code uses 1-based numbering.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor x in a:\n    d = (x - current) % n\n    total += d\n    current = x\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nInput is '4 3\\n3 2 3' → n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nx=3: d=2 → total=2.\n\nx=2: d= (2-3) mod4=3 → total=5.\n\nx=3: d=1 → total=6.\n\nOutput is 6.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[5,4,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nx=5: (5-1)=4 → total=4.\n\nx=4: (4-5) mod5=4 → total=8.\n\nx=3: (3-4) mod5=4 → total=12.\n\nOutput is 12.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and can only move clockwise around a ring of houses.
