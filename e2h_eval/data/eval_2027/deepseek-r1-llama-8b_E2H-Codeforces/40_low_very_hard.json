The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$. Note that $$$mod$$$ may not be a prime.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$mod$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 500$$$, $$$1\\le mod\\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer, which is the answer modulo $$$mod$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 403458273']\n\n### Output\n['17']\n\n## Note\nThe following are all valid pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ when $$$n=4$$$.  $$$p=[1,3,4,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,2,3]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,4,3]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,3,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,3,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,1,3]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,4,2]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,2,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,2,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,1,2]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,3,2]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,2,1,3]$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) that satisfy two conditions: first, p is lexicographically smaller than q, and second, the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And I need to compute this modulo a given mod value.\n\nHmm, permutations can be tricky because they involve a lot of possibilities. Since n can be up to 500, a brute-force approach is definitely out of the question. So I need an efficient way to model this.\n\nLet me think about the properties required. For each pair (p, q), p must be lex smaller than q. Also, inv(p) > inv(q). Wait, what's a lex smaller permutation? Oh right, lex order is determined by the first position where they differ. If p[i] < q[i], then p is smaller regardless of the rest.\n\nSo, how can I represent the state for each permutation? Maybe using dynamic programming where we track both the inversion count and some information about the permutation's structure relative to q.\n\nWait, but considering all possible p and q directly is too slow. So perhaps I can model the problem by considering the relationship between p and q in a way that allows me to compute the necessary counts without enumerating all pairs.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. For each possible permutation p, I want to count the number of permutations q that are lex larger than p, have fewer inversions than p, and then sum all these counts over all p.\n\nBut even that seems challenging because for each p, finding such q's is non-trivial. Maybe I can find a way to model the problem as a DP where each state represents certain characteristics of p and q that allow me to accumulate the necessary counts efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can precompute for all possible permutations their inversion counts and other attributes, then for each pair, check if the conditions are met. But with n=500, the number of permutations is way too bigâ€”like 500! which is impossible to handle.\n\nSo another approach is needed. Let's think about the problem's constraints:\n\n1. p < q lex order.\n2. inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nWhat's the relationship between inversion count and lex order? Not sure, but perhaps there's a way to model the transitions when building p and q.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to consider the problem in terms of the earliest position where p and q differ. Let's say the first differing position is at index i. At this point, p[i] < q[i], because p is lex smaller. So for all positions before i, p[j] = q[j]. So for each i, I can consider building p and q up to that point, ensuring that they are equal, and then choose p[i] < q[i].\n\nBut then, after that, the rest of the permutation needs to be considered in a way that affects both the inversion count and the lex order.\n\nHmm, maybe I can model the problem by considering the state as the current position, the last elements of p and q, and some information about the inversion counts. But that might get complicated.\n\nAnother thought: since p and q are permutations, they are both bijections from 1..n to themselves. The key is that p is lex smaller than q, which means that at the first position where they differ, p has a smaller element.\n\nLet me think about the inversion count. An inversion is a pair (i,j) where i < j and p[i] > p[j]. So for p, the inversion count is the number of such pairs. Similarly for q.\n\nI need to find all pairs (p,q) where p is lex smaller than q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the process of building p and q step by step, keeping track of certain parameters that help us compute the required counts.\n\nWait, maybe for each possible pair of prefixes of p and q, up to some position k, we can track whether p is lex smaller than q (which requires that up to k-1, p and q are equal, and at k, p[k] < q[k]). Then, beyond position k, we can build the rest of the permutation, ensuring that the inversion counts are correctly computed.\n\nThis seems promising. So the idea is to model the problem using dynamic programming where the state includes the current position, the elements chosen for p and q up to that position, and some information about the inversion counts so far.\n\nBut even that seems tricky because tracking all possible inversion counts up to each step would be infeasible for n=500.\n\nWait, perhaps the inversion count can be represented in terms of certain variables that can be updated incrementally. For example, when adding a new element to the permutation, the number of new inversions introduced can be calculated based on the elements already present.\n\nBut even that might",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using dynamic programming (DP) to track the state as we build permutations p and q step by step. The key steps are:\n\n1. **State Representation**: We represent the state using the current position, the elements chosen for p and q up to that position, and the inversion counts for both permutations.\n\n2. **Transition**: For each state, we consider all possible next elements for p and q, ensuring that p remains lexicographically smaller than q. We update the inversion counts accordingly.\n\n3. **Inversion Count Update**: When adding a new element to the permutation, the number of new inversions introduced can be calculated based on the elements already present.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we take modulo at each step to ensure we handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    max_mod = mod\n    \n    # We'll precompute factorial and inverse factorial modulo mod for faster computations\n    factorial = [1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        factorial[i] = factorial[i-1] * i % mod\n    \n    dp = [[[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(i, n+1):\n            dp[i][j][0] = 1  # Only one way when building the first i elements\n            dp[i][j][1] = 0  # No inversions initially\n    \n    for length in range(1, n+1):\n        for a in range(length):\n            for b in range(length):\n                if a == b:\n                    continue\n                current_a = a\n                current_b = b\n                total_ways = dp[a][b][0]\n                total_inv_p = dp[a][b][1]\n                total_inv_q = dp[a][b][2]\n                \n                for x in range(1, n+1 -
