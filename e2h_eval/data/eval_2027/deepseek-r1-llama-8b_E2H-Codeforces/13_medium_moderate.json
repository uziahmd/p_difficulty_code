For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are given as strings separated by spaces, and they can be in any order. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a major and minor triad. From the description:\n\n- A major triad has a specific order where the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 3 semitones apart. So, for example, C E G: C to E is 4, E to G is 3. So the total from C to G is 7 semitones.\n- A minor triad is the opposite: the first two are 3 semitones apart, and the next two are 4. Like B C# F: B to C# is 3, C# to F is 4. So the total from B to F is 7 as well.\n\nBut wait, the order in which we arrange the notes matters. So the same three notes could form a major if arranged one way and minor if arranged another. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so no cases where both apply.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Take the three notes as input.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes, considering all possible orderings.\n3. For each permutation, check if it satisfies the major or minor condition.\n4. If any permutation is major, return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n5. If none satisfy either, return 'strange'.\n\nWait, but how do I represent the notes numerically? Because calculating the distance between them requires knowing their positions in the scale.\n\nLet me think about the note order. The notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, no, the problem statement lists them as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, but in some sources, the order is sometimes different, but according to the problem statement, this is the order.\n\nSo the list is 12 notes, with H being the last before C again. Hmm, but in the problem statement, the order after H is C, so the sequence is cyclic.\n\nSo the first step is to create a mapping from each note name to its position in this list. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, ..., H is 11.\n\nOnce I have the numerical values, I can compute the distances between any two notes.\n\nWait, but when computing the distance from X to Y, it's the minimal number of semitones, but according to the problem statement, the distance is taken from the lower note to the higher one. But since the notes are cyclic, perhaps it's better to compute it modulo 12.\n\nWait, let's think: the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the distance is measured forward, like from C to E is 4, but from E to C is 8 semitones. Wait, no—because in the problem statement, the distance is always from the lower to the higher. So, for example, E to C is 8 semitones because you go E -> F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), A# (6), B (7), C (8). But wait, wait, the scale steps between consecutive notes are one semitone each. So the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but only if Y >= X. Otherwise, it's 12 - (X - Y).\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is calculated as the number of steps moving upwards. So for example, from C to E: C (0) → C# (1) → D (2) → D# (3) → E (4). So four steps. From E to C: E (4) → F (5) → F# (6) → G (7) → G# (8) → A (9) → A# (10) → B (11) → H (0, which is C) → 8 steps. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (12 - (X - Y)).\n\nSo, more precisely, distance(X, Y) = (Y - X) % 12. Because if Y < X, then Y - X is negative, so mod 12 gives the correct value.\n\nFor example, E to C: 4 - 12 = -8 mod 12 is 4? Wait, no. Wait, 0 is C, 4 is E. So (4 - 0) mod 12 is 4. But E to C is 8 semitones. Hmm, perhaps I got this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the distance as (Y - X + 12) % 12. Because if Y < X, adding 12 ensures it's positive before mod.\n\nWait, let's take E (4) to C (0). So Y - X is -4. Adding 12 gives 8, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nYes, so the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) % 12. But wait, that would give the correct value even if Y < X. Because for example, E to C: (0 -4) mod 12 is 8.\n\nWait, no, because (0 -4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Yes.\n\nSo the function to calculate the distance is (y_pos - x_pos) % 12.\n\nSo the first step is to map each note to its index.\n\nI'll create a list of the notes in the given order.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, create a dictionary, note_to_pos, which maps each note string to its index.\n\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nOnce I have that, for any note, I can get its position.\n\nNow, for the three notes, say n1, n2, n3, I need to generate all possible permutations of these three notes. Because the order matters when checking the conditions.\n\nEach permutation is a tuple of the three notes in a particular order. For each permutation, I need to check if it satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nWhat's the condition for major:\n\nIn the ordered sequence X, Y, Z:\n\ndistance(X, Y) == 4 semitones, and distance(Y, Z) == 3 semitones.\n\nWhich implies that the distance from X to Z is 7 semitones.\n\nSimilarly, for minor:\n\ndistance(X, Y) == 3, distance(Y, Z) ==4. So X to Z is 7 semitones.\n\nBut wait, in both cases, X to Z is 7 semitones. Because 4+3=7, and 3+4=7.\n\nSo for a triad to be either major or minor, the three notes must be spaced such that when arranged in some order, the first two are 4 apart, next two 3, or vice versa.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the three notes, I need to compute the distances between consecutive pairs.\n\nWait, but the triad is considered unordered. So the order in which we arrange the three notes can vary. So for each permutation, I can compute the required distances.\n\nWait, but a permutation is a specific order. So for a given permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\nCompute d1 = distance(X, Y)\nd2 = distance(Y, Z)\n\nIf d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nElse, check if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf either condition is true for any permutation, then the triad is classified accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the teacher will always give an unambiguous answer. So no triad can satisfy both major and minor for any permutation.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each permutation of the three notes, check if it's major or minor.\n\n- Once any permutation meets major, return 'major'.\n\n- Else, check if any permutation meets minor.\n\n- Else, return 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, since the same set of notes might have multiple permutations that fit major or minor, but since the answer is unique, we can just check all possible permutations until we find the first occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, for efficiency, we can collect all possible permutations and see if any meet the condition.\n\nSo, how to proceed:\n\n1. Read the three notes as a list.\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of this list. There are 3! = 6 permutations.\n\n3. For each permutation, extract the three notes in order.\n\n4. For each such triplet, compute the distances between consecutive notes.\n\n5. Check if the triplet is major or minor based on the distances.\n\n6. As soon as a permutation is found to be major, return 'major'.\n\n7. Similarly, if any permutation is minor, return 'minor'.\n\n8. If none of the permutations meet either condition, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, I'll need to import itertools.permutations.\n\nThen, for each permutation in permutations(notes_list), I'll process it.\n\nLet's outline the code structure.\n\nRead the input line, split into three note strings.\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nGenerate all permutations:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    # perm is a tuple of the three notes in order\n    # extract the three notes\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    # get their positions\n    x_pos = note_to_pos[x]\n    y_pos = note_to_pos[y]\n    z_pos = note_to_pos[z]\n\n    # compute distances\n    d_xy = (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n    d_yz = (z_pos - y_pos) % 12\n\n    # check for major\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    \n    # check for minor\n    if d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none found, print 'strange'.\n\nWait, but in this approach, as soon as any permutation is found to be major or minor, the program exits. So the order in which the permutations are processed affects which condition is met first. But since the problem says the answer is unambiguous, it won't matter.\n\nSo, the code will work.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nWait, no, the sample output is the list, but the actual code is supposed to output each case on a separate line. Or wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three space-separated notes, and the output is three lines, each being 'major', 'minor', etc.? No, wait no, the sample input shows three inputs, each being a chord, and the output is a list of three results. But in the problem statement, the input is a single line with three notes, not three lines.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes.\n\nSo, for each test case, it's a single input line with three notes, and the output is one line with 'major', 'minor', or 'strange'.\n\nWait, but the sample shows:\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, perhaps it's a typo in the problem statement. Probably, the sample input is a single line with three chords, but perhaps it's not. Or perhaps the sample is illustrative, showing that each input leads to one output.\n\nWait, looking back, the problem says, \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo, the input is a single line with three notes, separated by spaces.\n\nThe sample input shows three separate triplets, but perhaps that's a mistake. Or perhaps it's part of the problem's own example.\n\nWait, no, the problem says: \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\nSo, the problem expects that the input is a single line with three notes, e.g., \"C E G\".\n\nSo, the sample input shows three examples, each being a test case, but in reality, each run of the program takes one line as input.\n\nSo, in code, the program will read a single line, split into three notes, process, and output one line.\n\nSo, in the code, the notes list is of length 3.\n\nSo, the code will correctly process each case.\n\nNow, let's test the code against the sample.\n\nSample Input: ['C E G'] → no, wait, no, the input is a single line, e.g., \"C E G\".\n\nWait, for the first sample in the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. The actual input is a single line with three notes, e.g., \"C E G\".\n\nSo, in the code, the input is read as a single line, split into three note strings.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nCase 1: C E G.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nOne permutation is C, E, G.\n\nx=C (0), y=E(4), z=G(7).\n\nd_xy = (4-0)=4 mod12=4.\n\nd_yz = (7-4)=3 mod12=3.\n\nSo, major condition is satisfied. So the output is 'major'.\n\nCase 2: C# B F.\n\nLooking for a permutation that satisfies minor.\n\nLet's see: the notes are C#, B, F.\n\nPossible permutation: B, C#, F.\n\nx=B (10), y=C# (1), z=F (5).\n\nd_xy = (1 -10) mod12 = (1-10) is -9 mod12 is 3.\n\nd_yz = (5 -1) mod12 =4.\n\nSo 3 and 4 → minor condition is met. So output 'minor'.\n\nThird case: A B H.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nLooking for any that form a major or minor.\n\nNotes are A (9), B(10), H(11).\n\nPermutation A, B, H:\n\nd_xy =1, d_yz=1. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A.\n\nx=B (10), y=H(11), z=A(9).\n\nd_xy=1, d_yz=(9-11) mod12= (-2 mod12)=10. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B.\n\nx=11, y=9, z=10.\n\nd_xy = (9-11) mod12= 10.\n\nd_yz = (10-9) mod12=1. So no.\n\nAny other permutations?\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B.\n\nx=9, y=11, z=10.\n\nd_xy=2, d_yz= (10-11) mod12=11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H.\n\nx=10, y=9, z=11.\n\nd_xy= (9-10) mod12=11.\n\nd_yz= (11-9)=2 mod12=2.\n\nNo.\n\nOther permutations:\n\nH, B, A.\n\nx=11, y=10, z=9.\n\nd_xy= (10-11) mod12=11.\n\nd_yz= (9-10) mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, no permutation satisfies major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the sample output is ['major', 'minor', 'strange'], but each in their own runs. So the code would correctly handle each case.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about if the notes are all the same? Well, the problem says the triad consists of exactly three notes, but doesn't specify they have to be distinct. Wait, the problem says, \"a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes.\" So the same note repeated is allowed?\n\nWait, the problem says, \"exactly three notes.\" So the same note can be used, but in practice, the distance between same notes is 0, so it's impossible to form a major or minor triad.\n\nBut perhaps the input may have duplicates, but the code can handle that.\n\nFor example, input \"C C C\". All permutations are same, and the distances are zero, so output 'strange'.\n\nAnother edge case: notes wrap around.\n\nLike H, C, E.\n\nH is 11, C is 0, E is4.\n\nIn a permutation, H, C, E.\n\nd_xy: (0-11) mod12=1. d_yz: (4-0)=4 mod12=4.\n\nSo, 1 and 4. Doesn't match major or minor.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, H.\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz= (11-4)=7 mod12=7.\n\nSo 4 and 7: not 3. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, H, C.\n\nd_xy: (11-4) mod12=7.\n\nd_yz: (0-11) mod12=1.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, no major/minor.\n\nAnother edge case: E, G, C.\n\nE (4), G (7), C (0).\n\nPermutation E, G, C.\n\nd_xy=3, d_yz=(0-7) mod12=5.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: G, C, E.\n\nd_xy: (0-7) mod12=5.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, G.\n\nWe already know that's major.\n\nSo, in code, this will be detected.\n\nAnother test case: the triad is B, D#, F.\n\nWait, what is this? Let me compute.\n\nB is 10, D# is 3 (since C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n\nWait no, wait:\n\nWait, the notes_order is ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'].\n\nSo indexes:\n\nC → 0\n\nC# →1\n\nD→2\n\nD#→3\n\nE→4\n\nF→5\n\nF#→6\n\nG→7\n\nG#→8\n\nA→9\n\nB→10\n\nH→11\n\nSo, B is 10, D# is 3, F is5.\n\nWait, permutation: B, D#, F.\n\nd_xy: (3-10) mod12 = (3-10)=-7 mod12=5.\n\nd_yz: (5-3)=2 mod12=2.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: D#, F, B.\n\nx=D# (3), y=F (5), z=B (10).\n\nd_xy=2, d_yz=5.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: F, B, D#.\n\nx=5, y=10, z=3.\n\nd_xy=5, d_yz= (3-10)= -7 mod12=5.\n\nSo 5 and5. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, F, D#.\n\nx=10, y=5, z=3.\n\nd_xy= (5-10) mod12=7.\n\nd_yz= (3-5) mod12=10.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: F, D#, B.\n\nx=5, y=3, z=10.\n\nd_xy= (3-5) mod12=10.\n\nd_yz= (10-3)=7 mod12=7.\n\nSo 10 and7: no.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a minor triad.\n\nWait, what about permutation F, A, C#.\n\nWait, F is5, A is9, C# is1.\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz= (1-9)= -8 mod12=4.\n\nSo 4 and4. No.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's a strange chord.\n\nSo, the code needs to correctly handle all permutations.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Are the note names case-sensitive? The problem says the notes are given in the notation as listed, so assume they are case-sensitive and exact as per the input.\n\n- The note list is correctly defined.\n\n- The code correctly handles the wrapping around of H to C.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_pos mapping.\n\nThen, for each permutation, compute the distances.\n\nImplementing this in code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the notes are passed as a list, so for the input line, it's split into three elements.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: C E G → major.\n\nSample Input 2: C# B F → minor.\n\nSample Input3: A B H → strange.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: input is 'E G C' → major.\n\nBecause in the permutation E, G, C:\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nd_xy=3, d_yz= (0-7) mod12=5. So no.\n\nWait, wait, no: E to G is 3 semitones, G to C is (0-7) mod12=5. So 3 and5, no.\n\nWait, but wait, E to G is 3, but in a permutation E, C, G: E (4), C (0), G (7).\n\nd_xy= (0-4) mod12=8.\n\nd_yz= (7-0)=7.\n\nSo 8 and7: no.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct permutation is C, E, G.\n\nWhich gives d_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'B D F' → let's see.\n\nB is10, D is2, F is5.\n\nCheck permutation B, D, F.\n\nd_xy= (2-10) mod12=4.\n\nd_yz= (5-2)=3.\n\nSo 4 and3 → major.\n\nSo the code would output 'major'.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample 'C# B F' is minor.\n\nSo, the code correctly identifies the triads.\n\nSo, now, the code is written.\n\nBut wait, the code is supposed to read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nHere's the code:\n\nImport necessary modules.\n\nRead the input.\n\nProcess each permutation.\n\nCheck conditions.\n\nOutput accordingly.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead the input as a list of three note strings.\n\nCreate the note_to_pos dictionary.\n\nIterate over all permutations.\n\nFor each permutation, compute the distances.\n\nCheck major or minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies, output and exit.\n\nIf none, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, the note_to_pos is created once.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_pos = note_to_pos[x]\n    y_pos = note_to_pos[y]\n    z_pos = note_to_pos[z]\n    \n    d_xy = (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n    d_yz = (z_pos - y_pos) % 12\n    \n    if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, the 'exit()' is called as soon as a condition is met. So, the code will print 'major' or 'minor' and terminate immediately upon finding a permutation that fits. Otherwise, after checking all permutations, it will print 'strange'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'C E G'\n\nIn the code, the first permutation is ('C', 'E', 'G').\n\nx_pos=0, y_pos=4, z_pos=7.\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major is printed.\n\nSample Input 2: 'C# B F' → the permutation 'B', 'C#', 'F' is checked.\n\nB is10, C# is1, F is5.\n\nd_xy=1-10= -9 mod12=3.\n\nd_yz=5-1=4.\n\nSo minor is printed.\n\nSample Input3: 'A B H' → none of the permutations satisfy, so 'strange' is printed.\n\nAnother test case: 'E G C'.\n\nThe code checks permutations.\n\nOne permutation is E, G, C: d_xy=3, d_yz=5.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation is G, E, C: d_xy= (4-7) mod12= -3 mod12=9. No.\n\nAnother permutation is E, C, G: d_xy= (0-4) mod12=8. No.\n\nAnother permutation is C, E, G: yes, 4 and 3 → major.\n\nSo the code will print 'major'.\n\nAnother test case: 'B D F' → permutation 'B', 'D', 'F' has d_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: 'F A C#' → F(5), A(9), C#(1).\n\nPermutation F, A, C#:\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz= (1-9) mod12= ( -8 mod12 )=4.\n\nSo 4 and4: not major or minor.\n\nAnother permutation: A, C#, F.\n\nd_xy= (1-9) mod12= 10, d_yz= (5-1)=4 → 10 and4: no.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, F, A.\n\nd_xy= (5-1)=4, d_yz= (9-5)=4 → 4 and4: no.\n\nAnother permutation: F, C#, A.\n\nd_xy= (1-5) mod12= 8, d_yz= (9-1)=8 → 8 and8: no.\n\nAnother permutation: A, F, C#.\n\nd_xy= (5-9) mod12= 8, d_yz= (1-5) mod12=8 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, A, F.\n\nd_xy= (9-1) mod12=8, d_yz= (5-9) mod12=8 → no.\n\nSo, this is a strange chord.\n\nThus, the code correctly returns 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are provided in a cyclic order, and the classification is based on specific semitone distances between consecutive notes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: A major triad is defined by two specific semitone distances: 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note. Conversely, a minor triad is defined by distances of 3 semitones and 4 semitones respectively.\n2. **Cyclic Nature of Notes**: The notes are cyclic, meaning after 'H' comes 'C' again. This cyclic nature must be considered when calculating distances.\n3. **Permutations**: Since the order of notes can vary, we need to check all permutations of the three notes to determine if any permutation fits the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, calculate the distance between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_pos = note_to_pos[x]\n    y_pos = note_to_pos[y]\n    z_pos = note_to_pos[z]\n    \n    d_xy = (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n    d_yz = (z_pos - y_pos) % 12\n    \n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d_xy == 3 and d_yz == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single line with three space-separated notes.\n2. **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to its corresponding position in the cyclic order of notes.\n3. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated.\n4. **Major Triad Check**: If the distance between the first two notes is 4 semitones and between the next two is 3 semitones, the triad is classified as major.\n5. **Minor Triad Check**: If the distance between the first two notes is 3 semitones and between the next two is 4 semitones, the triad is classified as minor.\n6. **Output Result**: If neither condition is met for any permutation, the triad is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging the cyclic nature of the notes and modular arithmetic for distance calculations.",
