On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers, each being 1 or 2. Tommy wants to reverse a subarray (a continuous segment) in the original sequence such that after reversing, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the new array is as long as possible. My task is to find the maximum possible length of this LNDS after choosing the best possible subarray to reverse.\n\nHmm, right. So the input is a sequence of n elements, each either 1 or 2. We can choose any interval [l, r], reverse the elements from l to r, and then compute the LNDS of the modified array. The goal is to find the maximum possible LNDS over all possible choices of [l, r].\n\nWait, but what exactly is the LNDS? It's the length of the longest subsequence where each element is >= the previous one. So for example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4 because we can take all elements in order, which after reversing becomes [1,1,2,2]. Or wait, no, actually, the example given says that after reversing [2,3], which are the elements at positions 2 and 3 (so the subarray is [2,1] which when reversed becomes [1,2]), making the entire array [1,1,2,2], whose LNDS is 4.\n\nSo the first step is to consider all possible subarrays to reverse and find the best one that maximizes the LNDS. But considering all possible subarrays might be computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 2000, leading to O(n^2) possibilities. For each possibility, computing the LNDS might be O(n^2), which would make the total time O(n^4), which is 2000^4 = 16e12 operations—way too slow.\n\nWait, that's not feasible. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the problem. Since the original sequence only consists of 1s and 2s, maybe there's a pattern or a way to model this without brute-forcing all possibilities.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible LNDS we can achieve? Well, the entire array can be made into a non-decreasing sequence by reversing certain subarrays. For instance, if the array is [2,1,2], reversing the middle two elements gives [2,2,2], which has an LNDS of 3. Wait, but that's already the maximum possible since all elements are 2s. But if the array is [2,2,1], then reversing the last two elements gives [2,1,2], which doesn't help much. Wait, no—reversing the last two would give [2,2,1], same as before. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way to maximize the LNDS is to make as many consecutive 1s or 2s as possible. Because a non-decreasing subsequence can include all the 1s followed by all the 2s, regardless of their order. So the LNDS is essentially the maximum between the count of 1s plus the count of 2s, but wait, no—that's only if they are in non-decreasing order.\n\nWait no, that's not quite right. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4 because you can take all four elements in order. But if the array is [2,1,2,1], the LNDS is 2 because you can take 2,2 or 1,1, but not more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem differently. Let's think about the original array and how reversing a subarray can affect the counts of 1s and 2s in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal reversal is such that a certain prefix is all 1s and a suffix is all 2s. Because then the LNDS would be the number of 1s plus the number of 2s, which is the entire array. But wait, that's only possible if the array can be rearranged into all 1s followed by all 2s. But the problem allows us to reverse any subarray, not just a single block.\n\nWait, no. Reversing a subarray can change the order of elements within that subarray, but the rest of the array remains as is. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to arrange the array into a form where the 1s come first, then the 2s, possibly with some interleaving but in a way that the LNDS is maximized.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe another approach: for each possible [l, r], compute the effect of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a subarray in the given sequence. The sequence consists of 1s and 2s, and we can reverse any continuous segment of the sequence.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that reversing a subarray can potentially reorder elements within that segment, which might help in forming a longer non-decreasing subsequence. However, directly checking all possible subarrays is computationally expensive. Instead, we can leverage the properties of the sequence and use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the optimal solution.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming for LNDS**: Compute the LNDS for the original sequence using dynamic programming. This will give us a baseline to compare against.\n2. **Consider Reversing Subarrays**: For each possible subarray, consider what effect reversing it would have on the LNDS. Specifically, check if reversing this subarray could potentially merge two increasing sequences (one of 1s and one of 2s) into a single longer sequence.\n3. **Optimal Merge Check**: For each possible split point in the array, compute the maximum number of 1s before the split and the maximum number of 2s after the split. The sum of these two values gives the potential LNDS if the subarray between them is reversed to merge the two sequences.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_lnds(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill dp[i][j] for all i <= j\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] >= arr[i]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j])\n    \n    return dp[0][n-1]\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    arr = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    original_lnds = compute_lnds(arr)\n    \n    max_lnds = original_lnds\n    \n    # Precompute prefix counts of 1s and suffix counts of 2s\n    prefix_ones = [0] * n\n    suffix_twos = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # If the subarray [l, r] is reversed\n            # We need to find how many 1s are before l and how many 2s are after r\n            ones_before = prefix_ones[l-1] if l > 0 else 0\n            twos_after = suffix_twos[r+1] if r < n-1 else 0\n            current_max = ones_before + twos_after\n            if current_max > max_lnds:\n                max_lnds = current_max\n    \n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Compute LNDS for Original Array**: Using dynamic programming, we first compute the LNDS for the original array. This gives us a reference value to compare against when considering reversed subarrays.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We precompute the number of 1s up to each index (prefix_ones) and the number of 2s from each index to the end (suffix_twos). These arrays help us quickly evaluate the potential LNDS if a subarray is reversed.\n3. **Evaluate Subarrays**: For each possible subarray, we check how many 1s are before the subarray and how many 2s are after the subarray. The sum of these values gives the potential LNDS if the subarray is reversed to merge the two sequences.\n4. **Maximize LNDS**: By iterating over all possible subarrays and evaluating their potential impact on the LNDS, we keep track of the maximum possible LNDS found.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the best subarray to reverse, ensuring we maximize the LNDS without brute-forcing all possibilities, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
