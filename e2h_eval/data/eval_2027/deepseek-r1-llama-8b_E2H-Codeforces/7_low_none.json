The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a certain number of vertices n can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph has specific construction rules. \n\nHmm, let me try to understand the structure. So initially, there's one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it, where k is greater than 1. Then, for each vertex that has only one edge (the leaves), we connect each to k new vertices. And importantly, this last step must be done at least once. So the minimal case would have two layers: the root with k children, and each of those children having k children, but wait, no— wait, the step is done at least once. So maybe the minimal case is when the root has k children, and then each of them has k children, making it three layers in total. Or perhaps it's the root plus one layer, but the process is done at least once, which might mean that the root's children are expanded again.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that each vertex connected by only one edge (so the initial root is connected to k vertices, each of those has degree 1 after that) must be connected to k new vertices. So for each such vertex, they must undergo this expansion. So the process must be done at least once. So the initial root has k children. Then, each of those must each have k children. So the structure has the root, k nodes at level 1, and each of those has k nodes at level 2. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k*k.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because each of the k nodes at level 1 will add k children. So that's k * k = k² nodes at level 2. So the total is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut wait, what if the process is done more than once? For example, after adding level 2, each node in level 2 could also add k children. Then the total would be 1 + k + k² + k³. But the problem states that the process is done at least once. So the minimal structure is when the process is done exactly once, meaning that the root's children are expanded once. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k².\n\nWait, but the problem says that each vertex connected by only one edge must be connected to k new vertices. So after the root is connected to k nodes, each of those nodes is a leaf (degree 1). So the process is done once on each of them. So yes, each of those adds k children. So the minimal structure is 1 +k +k². But wait, could the process be done more than once on some nodes? Like, suppose after the first expansion, some nodes are added, and then perhaps another expansion on some of them?\n\nWait, no. Because the process is that each vertex that is connected by only one edge (i.e., a leaf) must be connected to k new vertices. So in the initial step, the root is connected to k leaves. Then, each of those leaves must themselves be connected to k new nodes. So that's the second step, which is required to be done at least once. So the minimal structure is 1 + k + k^2 nodes.\n\nBut wait, maybe the process can be done multiple times. Like, after expanding the leaves, those new nodes become leaves and must be expanded again. So that would create more layers.\n\nSo the total number of nodes depends on how many times the expansion is done beyond the initial step.\n\nWait, the problem says that the process is done at least once. So the initial root has its k children, and each of those children must be expanded at least once. Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nEach vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so this step is done at least once. So the initial root is connected to k nodes. Then, each of these k nodes (since they are connected to only the root) must be connected to k new nodes. So that's the first time the step is done. So the process must be done at least once, which means that the initial step (adding the root's children) is done, and then the step of expanding each leaf is done at least once.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is that the initial step is adding the root's children, and then each of those children is expanded. So the overall structure is the root, then k children, each of which have k children. So the total nodes are 1 + k + k^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process can be done multiple times. Like, after adding the first layer, each of those nodes expands",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf.

Each of these \\( k \\) vertices must then be connected to \\( k \\) new vertices each. This process is repeated at least once, creating layers of vertices.\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The total number of vertices in a snowflake graph after \\( m \\) expansions (where each expansion adds a new layer) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( m \\) is the number of times the expansion step is performed beyond the initial root.\n3. **Check for Valid \\( n \\)**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists an integer \\( m \\geq 1 \\) and an integer \\( k > 1 \\) such that \\( n \\) matches the sum of the series up to \\( m \\) terms.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    # We need to find if n can be written as 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1})\n    # Which is 1 + k * (k^m -

For each combination, it verifies if the total number of vertices \\( n \\) matches the required structure of the snowflake graph. If a valid \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) are found, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".",
