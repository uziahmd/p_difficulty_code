She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this competitive programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, Luba has n opened tabs in her browser. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to close all tabs that are not in the segment [l, r]. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but within the current range of open tabs), or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to leave only the tabs from l to r open.\n\nHmm. So, the steps she can take involve moving the cursor and then closing tabs on either side.\n\nLet me think about the process. She needs to get into a position where she can close all the necessary tabs on both sides.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial state. The tabs are from 1 to n. She can perform operations to close some tabs, which will change the active range. For example, after closing tabs to the left, the new 'a' (minimum) becomes the next available tab.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when she closes tabs to the left, it's all the tabs from a to i-1. Similarly for the right. So, each close operation reduces the active range.\n\nSo, the plan is to:\n\n1. Move the cursor to a position where she can close the left tabs.\n2. Close them.\n3. Move to another position where she can close the right tabs.\n4. Close them.\n\nEach of these steps involves movement and closing, which takes time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can do it in a different order, like close the right first, then the left. Or perhaps even one of them isn't needed if the initial position is already optimal.\n\nBut what's the minimal way?\n\nLet's think about the initial position 'pos'. She may need to adjust it so that she can close the tabs on the left and/or right.\n\nFor example, if she needs to close tabs to the left of l, she must reach a position >= l, then close left. But wait, no: if she's at position i, closing the left would close all tabs from a to i-1. So, to close the left of l, she should be at a position i where i-1 < l. So i must be at least l+1? Or wait, if she's at l, then closing left would close all tabs before l, which is exactly what we want.\n\nWait, the initial a is 1. So, if she is at l, and she closes left, that will close all tabs from 1 to l-1. That's correct. Then, she needs to close the right part. But for that, she needs to be somewhere in the middle.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Move to l, close left (cost: steps to move from pos to l, plus 1 second for closing)\n- Then, move to r, close right (steps from l to r, plus 1)\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the new a is l. So, moving from l to r is straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe she can move to the end of the left closure, then the end of the right.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are determined by whether she needs to close left, right, both, or neither.\n\nLet me outline the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close. If l=1 and r=n, then output is 0.\n\nCase 2: Only left tabs need to be closed. So she needs to close all tabs to the left of l.\n\nHow? She needs to move to a position >= l, then close left. So, the minimal movement is from pos to l (if pos >= l), or maybe to some other point.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when she's at position i, closing left will close all tabs from a to i-1. So if she's at i = l, closing left will remove all tabs less than l. So she doesn't need to go beyond l to close the left.\n\nSimilarly, for the right, she needs to be at i such that i+1 > r. So she can be at r, then close right, which will close all tabs from r+1 to b.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Move to l: cost is |pos - l| steps.\n- Close left: +1 step.\n- Move to r: cost is |l - r| steps.\n- Close right: +1 step.\n\nTotal steps: (|pos-l| + |l - r|) + 2.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe there's a better way. What if she can close the right first?\n\nFor example, suppose she is already at a position where she can close the right without moving much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can move to the closest position that allows her to close both sides in minimal steps.\n\nLet me think about all possible scenarios",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves moving the cursor and closing tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closing Tabs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r` that need to be closed. If there are no tabs to close (i.e., `l=1` and `r=n`), the answer is 0 seconds.\n2. **Calculate Movement Costs**: If tabs need to be closed:\n   - Move to position `l` to close the left tabs.\n   - Move from `l` to `r` to close the right tabs.\n3. **Close Tabs Efficiently**: Each move and each close operation takes a second. Calculate the total time by summing the movement steps and the two close operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Check if no tabs need to be closed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Calculate the steps needed to close left and right\n    left_close_pos = l\n    right_close_pos = r\n\n    # Steps to move to left_close_pos from pos\n    move_left = abs(pos - left_close_pos)\n    # Steps to move to right_close_pos from left_close_pos\n    move_right = abs(left_close_pos - right_close_pos)\n\n    # Total steps for movement and two closes\n    total = move_left + move_right + 2\n\n    print(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **No Tabs to Close**: If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, no tabs need closing, so the result is 0.\n- **Movement and Closing**: If there are tabs to close:\n  - Move from the initial position to `l` (cost: `|pos - l|` steps).\n  - Close the left tabs (cost: 1 step).\n  - Move from `l` to `r` (cost: `|l - r|` steps).\n  - Close the right tabs (cost: 1 step).\n- **Total Time**: Sum the movement steps and the two close operations to get the total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimal time required by considering the necessary movements and operations.",
