For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are given as strings separated by spaces, and they can be in any order. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a major and minor triad. From the description:\n\n- A major triad has a specific order where the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 3 semitones apart. So, for example, C E G: C to E is 4, E to G is 3. So the total from C to G is 7 semitones.\n- A minor triad is the opposite: the first two are 3 semitones apart, and the next two are 4. Like, C# B F would be ordered as B, C#, F. So B to C# is 3, C# to F is 4.\n\nSo the approach is to generate all possible permutations of the three notes, arrange them in a circular manner (since after H comes C again), compute the distances between consecutive notes, and check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nWait, but since the triad is an unordered set, the order in which we consider the notes matters because the arrangement determines the distances. So for each possible ordering of the three notes, we'll calculate the distances between consecutive notes and see if any such arrangement meets the criteria for major or minor.\n\nBut how do I represent the notes and their positions numerically to make distance calculation easier?\n\nHmm. I think I should map each note to its position in the 12-note scale. For example, let's create a list that represents the order of the notes. Let me list them out:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait—wait, no, the problem says \"notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\" Oh right, so H is the last note before C repeats.\n\nWait, but wait—is that correct? Because in the standard chromatic scale, it's C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, and then C again. But in the problem statement, the sequence provided is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H comes after B, and before C again. So the order is 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing because usually, the 11th note is B, and then C is the 12th. But here, H is the 12th. So perhaps the problem uses a different notation, perhaps considering H as equivalent to B? Or maybe it's a typo. No, according to the problem statement, it's exactly as given. So the 12 notes are as listed, with H being the last before C repeats.\n\nSo I think the correct order is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nWait, no—wait, looking at the list:\n\nThe list is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes. So their indices in the list would be 0 to 11.\n\nWait, but when you go from H to C, that's 1 semitone (since H is 11, C is 0; the distance is 11 - 0 + 1? Or is it 1 step? Wait, the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So from C (0) to C# (1) is 1 semitone. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as (y - x) mod 12, but each step is 1 semitone. So for example, from C (0) to E (4) is 4 semitones, which matches the sample input.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample, C to E is 4 semitones, which is correct. So yes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, and each step is 1 semitone. So for X and Y, the distance is (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower note to the higher one. So if X is lower",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are provided in any order, and we need to classify the triad based on specific distance criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Positions**: First, we map each note to its position in a 12-note scale. This allows us to calculate the distance between notes easily.\n2. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation of the three notes, calculate the distances between consecutive notes. Since the notes are cyclic, we use modulo arithmetic to handle the wrap-around from H back to C.\n3. **Check Triad Type**: For each permutation, check if it fits the criteria for a major or minor triad:\n   - **Major Triad**: The first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 3 semitones apart.\n   - **Minor Triad**: The first two notes are 3 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 4 semitones apart.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on the checks, classify the triad as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither condition is met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input notes\nnotes = input().split()\n\n# Create a list mapping each note to its index\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two notes\ndef get_distance(a, b):\n    return (note_to_index[b] - note_to_index[a]) % 12\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of the three notes\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    # Calculate the distances between consecutive notes\n    d1 = get_distance(perm[0], perm[1])\n    d2 = get_distance(perm[1], perm[2])\n    \n    # Check for major triad condition\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        is_major = True\n        break\n    \n    # Check for minor triad condition\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        is_minor = True\n        break\n\nif is_major and is_minor:\n    print(\"strange\")\nelif is_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input notes are read and split into a list.\n2. **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to its corresponding index in the 12-note scale.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: A helper function calculates the distance between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Permutations Check**: All permutations of the three notes are generated, and for each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are checked against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n5. **Result Classification**: Based on the checks, the triad is classified as major, minor, or strange, and the result is printed accordingly.",
