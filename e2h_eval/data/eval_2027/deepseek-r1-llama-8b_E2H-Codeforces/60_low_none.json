Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to calculate, after each modification to a string S, the number of non-empty substrings that correspond to valid English letters in Morse code. The result should be printed modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, let's understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, what's Morse code for each English letter? Each letter is represented as a string of 1-4 dots (0s) and dashes (1s). But there are 30 possible strings of length 1-4 with 0 and 1, but some are invalid. Specifically, four strings are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So any substring of S that corresponds to one of these four is not counted.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that each string of 0s and 1s of length up to 4 translates into a distinct English letter except those four. So the valid Morse codes are all the 30 possible except those four, which means 26 valid codes.\n\nSo when processing S, every time we add a character, we can look at all possible substrings ending at the current position and see if they form a valid Morse code. Then, we sum all such valid substrings.\n\nBut the challenge is to do this efficiently because m can be up to 3000, and for each step, considering all possible substrings would be O(n^2), which might be manageable since n is up to 3000, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming or some state that keeps track of possible valid substrings.\n\nI remember that similar problems involve keeping track of the last few characters and using that to compute the current possibilities.\n\nFor example, for each position i, we can keep track of all possible sequences of certain lengths that end at i and are valid. Then, the total count can be built incrementally.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother approach: For each position, consider all possible substrings ending at that position. For each possible length (1, 2, 3, 4), check if the substring is a valid Morse code. Sum all these up.\n\nBut for m=3000, doing this naively would be O(m * 4) per step, which is manageable.\n\nWait, no—because for each step, the number of possible substrings is up to the current length. So for the ith step, we have i substrings of length 1, i-1 of length 2, etc., down to 1. So the total is O(i^2), which for i=3000 is about 9 million operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can optimize it by tracking for each possible length, how many valid substrings end at the current position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute all the valid Morse codes and for each new character, check all possible substrings ending here of lengths 1-4, and see if they are in the valid set.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Precompute all the valid Morse codes. These are all possible strings of 0s and 1s of lengths 1-4, except the four invalid ones.\n\n2. For each step, when adding a new character (either '0' or '1'), we examine all possible substrings ending at this position with lengths 1, 2, 3, 4. For each such substring, check if it's in the valid set. If yes, add it to the total.\n\n3. Keep a running total of the number of valid substrings, and after each step, output the current total modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, how do we check if a substring is valid? Storing all valid Morse codes in a set for quick lookup would help. So first, generate all valid Morse codes.\n\nHow many are there? Let's calculate:\n\nTotal possible strings: sum_{k=1 to 4} 2^k = 2 +4+8+16=30.\n\nInvalid: 4. So valid is 26.\n\nSo create a set containing these 26 strings.\n\nNow, for each step, for the current character c (appended to S), we look back up to 3 positions (since the substring can be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4). For each possible length l (1,2,3,4), check if the substring from position i-l+1 to i is in the valid set.\n\nWait, but in the current setup, S is being built step by step. So for each step, the current position is the last character. So for each step i (0-based?), the current string is s_1 s_2 ... s_i.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the string starting from 0. So after i steps, the string has length i.\n\nAt step i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to an initially empty string. Each modification appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1') to the string. The result after each modification should be printed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Valid Morse Codes**: First, we identify all valid Morse codes corresponding to English letters. These are all possible strings of '0's and '1's of lengths 1 to 4, excluding the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n2. **Precompute Valid Codes**: We generate all valid Morse codes and store them in a set for quick lookup.\n\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each modification, we maintain a running total of valid substrings. After each modification, we check all possible substrings ending at the current position (of lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4) to see if they are valid Morse codes. If a substring is valid, it contributes to the total count.\n\n4. **Efficiency Consideration**: By checking each possible substring length up to 4, the solution efficiently handles up to 3000 modifications, ensuring the algorithm runs in a reasonable time frame.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute all valid Morse codes\nvalid_codes = set()\nfor length in range(1, 5):\n    for bits in itertools.product('01', repeat=length):\n        code = ''.join(bits)\n        if code not in {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}:\n            valid_codes.add(code)\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\ntotal = 0\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n    # Check all possible substrings ending here with lengths 1-4\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        start = len(s) - l\n        if start < 0:\n            continue\n        substr = ''.join(s[start:])\n        if substr in valid_codes:\n            total += 1\n    print(total % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Valid Codes**: We generate all possible strings of '0's and '1's of lengths 1 to 4 and exclude the four invalid ones. This gives us 26 valid Morse codes.\n\n2. **Iterative Check**: For each modification, we append the new character to the string `s`. We then check all substrings ending at the current position with lengths 1 to 4. Each substring is checked against the precomputed set of valid codes.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: By iterating through each possible substring length and using a set for quick validation, the solution efficiently counts valid substrings after each modification.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle up to 3000 modifications efficiently, providing the required results in a timely manner.",
