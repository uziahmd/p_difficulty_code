He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A creates a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So now the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before C adds them. Also, it's allowed for the count to be equal to both.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given string S could have been formed through this process.\n\nFirst, I should think about the structure of the string.\n\nThe string must follow the order: all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends letters, so after A, only 'a's; after B, 'a's followed by 'b's; after C, 'a's, 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nSo the first thing to check is that the string doesn't have any 'b's before 'a's, or 'c's before 'b's. Wait no—actually, the string should be a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's. Any deviation from this order means it's invalid.\n\nWait, no. For example, the string can't have a 'b' before an 'a', because A created the string with only 'a's, then B appended 'b's. Similarly, C can't add any 'c's before the 'b's, because the 'c's are added at the end.\n\nSo the entire string must consist of a non-decreasing sequence of 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's, without any interleaving. So the string should be in the form aaaabbbbc, but not have any other characters in between.\n\nSo first, I need to verify that the string is in the correct order: all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nIf this condition isn't met, we can immediately return \"NO\".\n\nNext, I need to calculate the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- count_a = number of 'a's\n- count_b = number of 'b's\n- count_c = number of 'c's\n\nNow, according to the problem statement:\n\nAfter B appends the 'b's, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends 'c's such that count_c equals either count_a or count_b (or both).\n\nSo, after C appends, the total count of 'c's must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, because count_a includes all the 'a's that were present before C added the 'c's. Similarly for count_b.\n\nSo, the condition is count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nAdditionally, since C appends some number of 'c's, count_c must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string after B appends. So in the string after B, count_a and count_b are fixed. So when C appends, the count_c is set to either count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, in the final string, count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b, but also, it's possible that count_c equals both. For example, if count_a = count_b, then count_c can be either.\n\nWait, but what if after C appends, count_c equals count_a or count_b. So the condition is count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the correct order: all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. If not, output NO.\n\n2. Compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\n3. Ensure that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n4. Also, ensure that count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1, because B appends some 'b's, making sure that after B's step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nBut wait, A could have made a string with only 'a's, but B appends at least one 'b' to make sure there's at least one of each. So count_a and count_b must be at least 1 each.\n\nSo, step 0: Check that the string starts with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, followed by zero or more 'c's? Or maybe one or more 'c's?\n\nWait, no. Because C appends some number of 'c's, which is equal to count_a or count_b. So count_c must be at least 1.\n\nWait, because in the note, it says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. But the problem says that the number is 'some number'—so it could be zero? No, because the problem states that C appends some number of 'c's, implying that the count is at least one.\n\nWait, the note says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. But the problem statement says that C appends some number of letters 'c', which implies that the count is at least one. So, the count_c must be >=1.\n\nTherefore, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? Or perhaps not necessarily.\n\nWait, no. Because in the process:\n\nA creates a string of 'a's (could be just one), then B appends 'b's (so at least one 'b'), then C appends 'c's (so at least one 'c').\n\nSo the final string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. So in the given string S, all three counts must be >=1.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThey have made sure that at the point when B gives the string to C, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So when C appends, count_c is equal to the current count_a or count_b, which are both >=1.\n\nSo count_c is >=1.\n\nTherefore, the final string must have count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nSo during the checks:\n\n- The string must have all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's, in order.\n\n- count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n- count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the algorithm is:\n\nCheck the order: all 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nIf not, return NO.\n\nElse, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nIf any of them is zero, return NO.\n\nIf count_c is equal to count_a or count_b, return YES.\n\nElse, return NO.\n\nWait, but let me look at the examples given.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nInput: 'aaabccc'\n\ncount_a = 3, count_b = 1, count_c =3.\n\nSo count_c equals count_a, which is 3. So condition satisfied.\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc'\n\nThe order is wrong: starts with 'b's, so fails the first check. So output is NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc'\n\nWait, no, the third example input is 'aabc'?\n\nWait, the input is ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], but the outputs are ['YES', 'NO', 'YES'].\n\nWait, the third example is 'aabc'?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, 'aabc' would be 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c'—but in the string, the 'b' comes before 'c', which is correct. So the order is a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nWait, no. 'aabc' is a a b c. So the 'b's are in the third position, and 'c's come after. So the order is correct.\n\nCount_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 1.\n\nSo count_c is 1, which equals count_b. So condition is satisfied.\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the string is 'aabbbc'.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which is neither 2 nor 3. So condition not satisfied, output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc'—no, because the order is incorrect. It's a a b b a a c c c. So after the initial a's, there are b's, then a's again, which is invalid. So order check fails.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts are 2, 2, 2. So count_c is 2, which equals count_a and count_b. So condition is satisfied. Output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. So count_c is 1, which is equal to count_a and count_b. So condition is satisfied. Output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a, which is 1. So condition is satisfied. Output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c is 2, which is greater than both count_a and count_b. So condition not satisfied. Output NO.\n\nSo, seems like the logic is solid.\n\nSo, how do I implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, read the input string S.\n\nThen, check the order.\n\nHow to check the order:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and ensure that once a character is found that is not 'a', all subsequent characters must be 'b's until the next change, and then only 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, split the string into runs of same characters and ensure the runs are in order 'a's -> 'b's -> 'c's.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nFor 'aaabccc', the runs are [a, a, a, b, c, c, c].\n\nWhich is in the correct order.\n\nFor 'aabc', the runs are [a, a, b, c], which is correct.\n\nFor 'abba', the runs are [a, b, b, a], which is incorrect because after b comes a.\n\nSo, the way to check is:\n\nThe string can be broken down into runs of same characters.\n\nEach run must be 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nSo, the runs list must start with 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's.\n\nMoreover, each run must be a single type.\n\nSo, let's code this.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nInitialize current_char as the first character.\n\ncurrent_run = [first_char]\n\nthen for each next char in S:\n\nif char == current_run[-1], continue adding to current_run.\n\nelse:\n\nif current_run is 'a's, and new char is 'b', proceed.\n\nif current_run is 'a's and new char is 'c', invalid.\n\nif current_run is 'b's and new char is 'a', invalid.\n\nif current_run is 'b's and new char is 'c', proceed.\n\nif current_run is 'c's, invalid.\n\nSo, let's write code to process the runs.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to find the indices where the characters change.\n\nSo, for the string, find all the positions where the character changes, and collect the characters in those segments.\n\nFor example:\n\nS = 'aaabccc'\n\nSegments are:\n\n['a', 'a', 'a'], ['b', 'b', 'c'], ['c', 'c', 'c']\n\nWait, no. Wait, the segments are the runs of same characters.\n\nWait, in 'aaabccc', the runs are:\n\nRun 1: 'a's (length 3)\n\nRun 2: 'b's (length 1)\n\nRun 3: 'c's (length 3)\n\nSo the order is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'aabba' → runs are a, ab, a → which is invalid.\n\nSo, how to represent the runs:\n\nWe can loop through each character and track when the character changes.\n\nWe can collect the runs in a list, where each element is the character of the run.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nruns = []\n\nprev_char = None\n\nfor char in S:\n\n    if prev_char is None:\n\n        runs.append(char)\n\n        prev_char = char\n\n    else:\n\n        if char != prev_char:\n\n            runs.append(char)\n\n            prev_char = char\n\nSo, for 'aaabccc', the runs list is ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\nFor 'aabc', runs are ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\nFor 'abba', runs are ['a', 'b', 'a'].\n\nSo, if the runs list is not exactly ['a', 'b', 'c'], then the order is invalid.\n\nWait, but the runs list can have only a single 'a' run, a single 'b' run, and a single 'c' run.\n\nBecause the string is built by appending, so the runs can't have multiple a's, etc.\n\nSo, the runs list must be of length exactly 3, and the elements must be 'a', 'b', 'c' in order.\n\nOtherwise, the order is invalid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n\n    return False\n\nelif runs[0] != 'a' or runs[1] != 'b' or runs[2] != 'c':\n\n    return False\n\nelse:\n\n    proceed.\n\nWait, but what about a string like 'aaaabbbbc' → runs are ['a','b','c'].\n\nThat's correct.\n\nWhat about 'aabbc'? Runs are ['a','b','c'] → correct.\n\nWhat about 'aabbaaccc'? Runs are ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c'] → len 4 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code would correctly reject it.\n\nSo, in code, we can do:\n\nCompute the runs list.\n\nIf runs is not exactly 3 elements, then order is invalid.\n\nElse, check if the elements are 'a', 'b', 'c' in order.\n\nIf not, order is invalid.\n\nSo, that's the first check.\n\nOnce that's done, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, 'c's.\n\nBut wait, in the runs, the count for each is the length of their run.\n\nBut since the runs are in order, the count_a is the length of the first run, count_b is the length of the second, count_c is the length of the third.\n\nWait, no. Because the runs are the groupings of same characters.\n\nSo, the first run is 'a's, so count_a is the length of the first run.\n\nSimilarly, count_b is the length of the second run, count_c is the length of the third run.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncount_a = len(runs[0])\n\ncount_b = len(runs[1])\n\ncount_c = len(runs[2])\n\nBut wait, what if the runs are longer than 3? Like, say, 'aaaabbbbcdd' → but in our problem, the string consists of only 'a', 'b', 'c'. So the runs can't have 'd's.\n\nSo, the runs can only be 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nThus, the runs list will be of length 3, and each element is one of 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nruns = []\nprev = None\nfor char in S:\n    if char != prev:\n        runs.append(char)\n        prev = char\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    # order invalid\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif runs[0] != 'a' or runs[1] != 'b' or runs[2] != 'c':\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ncount_a = len(runs[0])\ncount_b = len(runs[1])\ncount_c = len(runs[2])\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: count_c is len(runs[2]).\n\nBut what if the string is 'aaaabbbbc' → count_c is 1, which equals count_a (4) no, but 1 is not equal to 4. So in that case, the condition would fail.\n\nWait, but in this case, count_c is 1, count_a is 4, count_b is 3.\n\nSo, 1 is not equal to either 4 or 3. So condition not met.\n\nSo the function returns 'NO'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, C appends some 'c's equal to the count of 'a's or 'b's. So in this example, the count_c is 1, but neither 4 nor 3, so it's invalid.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1.\n\nSo count_c is 1, which is not equal to 2 or 2. So condition not met. So output is 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' is invalid due to order.\n\nWait, no. Because the runs would be a, b, a, c → len 4, so order check fails.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → runs are a, b, c → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1 → count_c is equal to count_a, so condition met → output 'YES'.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → runs are a, b, c → count_c=1, which is equal to count_a and count_b. So condition met → 'YES'.\n\nAnother case: 'abba' → runs are a, b, a → len 3, but runs[0] is a, runs[1] is b, runs[2] is a → which is invalid. So order check fails.\n\nSo code returns 'NO'.\n\nSo, seems correct.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nCase where the string is just 'abc' → yes.\n\nCase where the string is 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1 → c is 1, which is less than both. So condition not met.\n\nSo code returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother edge case: 'acbbc' → runs are a, c, b, b, c → len 5. So order check fails.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbaabbc' → runs are a, b, a, a, b, bc → which is longer than 3, so order check fails.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abbbc' → runs are a, b, c → yes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abcc' → runs are a, b, c → counts a=1, b=1, c=2 → c is 2, which is not equal to a or b. So condition not met.\n\nSo code returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → runs a, b, c → counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So c equals a and b. So condition met → 'YES'.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaabbc' → runs are a, b, a, a, b, c → len 6 → order check fails.\n\nSo the code handles these correctly.\n\nNow, what about when the string is empty? According to the problem statement, the input is a string of length >=1.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: 'a' → runs is ['a'] → len 1 → order check fails.\n\nSo code returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → runs are a, b → len 2 → order check fails.\n\nSo code returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother case: 'acb' → runs are a, c, b → len 3, but order is a, c, b → which is invalid, because after 'a' comes 'c', which is allowed only if 'c's are added last. So code correctly returns 'NO'.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo, to sum up, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the string is in the correct order, i.e., runs are exactly ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\n2. Compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\n3. Check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n4. Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all conditions are met, output 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nSo, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe code would be something like:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCheck runs as discussed.\n\nProceed as per the steps.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Step 1: Check the order of the runs.\nruns = []\nprev_char = None\nfor char in s:\n    if char != prev_char:\n        runs.append(char)\n        prev_char = char\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif runs[0] != 'a' or runs[1] != 'b' or runs[2] != 'c':\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ncount_a = len(runs[0])\ncount_b = len(runs[1])\ncount_c = len(runs[2])\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the string can have multiple 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's, but the runs must be exactly 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nSo, the code correctly captures that.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns are a, b, c → yes.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c is 3, which equals count_a. So condition met. Output YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc'\n\nRuns are b, a, c → len 3, but runs[0] is 'b' → invalid. So output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → runs are a, b, c → valid.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which equals count_b. So condition met. Output YES.\n\nSo, the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → runs are a, b → len 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → runs are a, b, c → counts 1,1,1 → condition met → YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → runs a, b, c → count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1. So count_c is 1, not equal to a or b. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabbc' → runs a, b, a, a, b, c → len 6 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaabbbbc' → runs a, b, c → counts 4,4,1. count_c is 1, which is not equal to 4 or 4 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' → runs a, b, a, c → len 4 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns NO.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending certain characters in a specific order.
