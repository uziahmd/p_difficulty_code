Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting souvenirs such that their total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is maximized. Petya has n souvenirs, each with a weight between 1 and 3, and a cost. We need to choose a subset where the sum of weights is ≤m, and the sum of costs is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, the constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So we need an efficient solution, probably O(n*m) is too slow. Wait, but n is 1e5 and m is 3e5, which gives 3e10 operations—way too much. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches. Since the weights are small (only 1,2,3), maybe we can group them by weight and handle each group separately.\n\nYes, for each weight class (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible count of taking items from each weight, we can compute the maximum cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nWait, but how do we combine the counts from each weight? Because the sum of 1*count1 + 2*count2 +3*count3 must be ≤m.\n\nThis sounds like a knapsack problem with specific constraints. But since the weights are limited, perhaps we can find a way to model this efficiently.\n\nI remember that for 0-1 knapsack, when the item sizes are bounded, we can optimize using some grouping. For example, if all items have size ≤k, then for each possible remainder mod k, we can process them in batches.\n\nIn this case, the maximum weight per item is 3. So, for each remainder r (0,1,2), we can consider the number of items that contribute to that remainder and process them in a way that allows us to compute the maximum cost quickly.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to precompute for each possible weight (1,2,3) the prefix sums of costs after sorting. Then, for all possible combinations of taking a certain number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, check if their total weight is within m, and find the maximum cost.\n\nBut considering all possible combinations is still O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but the number of possible items per weight is up to 1e5, but for each weight, we can take at most m/weight items. So for weight 3, max items is 1e5, but m is 3e5, so 1e5 is manageable. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: Since the weights are small, perhaps we can use dynamic programming where the state is the total weight. For each item, we update the dp array.\n\nWait, let's model this as a knapsack problem. Each item is either taken or not. The maximum weight is m, which is up to 3e5. So the DP approach might be feasible.\n\nLet's see: the standard 0-1 knapsack DP has O(n*m) time, which is 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python; it won't work.\n\nSo we need a smarter way. Given that the weights are small, perhaps we can exploit this in the DP.\n\nWait, what if we separate the items into three groups based on their weight. Then, for each group, sort the items in descending order of value. This way, when considering adding items from a group, we can take as many as possible starting from the highest value.\n\nSo for each group (w=1,2,3), we have a list of items sorted in descending order of c_i. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each group, calculate the total weight and see if it's within m. The maximum cost would be the sum of the top k1 items from w=1, top k2 from w=2, top k3 from w=3, such that 1*k1 + 2*k2 +3*k3 ≤m.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the best combination of k1, k2, k3.\n\nHmm, the problem reduces to finding triplets (k1, k2, k3) such that 1*k1 +2*k2 +3*k3 ≤m, and the sum of the costs is maximum.\n\nGiven that the groups are sorted, for each possible k3, we can compute the maximum possible k2 and k1.\n\nBut even that seems tricky because the variables are interdependent.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible k3 (number of 3-weight items taken), compute the maximum possible sum for the remaining weight (m' = m -3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry without exceeding a given weight limit. Given the constraints, we can leverage the fact that each souvenir's weight is either 1, 2, or 3, allowing us to optimize our approach using dynamic programming and sorting.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Souvenirs by Weight**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, and 3). This helps in efficiently managing and processing each group.\n2. **Sort Each Group by Cost**: For each group, sort the souvenirs in descending order of their cost. This allows us to consider the most valuable items first when forming our collection.\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Sliding Window**: Use a dynamic programming approach where we maintain a sliding window of possible sums for each weight. This helps in efficiently computing the maximum cost for different combinations of items from the three groups.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n\n    w = []\n    c = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        w.append(a)\n        c.append(b)\n        idx += 2\n\n    # Separate into groups\n    group1 = []\n    group2 = []\n    group3 = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if w[i] == 1:\n            group1.append(c[i])\n        elif w[i] == 2:\n            group2.append(c[i])\n        else:\n            group3.append(c[i])\n\n    # Sort each group in descending order\n    group1.sort(reverse=True)\n    group2.sort(reverse=True)\n    group3.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Precompute prefix sums for each group\n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for i in group1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + i)\n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for i in group2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + i)\n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for i in group3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + i)\n\n    max_cost = 0\n\n    # Iterate over possible k3, then find the best k2 and k1 for remaining weight\n    for k3 in range(len(prefix3)):\n        rem_weight = m - 3 * k3\n        if rem_weight < 0:\n            continue\n        # Now find the best k2 and k1 such that 2*k2 + k1 <= rem_weight\n        # We can iterate k2 up to min(rem_weight // 2, len(prefix2)-1)\n        max_rem = rem_weight\n        best = 0\n        for k2 in range(min(max_rem // 2, len(prefix2) - 1) + 1):\n            rem_k2 = max_rem - 2 * k2\n            if rem_k2 < 0:\n                continue\n            # Now take as many k1 as possible: min(rem_k2, len(prefix1)-1)\n            k1 = min(rem_k2, len(prefix1) - 1)\n            total = prefix2[k2] + prefix1[k1]\n            if total > best:\n                best = total\n        if best > max_cost:\n            max_cost = best\n\n    print(max_cost)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping and Sorting**: Souvenirs are grouped by their weights (1, 2, 3) and each group is sorted in descending order of their cost. This allows us to consider the most valuable items first.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Prefix sums for each group are precomputed to quickly calculate the total cost for any number of items taken from that group.\n3. **Sliding Window DP**: By iterating over possible counts of 3-weight items, we compute the remaining weight and use two nested loops to find the best combination of 2-weight and 1-weight items that fit within the remaining weight. This ensures we efficiently explore all feasible combinations without excessive computation.\n\nThis approach optimizes the problem by leveraging the small weight constraints and sorting, allowing us to handle up to 100,000 items efficiently.",
