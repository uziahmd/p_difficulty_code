    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about binary strings and choosing certain values for each string such that a multiset of these strings is 'beautiful'. And we need to count the number of ways to choose these c_s values so that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nWe are given n, k, f. We consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to n. For each such string s, we choose c_s from 0 to k. Then, the multiset is beautiful if for every string s (of any length), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. \n\nWait, but the multiset itself is of strings of length exactly n. So when considering s of length less than n, their prefixes would be longer strings. Wait no—no, wait, the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So for example, if s is \"0\", then any string in the multiset that starts with \"0\" will contribute to s's count. Because for s being a prefix, the strings in the multiset must have s as a prefix. So if the multiset contains \"00\", \"01\", etc., they all start with \"0\".\n\nSo for each string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut wait, the multiset is of length exactly n. So for a string s of length m < n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts for all strings t in the multiset where t starts with s.\n\nWait no: Each string in the multiset is of length exactly n. So for s of length m, the count is how many strings in the multiset start with s. For example, s is \"0\": the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with \"0\" (like \"00\", \"01\", ..., \"0x...\").\n\nNow, the goal is to choose the c_s for all s such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to count how many such choices of c_s exist.\n\nHmm. So the problem is about choosing c_s in [0, k] for each s, such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset under these c_s's is exactly f. Then, count the number of such c_s assignments.\n\nWait, but how is the maximum size determined? It's the largest size of a multiset where for every s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo for each possible assignment of c_s, the maximum size is f. We need to find the number of assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nThis seems like a combinatorial problem, but perhaps we can model it using dynamic programming or inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Each binary string of length up to n is a node, and for each node s, we have a capacity c_s. The constraints are that for each s, the sum over its children (strings that have s as a prefix) of the counts cannot exceed c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a tree. Each node is a string, and its children are the strings formed by adding a 0 or 1 bit. The root has all other nodes as descendants.\n\nWait, but the tree is a trie of all binary strings. Each node s has children s0 and s1, except when s is a full binary string of length n.\n\nBut for our problem, the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. So the leaves of the trie (length n) are the only ones that can be in the multiset.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because for the purpose of counting prefixes, any string of length less than n can be a prefix of a string of length n.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is as follows: the multiset is a collection of some number of each string of length n. For each s (any string, not necessarily of length n), the sum of the counts of all strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut wait, the multiset is built by selecting any number of strings (each of length exactly n). So for each string t of length n, when you add it to the multiset, it contributes to the count of all its prefixes s.\n\nSo, for example, adding t = \"101\" to the multiset increases the count of s=\"1\", s=\"10\", s=\"101\".\n\nThus, for each s, the total count is the sum of the multiplicities of all t that have s as a prefix.\n\nOur goal is to choose c_s for all s (for all possible binary strings) such that for each s, the sum of the counts (for all t that have s as a prefix) is ≤ c_s. And we need the maximum possible total size of such a multiset (sum over all t in the multiset of their multiplicities) is exactly f.\n\nWe need to count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is to count the number of c_s assignments that allow a multiset of size exactly f, and no larger.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible size is f. So for any c_s assignment, the maximum is f, meaning that there exists at least one multiset of size f, and for any larger size (f+1 or more), it's impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the problem can be approached by first determining what conditions on the c_s make it possible to have a multiset of size exactly f, and ensure that no larger multiset is possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node represents a binary string s. The edges represent the prefix relationships: s → t if t starts with s. Then, for each node s, the sum of the counts of its children (including itself if it's a leaf) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but the multiset is made of the leaves (length n). So each leaf t contributes to all its ancestors s.\n\nSo for the DAG, each node s has children which are the super-strings of s (i.e., s0 and s1, if they exist). But for s of length m < n, the children are s followed by 0 and 1, which are of length m+1.\n\nWait, no. The children are s0 and s1, regardless of the length. So the root is the empty string, and each node s has two children, unless s is a leaf (length n).\n\nWait, perhaps the trie structure is better thought of as a tree where each node s has two children (if not a leaf), representing appending 0 or 1. Then, the condition is that for each node s, the sum of the counts of all its descendants (including itself) in the multiset is ≤ c_s.\n\nBecause for each s, any string t that starts with s (i.e., s is a prefix of t) contributes to the count of s. So t could be s itself, or any longer string starting with s.\n\nWait, but in the multiset, only the leaves (length n) are present. So for s of length m < n, the count for s is the sum of the counts of all t in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Which includes all leaves that start with s.\n\nSo for each node s, the sum over all t in the multiset that are in the subtree rooted at s (including s itself if it's a leaf) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nAh! So the problem reduces to choosing c_s for each node s, such that for every node s, the sum of the multiplicities of all t in its subtree (including itself if it's a leaf) is ≤ c_s.\n\nAnd the goal is to count the number of c_s assignments where the maximum possible multiset size is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems complicated because the constraints are interdependent across different nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem using a generating function approach, where for each node, we have a variable that represents the maximum allowed sum for its subtree. Then, the constraints translate into inequalities between the variables of child nodes and their parents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to express the problem in terms of the multiplicities of the leaves and how they contribute to the various c_s constraints.\n\nLet me think about the leaves. Each leaf t of length n contributes to all its ancestors s. So for each leaf t, the count of t in the multiset affects the c_s of all s along the path from the empty string to t.\n\nSo for each leaf t, the count a_t (number of times it appears in the multiset) must satisfy:\n\na_t ≤ c_{t_1} \na_t ≤ c_{t_2}\n...\na_t ≤ c_{root}\n\nWhere t_1, t_2, ..., root are the prefixes of t.\n\nMoreover, the sum of all a_t for leaves t is the total size of the multiset. We need this sum to be exactly f, and also, the constraints must be tight enough that no larger sum is possible.\n\nBut how do we model this for all possible leaves and their contributions to various c_s?\n\nThis seems quite complex, but perhaps we can find a way to model it recursively.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the binary trie. Each node s has two children, s0 and s1. So the trie is a perfect binary tree of depth n, since each string is built by appending 0 or 1 bits until it reaches length n.\n\nWait, no. Because for a string s of length m, it can have two children of length m+1, unless m is already n. So the trie is a binary tree of height n, with leaves at level n.\n\nEach path from the root to a leaf represents a binary string of length n.\n\nSo, for each node s, the sum of a_t for all leaves in the subtree of s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBecause for each s, any t in its subtree (including s itself if it's a leaf) contributes to s's count. So for s, the sum of a_t for t in its subtree is the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nFor every node s, sum_{t in subtree(s)} a_t ≤ c_s.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of c_s assignments such that the maximum possible sum of a_t's is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So the problem is to assign c_s for all nodes s, such that:\n\n1. For each s, sum_{t in subtree(s)} a_t ≤ c_s.\n2. The maximum possible sum of a_t's is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model the maximum possible sum? Because the a_t's are variables subject to the constraints imposed by the c_s's.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the minimal flow through the constraints. Or perhaps it's the minimal possible maximum, depending on the c_s's.\n\nAlternatively, for a given c_s assignment, the maximum sum is the maximum flow through the constraints. Or perhaps it's the maximum possible sum that satisfies all constraints.\n\nWait, for each c_s, the maximum sum is the maximum total number of a_t's that can be assigned without violating any constraint. So for each c_s, the maximum sum is the sum of a_t's, where for each s, sum_{t in subtree(s)} a_t ≤ c_s.\n\nSo the problem is: count the number of c_s assignments where the maximum sum is exactly f.\n\nSo for each possible c_s assignment, compute the maximum possible sum (call it M), and count how many assignments have M = f.\n\nHmm. Now, the challenge is to model this efficiently.\n\nGiven the constraints on n (up to 15), perhaps we can model this using dynamic programming, considering each node's contribution and combining them.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the constraints. Each a_t is non-negative, and the sum for each s is the sum of a_t's in its subtree.\n\nSo the constraints form a hierarchy: for a parent node s, its sum is the sum of its children plus any a_t's that are directly in s's subtree but not in any of its children (only if s is a leaf, which is not the case here as all leaves have no children).\n\nWait, no. For a non-leaf node s, the sum for s is the sum of the sums of its children (since the children's subtrees include all descendants of the children, including s's own children). Because s's subtree includes all of its children's subtrees.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the subtree of s includes s itself and all its descendants. For non-leaf s, its subtree includes its two children s0 and s1, and their subtrees. So the sum for s is a_s + a_{s0} + a_{s1}, where a_s is the count of s in the multiset (but only if s is a leaf, otherwise a_s is zero because s isn't in the multiset). Wait, no. Because in the multiset, only leaves are present. So for a non-leaf s, the sum of a_t's in its subtree is the sum of a_t's for all leaves in s's subtree.\n\nBut s's subtree is s0 and s1 (which are leaves if s is of length n-1), and their subtrees. So for s of length m < n, the sum is the sum of a_t for all leaves in the subtree rooted at s.\n\nWhich is equal to the sum of a_{t} for t in the subtree of s. But for non-leaves, this is the sum of a_t for t in s's subtree, which includes all its children and their subtrees.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, let's denote d(s) as the maximum possible sum for the subtree rooted at s, given c_s. Then, for each s, the sum of a_t's in its subtree can't exceed c_s. Moreover, for each child t of s, the sum of a_t's in t's subtree is constrained by c_t.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum sum for s is min(c_s, sum of the maximum sums of its children plus any a_t's that are directly in s's subtree but not in any child. But wait, for non-leaf s, s's subtree includes all the leaves in its children's subtrees. So for s, the sum is the sum of the maximum sums of its children, but also, any a_t's that are in s's subtree but not in any child would contribute, but in this case, s is a non-leaf, so it's not a leaf. So perhaps for non-leaf s, the sum is just the sum of the maximum sums of its children.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think differently.\n\nEach a_t is a non-negative integer. For each node s, sum_{t in subtree(s)} a_t ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum sum is the maximum possible sum of a_t's, which is the sum of a_t's for all t in the multiset, subject to all constraints.\n\nSo for a given c_s assignment, the maximum sum is the maximum total a_t's that can be chosen without violating any c_s constraints.\n\nSo the problem is, for each c_s assignment, find the maximum sum M and count the number of assignments where M = f.\n\nNow, how do we model the relationship between the c_s's and M?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a system of constraints. For each node s, sum_{t in subtree(s)} a_t ≤ c_s. And the objective is to maximize the sum of a_t's for all t in the multiset.\n\nBut the variables are the a_t's, but the c_s's are the parameters. So the maximum sum M depends on the c_s's.\n\nWait, but the c_s's are the variables we're trying to choose. So perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of the c_s's and find for each c_s assignment whether the maximum M is exactly f.\n\nBut with n up to 15, the number of nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n. Wait, no, the number of nodes in a binary trie of depth n is 2^{n+1} - 1. For n=15, that's about 32768, which is manageable.\n\nBut the problem is that for each possible c_s assignment, we need to compute the maximum M, which is the sum of a_t's subject to all the constraints.\n\nBut even for n=15, the number of possible c_s assignments is (k+1)^(number_of_nodes), which is way too big for k up to 2e5.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nPerhaps we can model this problem using dynamic programming, where for each node, we compute some information based on its children.\n\nLet me think about the maximum M that can be achieved for a subtree rooted at s, given that the sum for s is c_s.\n\nWait, for a given node s, if we know the c_s, then the maximum M for the subtree rooted at s is the sum of the maximum M's for each of its children, plus any additional a_t's that can be added directly under s, but only if s is a leaf.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the maximum M for the subtree is the sum of the maximum M's of its children, but only if s is not a leaf. If s is a leaf, then its maximum M is min(c_s, the sum of the maximum M's of its children plus a_t for s itself).\n\nWait, no. Because for s being a leaf, a_t can be added to the multiset as s, contributing to its own count as well as all its ancestors.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to model this in terms of the nodes in the trie, processing them in a post-order manner.\n\nLet me think recursively.\n\nSuppose we have a node s. Let its children be s0 and s1.\n\nIf s is a leaf (i.e., length n), then the maximum M for s's subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum M's of s0 and s1 (if they exist). Because a_t can be added for s, but it's constrained by c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for s being a leaf, the a_t can be any value up to c_s, but it also has to satisfy the constraints of all its ancestors.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum M for s's subtree is the sum of the maximum M's of its children, plus the a_t for s itself, but s's a_t can't exceed c_s minus the sum of the children's a_t's.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because for s's subtree, the sum of a_t's is the sum of a_t's for s and all its descendants. But for non-leaf nodes, the sum is the sum of the children's a_t's. For leaves, the sum is a_t (since they are leaves) plus the sum of their children's a_t's.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe an alternative approach is needed.\n\nLet me consider that each node s has a certain 'allowance' c_s. The maximum M is the sum of all a_t's, which must satisfy for each s, the sum of a_t's in s's subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems similar to a resource allocation problem where each node s has a resource c_s, and the sum of resources used by its subtree is limited by c_s.\n\nIn this case, the maximum M is the sum of a_t's, which is subject to all the constraints.\n\nSo the problem becomes: choose c_s for each node s, such that the maximum M is exactly f, and count the number of such choices.\n\nWait, but the c_s's are variables we choose, and M is the maximum possible sum of a_t's under those constraints.\n\nSo, for each possible choice of c_s's, we can compute M, and count the cases where M equals f.\n\nBut how can we model this efficiently?\n\nAnother angle: for the maximum M to be exactly f, there must be at least one way to select a_t's such that the sum is f and all constraints are satisfied. Also, it should be impossible to have a sum larger than f.\n\nSo, for a given c_s assignment, the maximum M is the minimal possible maximum sum that can be achieved given the c_s's.\n\nWait, no. M is the maximum possible sum, so the constraints are that the a_t's can't exceed the c_s's for any s.\n\nSo, the M is the maximum sum that can be achieved while satisfying all constraints.\n\nSo, for each c_s assignment, M is the maximum sum, and we need M = f.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of c_s assignments such that the maximum M is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So perhaps, for each possible assignment of c_s's, we can model the M as the sum of a_t's, where each a_t can be up to c_s for all s in the path from the root to t.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: for each node s, the maximum sum for its subtree is the sum of the maximum sums of its children. Additionally, if s is a leaf, then the maximum sum for its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of its children's maximum sums plus a new a_t for s itself.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the key. Let me formalize it.\n\nFor a node s:\n\n- If s is a leaf, then the maximum sum for its subtree is min(c_s, sum_children + a_s), where a_s is the a_t for s. But a_s can be any value up to c_s, provided that sum_children + a_s ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but a_s can be anything as long as sum_children + a_s ≤ c_s. So the maximum M for s's subtree is the minimum between c_s and sum_children + a_s. To maximize M, a_s is set to (c_s - sum_children), but only if that's non-negative.\n\nWait, no. Because a_s can be any value up to (c_s - sum_children). But since we want to maximize the overall sum, for s being a leaf, the maximum M for its subtree is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the children's maximum M's plus a_s, which can be as high as (c_s - sum_children).\n\nWait, perhaps for a leaf node s, the maximum M for its subtree is min(c_s, sum_children + a_s). But to maximize M, we set a_s as large as possible, i.e., a_s = min(c_s - sum_children, ...) but only if sum_children + a_s ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps for a leaf s, the maximum M is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum M's of its children plus any a_s that can be added. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a leaf s, the maximum M is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the children's M's plus a_s.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the maximum M for its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum M's of its children plus the a_s (if s is a leaf).\n\nNo, I think that's not correct.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a node s with children c1 and c2. For each child, we have computed their maximum M. Then, for node s, the sum of a_t's in its subtree is the sum of the a_t's in c1's subtree plus the a_t's in c2's subtree, plus any a_t's that are directly in s's subtree but not in any child.\n\nBut for non-leaf s, s's subtree doesn't contain any leaves, so the sum is the sum of the children's M's.\n\nWait, no. Because non-leaf s can have children which are leaves. For example, s is \"10\" (length 2), which has children \"100\", \"101\" (length 3), but if n=3, then \"10\" is not a leaf. Wait, no, if n=3, then leaves are of length 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is that for each node s, its subtree consists of all leaves that are in the path starting from s. So, for a non-leaf s, the sum of a_t's in its subtree is the sum of a_t's for all leaves that can be reached by appending bits to s.\n\nBut for a non-leaf s, the sum is the sum of a_t's for all leaves in the subtree of s.\n\nHmm. So for a non-leaf s, the sum of a_t's in its subtree is the sum of a_t's in s0's subtree plus a_t's in s1's subtree. Because s0 and s1 are leaves (if n is 2, for example), but for higher n, s0 and s1 may have their own subtrees.\n\nWait, no, for s of length m < n, s0 and s1 are of length m+1, which may or may not be leaves, depending on n.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum M for a non-leaf s is the sum of the maximum M's of its children.\n\nBut for a leaf s, the maximum M is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum M's of its children plus a new a_t for s.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the maximum M is:\n\nIf s is a leaf:\nM(s) = min(c_s, sum_children_M + a_s)\nBut a_s can be up to (c_s - sum_children_M), so the maximum M is sum_children_M + a_s, which is up to c_s.\n\nWait, but then M(s) is the sum of a_t's in s's subtree, which includes a_s plus the sum of the children's a_t's.\n\nSo for a leaf s, the maximum M is the sum of a_t's in its subtree, which is a_s plus the sum of its children's a_t's.\n\nBut this sum can't exceed c_s. So the maximum M is min(c_s, a_s + sum_children_M + a_s?), no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps for a leaf s, the maximum M is the sum of the a_t's in its subtree. Since s is a leaf, it contributes a_s to the sum, plus the a_t's of its children (which for s being a leaf, it has no children, so a_s is the only term). So the maximum M for s is a_s, which must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor a node s:\n\n- If s is a leaf (length n), then M(s) = a_s, which must be ≤ c_s.\n- Else, M(s) = sum of M(t) for all children t of s.\n\nThen, the maximum M for the entire trie is M(root), which is the sum of all a_t's (since root's subtree is all leaves).\n\nWait, no. Because the root's subtree includes all nodes, including all leaves. So M(root) is the sum of a_t's for all leaves.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing c_s for each node s, such that for every s, M(s) ≤ c_s, and the maximum M(root) is exactly f.\n\nAnd we need to count the number of c_s assignments where M(root) = f.\n\nHmm. So for each node s, the constraint is M(s) ≤ c_s.\n\nBecause M(s) is the sum of a_t's in s's subtree, and M(s) can't exceed c_s.\n\nSo, for each node s, c_s must be ≥ M(s).\n\nBut M(s) is determined by the c_s's of its children.\n\nWait, but M(s) is the sum of the M(t) for its children t. So for non-leaf s, M(s) = sum(M(t)), where t are s0 and s1.\n\nSo, for non-leaf s, M(s) is fixed once the M(t) for its children are known.\n\nSo, the problem is to choose c_s for each node s, such that:\n\n- For each node s, c_s ≥ M(s).\n- M(root) = f.\n- Count the number of such c_s assignments where M(root) = f.\n\nWait, but M(s) is determined by the c_s's of the nodes in the path from the root to s.\n\nWait, no, M(s) is determined by the c_t's of its children.\n\nWait, for non-leaf s, M(s) is the sum of the M(t) of its children. For a leaf s, M(s) is a_s, which is constrained by c_s.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nFor each node s:\n\n- If s is a leaf: a_s ≤ c_s.\n- Else: M(s) = M(t0) + M(t1), where t0 and t1 are s0 and s1.\n\nAdditionally, M(root) = sum of a_t's for all leaves t.\n\nWe need to choose c_s for each node s, such that:\n\n- For each s, c_s ≥ M(s).\n- M(root) = f.\n\nAnd count the number of such c_s assignments.\n\nHmm. So, the problem is now to count the number of assignments of c_s's where for each s, c_s ≥ M(s), and M(root) = f.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because M(s) depends on the c_t's of its children.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each node, we track the possible M(s) given the choices made for its children.\n\nBut with n up to 15, the number of nodes is manageable. Let's see: for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^16 - 1 = 65535. That's a lot, but perhaps manageable with memoization.\n\nAlternatively, we can process the nodes in a bottom-up fashion, starting from the leaves.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The leaves are at depth n. Then, their parents are at depth n-1, and so on, up to the root.\n\nSo, for each node s, we can compute the possible M(s) based on the M(t) of its children.\n\nWait, for a non-leaf node s, M(s) is the sum of M(t0) and M(t1). So, if we know the possible M(t0) and M(t1) values, then M(s) is fixed as their sum.\n\nFor a leaf node s, M(s) is a single variable a_s, which is constrained by c_s >= a_s.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n1. For each node s, determine whether it's a leaf or not.\n\n2. Process the nodes in reverse order (starting from the leaves and moving up to the root).\n\n3. For each node s, compute the possible M(s) values based on its children.\n\n4. For non-leaf s: M(s) is the sum of M(t0) and M(t1).\n\n5. For leaf s: M(s) can be any value from 0 to c_s.\n\nBut since M(s) must be <= c_s, and for non-leaf nodes, M(s) is the sum of their children's M(t), perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nWe'll perform a DP where for each node s, we track the possible M(s) values, given the constraints from its children.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: Since M(s) is determined by the M(t) of its children, perhaps for non-leaf nodes, M(s) is fixed as the sum of the M(t) of its children. So, the only degrees of freedom come from the choices of c_s for the leaves.\n\nWait, no. Because for a non-leaf node s, M(s) is the sum of the M(t) of its children. But M(t) for each child t is determined by the c_t's of their own children, and so on.\n\nSo, the M(s) for non-leaf nodes is the sum of M(t) for their children, which are themselves functions of their c_t's.\n\nThis suggests that for the non-leaf nodes, their M(s) is determined by the M(t) of their children, which are determined by the c_t's of their own children.\n\nBut the c_t's are the variables we're trying to assign.\n\nHmm. This seems tricky. Perhaps we can model the problem by considering that for each node s, the M(s) can be any value up to c_s, and for non-leaf nodes, M(s) is the sum of M(t) for their children.\n\nBut this feels circular.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that for non-leaf nodes, their M(s) is the sum of their children's M(t), which are determined by the c_t's. So, for a non-leaf node s, M(s) is fixed once the c_t's for its children are chosen.\n\nSo, for the non-leaf nodes, their c_s must be >= M(s), which is the sum of their children's M(t).\n\nBut M(t) is determined by the c_t's of t's children.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign c_t's for all leaves, ensuring that for each non-leaf node s, c_s >= sum of M(t) for its children.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's represent the problem as a tree where each node has a certain 'max allowance' c_s. The constraints are that for each node s, c_s >= M(s), where M(s) is the sum of M(t) for its children.\n\nBut M(s) is a function of the c_t's of the leaves.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a series of constraints that must be satisfied for the c_s's. For each node s, c_s must be >= the sum of M(t) for its children.\n\nBut M(t) for a node t is the sum of M(t0) and M(t1), which are the M of t's children.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, the M(s) is determined by the sum of the M(t) of its children, which in turn are determined by their own children, and so on.\n\nSo, the only variables we can control are the c_s's for the leaves, because for non-leaf nodes, their c_s's must be >= M(s), which is the sum of their children's M(t)'s.\n\nWait, but for non-leaf nodes, their M(s) is fixed once their children's M(t) are fixed. So, the c_s's for non-leaf nodes must be >= M(s), which is the sum of their children's M(t).\n\nSo, perhaps the only variables we can choose are the c_s's for the leaves, and for non-leaf nodes, their c_s's are determined by the sum of their children's M(t).\n\nBut that's not entirely accurate because for non-leaf nodes, their c_s can be any value >= M(s), which is the sum of their children's M(t).\n\nSo, the problem becomes:\n\n- Assign c_s for all leaves, such that for each non-leaf node s, c_s >= sum of M(t) for its children.\n\n- The M(root) is the sum of all a_t's (the leaves' a_t's), which must equal f.\n\nBut how do we model the a_t's?\n\nWait, perhaps the M(s) for non-leaf nodes is the sum of the a_t's of their children (leaves and their subtrees). So, the M(s) for non-leaf nodes is fixed once the a_t's of the leaves are known.\n\nWait, no. Because for non-leaf nodes, M(s) is the sum of the M(t) of their children. But M(t) for a child t is the sum of the a_t's in t's subtree.\n\nSo, M(s) is the sum of the a_t's in t's subtree for each child t of s.\n\nBut for non-leaf nodes, their own c_s must be >= M(s), which is the sum of their children's M(t).\n\nSo, the problem is:\n\n- For each leaf t, choose a_t such that the sum of a_t's across all leaves is f, and for each node s, the sum of a_t's in s's subtree is <= c_s.\n\nBut c_s is to be chosen, and the sum of a_t's must be exactly f.\n\nSo, the problem is to choose c_s's for all nodes s, such that:\n\n1. For each s, sum of a_t's in s's subtree <= c_s.\n\n2. The sum of a_t's is exactly f.\n\nAnd the count is the number of such c_s assignments.\n\nBut again, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a product of constraints for each node s. The maximum sum M is the sum of a_t's, which is constrained by c_s >= sum_{t in s's subtree} a_t.\n\nSo, for the entire trie, the M is the sum of a_t's. For each node s, the sum of a_t's in s's subtree is <= c_s.\n\nWe need to choose c_s's such that the maximum possible M is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this as a mathematical expression?\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum of a_t's is f, which is fixed, perhaps we can model the problem as ensuring that for each node s, the sum of a_t's in s's subtree is <= c_s.\n\nSo, for each node s, c_s must be >= sum_{t in s's subtree} a_t.\n\nBut since the sum of a_t's across all leaves is f, the sum for the root is f.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to ensuring that for each node s, c_s >= sum_{t in s's subtree} a_t, and the sum of a_t's is f.\n\nBut since the sum of a_t's is f, the root's c_root must be >= f.\n\nSo, the first thing to note is that c_root must be >= f.\n\nSimilarly, for each node s, c_s must be >= the sum of a_t's in its subtree.\n\nBut",
