    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How do we calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nEach ring is the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter in terms of cells would be 2*(width + height) - 4. Because for a rectangle with width W and height H, the perimeter (number of cells) is 2W + 2H -4. Because the corners are counted twice when adding the four sides, so we subtract 4.\n\nFor example, a 3x3 square has perimeter 3*2 + 3*2 -4 = 12-4=8 cells, which matches the first example.\n\nSo the formula for each ring is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4. But current_w and current_h are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h -4*(i-1)) respectively.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the examples provided.\n\nFirst example: 3x3, k=1.\nOnly one ring. So current_w=3, current_h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4= 6*2-4=12-4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: 7x9, k=1. So the perimeter is 2*(7+9)-4=32-4=28. Output is 28. Correct.\n\nThird example: 7x9, k=2. So the first ring is 7x9, perimeter 28. The second ring is 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5: perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the third output.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each ring from 1 to k:\n   calculate the current width and height as w -4*(i-1) and h-4*(i-1)\n   compute the perimeter: 2*(w_i + h_i) -4\n   sum all these perimeters\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read w, h, k from input.\n2. Initialize total_gilded =0\n3. For i in 1..k:\n   current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   if current_w < 3 or current_h <3: break (but according to problem statement, k is constrained such that this won't happen)\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   add to total_gilded\n4. Print total_gilded as an integer string.\n\nSo now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into three integers.\n\nThen loop k times, but perhaps a better way is to loop i from 1 to k, and for each, calculate current_w and current_h.\n\nWait, no, for each i from 1 to k, inclusive.\n\nWait, but for each i, current_w is w -4*(i-1). So for i=1, it's w, for i=2, w-4, etc.\n\nSo in code:\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i-1)\n    current_h = h -4 * (i-1)\n    # compute perimeter\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) -4\n    total += perimeter\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but wait: for each ring, the current_w and current_h must be at least 3? Because the minimal size for a ring is 3x3. Because when current_w or current_h is less than 3, you can't form a ring. But according to the problem statement, the constraints on k ensure that it doesn't happen. So we don't need to handle that case.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1.\n\ni=1: current_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter=8. Total 8.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1: perimeter 28.\n\nSample3:7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7+9: perimeter 28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 3+5=8, perimeter 12. 28+12=40.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nRing 1:5x5. perimeter 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\nRing 2:5-4=1, 5-4=1. Wait, that's 1x1. But 1x1 is just a single cell. Its perimeter would be 2*(1+1)-4=4-4=0. So total is 16+0=16.\n\nBut wait, does the ring require the inner rectangle to have at least 3 cells? Because for a ring, you need to have a perimeter. If the inner rectangle is 1x1, the perimeter is 0, meaning no more cells to add. So in that case, any further rings beyond that would not contribute anything.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, k is constrained so that it's allowed. So perhaps the code doesn't need to check for that.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\nRing 1: 5x5, perimeter 16.\n\nRing 2: 1x1, perimeter 0.\n\nTotal 16.\n\nWhat about another test case: w=7, h=11, k=3.\n\nRing 1: 7x11 → perimeter 2*(7+11) -4= 36-4=32.\n\nRing 2:7-4=3, 11-4=7 → 3x7 → perimeter 2*(3+7)=20-4=16. Total 32+16=48.\n\nRing3:3-4= -1? No, wait wait, wait. Wait, 7-4*(3-1) =7-8= -1. That's impossible. So why is the k allowed? Because according to the problem statement, k is given such that it's feasible. So the constraints on k are that 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). Wait, no, looking back, the problem says:\n\n\"Constraints on k: 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(n, m) + 1)/4 ), where n is min(w,h), m is max(w,h).\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread it before. Let me recheck.\n\nProblem statement says: \"1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊(min(n, m) + 1)/4⌋, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the number x rounded down.\"\n\nWait, min(w, h) is the smaller of the two. Let's see: for w=7, h=11, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2. So floor is 2. So k can be up to 2. So in my earlier test case, k=3 is invalid, but the code wouldn't process it. But since the input is constrained by the problem, we don't have to handle it.\n\nSo, in code, the loop runs from 1 to k, inclusive.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nRead the input as a single line, split into three integers.\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute the sum.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 3: '7 9 2' → w=7, h=9, k=2.\n\ni=1: 7,9 → 7+9=16 → 2*16=32-4=28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3,9-4=5 → 3+5=8 → 16-4=12.\n\nTotal 28+12=40.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: w=3, h=3, k=1 → 8.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1 → 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\nIf k=2, then 5-4=1, 1x1 → perimeter 0. So total 16+0=16.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly. Since the input is a single line, with three space-separated integers.\n\nIn Python, input().split() will give us the list, then mapping to int.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1 →28.\n\nSample3:7 9 2 →40.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of successively smaller rectangles inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w` rows and `h` columns. Each ring is formed along the perimeter of a rectangle, reducing both the width and height by 4 units for each subsequent ring (2 units from each side). The number of cells in each ring is calculated as the perimeter of the rectangle it forms.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a rectangle of width `current_w` and height `current_h`, the number of gilded cells (perimeter) is given by the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4`. This accounts for the corners being counted twice when summing the sides.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height, then calculate the perimeter and accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height by subtracting 4 units for each previous ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4` and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring accurate results within the problem constraints.",
