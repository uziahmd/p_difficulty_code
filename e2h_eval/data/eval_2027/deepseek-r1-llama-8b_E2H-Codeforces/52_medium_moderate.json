Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for exactly one hour and then goes out. But the smart part is that he can collect the burned-out candles and trade them in. Specifically, he can make 'b' of these gone candles into a new one. So, each time he has enough gone candles, he can create more and burn them, thus extending the total hours.\n\nMy task is to compute how many hours in total he can keep the room lit by optimally managing the candles.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The initial number is 'a' hours. Then, every time he collects enough burnt candles, he can exchange them for new ones, which add to the total.\n\nWait, but when he exchanges, the new candles are added to his collection. Or wait, no—each time he uses some burnt candles, they are taken away and replaced by new ones. So, the process is:\n\n1. Burn all current candles, adding their count to the total hours.\n2. Collect the burnt ones.\n3. Exchange as many as possible (i.e., in multiples of b) to get new candles.\n4. Repeat until he can't exchange anymore.\n\nBut wait, after burning the new candles, the process continues. So, the key is to model this step by step.\n\nLet me try to break it down with an example. Take the first sample input: 4 and 2.\n\nInitial a =4. So, burn 4 hours. Now, he has 4 burnt candles.\n\nHe can exchange 4/2=2 new candles. So he burns 2 more hours, now total is 6. Now, he has 2 burnt candles from this step.\n\nHe can exchange again: 2/2=1 new candle. Burn it, adding another hour. Total is 7. Now, he has 1 burnt candle, which is less than b=2, so he can't do anything more.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- total = a\n- rem = a % b\n- if rem ==0: then, after burning all, he can exchange (a /b) * (b/a) times? Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a loop:\n\n- while the number of burnt candles is >= b:\n   - exchange as much as possible into new candles.\n   - add the new candles to the total.\n   - update the burnt count: the new ones will be burnt, and the remaining from previous.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\nInitialize total = a\ncurrent_burnt = a\n\nThen, while current_burnt >= b:\n    new_candles = current_burnt // b\n    total += new_candles\n    current_burnt = (current_burnt % b) + new_candles  # because the new candles are burned, adding to the burnt pile\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you create new_candles, each of them will burn for an hour, contributing to the total, and then become burnt.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\ntotal = a\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n    new = burnt // b\n    total += new\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new\n\nBecause each new candle is used once, so adds to the total, and then becomes part of the burnt pile.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total=4, burnt=4.\n\nBurnt >=2, yes.\n\nnew=2, total becomes 6.\n\nburnt = 4%2=0 + 2 =2.\n\nAgain, burnt>=2: new=1, total=7.\n\nburnt=0+1=1 <2, loop ends.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: a=6, b=3.\n\nTotal starts at 6.\n\nBurnt=6.\n\nnew=6//3=2, total=8.\n\nburnt=0 +2=2 <3. So total is 8, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if a=5, b=5.\n\nThen, initial total=5.\n\nburnt=5 >=5: new=1, total=6.\n\nburnt becomes 0 +1=1 <5. So total is 6.\n\nWhat about a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial burnt=10.\n\nnew=3 (since 10//3 is 3), total +=3 →13.\n\nburnt becomes 10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nNow, 4 >=3: new=1, total 14.\n\nburnt=4%3=1 +1=2 <3.\n\nSo total is 14.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nWe need to read two integers, a and b.\n\nCompute the total using the loop above.\n\nThen, output the total as an integer.\n\nIn Python, the code would look like:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b.\n\nConvert them to integers.\n\nInitialize total = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nloop while burnt >=b:\n\n    new = burnt //b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new\n\nOnce the loop ends, print(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where a <b: say a=3, b=5. Then, total is 3.\n\nNo loop runs.\n\nAnother case: a=0, but according to constraints, a is at least 1.\n\nSo, no issues.\n\nAnother test: a=7, b=4.\n\nInitial burnt=7.\n\nnew=1, total=8.\n\nburnt=7%4=3 +1=4.\n\nLoop again: new=1, total=9.\n\nburnt=0 +1=1 <4. So total is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWe can read the input as a single line, split into two parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen perform the loop.\n\nSo, code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n\n    new = burnt // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nThat should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can exchange burned-out candles for new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`. Each candle burns for exactly one hour.\n2. **Burn Candles**: Burn all initial candles, which contributes `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Exchange Process**: Collect the burned-out candles and exchange them for new candles whenever possible. Specifically, every time Vasily collects `b` burned-out candles, he can create one new candle.\n4. **Iterative Exchange**: Continue exchanging until the number of burned-out candles is less than `b`. For each successful exchange, add the new candles to the total burn time and update the count of burned-out candles accordingly.\n5. **Termination**: The process stops when there are not enough burned-out candles to make a new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n    new = burnt // b\n    total += new\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of burned-out candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: `total` is initialized to `a` because each candle burns for an hour. `burnt` is also initialized to `a` to track the number of burned-out candles.\n3. **Loop for Exchanges**: The loop continues as long as there are enough burned-out candles (`burnt`) to make a new one (`b`). In each iteration:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the current count of burned-out candles.\n   - Add these new candles to the total burn time.\n   - Update the count of burned-out candles to include both the remainder from the division and the newly burned candles from the created ones.\n4. **Output Result**: Once the loop terminates, print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum illumination time by iteratively converting burned-out candles into new ones until no more conversions are possible.",
