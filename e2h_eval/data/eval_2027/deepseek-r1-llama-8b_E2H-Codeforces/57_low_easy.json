His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where each participant has points from two tours. The teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x points. We need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have, given the possible permutations of the results.\n\nHmm. So the input gives us two lists of points: a for the first tour and b for the second. But they're in arbitrary order. Our task is to figure out what's the maximum and minimum rank Vasya can have, considering all possible pairings between a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but wait. Because the actual pairing isn't known. So for each participant, their total points are a_p + b_q, but we don't know which a corresponds to which b.\n\nSo, how do we model this? I think the approach is to consider all possible pairings of a and b, compute the sum for each participant, then sort them in descending order to get the ranks.\n\nBut since n can be up to 105, trying all possible permutations would be computationally expensive—like n! possibilities, which is way too big even for n=10. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem. Each a_i is connected to each b_j, and we choose a perfect matching such that the sum for Vasya (i,j) is >=x, and then compute the best and worst possible rankings.\n\nBut even with that, finding all possible pairings is impractical. So perhaps there's another way.\n\nLet me think differently. For any possible pairing, each participant's sum is a_p + b_q. Then the ranks depend on these sums.\n\nThe best rank for Vasya is when his sum is as high as possible compared to others. Conversely, the worst is when his sum is as low as possible, given the constraints.\n\nSo to find the best possible rank, we need to maximize Vasya's sum. And to find the worst, minimize it, but ensuring that his sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but the problem says that it's guaranteed that Vasya exists (there's at least one i,j with a_i + b_j >=x). So for our problem, any pairing must satisfy that condition.\n\nBut how do we find the best and worst ranks across all possible valid pairings.\n\nHmm, perhaps for the best case, we can arrange the pairings so that Vasya's sum is as large as possible, and all other participants' sums are as small as possible.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case because each a and b can only be used once. So to maximize Vasya's sum, we'd want to assign him the largest a plus the largest b possible, but then the remaining a's and b's have to be paired among themselves.\n\nAlternatively, for the best case, Vasya's sum should be as high as possible, and the rest of the participants' sums as low as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and the rest are as high as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the key. So for the best rank:\n\n- Assign Vasya the maximum possible a + b, subject to a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n- Then, for the other participants, assign the next highest a and b available to minimize their sums.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst rank:\n\n- Assign Vasya the minimal possible a + b (>=x).\n\n- Then, for others, assign the next highest a and b to maximize their sums.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the best rank, we want Vasya to have the highest possible sum, so that his rank is 1. For the worst, we want his sum to be as low as possible, but higher than others as little as possible.\n\nWait, but when considering all possible pairings, the best possible scenario for Vasya's rank is when he has the maximum sum, and all others have as small as possible sums.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the approach is:\n\nFor the best case:\n\n1. Find the maximum possible sum s_v for Vasya, such that s_v >=x.\n\n2. Then, for the rest of the participants, pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that their sums are as small as possible.\n\nWait, but how do you find the maximum possible s_v?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum s_v is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j, but only if a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nBecause if a_i is the largest a, and b_j is the largest b, then their sum is the maximum possible for any participant, including Vasya.\n\nSo in the best case, Vasya is assigned the largest a and largest b, giving him the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given in arbitrary order, and we need to consider all possible pairings of these results to find the optimal ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each participant's total points are the sum of their points from two tours. The goal is to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) possible ranks Vasya can achieve, considering all valid permutations of the tour results.\n\n2. **Best Rank Calculation**:\n   - To maximize Vasya's rank, we need to assign him the highest possible total points. This is achieved by pairing the highest points from the first tour with the highest points from the second tour.\n   - After assigning the maximum possible points to Vasya, we then calculate the total points for each participant and sort them in descending order to determine Vasya's best rank.\n\n3. **Worst Rank Calculation**:\n   - To minimize Vasya's rank, we need to assign him the minimum possible total points that still meet or exceed the required threshold `x`.\n   - After assigning the minimum possible points to Vasya, we then calculate the total points for each participant and sort them in descending order to determine Vasya's worst rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # For best case: Assign max a and b to Vasya, then others as low as possible\n    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    sorted_b = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    \n    max_sum_vasya = 0\n    for ai in sorted_a:\n        for bj in sorted_b:\n            if ai + bj >= x:\n                max_sum_vasya = ai + bj\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    remaining_a = sorted_a[sorted_a.index(max_sum_vasya // 1) + 1:] if max_sum_vasya != 0 else []\n    remaining_b = sorted_b[sorted_b.index(max_sum_vasya // 1) + 1:] if max_sum_vasya != 0 else []\n    \n    other_sums = []\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < len(remaining_a) and j < len(remaining_b):\n        s = remaining_a[i] + remaining_b[j]\n        other_sums.append(s)\n        i += 1\n        j += 1\n    \n    # Now create the list of all sums for best case\n    all_sums_best = [max_sum_vasya] + other_sums\n    all_sums_best.sort(reverse=True)\n    best_rank = all_sums_best.index(max_sum_vasya) + 1\n    \n    # For worst case: Assign min a and b to Vasya that meets x, then others as high as possible\n    sorted_a_asc = sorted(a)\n    sorted_b_asc = sorted(b)\n    \n    min_sum_vasya = float('inf')\n    for ai in sorted_a_asc:\n        for bj in sorted_b_asc:\n            if ai + bj >= x:\n                min_sum_vasya = ai + bj\n                break\n        if min_sum_vasya != float('inf'):\n            break\n    \n    remaining_a_worst = sorted_a_asc[:sorted_a_asc.index(min_sum_vasya)]\n    remaining_b_worst = sorted_b_asc[:sorted_b_asc.index(min_sum_vasya)]\n    \n    other_sums_worst = []\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < len(remaining_a_worst) and j < len(remaining_b_worst):\n        s = remaining_a_worst[i] + remaining_b_worst[j]\n        other_sums_worst.append(s)\n        i += 1\n        j += 1\n    \n    all_sums_worst = [min_sum_vasya] + other_sums_worst\n    all_sums_worst.sort(reverse=True)\n    worst_rank = all_sums_worst.index(min_sum_vasya) + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: We pair the highest points from both tours to maximize Vasya's total points. After ensuring Vasya's points meet the threshold, we sort all participants' points in descending order to determine Vasya's best possible rank.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: We pair the lowest points from both tours to minimize Vasya's total points, while still meeting the threshold. Then, we sort all participants' points in descending order to determine Vasya's worst possible rank.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the best and worst ranks by considering all valid permutations of the tour results and leveraging sorting to determine rankings.",
