A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on these resources.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nWe have n friends. They bought k bottles of drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nAnd they have p grams of salt.\n\nEach toast per friend requires nl milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast. So for each toast, all friends take some amount. Or maybe each toast is per person? Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of drink per toast. So for one toast round (where everyone makes a toast), each of the n friends uses nl ml. So per toast round, the total drink used is n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so per toast round, c slices are needed because there are n friends. So total lime slices per toast is n.\n\nSalt is per friend: each friend needs np grams. So per toast round, total salt used is n * np.\n\nSo to find out how many toast rounds they can do, we need to calculate based on each resource.\n\nBut wait, the way to compute each resource's capacity is:\n\n- Total drink: k * l → each toast consumes n * nl → number of toasts possible from drink is (k*l) / (n * nl). But since you can't have a fraction, we take the floor.\n\n- Total lime slices: c*d → each toast consumes n slices → toasts_from_lime = (c*d) // n.\n\n- Salt: p grams → each toast consumes n * np → toasts_from_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the maximum number of toast rounds is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's see.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4*5=20ml. Each toast per friend uses 3ml. So per toast round, 3*3=9ml. So 20/9 is 2.222... → 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: 10 limes, each 8 slices → 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666 → 26. But wait the sample says 6, 80, 100. Oh wait, perhaps I misunderstood.\n\nWait, in the note, it says:\n\nThey have 20ml of drink → enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Hmm, why 3? Because each toast per friend needs 3ml, but each toast round is for all friends at the same time. So for each toast, each friend drinks 3ml, so total per toast is 3 *3 =9ml. So 20ml allows 2 full toasts (2*9=18ml used, 2 left). Then 20-18=2ml, which isn't enough for a third toast.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait that doesn't add up. Oh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, the note says: The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So each toast is per friend, meaning each toast is individual. So each friend makes a toast, which requires nl ml, a slice, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, that changes things. So each toast is per friend. So for each toast, one friend takes their portion. So for a group of n friends, each making a toast, that's one toast round where each person contributes their own resources. So per toast round, the total drink used is n * nl (since each of the n friends uses nl). Similarly, for limes, each toast requires n slices (each friend uses one). For salt, each toast requires n * np.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the total drink available is k*l. Each toast round (all n friends making a toast) uses n * nl ml. So the maximum number of toast rounds possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly, the total lime slices are c*d. Each toast round uses n slices. So max toast rounds from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt is p grams. Each toast round uses n * np.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: \n   - The total amount of drink available is `k * l` milliliters.\n   - The total number of lime slices is `c * d`.\n   - The total amount of salt available is `p` grams.\n\n2. **Calculate Toasts per Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: Each toast round (where all friends make a toast) consumes `n * nl` milliliters. The number of toast rounds possible from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Each toast round consumes `n` slices. The number of toast rounds possible from lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt**: Each toast round consumes `n * np` grams. The number of toast rounds possible from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n3. **Determine the Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toast rounds each friend can make is the minimum of the three values calculated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input line as a list of integers\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate total resources\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_limes = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\n# Compute how much each resource can support\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoasts_lime = total_limes // n\ntoasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\n# The limiting factor is the smallest of these\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n\n# Output as a string\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line of space-separated integers representing the parameters of the problem.\n- **Calculating Total Resources**: We compute the total amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n- **Computing Toasts per Resource**: For each resource, we determine how many toast rounds can be supported based on the resource constraints.\n- **Determining the Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value among the three computed toast counts determines the maximum number of toast rounds each friend can make, ensuring all constraints are satisfied.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by breaking down the problem into manageable steps, ensuring all resource constraints are considered.",
