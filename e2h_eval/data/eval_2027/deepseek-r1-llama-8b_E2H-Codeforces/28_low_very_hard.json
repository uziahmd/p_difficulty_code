String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting beautiful strings based on certain criteria. The string must consist of only 0s and 1s, and the count of 0s should be exactly n, 1s exactly m. Then, there's this modification operation that can be applied any number of times, including zero. The modification allows us to replace the last two characters with a single 0 or 1, depending on what they were. For example, if the last two are 00, replacing them with 0; if they're 11, replace with 1; else, like 01 or 10, we can't do anything because the modification requires two same characters.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh right, the modification replaces two last characters with a single character. So for the string to undergo a modification, the last two characters must be the same. Because if they are different, the rule says we can't perform a modification because the replacement is either 0 (if both are 0) or 1 (if both are 1). So, the modification can only be done on a string where the last two are same.\n\nEach modification reduces the length by one. And the initial string can be modified multiple times, as long as its length is at least two after each step.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string where the majority (or perhaps some condition) leads to a certain g.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that after some modifications, the resulting string must have all characters equal to g. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nOh, right: We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) modifications. So the final string after modifications must consist entirely of g's. Because each modification reduces the string by one character, but the new character depends on the last two.\n\nWait, but how? Because when you perform a modification, you take the last two characters and replace them with one. So, for instance, if the string ends with \"00\", you replace them with \"0\", so the new last character is 0. Similarly for \"11\" → \"1\". But what about other endings? Like \"01\": you can't modify because the last two are different.\n\nSo, the process is about reducing the string through these operations until you can't anymore, and the end result must be a string that's all g's.\n\nWait, no. Because the process stops when the string is of length less than two. So the final string could be of any length, as long as it's composed entirely of g's. Because after all possible modifications, you can't make any more changes.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's not just the final string. Because during the process, the string could have been transformed in various ways, but the end result is that the entire string is made of g's.\n\nHmm. So the key is to model the possible transformations and see which initial beautiful strings can be reduced to a string of all g's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the minimal steps to reach a string of all g's, but that seems complicated.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's model the process as a series of reductions. Each time, the last two characters are replaced by a single one, which is 0 if the last two were 0s, 1 if they were 1s. So, each reduction step depends on the current last two characters.\n\nThe process continues until the string is of length less than two, and the final string must be all g's.\n\nSo, for a beautiful string (exactly n zeros and m ones), we need to determine whether it's possible to perform a sequence of such modifications such that the resulting string is all g's.\n\nWait, but the original string is beautiful, meaning it has exactly n zeros and m ones. So the total length is n + m.\n\nNow, each modification reduces the length by 1. So, the number of modifications possible is (n + m - k) - 1, where k is the length after all modifications. But since the final string must be all g's, the length of the final string can be anything, as long as it's all g's.\n\nBut wait, for the string to be reducible to all g's, the final string must have all characters g, and its length must be such that the initial string can be reduced to that length via k modifications, where k = initial_length - final_length.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each possible final string that is all g's, determine whether the initial beautiful string can be transformed into it via some modifications.\n\nBut what are the possibilities for the final string? It must consist entirely of g's, and its length must be such that the initial string can be reduced to it.\n\nWait, but",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string consisting entirely of a specific character (either '0' or '1') after performing a series of modifications. Each modification replaces the last two characters with a single character based on their values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The string must consist of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones. We can perform modifications where the last two characters are replaced by a single character. The goal is to determine how many such beautiful strings can be reduced to a string composed entirely of '0's or '1's.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The modifications can only be performed if the last two characters are the same. Each modification reduces the string length by one. The final string must be composed entirely of the target character `g`.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reduce the string while ensuring it ends with the target character `g`. We define states based on the current counts of '0's and '1's and the position in the string.\n\n4. **State Transition**: For each state, consider the possible next characters and update the counts accordingly. If the last two characters are the same, they can be replaced by the target character `g`, reducing the string length by one.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, use modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_len = n + m\ndp = [[0]*(max_len+1) for _ in range(2)]\n\n# Base case: empty string\ndp[0][0] = 1\ndp[1][0] = 1\n\nfor l in range(1, max_len+1):\n    for cnt0 in range(n+1):\n        for cnt1 in range(m+1):\n            if cnt0 + cnt1 != l:\n                continue\n            current = dp[cnt0 % 2][cnt1 % 2]\n            if current == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Try adding a '0' at the end\n            new_cnt0 = cnt0 + 1\n            new_cnt1 = cnt1\n            if new_cnt0 <= n and new_cnt1 <= m:\n                dp[new_cnt0 % 2][new_cnt1 % 2] = (dp[new_cnt0 % 2][new_cnt1 % 2] + current) % MOD\n            \n            # Try adding a '1' at the end\n            new_cnt0 = cnt0\n            new_cnt1 = cnt1 + 1\n            if new_cnt0 <= n and new_cnt1 <= m:\n                dp[new_cnt0 % 2][new_cnt1 % 2] = (dp[new_cnt0 % 2][new_cnt1 % 2] + current) % MOD\n            \n            # Check if we can perform any modification\n            if l >= 2:\n                # Case when last two are '00'\n                if cnt0 >= 2:\n                    new_g = g\n                    new_len = l - 1\n                    new_cnt0_mod = new_cnt0 - 2\n                    new_cnt1_mod = new_cnt1\n                    if new_cnt0_mod <= n and new_cnt1_mod <= m:\n                        target_state = (new_cnt0_mod % 2, new_cnt1_mod % 2)\n                        if target_state[0] == (g % 2):\n                            dp[target_state[0]][target_state[1]] = (dp[target_state[0]][target_state[1]] + current) % MOD\n                # Case when last two are '11'\n                if cnt1 >= 2:\n                    new_g = g\n                    new_len = l - 1\n                    new_cnt0_mod = new_cnt0\n                    new_cnt1_mod = new_cnt1 - 2\n                    if new_cnt0_mod <= n and new_cnt1_mod <= m:\n                        target_state = (new_cnt0_mod % 2, new_cnt1_mod % 2)\n                        if target_state[0] == (g % 2):\n                            dp[target_state[0]][target_state[1]] = (dp[target_state[0]][target_state[1]] + current) % MOD\n\nresult_0 = dp[g % 2][0]\nresult_1 = dp[g % 2][1]\n\nprint(result_0 % MOD)\nprint(result_1 % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to transform a beautiful string into one composed entirely of the target character `g`.
