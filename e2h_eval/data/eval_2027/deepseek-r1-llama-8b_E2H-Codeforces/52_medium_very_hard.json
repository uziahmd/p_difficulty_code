Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about candles and figuring out how many hours they can burn for. The process goes like this: each candle burns for an hour and then goes out. But Vasily is smart because he can take 'b' number of burned-out candles and make a new one. So the question is, what's the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let's think about the example given. For instance, when a is 4 and b is 2, the output is 7. How does that work? \n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Now he has 4 stubs. He can exchange them for 4/2 = 2 new candles. Burning those adds 2 more hours, making total 6. Now he has 2 stubs left from these. But wait, 2 is equal to b, so he can make another candle. That's one more hour, bringing the total to 7. Oh right, because after burning the two candles, he gets 2 more stubs, which again give him one candle, adding another hour. Wait, no—wait, wait. Let me recount:\n\nInitial 4 burn → 4 hours. Then 4 stubs → 2 new, which gives 2 hours (total 6). Now he has 2 stubs from those 2 candles. So he can make 1 new candle, burn it for 1 hour (total 7), and now he has 1 stub. Since 1 is less than b=2, he can't make any more. So yes, 7.\n\nSo the approach is to sum all the possible hours by continuously converting stubs into new candles as long as there are enough stubs.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Start with 'a' candles. Each burns for 1 hour, adding 'a' to the total.\n2. Collect 'a' stubs.\n3. Exchange stubs for new candles: each time, the number of new candles is (current_stubs // b). Add this number to the total.\n4. Update the stubs: the new candles when burned add to the stubs. Also, the remainder from the division (current_stubs % b) is added to the stubs.\n\nWait, let's model this correctly. Because each time you make new candles, those will also contribute stubs once they burn.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n- stubs = a\n- while stubs >= b:\n    - new_candles = stubs // b\n    - total += new_candles\n    - stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles  # because new_candles burn, adding new stubs\n\nBecause each new candle made contributes its own stub after burning.\n\nLet's test this logic with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\nstubs =4.\n\nFirst iteration:\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6.\nstubs =4%2=0 + 2 =2.\n\nSecond iteration:\nnew_candles=2//2=1. total=6+1=7.\nstubs =0 +1=1.\n\nNow stubs <b, loop ends. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3.\n\nInitial stubs=6.\n\nFirst iteration: 6//3=2. total=6+2=8.\nstubs=0 +2=2. 2<3, loop ends. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nWhat about when a is less than b?\n\nLike a=3, b=5.\n\nTotal would be 3. Because after burning 3, you have 3 stubs, which is less than 5, so nothing else.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5.\n\nBurn 5 → 5 hours. Stubs=5. Make 1 new candle. Burn it → 6 hours. Stubs=1. So total is 6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Compute the initial total as a.\n- Compute the initial stubs as a.\n- While stubs >= b:\n   - new = stubs // b\n   - total += new\n   - stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n- Return total.\n\nSo the code should implement this.\n\nNow, in Python, we can write a function or just compute it step by step.\n\nRead the input as two integers a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a.\n\nstubs = a.\n\nThen loop:\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nThen print total.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nTesting another scenario: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial total=10.\n\nStubs=10.\n\nLoop:\n\n10//3=3. total=13. stubs=10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nNext iteration:4 >=3.\n\n4//3=1. total=14. stubs=1 +1=2.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nSo total is 14.\n\nLet me see:\n\nBurn 10 → 10 hours, 10 stubs.\n\nMake 3 from 10 → burn 3 → 3 hours, stubs 3. Now total 13.\n\nNow stubs: 3 + 1 (from 10%3=1) → 4? Wait, wait:\n\nWait, original stubs after first step: 10 mod 3 is 1, plus new_candles 3 → 4.\n\nIn next step, 4 >=3 → new=1. total 14.\n\nStubs becomes 4 mod 3 =1 +1=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute as described.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nWe can read the input line, split into two integers.\n\nThen, proceed as per the algorithm.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 4 2 → 7.\n\nSample 2:6 3 →8.\n\nAnother test: a=5, b=5 → 5+1=6.\n\nYes.\n\nEdge case: a=0 → but according to the problem statement, a is at least 1. So no need to handle.\n\nAnother edge case: a=1, b=1000. Then total is 1, since 1 <1000.\n\nAnother test: a=9, b=5.\n\nInitial stubs=9.\n\nBurn 9 → 9 hours.\n\nMake 1 new (since 9//5=1), stubs become 9%5=4 +1=5.\n\nBurn that 1 → 10 hours.\n\nNow stubs=5//5=1. So total 11.\n\nStubs after that: 0 +1=1. Loop ends.\n\nSo total is 9+1+1=11.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can create new candles from the stubs of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Collect Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, we will have `a` stubs.\n3. **Recycle Stubs**: Use the collected stubs to create new candles. Each time we create a new candle from `b` stubs, it burns for an hour and generates another stub.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Continue recycling the stubs until we no longer have enough stubs to create a new candle (i.e., when the number of stubs is less than `b`).\n5. **Summing Hours**: Keep track of the total hours by adding the hours from each newly created candle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    stubs = stubs % b + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of stubs needed to create a new candle).\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `total` to `a` because each candle burns for exactly one hour.\n3. **Loop Through Stubs**: While there are enough stubs to create at least one new candle, we:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made (`new_candles`).\n   - Add these new candles' burn time to the total hours.\n   - Update the number of stubs to reflect the remainder after creating new candles plus the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n4. **Output Result**: Once the loop ends, print the total hours.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the stubs and ensures that we maximize the number of hours the candles can keep the room illuminated.",
