The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where a frog starts at position 0 and can jump either +a or -b each time. For each x from 0 to m, I need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without going outside [0, x]. Then, sum all these f(x) values.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The frog's movement depends on a and b. Since a and b are positive, the frog can only move forward or backward, but not in both directions equally because subtracting b might take it below zero, but the constraints say it can't jump outside [0, x]. Wait, no, the problem states that the frog must never jump outside [0, x], so any jump that would take it beyond x or below 0 is forbidden.\n\nSo for each x, I need to calculate how many reachable positions there are, considering that the frog can't go beyond x or below 0.\n\nBut doing this for every x up to m would be too slow, especially since m can be up to 1e9. So we need a mathematical approach to find a pattern or formula that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. The frog's movement is governed by steps of +a and -b. So the reachable positions form some kind of set based on linear combinations of a and b.\n\nWait, but since the frog can make any number of jumps (including zero), the reachable positions are all numbers that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and such that the position is within [0, x].\n\nBut that might not directly help because for each x, the allowed positions depend on x. So perhaps the key is to find the minimal x after which the set of reachable positions stops changing in a certain way.\n\nWait, what's the maximum x where adding more doesn't change f(x)? Because for larger x, the frog has more options, so f(x) increases until it reaches a point where all possible positions are already covered, and then stays the same.\n\nSo maybe there's a point X such that for all x >= X, f(x) remains the same. Beyond X, the frog can't reach any new positions because the allowed interval is large enough.\n\nSo first, I need to find the smallest X where the frog can reach all possible positions in some periodic way, and beyond that, the count stabilizes.\n\nWhat's the structure of the reachable positions?\n\nThe frog can reach positions that are congruent to some residue modulo d, where d is the greatest common divisor of a and b. Because each step changes the position by a multiple of d. So, the reachable positions are those where (position) mod d is equal to 0 mod gcd(a,b). Wait, actually, the set of reachable positions is all numbers of the form k*a - l*b, which can be written as t = a*k - b*l. The GCD of a and b is g, so t must be a multiple of g. So the reachable positions are all multiples of g.\n\nWait, but wait: if a and b are co-prime, then the frog can reach any position beyond a certain point. Otherwise, it can only reach positions that are multiples of their GCD.\n\nSo, the minimal position the frog can reach is 0, but when you add a, you can get a, 2a, etc., but also subtract b, so maybe you can reach other positions.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose a=5, b=3. The GCD is 1, so theoretically, the frog can reach any integer. But given that the frog can't jump beyond x or below 0, for small x, certain positions are unreachable.\n\nIn the sample input, for x=7, the output is 19. Let's see:\n\nf(0) = 1 (can't move)\nf(1) = 1 (can't move +5 or -3)\n...\nf(4) =1 (same reason)\nAt x=5: the frog can jump once to 5, but can't jump back because 5-3=2 is still >=0. So from 5, it can reach 5+5=10 (but x is 5, so that's beyond. Or wait, no, because the frog can't jump beyond x. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0,5. But wait, from 5, can it subtract 3 to reach 2? Oh right, because 2 is within [0,5]. So the reachable positions are 0,5,2,7 (but 7 is beyond 5, so no). So for x=5, the frog can reach 0,2,5, which is 3 positions.\n\nWait, so for x=5, the frog can make the following moves:\n\nStart at 0.\n\nFrom 0, can jump +5 to 5, or -3 to -3, which is invalid because it's less than 0. So only 5 is reachable.\n\nFrom 5, can jump +5 again to 10 (invalid for x=5) or -3 to 2. So 2 is added.\n\nSo the reachable positions are 0,5,2 → 3 positions. So f(5)=3.\n\nSimilarly, for x=6, the frog can jump to 5 again, and from 5, to 2, and from 2, can jump +5 to 7 (invalid) or -3 to -1 (invalid). So the reachable positions remain 0,2,5, but wait, can the frog reach 0 again via another path?\n\nWait, no. Because once the frog is at 5, it can't jump back to 2 again without having done so before. Wait, no—each move is a single step. So from 5, the frog can choose to jump back to 2, but that's another step.\n\nWait, but the frog can make multiple jumps. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0 →5 →2. But once it's at 2, it can't do anything else except jump to 5 again (since 2+5=7>5 is invalid, 2-3=-1 is invalid). So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0,5,2 → f(5)=3.\n\nFor x=6, the frog can now reach 5+5=10 (which is beyond 6, so can't) or 5-3=2, which is already there. From 2, adding 5 gives 7>6, invalid; subtracting 3 gives -1, invalid. So for x=6, same as x=5: f(6)=3.\n\nWait, but wait: for x=6, the frog could also reach 6? Because 0+6 is not a jump, but the frog can't just appear there unless it's reachable via the allowed steps.\n\nWait, how can the frog reach 6? It can't, because 6 is not a multiple of 5-3. Let's see: 6 can be written as 5k -3l. Let's see: 5*3=15, 3*5=15. Hmm, 15 - 15=0. Not 6. 5*2=10, 3*4=12. 10-12= -2. Not 6. Maybe another combination: 5*4=20, 3*2=6 → 20-6=14. No. Hmm, perhaps 6 is not reachable.\n\nWait, but wait: 6 is 0 + ...? Let's see: the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7 (for x=7). So for x=6, the frog can't reach 6 because it's not part of the reachable set.\n\nSo for x=7, the frog can reach 0,2,5,7 (from 5+5=10, which is beyond, but wait, 5+5=10 is beyond 7, so that's not allowed. Hmm, wait, no. How does the frog reach 7? Because from 5, the frog can't jump +5 to 10, but from 2, the frog can jump +5 to 7. So yes, 7 is reachable.\n\nSo for x=7, the frog can reach 0,2,5,7. Are there any more positions?\n\nWait, from 7, can the frog jump back to 4 (7-3=4). So 4 is added. From 4, can the frog jump +5 to 9 (>7, invalid) or -3 to 1. So 1 is added. From 1, can the frog jump +5 to 6, which is within x=7. So 6 is added. From 6, can the frog jump +5 to 11 (invalid) or -3 to 3. So 3 is added. From 3, can the frog jump +5 to 8 (invalid) or -3 to 0. So 0 is already counted.\n\nSo for x=7, the reachable positions are 0,2,5,7,4,1,6,3. That's 8 positions, so f(7)=8.\n\nSo the sample makes sense.\n\nSo the problem is to model the reachable positions for each x and sum them up.\n\nBut with m up to 1e9, iterating for each x is impossible. We need a mathematical way to find, for each x, the size of the reachable set, and then sum over x from 0 to m.\n\nLet me think about when the reachable positions stop increasing.\n\nThe minimal x beyond which the reachable positions don't increase anymore is when the frog can reach all possible positions in the allowed range, meaning that the set has stabilized.\n\nSo, the key is to find the point X where, for x >= X, the number of reachable positions becomes S, and remains S for all larger x.\n\nOnce we find X, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\n- For x < X, compute f(x) individually.\n- For x >= X, f(x) is S.\n\nSo the sum is the sum from x=0 to X-1 of f(x) plus (m - X + 1) * S, but only if m >= X.\n\nOtherwise, if m < X, then we just sum up to m.\n\nNow, the question is: How to find X, and what is S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions form a certain structure that can be represented as intervals and arithmetic progressions.\n\nWait, another approach: The frog's movement can be modeled as a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent possible jumps. The reachable positions form connected components based on the graph.\n\nBut again, for large m, this isn't feasible.\n\nLet me think about the minimal and maximal positions the frog can reach.\n\nThe minimal position is 0, but when jumping back, you can reach lower positions, but not below 0.\n\nThe maximal position is x, since the frog cannot jump beyond x.\n\nSo for each x, the frog can reach any position within [0, x] that can be expressed as a combination of a and b steps, starting from 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable positions for a given x are all numbers in [0, x] that satisfy certain modular conditions.\n\nSince the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the GCD of a and b, let's denote g = gcd(a, b).\n\nSo any reachable position p must satisfy p mod g == 0.\n\nSo, the first step is to compute g = gcd(a, b). Then, all reachable positions must be multiples of g.\n\nNow, the next question is: For a given x, what is the number of reachable positions that are multiples of g within [0, x]?\n\nBut that's not sufficient because the frog might not be able to reach all such multiples due to the constraints of the jumps.\n\nWait, but when a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach any multiple of g beyond a certain point. For example, if a=5 and b=3 (coprime), then the frog can reach any integer beyond a certain x.\n\nWait, no. Even if a and b are coprime, the frog may not be able to reach all positions because it can't make certain jumps.\n\nWait, but according to the coin problem (Frobenius number), the largest monetary amount that cannot be obtained using any combination of coins of denominations a and b is ab - a - b, provided a and b are coprime. But that's for combinations where you can use any number of a and b, including negative (like in our case, since the frog can subtract b). Wait, no, in our problem, the frog can make any number of jumps, including subtracting b, which is equivalent to adding (-b), so it's similar to allowing positive and negative coefficients.\n\nWait, in the standard Frobenius problem, you have non-negative coefficients, but here, since the frog can make any number of jumps, including negative ones (like, making a jump that's effectively subtracting b multiple times), the reachable positions are all integers that are linear combinations of a and b, which in this case is all integers because a and b are coprime. So, for a and b coprime, the frog can reach any integer beyond a certain point.\n\nBut in our problem, the frog can't go below 0 or above x. So, for x >= some X, the frog can reach all possible positions in [0, x], but perhaps not exactly all, because the frog can't make all possible jumps.\n\nWait, but perhaps when x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of g up to x.\n\nSo, let's formalize this.\n\nLet g = gcd(a, b). Then, all reachable positions are multiples of g.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding how many multiples of g are reachable within [0, x], for each x.\n\nSo, for a given x, the maximum reachable position is min(x, something?), but the frog can't go beyond x.\n\nWait, the maximum reachable position is x, because the frog can choose to not make any jumps beyond x.\n\nWait, no. Because the frog can make jumps that exceed x, but such jumps are disallowed. So the frog can't reach beyond x.\n\nSo, for x, the reachable positions are all multiples of g that are <=x and satisfy some condition based on the frog's movement.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother thought: The frog can reach any position in the set S = { k * g | k is an integer }, that's within [0, x], and for which (k) can be expressed as a combination of a and b steps.\n\nWait, but perhaps more accurately, the reachable positions are those that are in the additive subgroup generated by a and b, intersected with [0, x].\n\nSo, for a and b, the subgroup is all multiples of g. So, the reachable positions are the multiples of g within [0, x], but whether they are reachable depends on the specific a and b.\n\nWait, but for a and b being coprime, then the frog can reach any multiple of g beyond a certain point. So for x >= some value, all multiples of g up to x are reachable.\n\nSo, perhaps for the general case, the reachable positions are the multiples of g up to x, and for x >= X, all of them are reachable.\n\nSo, the problem becomes:\n\nCompute the number of reachable positions for each x, which is floor(x / g) minus the number of unreachable multiples of g.\n\nBut again, for large x, this is not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of reachable positions is floor((x + c)/g), where c is some constant depending on a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions form a continuous range once x is large enough.\n\nSo, let's think about when the frog can reach all possible multiples of g up to x.\n\nIn the case where a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any multiple of g beyond a certain point. So, for x >= that point, the number of reachable positions is x//g.\n\nWait, but wait: if a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach any integer beyond (a*b -a -b), but that's when you can only use non-negative coefficients. In our case, since the frog can make any number of jumps (including negative), which corresponds to using any integer coefficients, the frog can reach any multiple of g beyond a certain point.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the frog can't jump beyond x. So for x >= (a + b)*something, perhaps all multiples of g up to x are reachable.\n\nWait, perhaps for a and b coprime, the frog can reach any multiple of g up to x, as long as x is >= g*(some value). So, for x >= (a + b)*g, maybe all multiples of g up to x are reachable.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's take a=5, b=3, which are coprime. For x=10, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7, etc. But for x=10, can it reach all multiples of 1 (since g=1) up to 10?\n\nYes, because 0,1,2,...10 are all reachable.\n\nWait, how? Let's see.\n\nFrom 0, can reach 5, then from 5, subtract 3 to get 2, then from 2, add 5 to get 7. From 7, subtract 3 to get 4, then from 4, subtract 3 to get 1. Then from 1, add 5 to get 6. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. From 3, add 5 to get 8. From 8, subtract 3 to get 5 (already visited). So, seems like all positions from 0 to 10 are reachable except perhaps some.\n\nWait, no: can we reach 9?\n\nFrom 0, add 5 to get 5, subtract 3 to get 2, add 5 to get 7, subtract 3 to get 4, subtract 3 to get 1, add 5 to get 6, subtract 3 to get 3, add 5 to get 8, subtract 3 to get 5. Hmm, stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps 9 is not reachable. Wait, can the frog reach 9?\n\nAlternatively, think about 9 = 5*2 - 3*3 → 10-9=1. Yes, 5*2=10, 3*3=9, so 10-9=1. So 9 is reachable.\n\nWait, but in practice, the frog can't make 5*2 -3*3=1, but that doesn't directly translate. Wait, perhaps the frog can reach 9 by other means.\n\nWait, let's try another approach:\n\nStart at 0.\n\nAdd 5 →5.\n\nSubtract 3 →2.\n\nAdd 5 →7.\n\nSubtract 3 →4.\n\nSubtract 3 →1.\n\nAdd 5 →6.\n\nSubtract 3 →3.\n\nAdd 5 →8.\n\nSubtract 3 →5.\n\nHmm, seems like the frog can't reach 9.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's try a different path.\n\nStart at 0.\n\nAdd 5 →5.\n\nAdd 5 →10 (but x=10, so that's allowed).\n\nFrom 10, subtract 3 →7.\n\nFrom 7, subtract 3 →4.\n\nFrom 4, subtract 3 →1.\n\nFrom 1, add 5 →6.\n\nFrom 6, subtract 3 →3.\n\nFrom 3, add 5 →8.\n\nFrom 8, subtract 3 →5.\n\nHmm, not getting to 9.\n\nWait, perhaps 9 isn't reachable. So even though a and b are coprime, some positions may not be reachable because the frog can't make the necessary jumps without exceeding x.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption was incorrect. So, perhaps the reachable positions aren't necessarily all multiples of g when x is large.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nSo, maybe I need to find for each x, the reachable positions, but that's not feasible for large x.\n\nAlternative approach: find the minimal x where the reachable positions include all multiples of g up to x. Once x reaches that point, the count for f(x) becomes x/g.\n\nBut how to find that x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions form an arithmetic progression with a certain step. So, the minimal reachable positions are spaced by a certain distance.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal step after which all positions are reachable is determined by a and b.\n\nWait, another idea: the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the GCD of a and b. So, for each x, the number of reachable positions is the number of such multiples <=x.\n\nBut again, that's only true if the frog can reach all such multiples, which may not be the case.\n\nWait, but perhaps when x is larger than or equal to a certain value, the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x.\n\nSo, perhaps the sum can be split into two parts: for x up to a certain X, compute f(x) individually, and for x >= X, compute f(x) as x/g.\n\nThen, the total sum is the sum of f(x) from 0 to X-1 plus (m - X + 1) * (m//g), assuming m >= X.\n\nBut how to find X.\n\nWait, perhaps X is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and from x, can reach x - g, x - 2g, etc., all the way down to 0. So, X is the minimal x where x is a multiple of g, and the frog can reach x, and then can subtract g as much as needed.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x is when x is the minimal such that x >= a + b.\n\nWait, that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x is the maximal between a and b, or something like that.\n\nBut perhaps I should look for a pattern in the reachable positions.\n\nLet me consider the example where a=5, b=3.\n\ng=1, so all positions are multiples of 1.\n\nFor x=5, the frog can reach 0,5,2.\n\nFor x=10, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3,8,9,10.\n\nWait, that's 11 positions, which is 10/1=10, but 11 positions. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, 10//1 is 10, but the reachable positions are 11. So that approach may not hold.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is (x + s)/g, where s is the step or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are all the numbers that can be written as (k*a - l*b) >=0, and <=x.\n\nBut that's not easy to model.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of reachable positions is the number of integers k such that 0 <= (k*a - l*b) <=x, for some l >=0.\n\nBut solving this for all k and l is complicated.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nGiven that the frog can reach any position in the additive subgroup generated by a and b, which is the multiples of g, the number of reachable positions up to x is the number of multiples of g up to x that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients.\n\nWait, but that's not precise because the frog can subtract b, which is equivalent to adding a negative coefficient.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the frog can make any number of jumps, including negative steps (like, making a jump of -b), which is equivalent to adding a negative coefficient to b.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of elements in the subgroup generated by a and b (which is gZ) that are <=x and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients (positive or negative) such that the position is non-negative.\n\nBut that's still abstract.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to model the problem as a BFS, but for large x, that's impractical. So, perhaps we can find for which x the reachable positions become a complete residue system mod d, and then the count is (x//d) + 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: For a given x, the number of reachable positions is the number of integers k such that k is in [0, x], and k can be expressed as k = a * p - b * q, where p and q are non-negative integers, and k >=0.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of such k.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions can be represented as a union of arithmetic sequences.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible residues modulo g.\n\nEach position is a multiple of g. So, for each residue r in 0, 1, ..., g-1, the reachable positions are the numbers congruent to r mod g, and <=x.\n\nBut perhaps each residue class has its own coverage.\n\nSo, the total number of reachable positions is the sum over each residue r of the number of multiples of g in [0, x] that are congruent to r mod g and are reachable.\n\nSo, the key is to find, for each residue r, the minimal x_r beyond which all multiples of g in that residue class are reachable.\n\nOnce we have x_r for each r, then for x >= max(x_r), the count for residue r is (x - r)/g + 1, but only if r <=x.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's see.\n\nSuppose for residue r, the minimal x_r is such that for x >= x_r, all multiples of g in residue r and <=x are reachable.\n\nThen, for a given x, the number of reachable positions for residue r is:\n\nif x < r: 0\n\nelse:\n\ncount_r = ((x - r) // g) + 1\n\nBut only if x >= r.\n\nSo, the total f(x) is sum over r=0 to g-1 of max(0, ((x - r) // g) + 1) if x >= r, else 0.\n\nWait, but that's only correct if for each residue r, beyond x_r, all multiples are reachable.\n\nSo, how to compute x_r for each residue r.\n\nFor residue r, x_r is the minimal x such that r + kg is reachable for all k >=0, and x >= r + kg.\n\nWait, perhaps for residue r, x_r is the minimal x such that r can be reached, and then from there, the frog can reach r + a, r + a -b, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps for each residue r, the frog can reach all positions of the form r + t*g, where t is an integer >=0, provided that r + t*g is reachable.\n\nSo, the minimal x_r is the minimal x such that r can be reached, and the frog can perform a series of jumps that allow it to reach all higher positions in that residue class.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each residue r, the minimal x_r is the minimal x where the frog can reach r and then can perform a sequence of a and -b jumps to reach higher positions.\n\nWait, perhaps x_r is r + a, or something like that.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: For each residue r, the minimal x required to reach all positions in that residue class is r plus the maximum of a and b. Or perhaps the minimal x is r + a + b.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for residue r, the minimal x is r + a + b.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to model this for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=7, a=5, b=3.\n\ng=1.\n\nSo, for each residue r=0:\n\nWhat's x_0? The minimal x such that all multiples of 1 in residue 0 (i.e., all positions) can be reached.\n\nBut in the sample, for x=7, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3, which are 8 positions, which is 8=7+1.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier idea, for residue 0, the count would be (7 -0)/1 +1 =8, which matches.\n\nSo, for residue 0, x_0 is 0, and beyond x=0, the frog can reach all positions in residue 0.\n\nWait, but in reality, for x=0, f(0)=1, which is correct.\n\nSo, for residue 0, the count is x +1.\n\nFor residue 1:\n\nThe minimal x_1 is 1.\n\nBecause the frog can reach 1 when x is at least 1.\n\nBut for x=1, the frog can reach 1, but not any higher positions beyond 1 in residue 1.\n\nWait, in the sample, for x=5, the frog can reach 1, but for x=6, it can reach 1 and 6 is not in residue 1.\n\nWait, perhaps for residue 1, the minimal x_1 is 1, but beyond that, the frog can reach 1+5=6, 6-3=3, etc.\n\nBut in the sample, for x=7, the frog can reach 1,6,3, which are 3 positions. So for residue 1, the count is 3, which is (7-1)/1 +1=7. But that's not correct.\n\nWait, that suggests that the initial idea is incorrect. So, perhaps the minimal x_r is not simply r.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal x_r is the minimal x where the frog can reach r, and then can perform a series of jumps that allows it to reach all higher multiples of g in the residue class.\n\nWait, for residue 1, in the sample, the frog can reach 1, but to reach 6, it needs to make jumps from 1.\n\nWait, 1 +5=6, which is allowed for x>=6.\n\nSo, for residue 1, x_1 is 6, because beyond x=6, the frog can reach 6, and then 6-3=3, which is within x=7.\n\nSo, for residue 1, the minimal x is 6.\n\nThus, for x >=6, the frog can reach 1,6,3,10 (but x is 7, so 10 is beyond. So, for x=7, the reachable positions in residue 1 are 1,6,3 →3 positions.\n\nWhich is (7-1)/1 +1=7, which is more than 3. So, that suggests that the initial idea is not correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal x_r is not as straightforward as r + a or something.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Perhaps I should try to find a mathematical approach that can model the problem for all x.\n\nAn alternative idea: the reachable positions can be represented as all numbers that are in the interval [0, x] and can be written as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients.\n\nBut since the frog can subtract b, this is equivalent to allowing any integer coefficients (positive and negative), but the position must remain non-negative.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of non-negative integers k such that k = a*p - b*q, where p and q are non-negative integers, and 0 <= k <=x.\n\nBut how to count this for each x.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of such k is equal to the number of integers in [0, x] that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of counting the number of integers in [0, x] that are expressible as ax + by for non-negative integers x and y.\n\nBut I'm not aware of a direct formula for this.\n\nAnother angle: For each x, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of integers in [0, x] that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and k*a - l*b >=0.\n\nBut again, this seems challenging to model.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed by considering the equation k*a - l*b = p, where p is in [0, x].\n\nRearranging, we get k*a + l*(-b) = p.\n\nThis is a linear Diophantine equation in variables k and l.\n\nThe general solution for this equation, given that a and b are coprime, is known. But since a and b may not be coprime, perhaps we can factor out the GCD.\n\nLet g = gcd(a, b). Then, a = g*a', b = g*b', where a' and b' are coprime.\n\nThe equation becomes: g*a'*k - g*b'*l = p → a'*k - b'*l = p/g.\n\nSo, for p to be expressible, p must be divisible by g. So, p must be a multiple of g.\n\nTherefore, all reachable positions are multiples of g.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of multiples of g in [0, x] that can be expressed as a linear combination of a' and b' with non-negative coefficients.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, according to the Coin Problem, the largest unattainable number is a'*b' -a' -b'.\n\nBut wait, that's when you can only use non-negative coefficients. In our case, since the frog can subtract b, it's allowed to have negative coefficients, which means that any multiple of g can be expressed as a combination.\n\nWait, no: the frog can't make negative jumps in terms of position, but in terms of the equation, the coefficients can be negative because l can be larger than k.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of g, regardless of x, as long as x is large enough.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample where a=5, b=3, g=1. The frog can reach 0,2,5,7, etc., which are all multiples of 1.\n\nBut for x=7, the frog can reach 8 positions, which includes all multiples of 1 up to 7.\n\nWait, but 7 is not a multiple of 1, but 7 is included because it's the sum of 5 and 2.\n\nWait, no, 7 is 5 + 2, but 2 is 5 -3.\n\nWait, perhaps for x >= some value, the frog can reach all multiples of g in [0, x].\n\nSo, for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all multiples of g.\n\nWait, perhaps for x >= a + b, the frog can reach any multiple of g up to x.\n\nIf that's the case, then for x >= a + b, f(x) = (x//g) + 1, but wait, for a=5, b=3, a +b =8.\n\nWait, but in the sample, x=7 is less than 8, and f(7)=8, which is (7+1) =8, which is correct.\n\nWait, but for x=8, f(8) would be 8+1=9? Or no.\n\nWait, for x=8, the frog can reach 0,2,5,7,4,1,6,3,8, etc. Let's see:\n\nFrom 0, can reach 5.\n\nFrom 5, can reach 2 and 10 (but x=8, so 10 is beyond. So, from 5, subtract 3 to get 2.\n\nFrom 2, add 5 to get 7.\n\nFrom 7, subtract 3 to get 4.\n\nFrom 4, subtract 3 to get 1.\n\nFrom 1, add 5 to get 6.\n\nFrom 6, subtract 3 to get 3.\n\nFrom 3, add 5 to get 8.\n\nFrom 8, subtract 3 to get 5 (already there), or add 5 to get 13 (beyond x=8).\n\nSo, for x=8, the reachable positions are 0,2,5,7,4,1,6,3,8. That's 9 positions, which is 8//1 +1=9, correct.\n\nSo, for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x.\n\nSo, the minimal x beyond which f(x) equals x/g +1 is when x is >= a + b.\n\nWait, but wait: a + b may not be the correct threshold.\n\nIn the sample, a=5, b=3, a + b=8.\n\nSo for x >=8, f(x)= (x//1) +1 =x+1.\n\nBut in the sample, x=7 is less than 8, and f(7)=8, which is (7+1)=8.\n\nWait, but that's not consistent with the earlier idea.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal x is a + b - g.\n\nBecause in the sample, a=5, b=3, g=1: 5+3-1=7, which is the x where f(x)=8.\n\nSo, perhaps for x >= a + b -g, the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x.\n\nSo, the minimal x is X = a + b -g.\n\nSo, for x >=X, f(x) = (x//g) + 1.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn the sample:\n\nX=5+3-1=7.\n\nFor x=7, f(x)=8=7+1.\n\nFor x=8, f(x)=9=8+1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=5.\n\ng=1.\n\nX=4+5-1=8.\n\nFor x=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line for each integer from 0 to m. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by a distance 'a' or backward by a distance 'b'. The challenge is to efficiently compute this sum given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**:\n   - The frog's movement is governed by steps of 'a' and '-b', leading to reachable positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 'a' and 'b'.\n   - Let `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable positions must be multiples of `g`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For sufficiently large values of `x`, the frog can reach all multiples of `g` up to `x`. This threshold value is `X = a + b - g`.\n   - For `x >= X`, the number of reachable positions is `(x // g) + 1`.\n\n3. **Summing the Results**:\n   - For `x` from 0 to `min(m, X-1)`, compute the number of reachable positions individually.\n   - For `x >= X`, use the formula `(x // g) + 1` to compute the number of reachable positions and sum these values efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n    if g == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    X = a + b - g\n    if X < 0:\n        X = 0\n    sum_total = 0\n    for x in range(0, min(m, X)):\n        # Compute f(x)\n        count = 0\n        # We'll simulate the BFS up to x\n        visited = set()\n        queue = [0]\n        visited.add(0)\n        while queue:\n            pos = queue.pop(0)\n            if pos > x:\n                continue\n            next_pos_a = pos + a\n            if next_pos_a <= x and next_pos_a not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_pos_a)\n                queue.append(next_pos_a)\n            next_pos_b = pos - b\n            if next_pos_b >= 0 and next_pos_b <= x and next_pos_b not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_pos_b)\n                queue.append(next_pos_b)\n        count = len(visited)\n        sum_total += count\n    if m >= X:\n        remaining = m - X + 1\n        full = (remaining) * ((X // g) + 1)\n        sum_total += full\n    print(sum_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Read input values for `m`, `a`, and `b`.\n   - Compute the GCD `g` of `a` and `b`.\n\n2. **Threshold Calculation**:\n   - Determine the threshold `X` where beyond this point, the frog can reach all multiples of `g` up to `x`.\n\n3. **Sum Calculation**:\n   - For each `x` from 0 to `min(m, X-1)`, use a BFS approach to simulate the frog's jumps and count the reachable positions.\n   - For `x >= X`, compute the sum using the derived formula for all such `x`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle both small and large values of `m` by leveraging mathematical insights and avoiding unnecessary computations.",
