            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from one base to another, but with a twist. The number is given in base 'a', and we need to convert it into base 'b'. But the catch is that if b is 'R', then instead of a regular base conversion, we have to interpret the number as a Roman numeral, which has specific rules for its representation.\n\nHmm, right. So the input will have two lines. The first line contains a and b, where b could be R. The second line is the number c in base a. My task is to output c converted into base b, without leading zeros.\n\nLet me break down what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I need to handle two cases: when b is not R, and when it is R.\n\nCase 1: b is not R. Then, I just need to convert the given number from base a to base b.\n\nCase 2: b is R. Then, I need to treat the number as a Roman numeral and convert it into the corresponding integer, and then represent that integer in base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for values 10 and above.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when b is R, the output is the number in base R, which is a Roman numeral system. So the steps are:\n\n1. Convert the given number from base a to an integer value (in base 10).\n2. Then, represent this integer as a Roman numeral.\n3. Finally, convert that Roman numeral string into base b, treating each character as a digit in base b.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. When b is R, the output is the number represented in the Roman numeral system, which is a form of base 10 but with symbols. Or is it that the output is the same as the Roman numeral representation of the number, but considering that the base is higher than 10?\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWhen b is R, we should write the number in base b. But in this case, the base is R, which is a special numbering system used by Romans. So, for example, if a is 10 and b is R, then the number is 16 in base 10, which would be XVI in Roman numerals. Wait, but the output in the sample shows that when a=10, b=R, the output is 'V' for the number 5. Because 5 in base R is 'V'.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nSo, for the second case, the input is '16 R\\n5'. So a=10, b=R, and c is '5' in base 10. The output is 'V', which is 5 in Roman numerals. So when b is R, the number is treated as a Roman numeral and output as such.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in this case, c is 5 in base a=10, which is 5 in decimal. So when b is R, we have to output 5 in Roman numerals, which is 'V'.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- When b is R, c is treated as a Roman numeral, converted to an integer, and then represented in base b, using the standard numeral system.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nNo, the problem statement says that each door's fourth part is empty because Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks. So when you open a door, you have to write the number in base a, then convert it to base b. But if b is R, then writing it in base R is using Roman numerals.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Take the number c in base a, convert it to base 10 (as an integer N).\n\n- If b is not R, then convert N to base b, and output the result as a string without leading zeros.\n\n- If b is R, then treat N as a Roman numeral (which requires that N is less than or equal to 300010, but the problem says that the input ensures that the number is within certain limits), then convert that Roman numeral to base b, which is also the Roman numeral system.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when b is R, the output is the Roman numeral representation of N. Because in the sample, when c is '5' in base 10 and b is R, the output is 'V', which is the Roman numeral for 5.\n\nWait, yes. So when b is R, the output is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another. The challenge arises when the target base is 'R', which represents a Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the given number from its initial base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting that integer into the target base, which could be either a standard base or a Roman numeral system.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, `a` and `b`, where `a` is the source base and `b` can be either a standard base or 'R'. The second line contains a non-negative integer `c` in base `a`.\n\n2. **Convert to Decimal**: If the target base `b` is not 'R', we convert the number `c` from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer. If `b` is 'R', we treat `c` as a Roman numeral and convert it to an integer.\n\n3. **Convert to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base is 'R' or a standard base:\n   - If `b` is a standard base, convert the decimal integer to this base.\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Ensure the result is printed without leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for i, (v, t) in enumerate(val):\n        while num >= v:\n            res.append(t)\n            num -= v\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef roman_to_int(s):\n    val = [\n        1000, 900, 500, 400,\n        100, 90, 50, 40,\n        10, 9, 5, 4,\n        1\n    ]\n    res = 0\n    i = 0\n    for c in s.upper():\n        while i < len(val) and val[i] < int(c):\n            i += 1\n        if i < len(val):\n            res += val[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            res += int(c)\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    a_b = input[0].strip().split()\n    a = int(a_b[0])\n    b = a_b[1] if len(a_b) > 1 else 'R'\n    c_str = input[1].strip()\n\n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    def to_decimal(s, base):\n        num = 0\n        for ch in s:\n            num = num * base + int(ch)\n        return num\n\n    decimal = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\n    if b != 'R':\n        # Convert decimal to base b\n        def decimal_to_base(n, base):\n            if n == 0:\n                return '0'\n            digits = []\n            while n > 0:\n                digits.append(str(n % base))\n                n = n // base\n            return ''.join(reversed(digits)) if digits else '0'\n        result = decimal_to_base(decimal, int(b))\n    else:\n        # Convert decimal to Roman numeral\n        result = int_to_roman(decimal)\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the source base `a`, target base `b`, and the number `c`.\n\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` converts the string representation of `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer.\n\n3. **Handling Target Base**:\n   - For standard bases, the function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal integer to the target base.\n   - For Roman numerals, the function `int_to_roman` converts the decimal integer into a Roman numeral string.\n\n4. **Output**: The result is printed without leading zeros, ensuring the correct format as required by the problem statement.",
