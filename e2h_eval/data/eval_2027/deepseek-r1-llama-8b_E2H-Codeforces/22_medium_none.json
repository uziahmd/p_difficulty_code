After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students in a group. Let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered the best in a subject if no other student has a higher mark for that subject. And a student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think I should process each subject separately. For each subject, I need to determine which student(s) have the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in any subject.\n\nWait, but the students' marks are given as strings, right? Each row is a string of m characters, each being 1-9. So, for each subject j, I can collect all the marks from all students for that j-th position.\n\nFor example, let's say for subject j, the marks are [5, 3, 8]. The maximum is 8, so the third student is the best in subject j.\n\nSo, for each subject, I need to find the maximum mark and which student(s) have that mark. But wait, since each subject is handled independently, for each subject, there might be multiple students with the same max. But only one of them can be the 'best'? Or does the problem consider all students who have the maximum as best?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"a student the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" Oh right, so if two students have the same maximum, then both are best in that subject. Because neither has a higher mark than the other.\n\nSo, for each subject, the students who have the maximum mark are the best in that subject.\n\nBut for a student to be successful, they need to be best in at least one subject. So, for each student, I need to check across all subjects whether they are among the best in any of them.\n\nSo, the steps I think are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. For each of the n students, read their m marks.\n3. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), collect all the marks from all students for that j.\n4. For each subject j, find the maximum mark.\n5. For each subject j, note down all the students who have this maximum mark.\n6. For each student, check if they are in any of the sets of best students for any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about data structures. Maybe for each subject j, store a set of student indices (like 0-based) who are best in j.\n\nThen, for each student, iterate through all subjects and see if they are in any of these sets.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Read n, m.\n- Read each of the next n lines as a string.\n- For each subject j (0..m-1):\n   - Collect the marks from each student's j-th character.\n   - Convert to integers.\n   - Find the maximum value in this list.\n   - Collect all students (indices) where their mark equals the maximum.\n   - Store this as a set in a list per subject.\n- Then, for each student, check if they are present in any of the sets for any subject.\n- Count how many such students.\n\nWait, but storing the sets for each subject is necessary because we need to quickly check for each student if they are a best in any subject.\n\nSo, perhaps create a list called 'best_students', where best_students[j] is a set of student indices who are best in subject j.\n\nOnce that's done, for each student i in 0..n-1, check if i is in any of the sets in best_students.\n\nIf yes, increment the count.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo, students are:\nStudent 0: 2 2 3\nStudent 1: 2 3 2\nStudent 2: 1 1 2\n\nSubjects:\n\nSubject 0:\nMarks are [2,2,1]. Max is 2. So students 0 and 1 are best.\n\nSubject 1:\nMarks are [2,3,1]. Max is 3. Only student 1.\n\nSubject 2:\nMarks are [3,2,2]. Max is 3. Only student 0.\n\nSo, the best students are:\nsubject 0: {0,1}\nsubject 1: {1}\nsubject 2: {0}\n\nNow, check each student:\n\nStudent 0: in subject 0 and subject 2. So yes.\n\nStudent 1: in subject 0 and 1. So yes.\n\nStudent 2: not in any. So no.\n\nThus, output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n3 5\n91728\n11828\n11111\n\nEach line is 5 characters.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStudents are:\n0: 9 1 7 2 8\n1: 1 1 8 2 8\n2: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSubjects:\n\nSubject 0: 9,1,1. Max is 9, only student 0.\n\nSubject 1: 1,1,1. All same, so all are best.\n\nSubject 2:7,8,1. Max is 8, student 1.\n\nSubject3:2,2,1. Max is 2, students 0 and 1.\n\nSubject4:8,8,1. Max is 8, students 0 and 1.\n\nSo for each subject:\n\nsubject0: {0}\nsubject1: {0,1,2}\nsubject2: {1}\nsubject3: {0,1}\nsubject4: {0,1}\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent 0: in subject0, subject1, subject3, subject4. So yes.\n\nStudent1: in subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4. So yes.\n\nStudent2: in subject1. So yes.\n\nThus, all 3 are successful.\n\nSo the output is 3.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines. Each line is a string of m characters.\n\nThen, for each subject j in 0 to m-1:\n\nCollect the j-th character of each student's string, convert to integer.\n\nFind the maximum, then collect all students whose j-th mark is equal to the maximum.\n\nStore these in a list of sets, like best_in_subject[j] is a set containing the student indices.\n\nOnce that's done, for each student i in 0 to n-1:\n\nCheck if i is in any of best_in_subject[j] for any j.\n\nCount the total.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    students.append(s)\n\nbest_in_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    # collect all j-th marks\n    marks = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = int(students[i][j])\n        marks.append(mark)\n    # find max\n    max_mark = max(marks)\n    # collect all students with max_mark\n    current_best = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        if int(students[i][j]) == max_mark:\n            current_best.add(i)\n    best_in_subject.append(current_best)\n\n# Now, count the successful students\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    found = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if i in best_in_subject[j]:\n            found = True\n            break\n    if found:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the input is given as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', ...], but when reading from stdin, the first line is n and m, and then n lines follow. So the code as written will correctly read the inputs.\n\nTesting the code with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nProcessing:\n\nstudents = ['223', '232', '112']\n\nbest_in_subject:\n\nj=0:\nmarks = [2,2,1] → max 2. Students 0 and 1.\n\nj=1:\nmarks = [2,3,1] → max 3. Only student 1.\n\nj=2:\nmarks = [3,2,2] → max 3. Student 0.\n\nSo best_in_subject is:\n\n[ {0,1}, {1}, {0} ]\n\nThen, for each student i:\n\ni=0: present in j=0 and j=2 → yes.\n\ni=1: present in j=0, j=1 → yes.\n\ni=2: not present in any → no.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\n3 5\n91728 → '9','1','7','2','8'\n11828 → '1','1','8','2','8'\n11111 → '1','1','1','1','1'\n\nProcessing each j:\n\nj=0: marks are 9,1,1 → max 9. Only student 0.\n\nj=1: marks 1,1,1 → all are max. So students 0,1,2.\n\nj=2: marks 7,8,1 → max 8. Only 1.\n\nj=3: 2,2,1 → max 2. 0 and 1.\n\nj=4: 8,8,1 → max 8. 0 and 1.\n\nSo best_in_subject has sets:\n\n[ {0}, {0,1,2}, {1}, {0,1}, {0,1} ]\n\nSo for each i:\n\ni=0: in j=0, j=1, j=3, j=4 → yes.\n\ni=1: in j=1, j=2, j=3, j=4 → yes.\n\ni=2: in j=1 → yes.\n\nSo count is 3.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases correctly.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=1, m=1: the single student is always successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudent 0: 99\nStudent 1: 99\n\nIn both subjects, both students are best. So both are successful.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\nstudent0: 11\nstudent1: 22\n\nThen, for each subject:\n\nsubject0: 1 and 2 → max 2 → student1.\n\nsubject1: 1 and 2 → max 2 → student1.\n\nSo student0 is not best in any, student1 is best in both.\n\nSo output is 1.\n\nAnother case: all students share the same mark in all subjects.\n\nLike n=4, m=2:\n\nAll students have 55.\n\nThen, in each subject, all students are best. So all 4 are successful.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about empty input? But according to constraints, n and m are >=1.\n\nWhat about m=0? No, constraints say m>=1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
