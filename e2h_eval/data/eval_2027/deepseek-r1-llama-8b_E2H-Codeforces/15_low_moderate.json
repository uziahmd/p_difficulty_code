They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find all winning integers x such that there's a permutation p of 1 to 2^n where the team with skill x becomes the champion. The tournament structure is a knockout style with each phase determining which teams move on based on the given string s.\n\nFirst, let me understand the tournament structure and how the phases work. The tournament has n phases. In phase i (starting from 0?), the number of games is 2^{n-i}, right? Wait, no. Wait, the first phase has 2^{n-1} games because it's split into pairs. Then each next phase reduces the number of teams by half, so phase i has 2^{n - i -1} games. But the string s is of length n, so for each phase i from 0 to n-1, s[i] determines whether higher or lower skill wins in that phase.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: s_i corresponds to the i-th phase, which has 2^{n-i} games. Because the first phase has 2^{n-1} games, which is when i=0, 2^{3-0} = 8 for n=3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nWait, for example, when n=3, the string s is length 3. Each character corresponds to a phase. The first phase (i=0) has 4 games (since 2^(3-0-1) is 4?), wait no. Let me think again.\n\nThe tournament has 2^n teams. It's a knockout, so each game eliminates one team. The total number of games is 2^n -1. The phases are as follows:\n\n- Phase 1: 2^{n-1} games (since it's the first round, pairing all teams)\n- Phase 2: 2^{n-2} games\n- ...\n- Phase k: 2^{n-k} games, until the last phase which has 1 game.\n\nSo for the string s of length n, each character s[i] corresponds to phase i+1. So phase 0 is the first phase with 2^{n-1} games, phase 1 is next, etc., up to phase n-1 which has 1 game.\n\nIn each phase i (0-based), the number of games is 2^{(n-1 -i)}, since for the first phase, i=0, it's 2^{n-1} games.\n\nNow, for each phase i, depending on s[i], the outcome is determined. If s[i] is '0', then in each match, the lower-skilled team wins. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nI need to model the tournament and determine the possible winners x such that for some permutation p, the champion is x.\n\nHmm. So, the approach is to find all x where there exists a permutation p such that x is the winner of the tournament under the given s.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming or memoization, tracking the possible winners at each stage.\n\nLet me think about how the tournament progresses. At each phase, the matches are grouped into blocks. For example, phase 0 has 2^{n-1} games, which are grouped into 2^{n-1 - (i)} groups, each group being two consecutive teams.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in phase i, the number of games is G = 2^{(n-1 - i)}. So the number of groups is G / 2 = 2^{(n-1 -i -1)} } = 2^{n-2 -i}.\n\nBut how are the teams arranged into these groups? For phase i, the groups are formed by taking consecutive pairs of teams from the current list.\n\nWait, the way the problem describes it is that in the second phase, after the first phase, the winners are ordered as the first game is between the winners of the first pair, the next is between the winners of the second pair, etc.\n\nSo for phase i, the groupings are determined by the previous phase's winners.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a game, and the leaves are the initial matches, and each internal node is the result of a game. The root is the final game that determines the champion.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the process in terms of the required conditions for each position in the permutation.\n\nWait, another idea: each position in the permutation must satisfy certain constraints based on the phases.\n\nFor a team x to be the champion, it must win all its matches in every phase. So for each phase, x must be in a certain subset of the bracket such that it can reach the final.\n\nWait, but the bracket structure depends on",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all possible winning integers x such that there exists a permutation of the teams where x becomes the champion of the tournament. The tournament structure and outcomes are defined by the given string s, which dictates whether higher or lower-skilled teams win in each phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament is a knockout style with n phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one champion remains. The string s determines the outcome of each phase: '0' means the lower-skilled team wins, and '1' means the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n2. **Permutation and Bracket Structure**: The key insight is that each phase groups teams into pairs, and the winners of each pair proceed to the next phase. The structure of these groupings can be thought of as a binary tree where each node represents a game.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use dynamic programming (DP) to track possible winners at each stage. For each position in the permutation, we determine if it can reach the final round based on the current phase's outcome rules.\n\n4. **Backtracking with Bitmasking**: We use a bitmask to represent the set of possible winners at each stage. This helps efficiently track and update possible winners as we simulate each phase of the tournament.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Each state is a mask representing the possible winners up to the current phase\n    # The mask has 2^(n) bits, each bit representing whether a team is still possible to win\n    # We'll process phases from the last to the first, since each phase depends on the next\n    # The mask for phase i is built based on the mask of phase i+1\n    # We start from the final phase (phase n-1, which has 1 game) and move backward\n\n    # We'll represent the possible winners as a list of sets or bitmasks\n    # Let's create a DP array where dp[i] is a set of possible winners after phase i\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[n] = (1 << (2**n - 1))  # Only the last team can be the winner initially\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        games = 2 ** (n - i - 1)\n        group_size = 2 ** (i)\n        current_mask = dp[i+1]\n        # For each possible winner in the next phase, determine who could have beaten whom\n        # We need to consider all possible groupings in this phase\n        # Each winner in the next phase must have come from a specific group in the current phase\n        # The grouping is in chunks of group_size, so each group of size group_size is a match\n        # So, for each possible winner in the next phase, find all possible predecessors in this phase\n        new_mask = 0\n        for winner in range(2**n):\n            if (current_mask >> winner) & 1:\n                # Determine which group this winner could have come from\n                # The group is determined by the highest bit set in the mask\n                # For example, if the current_mask is in the form 0b101000..., the highest set bit is at position 9, so group starts at 8\n                group = (winner // group_size) * group_size\n                # Now, within this group, determine which two teams were matched\n                # The group has group_size/2 matches, each producing one winner\n                # To find possible predecessors, we need to check all possible ways the winner could have been the result of a match in this group\n                # For example, if the winner is in a group of 4 (group_size=4), then the possible predecessors are in positions 0-3\n                # For each possible predecessor in this group, determine if they could have won against someone else in the same group\n                # For each possible way, if the predecessor's opponent is not in the next phase's winners, it's possible\n                # This is getting complicated, perhaps using a helper function would help\n                # Alternatively, for each possible group, generate all possible subsets of winners that could have come from this group\n                # For each possible subset, determine the possible winners based on the current phase's rules\n                # But this might be too slow for n=18\n                # Alternative approach: for each possible winner in the next phase, find all possible predecessors in the current phase\n                # Predecessors are those that could have beaten someone else in their group to reach the next phase\n                # So for each possible group, the current winner must have come from that group, and within that group, they must have beaten someone else\n                # So for the current group, the possible winners are those who are in the next phase's winners and could have beaten someone in their group\n                # For each such winner, add them to the new_mask\n                # However, this is computationally intensive, but for n=18, it's manageable with memoization and efficient code\n                # Another idea is to represent the possible winners as a bitmask and for each phase, compute the new bitmask based on the current phase's rules\n                # For each group in the current phase, determine which teams could have won based on the phase's rule and the next phase's winners\n                # This seems like a better approach\n                # So, for each group in the current phase, which consists of 2^(n-i-1) teams, the group is split into 2^(i) matches, each producing one winner\n                # For each possible winner in the next phase, we need to see if they could have come from this group, and based on the phase's rule, determine their possible predecessors\n                # This is getting a bit too abstract;
