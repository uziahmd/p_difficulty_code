Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases. Each base must have exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base. So, it's a perfect matching between R rebels and B bases.\n\nBut there's an additional condition: the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. The paths are straight lines in the galaxy plane (2D). So, no two paths can cross each other.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? It feels like a graph problem where edges represent possible assignments, but with the constraint on non-intersecting paths.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. **Input Reading**: Read R and B. Then read R spaceship coordinates, then B base coordinates.\n2. **Check for Perfect Matching**: First, check if R equals B because otherwise, a perfect matching isn't possible. If not, immediately output 'No'.\n3. **Generate All Possible Assignments**: For all possible ways to assign R ships to B bases, ensuring each ship is assigned to exactly one base and vice versa. This is like finding all permutations of size min(R,B), but since R and B can be up to 10, that's manageable (10! is around 3.6 million, which is acceptable for Python).\n4. **Check Path Intersection for Each Assignment**: For each permutation (each possible assignment), check if any two paths cross. If none cross, return 'Yes'.\n\nWait, but how to check if two line segments intersect? Oh right, that's a classic computational geometry problem. So I need a function that takes two line segments and returns True if they intersect, including at the endpoints.\n\nSo first, I need to implement that function. How?\n\nI remember that two line segments AB and CD intersect if the points A and B are on opposite sides of CD, and C and D are on opposite sides of AB. Or if any point lies on the other segment.\n\nSo the steps for the function:\n\n- Check if any of the four points are colinear and lie on the other segment. Like, if point A is on CD, or B is on CD, etc.\n- Otherwise, compute the orientation of each point with respect to the other line. If the orientations are such that they form a crossing, then the segments intersect.\n\nAlternatively, use the cross product method to determine the relative positions.\n\nWait, maybe using the standard line segment intersection algorithm would work here. Let me outline it.\n\nThe function will take two line segments, each defined by two points. For each segment, check if the other segment's endpoints lie on opposite sides (using the cross product). Also, check if any of the endpoints lie on the other segment.\n\nSo, implementing this correctly is crucial. I'll have to make sure that all edge cases are handled, like when a point is exactly on the other segment's line.\n\nOnce I have that function, for each possible assignment permutation, I can generate the pairs (ship to base) and then for each pair, create the line segments. Then, for all pairs of these line segments, check if any intersect.\n\nIf any assignment has all line segments non-intersecting, then the answer is 'Yes'. Otherwise, after checking all possible assignments, output 'No'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read input.\n- Check if R != B; if so, output 'No'.\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of B bases for R ships (but wait, if R=B, then it's a permutation of B elements taken R at a time, which is B! possibilities. Since B is up to 10, that's 3.6 million again, which is manageable).\n- For each permutation:\n   - Assign each ship to a base based on the permutation.\n   - Create a list of line segments: each segment connects a ship to its base.\n   - For each pair of segments in this list, check if they intersect.\n   - If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid. Skip to the next permutation.\n   - If no intersections found for all pairs, then this permutation is valid. So output 'Yes'.\n- After checking all permutations, if none worked, output 'No'.\n\nNow, let's think about the details.\n\nFirst, generating all possible assignments: since we need to match R ships to B bases, but R and B can be equal (since it's a perfect matching). Wait, no: wait, the problem says R and B can be different, but the assignment is only possible if R = B. Because each base must have exactly one guardian, and each spaceship must have exactly one base. So, if R != B, it's impossible, and we can directly output 'No'.\n\nSo, step 1: check if R != B. If so, output 'No' and done.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, R=3 and B=3, so it's possible.\n\nNext, for each permutation of the bases, assign each ship to a base in that order. But wait, wait: the permutation represents the order in which we assign the ships. For example, the first ship in the list is assigned to the first base in the permutation, the second ship to the second, etc. So, the permutation is a list where the i-th position is the base index assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a bijection. For each permutation, the i-th element (0-based or 1-based?) determines which base is assigned to which ship.\n\nWait, for R=3 and B=3, each permutation is a list of 3 elements, each corresponding to the base index (like 0,1,2). So the i-th ship (0-based) is assigned to the perm[i] base.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to represent the bases as a list, and for each permutation, the i-th element is the index of the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nSo, for each permutation p of range(B), ship 0 goes to p[0], ship 1 to p[1], etc.\n\nWait, but if B is 3 and R is 3, each permutation is a rearrangement of 0..B-1. So each permutation is a possible way to assign all ships to bases, with each base being used exactly once.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each permutation, generate the list of line segments: for each i in 0..R-1, the segment connects ship i to base p[i].\n\nThen, for each pair of segments (s1, s2), check if they intersect.\n\nBut wait, the segments are from ships to bases. So, the segments are from ship positions to base positions.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we have R segments. We need to check all possible pairs of these segments for intersection.\n\nIf any pair of segments intersects, this permutation is invalid, and we proceed to the next.\n\nOtherwise, if all pairs are non-intersecting, then this permutation is a valid solution, and we can output 'Yes'.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each permutation p in permutations(range(B)):\n    create the list of segments\n    for each pair of segments in this list:\n        if segments a and b intersect:\n            mark permutation as invalid, break and try next permutation\n    if permutation is valid:\n        output 'Yes' and terminate\n\nIf all permutations are tried and none are valid, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the key parts are:\n\n- Implementing the line segment intersection correctly.\n- Generating all permutations efficiently.\n\nLet's think about the line segment intersection function.\n\nFunction signature: segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2) -> bool\n\nWhere a1, a2 are endpoints of segment A, and similarly for b1, b2.\n\nWe need to determine whether the two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nImplementing this function accurately is critical.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nOne approach is to use the cross product method.\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n1. The points are colinear and overlap (i.e., one segment lies on the other, and their bounding boxes overlap).\n\nOR\n\n2. The segments cross each other, meaning that the endpoints are on opposite sides of each other.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\na) Compute the orientation of various points to determine if the segments cross.\n\nb) Handle the case where a point lies on the other segment.\n\nLet me recall the standard algorithm.\n\nHere's a method I remember:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- The general case: the orientations of (A, B, C), (A, B, D), (C, D, A), (C, D, B) are such that one is clockwise and the other counter-clockwise, and vice versa. Or, some other condition indicating crossing.\n\nOr, alternatively, using the following conditions:\n\nThe segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and the points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nOR\n\n- One of the segments' endpoints lies on the other segment.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because if one endpoint is on the other segment, but the other points are on the same side, it might not count as an intersection.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if either:\n\n1. One of the endpoints of CD lies on AB, and the other is not on AB, and AB and CD are not collinear.\n\nOR\n\n2. The two segments cross each other, i.e., their endpoints are on opposite sides of each other.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to implement the following steps:\n\n1. Check if any of the endpoints of CD lie on AB, or any of the endpoints of AB lie on CD. If yes, return True.\n\n2. Else, check the orientation of the four points. If the segments cross each other, return True.\n\nOtherwise, return False.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nI think the code can be structured as follows:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # Check if a1a2 and b1b2 intersect or touch.\n\n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        # Compute the cross product of (B - A) and (C - A)\n        return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\n    # Check if any point is on the other segment.\n    # Check for a1 on b1b2\n    def on_segment(p, q, r):\n        # Check if q lies on pr\n        if min(p[0], r[0]) <= q[0] <= max(p[0], r[0]) and min(p[1], r[1]) <= q[1] <= max(p[1], r[1]):\n            # Now check if the area is zero (collinear)\n            area = abs(ccw(p, r, q)) \n            if area < 1e-9:  # considering floating point precision\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    if on_segment(a1, b1, b2) or on_segment(a2, b1, b2) or on_segment(b1, a1, a2) or on_segment(b2, a1, a2):\n        return True\n\n    # Now check if the segments cross each other.\n    # Compute the orientations.\n    o1 = ccw(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = ccw(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = ccw(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = ccw(b1, b2, a2)\n\n    # General case: the segments intersect.\n    if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: colinear and overlapping, but not the same segment.\n    # But since we checked on_segment earlier, this should have been caught.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what about when the two segments are colinear and overlapping? For example, both are on the same line and their bounding boxes overlap. In that case, the on_segment function should have detected that one point is on the other segment, right?\n\nWait, no. Because if the segments are colinear and overlapping, but none of the endpoints lie on each other's segments, then the on_segment function won't detect it. For example, imagine two overlapping line segments on the same line, but their endpoints don't lie on each other's segments. Like, [0,0] to [2,0], and [1,0] to [3,0]. The first segment's endpoints are (0,0) and (2,0), the second's are (1,0) and (3,0). Neither endpoint of the second is on the first, but the segments overlap. So, in this case, our function would miss this and return false, even though the segments actually do overlap.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that no two paths (segments) intersect. So in this case, the segments overlap but don't cross, but they are colinear and overlapping. So, according to the problem statement, does this count as an intersection?\n\nThe note in the problem says that the paths should not intersect. So, if two line segments are colinear and overlapping, their paths do intersect, right? Because any point along the overlapping part is covered by both segments.\n\nTherefore, our function needs to consider this case as an intersection.\n\nSo, the current function may not handle this case. So, I need to adjust the function.\n\nHmm, how to handle this.\n\nAlternative approach: check if the two segments are collinear and their projections on the x and y axes overlap.\n\nBut that can be tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incomplete. So, perhaps I should change the function to include the case where the two segments are collinear and overlapping, but not coinciding.\n\nSo, how to detect that.\n\nLet me think: after checking the on_segment function, perhaps I should check whether the two segments are collinear and their projections on x and y axes overlap, but not entirely contain each other.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute the minimal axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) for each segment and see if they overlap.\n\nBut that doesn't capture the case where one segment is entirely within another without overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the better way is to check if the two segments are collinear and their bounding boxes overlap.\n\nWait, let me think: if the two segments are collinear, then to determine if they overlap (not just intersect at a point), we can check if their projections on the x and y axes overlap.\n\nSo, for collinear segments:\n\nCompute the projection on x-axis: the min and max for each segment.\n\nIf their x projections overlap, and the y projections overlap, then the segments overlap.\n\nBut if one segment is entirely contained within another, that also counts as overlapping.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Check if any of the endpoints lie on the other segment. If yes, return True.\n\n2. Else, check if the two segments are collinear.\n\n   a. If not collinear, check if their lines cross each other (as before). If so, return True.\n\n   b. If collinear, check if their projections on x and y axes overlap. If so, return True.\n\nSo, modifying the function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # Check if any point is on the other segment.\n    if on_segment(a1, a2, b1) or on_segment(a1, a2, b2) or on_segment(b1, a2, a1) or on_segment(b2, a2, a1):\n        return True\n\n    # Check if the segments are collinear.\n    def are_collinear(p1, p2, p3, p4):\n        # Check if all four points are collinear.\n        # Check if the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors p1p2 and p3p4 is zero.\n        area = ccw(p1, p2, p3) \n        if area == 0:\n            # Now check if p4 is on the line.\n            # Since we already checked on_segment, perhaps it's sufficient to return True if collinear.\n            # But wait, maybe the two segments are collinear but don't overlap.\n            # So, after checking for on_segment, we need to check if the segments project onto x and y axes and overlap.\n            # So, perhaps this function isn't enough.\n            pass\n\n    # So, perhaps a better way is to compute the direction of the line for both segments and see if they are the same.\n\n    # Compute direction vectors.\n    dx1 = a2[0] - a1[0]\n    dy1 = a2[1] - a1[1]\n    dx2 = b2[0] - b1[0]\n    dy2 = b2[1] - b1[1]\n\n    # Check if the segments are collinear.\n    if dx1 * dy2 == dx2 * dy1:\n        # Collinear.\n        # Now check if their projections on x and y axes overlap.\n        # For x-axis projection:\n        # Find the min and max of each segment's x-coordinates.\n        min_x1 = min(a1[0], a2[0])\n        max_x1 = max(a1[0], a2[0])\n        min_x2 = min(b1[0], b2[0])\n        max_x2 = max(b1[0], b2[0])\n        if (max_x1 < min_x2) or (max_x2 < min_x1):\n            # No overlap on x-axis.\n            return False\n\n        # For y-axis projection:\n        min_y1 = min(a1[1], a2[1])\n        max_y1 = max(a1[1], a2[1])\n        min_y2 = min(b1[1], b2[1])\n        max_y2 = max(b1[1], b2[1])\n        if (max_y1 < min_y2) or (max_y2 < min_y1):\n            # No overlap on y-axis.\n            return False\n\n        # If both projections overlap, then the segments are collinear and overlapping.\n        return True\n    else:\n        # Not collinear, check if lines cross.\n        # Use the earlier method.\n        o1 = ccw(a1, a2, b1)\n        o2 = ccw(a1, a2, b2)\n        o3 = ccw(b1, b2, a1)\n        o4 = ccw(b1, b2, a2)\n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\nWait, but this approach may have issues. Let me test it with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nSegment 1: (0,0) to (2,0)\nSegment 2: (1,0) to (3,0)\n\nThese segments are collinear and overlapping.\n\nIn the function, dx1=2, dy1=0. dx2=2, dy2=0. So dx1*dy2=0, dx2*dy1=0. So condition holds.\n\nx projections: min_x1=0, max_x1=2. min_x2=1, max_x2=3. 0 < 1 <= 2 <3. So x projections overlap.\n\ny projections: min_y1=0, max_y1=0. min_y2=0, max_y2=0. So y projections overlap.\n\nThus, function returns True.\n\nAnother example: two segments that are parallel but not overlapping.\n\nSegment 1: (0,0) to (1,0)\nSegment 2: (2,0) to (3,0)\n\ndx1=1, dy1=0. dx2=1, dy2=0. So collinear.\n\nx projections: 0-1 vs 2-3. No overlap. So function returns False.\n\nAnother test case: two segments that cross each other at a point not an endpoint.\n\nSegment 1: (0,0) to (2,2)\nSegment 2: (1,1) to (3,3)\n\nThey cross at (1,1), but in our function, the on_segment function would not catch it because the endpoints are not on each other's segments. So the function proceeds to check if the lines cross.\n\nCompute o1 = ccw( (0,0), (2,2), (1,1) ). The cross product is (2-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(1-0) = 2*1 - 2*1 = 0. So o1 is 0.\n\nSimilarly, o2 would also be 0, since (3,3) is on the same line.\n\nSo, o1 * o2 is 0. So the condition (o1 * o2 < 0) is not satisfied. Thus, function returns False, but in reality, the segments cross at (1,1). So this is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait: in this case, the segments cross at (1,1), which is an internal point of both segments. So, according to the problem statement, this would be considered an intersection, thus making the assignment invalid.\n\nSo, the function as designed would miss this case, leading to incorrect results.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nSo, the function needs to detect this case.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after checking on_segment, it proceeds to check for line intersection. But in this example, the line segments cross, but none of the endpoints lie on the other segment.\n\nSo, the function returns False, but it should return True.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nBecause the function's condition for line intersection is (o1 * o2 <0) and (o3 * o4 <0). In this case, o1 and o2 are zero, so their product is zero, which is not less than zero. Hence, the condition is not satisfied.\n\nThus, the function misses this case.\n\nThis indicates that the function is incorrect.\n\nSo, how to handle this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute whether the segments straddle each other, regardless of whether the endpoints are on the lines.\n\nThe standard way to check for line segment intersection is to compute the orientation of each point relative to the other line.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should be rewritten to correctly handle this.\n\nAnother approach is to refer to standard computational geometry algorithms.\n\nUpon checking, the correct way is to compute the orientations and then see if the segments cross or are collinear and overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- AB and CD are not collinear, and the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different.\n\nOR\n\n- Either of the following is true:\n\n   a) One of the endpoints of CD lies on AB, and the other is not on AB, and AB and CD are not collinear.\n\n   b) AB and CD are collinear and their projections on x and y axes overlap.\n\nSo, the function can be restructured to handle all these cases.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the following approach:\n\nThe segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\nEither:\n\n- There exists a point E on AB that lies on CD.\n\nOR\n\n- There exists a point F on CD that lies on AB.\n\nOR\n\n- The two lines cross each other (i.e., the orientation tests indicate that).\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps, instead of trying to write it all, find a reliable implementation.\n\nLooking up, I find that the standard approach involves checking the general case and the special cases.\n\nHere's a corrected version:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # Check if a1a2 and b1b2 intersect, including endpoints.\n\n    # Helper function to compute the cross product.\n    def cross(o, a, b):\n        return (a[0] - o[0])*(b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1])*(b[0] - o[0])\n\n    # Check if any point is on the other segment.\n    def on_segment(p, q, r):\n        # Check if q is on pr.\n        if min(p[0], r[0]) <= q[0] <= max(p[0], r[0]) and min(p[1], r[1]) <= q[1] <= max(p[1], r[1]):\n            # Check if the area is zero (collinear)\n            return cross(p, r, q) == 0\n        return False\n\n    if on_segment(a1, b1, a2) or on_segment(a1, b2, a2) or on_segment(b1, a1, b2) or on_segment(b2, a1, b2):\n        return True\n\n    # Check if the segments are collinear.\n    # Compute direction vectors.\n    ab_dx = a2[0] - a1[0]\n    ab_dy = a2[1] - a1[1]\n    bc_dx = b2[0] - b1[0]\n    bc_dy = b2[1] - b1[1]\n\n    if ab_dx * bc_dy == ab_dy * bc_dx:\n        # Collinear.\n        # Now check if their projections on x and y axes overlap.\n        # Project to x and y.\n        min_x1, max_x1 = sorted([a1[0], a2[0]])\n        min_x2, max_x2 = sorted([b1[0], b2[0]])\n        if max_x1 < min_x2 or max_x2 < min_x1:\n            return False\n\n        min_y1, max_y1 = sorted([a1[1], a2[1]])\n        min_y2, max_y2 = sorted([b1[1], b2[1]])\n        if max_y1 < min_y2 or max_y2 < min_y1:\n            return False\n\n        return True\n    else:\n        # Not collinear. Check if lines cross.\n        # Compute orientations.\n        o1 = cross(a1, a2, b1)\n        o2 = cross(a1, a2, b2)\n        o3 = cross(b1, b2, a1)\n        o4 = cross(b1, b2, a2)\n\n        # General case: segments cross.\n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True\n\n        # Special case: colinear, but already handled above.\n\n        return False\n\nWait, but in the case where two segments are collinear and overlapping, the function returns True, which is correct.\n\nIn the earlier example where segments cross at a point that's not an endpoint, the function would return True because the lines cross.\n\nWait, let's test that example.\n\nSegment AB: (0,0) to (2,2)\nSegment CD: (1,1) to (3,3)\n\nab_dx = 2, ab_dy = 2.\nbc_dx = 2, bc_dy = 2.\n\nSo, ab_dx * bc_dy = 2*2=4, ab_dy * bc_dx=2*2=4 → equal, so collinear.\n\nCheck x projections: AB's x is 0-2, CD's x is 1-3. Overlap on x.\n\nCheck y projections: AB's y is 0-2, CD's y is 1-3. Overlap on y.\n\nThus, function returns True.\n\nAnother example: AB is (0,0) to (2,0), CD is (1,1) to (3,1). These are parallel and not overlapping.\n\nab_dx=2, ab_dy=0.\nbc_dx=2, bc_dy=0.\n\nCollinear.\n\nX projections: 0-2 vs 1-3. Overlap.\n\nY projections: 0-0 vs 1-1. Do not overlap.\n\nThus, function returns False.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: AB is (0,0) to (2,0), CD is (1,0) to (3,0). They are collinear and overlapping. Function returns True.\n\nAnother case: AB is (0,0) to (2,2), CD is (1,1) to (1,1). So CD is a single point. Then, in on_segment, CD's endpoint is (1,1), which is on AB. So function returns True.\n\nAnother case: AB is (0,0) to (2,2), CD is (3,3) to (4,4). Are they collinear? Yes.\n\nCheck x projections: AB 0-2, CD 3-4. No overlap. So function returns False.\n\nAnother case: AB is (0,0) to (0,2), CD is (0,1) to (0,3). On y-axis, overlapping. Function returns True.\n\nSo, this function seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the function should now correctly identify all cases of intersecting or overlapping segments.\n\nGreat.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nNow, the next step is to generate all possible permutations of B bases, and for each, create the segments between the R ships and their assigned bases, and check if any pair of segments intersect.\n\nIn Python, for the permutations, I can use itertools.permutations.\n\nBut wait, since R and B can be up to 10, and R can be 10, B can be 10, 10! is 3,628,800. Which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n\nRead R ship coordinates into a list.\n\nRead B base coordinates into a list.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases.\n\nFor each permutation p in permutations:\n\n   create a list of segments: for each i in 0..R-1, segment is (ships[i], bases[p[i]]).\n\n   for each pair of segments (s1, s2) in this list:\n\n       if segments_intersect(s1[0], s1[1], s2[0], s2[1]) is True:\n\n           mark this permutation as invalid, break and continue to next permutation.\n\n   if permutation is valid (no intersecting segments):\n\n       output 'Yes' and exit.\n\nIf after all permutations, none are valid, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this correctly.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is over the B bases. So, for each permutation, the i-th ship is matched to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation is a tuple of length B, each element is the index of a base. So, for each i, the i-th ship is assigned to the p[i]-th base.\n\nWait, but the permutation is generated as a tuple of indices. So, for example, if B=3 and the permutation is (1,2,0), then:\n\nship 0 → base 1,\n\nship 1 → base 2,\n\nship 2 → base 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each permutation p in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n\n   for each ship index i in 0..R-1:\n\n       base_index = p[i]\n\n       add the segment (ship[i], base[base_index])\n\nWait, but wait: if R is not equal to B, but earlier we have checked that R == B, so it's okay.\n\nNow, for each permutation, collect all the segments.\n\nThen, for each pair of segments in this collection, check for intersection.\n\nBut wait, for each permutation, the segments are between the ships and their assigned bases. So, for example, if the permutation is (1,2,0), then:\n\nsegment 0: ship0 → base1.\n\nsegment1: ship1 → base2.\n\nsegment2: ship2 → base0.\n\nThen, check all pairs: (seg0, seg1), (seg0, seg2), (seg1, seg2).\n\nIf any pair intersects, permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nimport itertools\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append( (x, y) )\n\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # as implemented above.\n\ndef check_permutation(perm):\n    segments = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        ship = ships[i]\n        base = bases[perm[i]]\n        segments.append( (ship, base) )\n    # Now check all pairs.\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n            s1 = segments[i]\n            s2 = segments[j]\n            if segments_intersect(s1[0], s1[1], s2[0], s2[1]):\n                return False\n    return True\n\nfound = False\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n    if check_permutation(perm):\n        found = True\n        break\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nWait, but wait. This is for the case where R = B. What if R < B or R > B?\n\nEarlier, we check if R != B and output 'No'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nbases:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the ships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nBases are [(2,1), (1,0), (2,2)].\n\nOne possible permutation is (0,1,2), but wait, in the sample explanation, the permutation is (base 0, base 1, base 2?), but the exact order may vary.\n\nWait, the sample says that one possible assignment is connecting the Rebels and bases in order, which probably means ship0→base0, ship1→base1, ship2→base2.\n\nBut in the code, the permutation is a tuple of indexes. So, in the sample, the permutation (0,1,2) would connect ship0 to base0, ship1 to base1, ship2 to base2.\n\nIn that case, the segments are:\n\nship0 (0,0) → base0 (2,1): line from (0,0) to (2,1).\n\nship1 (2,0) → base1 (1,0): line from (2,0) to (1,0).\n\nship2 (3,1) → base2 (2,2): line from (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nDo any of these segments intersect?\n\nCheck segment 0 and 1: from (0,0)-(2,1) and (2,0)-(1,0). Do they intersect?\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nLine 0: y = (1/2)x + 0 → y = 0.5x.\n\nLine 1: from (2,0) to (1,0): it's a horizontal line at y=0.\n\nThey intersect at (2,1) and (2,0) for line 0 and 1? Wait, no. Line 1 is from (2,0) to (1,0). It's the line y=0, x from 1 to 2.\n\nLine 0 is from (0,0) to (2,1). It's the line y=0.5x.\n\nAt x=2, y=1 for line 0. But line 1 ends at (2,0). So, the lines cross at (2, 1) and (2,0), but wait, line 0 at x=2 is at (2,1), which is not on line 1.\n\nWait, line 0 is (0,0) to (2,1). So, at x=2, it's (2,1). Line 1 is from (2,0) to (1,0): it's the line segment from (2,0) to (1,0). So, line 0 passes above line 1.\n\nThus, the two segments do not intersect.\n\nSimilarly, segment 0 and 2: from (0,0) to (2,1) and from (3,1) to (2,2). Do they intersect?\n\nThe line from (0,0) to (2,1) is y=0.5x.\n\nThe line from (3,1) to (2,2) is from (3,1) to (2,2): slope is (2-1)/(2-3) = 1/-1 = -1.\n\nEquation: y -1 = -1(x-3) → y = -x +4.\n\nIntersection point is where 0.5x = -x +4 → 1.5x=4 → x=8/3 ≈ 2.666..., y=4/3 ≈ 1.333.\n\nCheck if this point is on both segments.\n\nFor segment0: x ranges from 0 to 2. So, 8/3 ≈2.666>2 → no. So, the lines cross outside the segments.\n\nThus, segments 0 and 2 do not intersect.\n\nSegment 1 and 2: from (2,0) to (1,0) and (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nLine 1 is y=0, from x=1 to 2.\n\nLine 2 is from (3,1) to (2,2): slope is (2-1)/(2-3)= -1.\n\nEquation: y -1 = -1(x-3) → y= -x +4.\n\nFind intersection between line 1 and line 2.\n\nSet y=0: 0 = -x +4 → x=4",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base.
