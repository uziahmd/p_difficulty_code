Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases. Each base must have exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base. So, it's a perfect matching between R rebels and B bases.\n\nBut there's an additional condition: the straight paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. So, no two paths can cross each other in the galaxy plane.\n\nHmm. So, I need to determine if such a matching exists.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input consists of R spaceships and B bases. The coordinates are given, and no three points are colinear, which probably helps because it reduces some cases where lines could overlap.\n\nThe output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether a valid matching exists.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Read the input correctly.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n3. For each matching, check if any two paths intersect.\n4. If any matching satisfies that no paths intersect, output \"Yes\".\n5. If none do after checking all possibilities, output \"No\".\n\nWait, but wait. The number of matchings depends on the minimum of R and B. Oh, wait no, since R and B can be up to 10 each. But if R != B, then it's impossible to have a perfect matching. So first, I should check if R == B. Because each spaceship must assign to a base, and vice versa.\n\nWait, the problem says R and B are the numbers of spaceships and bases. So for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: It says \"R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", so the assignment is a perfect matching only if R = B. So in the code, the first thing to check is whether R equals B. If not, output \"No\" immediately.\n\nWait no, the problem says, \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\". Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the assignment is a perfect matching, which requires that R equals B. So if R is not equal to B, then it's impossible. So in that case, the answer is \"No\".\n\nSo the first step is: if R != B, output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo assuming R = B.\n\nNow, the next part is to find a perfect matching (bijection) between the R spaceships and B bases such that no two paths intersect.\n\nHow to model this? It feels like a problem that can be modeled as a graph, perhaps using bipartite matching, but with constraints on the edges beyond just the matching.\n\nWait, the problem is similar to finding a non-crossing perfect matching between two sets of points. So the question is whether such a matching exists.\n\nI remember that for points in convex position, the non-crossing matching can be found via certain algorithms, but I'm not sure about the general case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where each possible matching is a permutation, and for each permutation, check if all the line segments connecting the points are non-crossing.\n\nBut wait, for R=10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. Hmm, that's manageable, but maybe a bit tight for Python.\n\nBut considering that R can be up to 10, perhaps with optimizations, it's feasible.\n\nWait, let's compute 10! in terms of computational steps. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments to see if they cross. Each line segment is between a point and another point. For each pair of segments, we need to check if they cross.\n\nIn the worst case, for each permutation, the number of segment pairs is O(R^4), since for each of the R segments, we compare it with every other segment.\n\nWait, no. For a permutation, each of the R points is connected to another. So for each pair of connections (i, j) and (k, l), we need to check if the segments (i,j) and (k,l) cross.\n\nSo the number of comparisons per permutation is O(R choose 2) * 2, but that's not quite right. Wait, for each permutation, the number of segments is R, so the number of pairs is R*(R-1)/2. For each pair, we check if their lines cross.\n\nSo for R=10, each permutation requires 45 checks, each involving two line segments.\n\nEach check can be done by determining the orientation of the four points involved. If the orientations indicate that the segments cross, then the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo for each permutation, 45 segment pairs, each checked in O(1) time.\n\nSo 3,628,800 permutations * 45 = around 163 million operations. That might be a bit slow for Python, but perhaps manageable with optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to represent the problem more efficiently.\n\nWait, but wait—since the points are in a plane, and no three are colinear, the problem can be approached by sorting the points in a particular order and then trying to match them in a way that avoids crossings.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking if the bipartite graph's edges satisfy the non-crossing condition. But I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nWait, another idea: for any permutation, the matching corresponds to a set of edges where each edge connects a spaceship to a base. To ensure that none of these edges cross, the arrangement must form a non-crossing structure.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check if R == B. If not, output No.\n- Else, generate all possible perfect matchings (permutations of the bases for the spaceships).\n- For each permutation, check whether all the edges (spaceship i to base permutation[i]) are non-crossing.\n- If any permutation passes this check, output Yes.\n- Otherwise, output No.\n\nSo, the key is to implement this approach efficiently.\n\nNow, how to represent the points. Each spaceship and base has x and y coordinates. So we can store them as lists of tuples.\n\nThen, for each permutation, we can create a list of edges, each being a tuple of two points (spaceship and base). Then, for each pair of edges in this list, we need to check if they cross.\n\nHow to check if two line segments cross?\n\nWe can use the concept of orientation and determine if the segments AB and CD cross.\n\nThe orientation of three points p, q, r can be determined by the direction of the cross product of vectors pq and qr. If the cross product is zero, they are colinear; positive, counter-clockwise; negative, clockwise.\n\nSince the problem states that no three points are colinear, we don't have to worry about colinear cases.\n\nTo check if two segments AB and CD cross:\n\nCompute the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D). If these two orientations are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are also different, then the segments cross.\n\nWait, I think that's correct. So the function to check if two segments AB and CD cross is as follows:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_cross(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD cross\n    if ccw(A, B, C) * ccw(A, B, D) < 0:\n        return True\n    if ccw(C, D, A) * ccw(C, D, B) < 0:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Two line segments AB and CD cross if the points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nSo, the standard approach is to check the orientation of the points. If the orientations of C and D relative to AB are different, and the orientations of A and B relative to CD are different, then the segments cross.\n\nSo, the function would return True if this condition holds.\n\nSo, in code, for each pair of edges (s1, b1) and (s2, b2):\n\nCheck if s1 and s2 are in a certain order that causes the segments to cross.\n\nSo, the steps for each permutation:\n\n1. For each i, create the edge (spaceships[i], bases[perm[i]]).\n2. Collect all these edges into a list.\n3. For every pair of edges (e1, e2) in the list, check if they cross using the above function.\n4. If any pair crosses, this permutation is invalid.\n5. If all pairs are non-crossing, then this permutation is valid, so return Yes.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nGenerate all permutations, for each permutation, check all pairs of edges for crossing.\n\nIf any permutation is valid, output Yes.\n\nElse, after all permutations are checked, output No.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nNow, considering that R can be up to 10, generating all permutations is feasible, but 10! is 3,628,800, which may be acceptable in Python.\n\nBut wait, 3.6 million is manageable for a loop, but for each permutation, we have to process 45 pairs, each involving two edges.\n\nEach edge is a pair of points, so for each pair, we need to extract the points and compute the orientation.\n\nSo, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can read the input as:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nThen read R spaceship points into a list called ships.\n\nThen read B base points into a list called bases.\n\nThen, if R != B, print 'No'.\n\nElse, generate all possible permutations of the bases list, and for each permutation, create a list of edges as (ships[i], perm[i]).\n\nThen, for each permutation, check all pairs of edges to see if any cross.\n\nIf any permutation has no crossings, output 'Yes'.\n\nElse, after checking all, output 'No'.\n\nSo, now the code.\n\nImplementing the permutation generator: itertools.permutations can be used.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport itertools\n\nr, b = map(int, input().split())\nships = []\nfor _ in range(r):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append( (x, y) )\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(b):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\nif r != b:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\ndef ccw(a, b, c):\n    # Calculate the cross product of (b-a) and (c-a)\n    val = (b[0] - a[0])*(c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1])*(c[0] - a[0])\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1  # counterclockwise\n    elif val < 0:\n        return -1  # clockwise\n    else:\n        return 0  # colinear, but problem says no three points are colinear.\n\ndef segments_cross(s1, b1, s2, b2):\n    # Check if segments s1-b1 and s2-b2 cross.\n    # s1 is ship point, b1 is base point.\n    o1 = ccw(s1, b1, s2)\n    o2 = ccw(s1, b1, b2)\n    o3 = ccw(s2, b2, s1)\n    o4 = ccw(s2, b2, b1)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Now, generate all permutations of the bases\nfound = False\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n    edges = []\n    for i in range(r):\n        edges.append( (ships[i], perm[i]) )\n    # Now, check all pairs of edges\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(edges)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(edges)):\n            s1, b1 = edges[i]\n            s2, b2 = edges[j]\n            if segments_cross(s1, b1, s2, b2):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        found = True\n        break\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nWait, but wait—this code may have a mistake. Because the permutation is of the bases, but each base is a point. So, for each permutation, we are matching the i-th spaceship to the i-th element in the permutation.\n\nWait, no: the permutation is over the bases, so for each i, the i-th spaceship is matched to perm[i].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut in the code, 'perm' is a permutation of the bases list. So, for each i, the i-th spaceship is connected to perm[i].\n\nSo, the edges are built correctly.\n\nBut wait, when we call itertools.permutations(bases), it returns tuples where the elements are in a certain order. For example, for a list [A, B, C], a permutation could be (B, A, C).\n\nSo, in the edges list, the first spaceship is connected to B, the second to A, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code above, for each permutation, the edges are created correctly.\n\nThen, for each pair of edges, we check if they cross.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n\nBases:\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nWait, no—the sample input seems to have two sets of points, each for spaceships and bases. Wait, the sample input is:\n\nThe first line after R and B is 3 3\\n, then three lines for spaceships, then three lines for bases.\n\nWait, the first part of the input is the spaceships:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n\nThen the bases:\n\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nSo, ships = [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\nbases = [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nThen, the code will generate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor the first permutation (assuming one of them is the correct one), say, [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)], then the edges are:\n\nship 0 → (-2,1)\n\nship 1 → (0,3)\n\nship 2 → (2,2)\n\nThen, check all pairs:\n\nEdges 0 and 1: between (-2,1) and (0,3). Do they cross with (0,0) and (2,0)?\n\nWait, no, because the first edge is from ship 0 to (-2,1), and the second is ship 1 to (0,3). The line segments are from (0,0) to (-2,1) and from (2,0) to (0,3). Do they cross?\n\nI think they don't. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation that's correct is when the bases are ordered in a way that their connecting lines don't cross.\n\nBut regardless, the code will check all permutations until it finds a valid one.\n\nIn the first sample, the code will find a permutation where the edges don't cross, so it will output 'Yes'.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nInput is:\n\n2 1\n\nShip positions:\n0 0\n2 0\n\nBase position:\n2 2\n\nWait, wait, R is 2, B is 1. So R != B, so output is 'No'.\n\nWait, no—the sample input may have been miswritten here. Wait, the sample input provided in the problem statement is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nSo the first part is R=3, B=3, then 3 ships, then 3 bases.\n\nThe second part is R=2, B=1, then 2 ships, then 1 base.\n\nSo, for the second case, R=2, B=1. Since 2 !=1, output is 'No'.\n\nSo the code correctly handles this.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nShips at (0,0) and (2,0).\n\nBases at (1,1) and (1,2).\n\nWhat's the possible matching?\n\nPermutation 1: base1 and base2.\n\nEdges: ship0→base1, ship1→base2.\n\nCheck if these cross.\n\nThe segments are from (0,0) to (1,1), and (2,0) to (1,2).\n\nDo they cross? Let's compute.\n\nccw( (0,0), (1,1), (2,0) ) → (1-0)(0-0) - (1-0)(2-0) → 1*0 -1*2= -2 → orientation is -1.\n\nccw( (0,0), (1,1), (1,2)) → (1-0)(2-0) - (1-0)(1-0) → 1*2 -1*1=1 → orientation is +1.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are different.\n\nThen, check the other way: for (2,0) to (1,2) and (0,0) to (1,1).\n\nCompute o3 = ccw( (2,0), (1,2), (0,0) ) → (-1)*(-0) - (2)* (-2) → wait, perhaps better to compute:\n\n(1-2)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(0-2) → (-1)*0 - 2*(-2) → 0 +4=4>0 → orientation is +1.\n\nccw( (2,0), (1,2), (1,1) ) → ( -1 )*(0) - (2)*(0) → 0 -0=0. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the function.\n\nWait, the function is:\n\ndef ccw(a, b, c):\n    return (b[0] - a[0])*(c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1])*(c[0] - a[0])\n\nSo for a=(2,0), b=(1,2), c=(0,0):\n\nb.x -a.x = -1, c.y -a.y=0 → term1: (-1)*0=0.\n\nb.y -a.y=2, c.x -a.x= -2 → term2: 2*(-2)= -4.\n\nSo overall value is 0 - (-4) = 4>0 → returns 1.\n\nFor c=(1,1):\n\nterm1: (1-2)*(1-0) = (-1)*1= -1.\n\nterm2: (2-0)*(1-2)= 2*(-1)= -2.\n\nSo total: -1 - (-2) = 1>0 → returns 1.\n\nSo o3 is 1, o4 is 1. So same orientation.\n\nThus, the condition (o1 != o2 and o3 != o4) is true (since o1 and o2 are different, but o3 and o4 are same), so the segments do not cross.\n\nWait, but according to the condition, segments_cross returns True only if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4.\n\nIn this case, o1 is -1, o2 is +1 → different.\n\no3 is +1, o4 is +1 → same.\n\nSo, the condition is o1 != o2 and o3 != o4? Or is it (o1 != o2 or something else)?\n\nWait, the function I wrote earlier:\n\ndef segments_cross(s1, b1, s2, b2):\n    # Check if segments s1-b1 and s2-b2 cross.\n    # s1 is ship point, b1 is base point.\n    o1 = ccw(s1, b1, s2)\n    o2 = ccw(s1, b1, b2)\n    o3 = ccw(s2, b2, s1)\n    o4 = ccw(s2, b2, b1)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nSo, in this case, o1 = -1, o2 = +1 → different. o3 = +1, o4 = +1 → same. So the condition is o1 != o2 and o3 != o4. So both conditions must be true for it to return True.\n\nIn this example, o3 and o4 are same, so condition is false.\n\nThus, the segments do not cross.\n\nSo the permutation is valid.\n\nThus, the code will output 'Yes' for this case.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2, ships at (0,0) and (2,0), bases at (0,1) and (2,1). Then, any matching would cross, because the two lines are parallel and on top of each other.\n\nWait, no. Because the lines are from (0,0) to (0,1), and (2,0) to (2,1). These are vertical lines, and they don't cross. So the matching is valid.\n\nWait, but in this case, the two segments are both vertical, so they don't cross. So the code will find this as a valid matching.\n\nAnother case: R=4, B=4.\n\nShips at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n\nBases at (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nIs there a matching where the edges don't cross?\n\nPerhaps, but it's getting complicated.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Performance: For R=10, 10! is 3.6 million, each requiring 45 checks. Each check involves four CCW calculations. So in Python, 3.6e6 * 45 = ~160 million operations. That's probably too slow for Python, which typically handles about 1e6 operations per second.\n\nWait, that's 160 million operations, which is 160 seconds, which is way beyond what is acceptable.\n\nWait, but wait: 10! is 3.6e6. For each permutation, 45 pairs of edges. So 3.6e6 *45 = 1.6e8 operations. For each operation, four CCW computations, each involving a few multiplications and subtractions. In Python, each CCW computation is quick, but 1.6e8 is way too much.\n\nSo, the code as written would not be efficient enough for R=10.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Find a way to represent the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the segments do not cross, and then find a maximum matching. But even that might not be efficient enough.\n\nWait, but the problem requires a perfect matching, so perhaps a bipartite matching approach can be used with a constraint-based graph.\n\nBut how to model the non-crossing condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where the points are sorted in a certain way, and then the matching is checked in a way that reduces the search space.\n\nWait, but the points can be in any configuration.\n\nAnother idea: for a given set of points, the non-crossing perfect matching is equivalent to a non-crossing tree (which is a perfect matching with no edges crossing). So, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a non-crossing tree, which is a well-known problem in computational geometry.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with the exact algorithms for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the line segments do not cross, and then find a perfect matching.\n\nBut in bipartite matching, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm can find maximum matchings quickly. However, building such a bipartite graph would require considering all possible edges that do not cross, which could be expensive for larger R.\n\nWait, but for R=10, the number of possible edges is 10*10=100, but many of them will cross. So, for each ship, we can precompute all bases that can be connected without crossing to it, but that may not be efficient.\n\nWait, but for each ship, the compatible bases are those such that the line from the ship to the base does not cross with any other line.\n\nWait, but that's not the case because the compatibility depends on the entire matching. So, it's difficult to precompute.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the arrangement of the points.\n\nWait, perhaps we can sort the ships and bases in a certain way.\n\nFor example, sort the ships in increasing order of x-coordinate, and the bases similarly. Then, try to match the i-th ship to the i-th base. But that may not always work, but it can be a starting point.\n\nBut since the problem allows any permutation, this approach may miss valid matchings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a non-crossing bipartite matching, which is a known problem, but I'm not familiar with the exact solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the problem can be transformed into a bipartition of the points, and the matching is a non-crossing set of edges.\n\nIn that case, perhaps a bipartite graph can be constructed where edges are only between ships and bases that can be connected without crossing, and then we need to find a perfect matching in this graph.\n\nBut how to construct such a graph.\n\nWait, but for each ship and base, we need to know if the segment connecting them doesn't cross any other segment in the matching.\n\nBut that's interdependent. So, perhaps the only way is to try all possible matchings and check for non-crossing.\n\nBut for R=10, that's computationally intensive.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is not feasible for R=10.\n\nWait, but wait—looking at the constraints: R and B are up to 10. So for R=10, 10! is 3.6 million, but for each permutation, the checking is 45 segment pairs. So in Python, even with 1e8 operations, it's challenging.\n\nBut perhaps with optimizations, it can pass.\n\nWait, but 3.6e6 * 45 is 1.6e8 operations. For each operation, the function segments_cross is called, which involves four CCW calculations.\n\nEach CCW calculation is a few integer operations. So in Python, each CCW is about 4 operations. So 1.6e8 * 4 = 6.4e8 operations. That's way beyond what Python can handle in the allowed time.\n\nThus, the initial approach is not feasible for R=10.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: Represent the problem in terms of planar graphs, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding a non-crossing perfect matching between the two sets of points. This is equivalent to finding a non-crossing bipartite matching.\n\nI recall that for points in convex position, the non-crossing matching is easier to find. But in general, any point set can be considered.\n\nBut I'm not aware of an efficient algorithm for this.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where edges are allowed only if the line segments are non-crossing with each other. Then, the problem reduces to finding a perfect matching in this graph.\n\nBut again, the challenge is to model this graph efficiently.\n\nAlternative approach: Use dynamic programming with sorting.\n\nPerhaps, sort the ships and bases in a certain way and then greedily match them.\n\nWait, for example, sort the ships in increasing order of x-coordinate, and the bases in decreasing order. Then, for each ship, try to connect it to the earliest possible base that doesn't cause a crossing.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this leads to a correct solution.\n\nAnother idea: Since the problem requires that all edges are non-crossing, the matching must form a non-crossing structure. Thus, the problem can be reduced to checking whether the bipartite graph's edges form a non-crossing structure, which may allow for efficient algorithms.\n\nBut I'm not aware of such algorithms.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible pairing of ships to bases, represent the edges as a polygonal chain and check if it's non-crossing.\n\nBut again, for R=10, this may not be feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be represented using a bitmask for the bases, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach is needed.\n\nLet me think differently: perhaps for the problem, the condition is that the bipartitioned points can be connected in a way that the edges form a non-crossing structure. Such a structure is called a non-crossing matching.\n\nIn computational geometry, a non-crossing matching is a set of edges such that no two edges cross. So, the problem is to find a non-crossing perfect matching.\n\nI did a quick search in my mind and remember that this is a known problem. There are algorithms to find a non-crossing perfect matching for two sets of points, but I'm not sure about the specifics.\n\nOne approach is to model this as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the corresponding segments do not cross, and then find a perfect matching in this graph.\n\nBut the issue is that the edges are interdependent. So, it's possible that two edges are non-crossing individually, but together they cross when combined with others.\n\nThus, the problem is that the graph is not just a collection of edges, but each edge's validity depends on the context of other edges in the matching.\n\nThis makes it challenging to model.\n\nAnother thought: the problem can be reduced to finding a non-crossing bipartite matching, which is a known problem. According to some sources, the problem can be solved using a modified version of the Hungarian algorithm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using dynamic programming by sorting the points and recursively trying to match them in a way that avoids crossings.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nSort the ships and bases in a certain order (like x-coordinate), and then recursively match the first ship to each possible base, ensuring that the chosen base doesn't cross with any previously chosen edges.\n\nThis is similar to the approach used in the problem of finding non-crossing partitions.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the ships and bases in a certain order (e.g., by x-coordinate).\n\n2. For each ship in order, try to match it to a base that comes after it in the order, and which doesn't cross any previously matched edges.\n\n3. Use memoization to cache intermediate results.\n\nThis approach reduces the problem's complexity, but I'm not sure about the exact implementation details.\n\nBut implementing this could be more efficient than checking all permutations.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the problem as a dynamic programming problem, where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to match the first i ships to the first j bases, with non-crossing edges.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this captures all necessary constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since the ships and bases are in arbitrary order, perhaps the order in which they are processed matters, and thus sorting them could help.\n\nBut without knowing the exact order in which to process them, this could be difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps we can sort the ships and bases in a way that allows us to process them in an order that ensures non-crossing edges.\n\nFor example, sort the ships in increasing order of x-coordinate, and the bases in decreasing order. Then, for each ship, we can try to connect it to a base that is to the left of it, ensuring that the segments don't cross.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem of finding a convex hull, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps it's best to look for existing solutions or algorithms for non-crossing bipartite matching.\n\nUpon further reflection, I realize that the problem is similar to the bipartite matching problem where edges are allowed only if they are non-crossing. This is a special case of the general matching problem, but with geometric constraints.\n\nAn efficient way to model this is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a bipartite graph where edges exist only if the line segments do not cross. Then, the problem becomes finding a perfect matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut for R=10, the bipartite graph can have up to 10*10=100 edges. However, finding a maximum matching of size 10 (if R=B=10) can be done with the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, which is O(E√V) per iteration.\n\nBut how to model the edges correctly.\n\nWait, but for each ship, the edges to the bases that are non-crossing with any other edges in the matching is hard to precompute.\n\nWait, but perhaps the edges can be precomputed such that any edge (ship, base) is allowed if, when added to the current matching, it doesn't cross any existing edges.\n\nBut this is dynamic and difficult to manage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each ship, we can precompute all possible bases that can be connected to it without crossing any edges in the current matching.\n\nBut this again seems difficult.\n\nAn alternative approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where an edge exists between ship i and base j if the segment between them does not cross any other edge in the current matching. But this is again dynamic and hard to model.\n\nThus, perhaps the initial approach is not feasible for R=10, and another method is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a bipartite matching problem where edges are only allowed if they are non-crossing with each other. So, the bipartition is the ships and bases, and edges are present only between pairs whose segments do not cross.\n\nBut the problem is that two edges may individually not cross, but together they do when combined with others.\n\nThus, the bipartite graph approach may not capture the interdependencies.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the only way to proceed is to try to optimize the initial approach as much as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be optimized by precomputing all possible edges that do not cross, and then build a bipartite graph where edges are only those that do not cross each other. But again, this is not directly applicable.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial approach can be optimized by memoizing or pruning early in the permutation generation.\n\nFor example, for a given permutation, as soon as any pair of edges is found to cross, we can break out and try the next permutation.\n\nBut in the code above, this is already implemented, and it's correct.\n\nAnother optimization is to precompute all possible edges that do not cross each other. But since the edges are dependent on the permutation, this may not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each pair of ships and bases whether their connecting segment would cross any other segment in the current permutation.\n\nBut again, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be optimized using bitwise operations or other vectorized methods, but in Python, this may not be straightforward.\n\nAnother idea is to precompute all possible segments and their crossings, and then for each permutation, quickly check if any pair of edges in it cross.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be optimized by representing the points as tuples and precomputing all possible edge pairs.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial approach is the only way, and I'll proceed to implement it, but try to find ways to optimize it.\n\nWait, perhaps using memoization for the permutations is not feasible. Another idea is to represent the segments in a way that allows for faster checking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using itertools.permutations is the slowest part, and perhaps we can generate the permutations in a way that skips impossible cases early.\n\nBut for now, perhaps proceed with the code as written and see if it can be optimized.\n\nAnother observation: the order of checking the pairs can be optimized. For example, for the edges in the permutation, arrange them in a certain order that reduces the chances of early termination.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive approach with pruning can be faster.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be rewritten as a recursive backtracking solution, where we try to assign ships to bases one by one, and for each assignment, check only the necessary pairs for crossings.\n\nBut implementing this is more complex.\n\nBut perhaps, for R=10, it's manageable.\n\nLet me think: the recursion would proceed by selecting a ship and trying each possible base, then for each subsequent ship, try to assign a base that doesn't cross any previous edges.\n\nBut for each assignment, we need to check all pairs of edges that include the new edge and any previous edges.\n\nThis could reduce the number of checks compared to the initial approach, which checks all pairs for each permutation.\n\nBut the exact complexity would depend on the order in which ships are processed.\n\nFor example, processing ships in the order of increasing x-coordinate may lead to earlier pruning of impossible paths.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recursive approach can be implemented with memoization, but it's unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the initial approach is the way to go, but with some optimizations.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be optimized by pre-sorting the ships and bases in a certain way, reducing the number of permutations that need to be checked.\n\nFor example, sort the ships and bases in a certain order (like",
