A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on these resources.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nWe have n friends. They bought k bottles of drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nFor salt, they have p grams.\n\nEach toast per friend needs nl milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend makes a toast. So for each toast, all n friends need their own drink, lime, and salt. So each toast requires n * (nl) ml of drink, n * 1 slice, and n * np grams of salt.\n\nBecause each friend makes one toast at a time, but all of them are making a toast simultaneously. So for t toasts, the total required is:\n\nDrink: t * n * nl <= total_drink\nLime: t * n * 1 <= total_lime_slices\nSalt: t * n * np <= total_salt\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of:\n\n(total_drink) / (n * nl)\n(total_lime_slices) / (n)\n(total_salt) / (n * np)\n\nThen, we take the floor of each of those and take the minimum across all three.\n\nSo the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l\n2. Calculate total_lime = c * d\n3. Calculate total_salt = p\n4. For each resource, compute how many toasts it allows:\n   - drink_toast = total_drink // (n * nl)\n   - lime_toast = total_lime // n\n   - salt_toast = total_salt // (n * np)\n5. The answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's see:\n\nFirst sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nCalculations:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20\nnl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3ml, so for 3 friends, 3*3=9ml per toast.\n20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts.\n\nLime: c*d=10*8=80. Each toast, 3 friends each take 1 slice, so 3 per toast. 80 /3 is 26.666, which is 26. But wait, wait, the sample output says that the lime allows 80 toasts. Oh, because each toast requires n slices? No, wait the problem says each friend needs a slice. So for each toast, each friend gets a slice. So for t toasts, each of the n friends will have t slices. So the total slices needed is t * n.\n\nSo in the first sample, 3 friends, each toast needs 3 slices. So for t toasts, 3t slices needed. So the total slices available is 10*8=80. So 3t <=80 → t <= 80/3 = 26.666, so 26.\n\nBut in the note, the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, wait, that doesn't match. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, the note says: 'the limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100/1=100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends, so the answer is min(6,80,100)/3=2.'\n\nWait, wait. So according to the note, the drink allows 20ml. Each toast per friend needs 3ml, so for 3 friends, each toast uses 3*3=9ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. Then, the limes: 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices (for 3 friends). So 80 /3 = 26.666, so 26. The salt is 100 grams. Each toast requires 3 *1=3 grams. So 100 /3 is 33.333, so 33.\n\nSo the min is 2, which is the correct answer.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, the drink allows 2 toasts, limes allow 26, and salt allows 33. So min is 2.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n- Read the inputs: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n- Compute total_drink = k * l.\n\n- total_lime = c * d.\n\n- total_salt = p.\n\n- For each resource, compute how many toasts they can support:\n\n   drink_limit = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\n   lime_limit = total_lime // n\n\n   salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n\n- The answer is the minimum of these three.\n\nWait, but the sample shows that for the first case, the drink gives 20/(3*3)=2.222, so 2. So integer division is correct.\n\nSimilarly, the lime is 80/(3)=26.666→26.\n\nSalt: 100/(3*1)=33.333→33.\n\nSo the min is 2.\n\nSo yes, the code should compute each limit as integer division.\n\nSo the steps are clear.\n\nNow, handling the input: the input is a single line with 8 integers.\n\nSo in Python, we can read the line, split into parts, convert each to integers.\n\nThen compute the three limits, then take the minimum.\n\nWait, but what if any of the denominators are zero? Well, according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers, so n, etc., are >=1. So n * nl is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo, let's outline the code:\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into a list of strings, convert each to int.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ndrink_toast = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toast = total_lime // n\n\nsalt_toast = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nanswer = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\n\nPrint(answer)\n\nWait, that's all?\n\nYes, that seems to be the solution.\n\nTesting against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → 20.\n\nc=10, d=8 → 80.\n\np=100.\n\nnl=3, np=1.\n\ndrink_toast: 20/(3*3)=2.222 →2.\n\nlime_toast:80/3=26.\n\nsalt_toast:100/(3*1)=33.\n\nmin(2,26,33)=2 → output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink=1000.\n\nc=1, d=19 →19.\n\np=90.\n\nnl=4, np=3.\n\ndrink_toast:1000/(5*4)=50.\n\nlime_toast:19/5=3 (since 19//5=3).\n\nsalt_toast:90/(5*3)=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6)=3 → output 3.\n\nThird sample input:10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → 1e6.\n\nc=25, d=23 →575.\n\np=1.\n\nnl=50, np=1.\n\ndrink_toast: 1e6/(10*50) = 1e6/500 = 2000.\n\nlime_toast:575//10=57.\n\nsalt_toast:1/(10*1) = 0.1 →0.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: when one of the resources is exhausted before others.\n\nLike, n=2, k=1, l=5 → drink=5.\n\nnl=2 → per toast, 2*2=4ml.\n\nSo 5//4=1.\n\nIf c=1, d=1 →1 slice. So for 2 friends, each toast needs 2 slices. So 1//2=0.\n\nSo answer is 0.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each friend needs a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a specific amount of salt for each toast.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of each resource available.\n3. **Determine Resource Limits**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total available amount and the requirement per toast.\n4. **Compute Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is found by taking the minimum of the three calculated values from the previous step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\ndrink_toast = total_drink // (n * nl)\nlime_toast = total_lime // n\nsalt_toast = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nanswer = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\nprint(answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, lime slices, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast, and grams of salt per toast.\n2. **Total Resources Calculation**:\n   - `total_drink` is the product of the number of bottles and the milliliters per bottle.\n   - `total_lime` is the product of the number of limes and the number of slices per lime.\n   - `total_salt` is directly given as the grams of salt.\n3. **Resource Limits Calculation**:\n   - `drink_toast` is the total drink divided by the amount needed per toast per friend, rounded down.\n   - `lime_toast` is the total lime slices divided by the number of friends.\n   - `salt_toast` is the total salt divided by the amount needed per toast per friend, rounded down.\n4. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value among `drink_toast`, `lime_toast`, and `salt_toast` gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of toasts while considering all resource constraints.",
