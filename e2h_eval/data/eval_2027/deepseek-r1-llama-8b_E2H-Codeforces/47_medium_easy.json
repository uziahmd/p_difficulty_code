    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the smallest non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest k.\n\nHmm, let's think about what a+k and b+k represent. Since a and b are given, adding the same k to both means their difference remains the same. Wait, yes! Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So the difference between the two numbers doesn't change with k. Interesting.\n\nSo, the two numbers x and y where x = a +k, y = b +k have a fixed difference d = |a - b|. The goal is to find x and y such that their LCM is minimized, with x and y being positive integers and y = x + d or vice versa, depending on which is larger.\n\nWait, right. Because if a > b, then x = a +k and y = b +k, so y = x - (a - b). Or if a < b, then x = b +k and y = a +k, so x = y + (b - a). But in any case, the difference is fixed.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y with a fixed difference d = |a - b|, such that LCM(x, y) is minimized.\n\nWait, but how? Because for different k, x and y will vary, but their difference is fixed. So perhaps the optimal k is determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y?\n\nLet me think: since d is fixed, x and y can be written as y = x -d or x = y +d, depending on which is bigger. So, without loss of generality, let's assume that a <= b, so d = b - a, and x = a +k, y = b +k. Then y = x + d.\n\nSo, x and y are two numbers with difference d, and we want their LCM to be as small as possible.\n\nWhat's the relationship between x, y, and their GCD? Well, the LCM of x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD.\n\nBecause for fixed x and y, as the GCD increases, the LCM decreases. So, the maximum possible GCD would give the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the key is to maximize the GCD of x and y. But since y = x + d, the GCD of x and x+d is the same as the GCD of x and d.\n\nBecause gcd(x, x + d) = gcd(x, d). Right, because x + d = x + d, subtracting x gives d. So the GCD is the same as the GCD of x and d.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of x and y is equal to g, where g divides d.\n\nSo, to maximize g, we need to find the largest possible divisor of d that also divides x. But wait, x is a +k, which is variable. So, for each divisor g of d, we can see what's the minimal x such that x is congruent to 0 modulo g.\n\nBut how does that help us find the optimal k?\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nWe have d = |a - b|. Let's assume d is not zero (if a == b, then the LCM is a +k, which is minimized when k=0, so that's easy).\n\nIf d is zero, then a = b. So a +k and b +k are the same, so their LCM is a +k. To minimize this, set k=0.\n\nOtherwise, for d > 0:\n\nWe want to find x = a +k, y = b +k, with y = x + d. We need to find x such that g = gcd(x, d) is as large as possible. Because then the LCM (x*(y)/g) would be minimized.\n\nWait, because LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / g, and y = x + d. So substituting y, we get (x*(x + d))/g. But since g divides d, perhaps we can express it differently.\n\nAlternatively, since g divides x, let's write x = g * m, where m is an integer. Then y = g*m + d. But since g divides d, let's say d = g * t, where t is another integer.\n\nSo y = g*(m + t). Therefore, the GCD of x and y is g, as desired.\n\nSo, now, the LCM is (g*m * g*(m + t)) / g = g * m (m + t). So, the LCM becomes g * m (m + t).\n\nOur goal is to minimize this expression, given that m is a positive integer, and m must be chosen such that x = a +k is positive, i.e., m >= (a +k) / g >= something.\n\nWait, perhaps m can be any integer >=1, as long as x = g*m is such that a +k = g*m. So, k = g*m - a. But we have to ensure that k is non-negative, so g*m >= a.\n\nWait, no. Because if a is less than x, which is g*m, then k could be negative. But wait, k must be non-negative. So, the minimal k is such that x >= a (if a <= b) or x >= b (if b < a). Wait, no, because in our assumption, a <= b, so x = a +k and y = b +k. So x must be >= a, which is already satisfied since k is non-negative.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\n- x = g * m >= a\n- m must be a positive integer.\n\nSo, for each possible divisor g of d, we can compute the minimal m such that x = g*m >= a. Then, compute the corresponding LCM, which is g*m*(m + t), and find the minimal such LCM across all possible g.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return k=0.\n\n2. Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d, compute t = d / g.\n\n4. Then, x needs to be a multiple of g, at least a (assuming a <= b; if not, swap a and b to have a <= b).\n\n5. Find the minimal m such that g*m >= a. So m_min = ceil(a / g). But since g divides d, and a may not be a multiple of g, m_min is the smallest integer greater than or equal to a/g.\n\n6. Then, the LCM for this g is g * m * (m + t).\n\n7. Among all possible g's, find the one that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple g's give the same minimal LCM, choose the one with the smallest k.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the cases where for different g's, the same LCM is achieved but with different k's? Also, perhaps we need to find all possible g's, compute their corresponding k's, and then select the minimal LCM and the smallest k among those.\n\nBut considering that d can be up to 1e9, enumerating all the divisors of d might be feasible, but we need an efficient way to do it.\n\nBut first, let's outline the steps more clearly.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return k=0.\n\n2. Else, generate all the divisors of d. For each divisor g:\n\n   a. Compute t = d / g.\n\n   b. Compute m_min = ceil( (a) / g ). Because x = g * m must be >= a. So m_min is the smallest integer m such that g*m >= a.\n\n      - For example, if a = 5, g = 2, then m_min is 3, since 2*2=4 <5, 2*3=6>=5.\n\n   c. Then, the corresponding x is g * m_min, and y is g*(m_min + t).\n\n   d. The LCM is (x * y) / g = (g*m_min * g*(m_min +t)) / g = g * m_min * (m_min + t).\n\n   e. Record this LCM and the corresponding k = x - a (since x = a +k).\n\n3. After processing all g's, find the pair (g, m) that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple, choose the smallest k.\n\nWait, but in step 2.b, m_min is computed as the minimal m where g*m >= a. So, for each g, the minimal x is g * m_min, leading to the minimal possible x for that g, which in turn leads to the minimal possible k for that g.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because for a particular g, choosing a larger m could lead to a smaller LCM. Hmm, no. Because as m increases, m*(m+t) increases, so the LCM would also increase. So, the minimal LCM for a given g is achieved when m is as small as possible, which is m_min.\n\nSo, for each g, the minimal LCM is when m is m_min.\n\nSo, the approach is to iterate over all divisors g of d, compute m_min for each, compute the corresponding LCM, and track the minimal LCM and the smallest k that achieves it.\n\nBut wait, what about when a > b? Oh, right, because earlier we assumed a <= b, but the code should handle a > b as well. So, in that case, we swap a and b, but d remains positive.\n\nWait, no, because if a > b, then in the initial setup, a +k and b +k would have a difference of a - b. But in the code, when a > b, we can swap them to make a <= b, so that d = b - a is negative, but taking absolute value gives d = a - b.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set d as the absolute difference, regardless of a and b.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nThen, for each divisor g of d, compute t = d // g.\n\nThen, for a and b, after ensuring that a <= b, but wait, no. Because when a > b, adding k to both, the difference remains the same. So, the approach is correct regardless of a and b.\n\nBut perhaps in code, it's better to compute a and b such that a <= b, to avoid confusion.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif a > b:\n    a, b = b, a\n\nThen, d = b - a.\n\nWait, no, because if a was originally larger than b, then after swapping, d becomes b - a, which is negative. But the absolute value is correct.\n\nWait, no, because when you swap a and b, then d is b - a, which is the negative of the original a - b. So, taking absolute value is important.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute d as the absolute difference.\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the steps in code are:\n\n- Read a and b.\n\n- Compute d = abs(a - b). If d is 0, output k=0.\n\n- Else, find all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g:\n\n   - Compute t = d // g.\n\n   - Compute m_min = ceil(a / g). Because x = a +k = g * m >= a, so m >= a/g. But since m must be an integer, m_min is the ceiling of (a / g).\n\n   - Compute x = g * m_min, y = x + d.\n\n   - Compute current_LCM = (x * y) // g.\n\n   - Compute k = x - a.\n\n   - Record current_LCM and k.\n\n- Now, find the pair (current_LCM, k) with the smallest current_LCM. If multiple, choose the smallest k.\n\nWait, but wait: for each g, the current_LCM is (g * m_min) * (g * (m_min + t)) / g. Which simplifies to g * m_min * (m_min + t).\n\nYes, because:\n\nx = g * m_min\ny = x + d = g * m_min + d = g * m_min + g * t = g (m_min + t)\nSo, LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y) = (g m * g (m + t)) / g = g m (m + t)\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nNow, for each g, compute this value, and track the minimal.\n\nBut wait, are there any other possibilities besides considering all divisors of d?\n\nNo, because the maximum possible GCD is limited by the divisors of d. Because the GCD of x and y is g, and since y = x + d, it's the same as the GCD of x and d. So, the maximum g can be is a divisor of d.\n\nSo, considering all divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nSo, the next task is to find all the divisors of d efficiently.\n\nBut d can be up to 1e9, so the number of divisors is manageable, since the maximum is around 1e5 or so for very composite numbers.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about some examples.\n\nFirst example from the note:\n\nInput: 6 10\n\nd = 4.\n\nDivisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each g:\n\nCase g=1:\n\nt =4/1=4.\n\nm_min = ceil(6/1)=6.\n\nx=6*1=6, y=6+4=10.\n\nLCM is 6*10 /1 =60.\n\nk=6-6=0.\n\nCase g=2:\n\nt=4/2=2.\n\nm_min=ceil(6/2)=3.\n\nx=2*3=6, y=6+4=10.\n\nSame as above, LCM 30.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no:\n\nWait, for g=2, t=4/2=2.\n\nx=2*3=6, y=6+4=10.\n\nWait, so x=6, y=10.\n\nWait, but 6 and 10 have GCD 2. So the LCM is (6*10)/2=30.\n\nWhich is better than 60.\n\nSo, current_LCM is 30, k=0.\n\nWait, but wait, the sample input's correct answer is k=2.\n\nWait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the correct k is 2.\n\nLet me re-calculate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, in the sample input, a=6, b=10.\n\nSo, x=6 +k, y=10 +k.\n\nd=4.\n\nSo, for each g that divides 4:\n\ng=1: m_min=6, x=6, y=10. LCM is 60.\n\ng=2: m_min=3, x=6, y=10. LCM is 30.\n\ng=4: m_min=2 (since 6/4 is 1.5, ceil is 2). x=8, y=12.\n\nx=8, y=12. Their GCD is 4. So LCM is (8*12)/4=24.\n\nSo, for g=4, the LCM is 24, which is better than 30.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal LCM is 24, achieved when g=4, m_min=2.\n\nThus, k=x - a = 8-6=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, my previous reasoning was missing this case. So, why?\n\nBecause when g=4, which is a divisor of d=4, the approach correctly computes m_min=2, leading to x=8, y=12, LCM 24.\n\nSo, the code should consider all the divisors of d, including 4.\n\nSo, the process is correct.\n\nSo, the issue in my initial thought was that I forgot to include g=4 in the consideration.\n\nSo, the code must generate all the divisors of d, including all the possible ones.\n\nSo, the code must correctly list all the divisors.\n\nSo, the next step is to write a function to generate all the divisors of d.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, we can factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all the divisors from the exponents.\n\nBut for d up to 1e9, trial division is acceptable.\n\nSo, let's think about writing a function to find all the divisors of a number n.\n\nFunction to find all divisors of n:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1):\n        if n % i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nYes, but since n can be up to 1e9, the sqrt is 3e4, which is manageable.\n\nSo, that's manageable.\n\nNow, back to the sample.\n\nIn the sample, for g=4, m_min is 2, x=8, which is a +k =6 +2=8.\n\nWhich gives LCM 24.\n\nSo, the code would find that as the minimal.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case is '21 31'.\n\nd=10.\n\nDivisors of 10: 1, 2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=1: m_min=21.\n\nx=21, y=31.\n\nLCM= 21*31=651.\n\nk=0.\n\ng=2: m_min=11 (21/2=10.5, ceil is 11). x=22, y=32.\n\nGCD(22,32)=2. LCM= (22*32)/2= 352.\n\ng=5: m_min=5 (21/5=4.2, ceil 5). x=25, y=35.\n\nGCD(25,35)=5. LCM= (25*35)/5=175.\n\ng=10: m_min=3 (21/10=2.1, ceil 3). x=30, y=40.\n\nGCD(30,40)=10. LCM= (30*40)/10= 120.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 120, achieved when g=10, m=3.\n\nk=30-21=9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird test case: '5 10'.\n\nd=5.\n\nDivisors: 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: m_min=5. x=5, y=10. LCM=50.\n\nk=0.\n\nFor g=5: m_min=1. x=5, y=10. LCM=5*10 /5=10.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because x=5, y=10.\n\nTheir GCD is 5.\n\nSo, LCM is (5*10)/5=10.\n\nSo, the LCM is 10, which is better than 50.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 10, achieved with k=5-5=0.\n\nSo, the output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code works for these samples.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Compute d = abs(a -b).\n\n- If d is 0, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Generate all divisors of d.\n\n   For each g in the divisors:\n\n      t = d // g.\n\n      m_min = ceil(a / g).\n\n      x = g * m_min.\n\n      y = x + d.\n\n      current_LCM = g * m_min * (m_min + t).\n\n      current_k = x - a.\n\n      Keep track of the minimal current_LCM, and the minimal current_k in case of ties.\n\nOnce all g's are processed, output the k that gives the minimal current_LCM, and smallest k if tied.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut wait, how do we handle a and b? Because in code, a and b can be in any order.\n\nIn code:\n\nWe can compute d = abs(a -b).\n\nIf d == 0, print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute all divisors of d.\n\nSort the divisors in increasing order? Not necessarily, but for efficiency, perhaps not needed.\n\nBut for each divisor g, compute as above.\n\nBut in code, the order of processing g's does not matter, as we track the minimal LCM and k.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, implementing in Python.\n\nFirst, read a and b:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b)\n\nif d ==0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   # get all divisors of d\n\n   def get_divisors(n):\n\n       if n ==0:\n\n           return []\n\n       divisors = set()\n\n       for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n\n           if n%i ==0:\n\n               divisors.add(i)\n\n               divisors.add(n//i)\n\n       return sorted(divisors)\n\n   divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n   min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n   best_k = float('inf')\n\n   for g in divisors:\n\n       t = d // g\n\n       # compute m_min: smallest m where g * m >= a\n\n       m_min = (a + g -1 ) // g  # this is equivalent to ceil(a/g)\n\n       x = g * m_min\n\n       y = x + d\n\n       current_lcm = g * m_min * (m_min + t)\n\n       current_k = x - a\n\n       if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n           min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n           best_k = current_k\n\n       elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n           if current_k < best_k:\n\n               best_k = current_k\n\n   print(best_k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where a > b, after swapping a and b, but in the code, a is not swapped. Because the code uses a and b as given, but the calculation is based on d=abs(a -b), so the code doesn't need to swap a and b.\n\nWait, no, in the code above, a and b are taken as input, but the code doesn't swap them. So, if a is larger than b, then m_min is calculated as (a + g -1) // g, which is correct because x = a +k must be >= a, but since y is a +k +d, which is larger.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, a and b are just two integers. So, the code can proceed as is.\n\nWait, but in the code, when a > b, then d = a -b, but when computing x = a +k and y = b +k, y is smaller than x, but the difference is still d.\n\nWait, no, because a > b implies that d = a -b, so y = b +k = a +k -d.\n\nSo, the code remains correct.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as written.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 10\n\nd=4.\n\ndivisors are [1,2,4].\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=1:\n\nt=4.\n\nm_min=6.\n\nx=6, y=10.\n\ncurrent_lcm=6*10=60.\n\ncurrent_k=0.\n\ng=2:\n\nt=2.\n\nm_min=3.\n\nx=6, y=10.\n\ncurrent_lcm= 2*3*(3+2) = 2*3*5=30.\n\ncurrent_k=0.\n\ng=4:\n\nt=1.\n\nm_min=2.\n\nx=8, y=12.\n\ncurrent_lcm=4*2*(2+1)=4*2*3=24.\n\ncurrent_k=2.\n\nSo, the best is 24, k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:21 31.\n\nd=10.\n\ndivisors:1,2,5,10.\n\ng=1: m_min=21. x=21, y=31. LCM 21*31=651, k=0.\n\ng=2: m_min=11. x=22, y=32. LCM 22*32/2= 352, k=1.\n\ng=5: m_min=5. x=25, y=35. LCM 25*35/5= 175, k=4.\n\ng=10: m_min=3. x=30, y=40. LCM 30*40/10= 120, k=9.\n\nSo, the best is 120, k=9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput:5 10.\n\nd=5.\n\ndivisors:1,5.\n\ng=1:\n\nm_min=5. x=5, y=10. LCM 5*10/1=50, k=0.\n\ng=5:\n\nm_min=1. x=5, y=10. LCM 5*10/5=10, k=0.\n\nSo, the minimal is 10, k=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when a = b.\n\nInput: 7 7.\n\nd=0.\n\nOutput k=0.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=1000000000.\n\nd=999999999.\n\nWe need to find the minimal LCM.\n\nWhich would be when g is as large as possible, leading to a small LCM.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nThe largest g is 999999999.\n\nThen, m_min=1.\n\nx=999999999, y=1999999998.\n\nTheir GCD is 999999999.\n\nSo, LCM is (999999999 * 1999999998) / 999999999 = 1999999998.\n\nWhich is better than any other g.\n\nSo, the code should pick that.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the function get_divisors returns a sorted list, but in the code, the loop processes the divisors in that order. Does the order affect anything? No, because it's checking all.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, in code, import math.\n\nHandle the case when d=0.\n\nElse, compute all divisors.\n\nBut wait, what if d=0? That's when a = b. So, a +k and b +k are the same, so their LCM is a +k. So, the minimal is when k=0.\n\nThus, the code correctly handles that.\n\nNow, test for d=0.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) remains constant regardless of \\( k \\). Let \\( d = |a - b| \\).\n   - The goal is to minimize the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\), which can be expressed as \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) respectively, where \\( y = x + d \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The LCM of two numbers can be minimized by maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). Since \\( y = x + d \\), the GCD of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is the same as the GCD of \\( x \\) and \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute all divisors of \\( d \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest \\( m \\) such that \\( g \\times m \\geq a \\).\n   - Calculate the corresponding \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values and their LCM.\n   - Track the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations**:\n   - Finding divisors of \\( d \\) using trial division is efficient for \\( d \\) up to \\( 10^9 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        t = d // g\n        m_min = (a + g - 1) // g  # Equivalent to ceil(a / g)\n        x = g * m_min\n        current_lcm = g * m_min * (m_min + t)\n        current_k = x - a\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = current_k\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if current_k < best_k:\n                best_k = current_k\n                \n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Divisor Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of \\( d \\) efficiently by iterating up to the square root of \\( d \\).\n- **Main Logic**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest \\( m \\) such that \\( g \\times m \\) is at least \\( a \\). This ensures \\( x \\) is valid and non-negative.\n- **LCM Calculation**: For each valid \\( x \\), compute \\( y \\) and the corresponding LCM. Track the minimum LCM and the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves it.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, providing an optimal solution within acceptable time limits for large inputs.",
