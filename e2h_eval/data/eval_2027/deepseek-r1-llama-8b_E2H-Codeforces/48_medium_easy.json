He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but if the second part of a door is 'R', then it's using Roman numerals instead of a normal base. Hmm, let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the input has two lines. The first line is a and b, where b can be R. The second line is c in base a, which could be a very long string. My task is to output c in base b, but if the second part was R, then we have to represent it as a Roman numeral.\n\nWait, right. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then the output should be in Roman numerals. Otherwise, output the number in base b as a string.\n2. Read the number c which is in base a. It can have leading zeros but shouldn't be zero itself.\n3. Convert c from base a to an integer value.\n4. Then, if the second part is R (i.e., we're dealing with Roman numerals), convert that integer to a Roman numeral string. Otherwise, convert it to base b and output without leading zeros.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second part is either b or R. Oh right. So the second part in the first line determines whether the conversion is to a standard base or to Roman.\n\nSo for each test case, I have to check if b is 'R' or not. If it's 'R', then the output is the Roman numeral equivalent of the number. Else, output the number in base b as a string.\n\nBut wait, the initial problem says that each door has four parts: a, second part is either b or R, third part is c, fourth is empty. So the problem is that when the second part is R, we need to treat the entire number as a Roman numeral.\n\nSo the steps for each test case are:\n\n- Parse a and b from the first line. If b is 'R', then the second part is Roman.\n- Take the second line, which is c in base a. So c is a string of digits in base a.\n- Convert c from base a to an integer. Let's call this value N.\n- If b is 'R', then output the Roman numeral representation of N.\n- Else, output N in base b, without leading zeros.\n\nSo the main challenges are:\n\n1. Converting a potentially very long string (up to 103 digits) from base a to an integer. But since a is up to 25, it's manageable as Python handles big integers well.\n\n2. Converting the integer to a Roman numeral, considering all the rules like IV for 4, IX for 9, etc. Also, for bases larger than 10, letters go beyond I, V, X... to A, B, etc.\n\nWait, but the note says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So for example, in base 13, the digits would be 0-12, represented as 0,1,...,9,A,B.\n\nWait, but the problem is about converting the number into Roman numerals, regardless of the base. Or is the base a factor here? No, wait: when b is R, the entire c is treated as a Roman numeral, which may contain letters beyond the usual Roman symbols. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So when converting to Roman numerals, the digits are treated as their values, and letters are used accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWhen the second part is R, the entire c is a Roman numeral. So for example, in the sample input, one of the cases is '5 R\\n4'. So the number is 5 in base a (which is 10 in that case?), wait no. Wait, in that case, a is 10 and c is '5', so N is 5. Since b is R, we need to output the Roman numeral for 5, which is 'V'.\n\nAnother sample input is '2 2\\n1111001' — so a is 2, b is 2, so output is 1111001 in base 2, which is 1+16 + 32 + 64 +128 = 241? Wait, 1111001 in binary is 1*128 + 1*64 + 1*32 + 1*16 + 0*8 + 0*4 + 1*1 = 128+64+32+16+1=241. So the output is '1111001' because b is 2, so it's just the same as the input but without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but what about when the base is higher? Like the last sample input is '12 13\\nA'. So a is 12, c is 'A' which is 10 in base 12. So N is 10. Since b is 13, which is a base, but the output is 'A' because 10 in base 13 is represented as 'A'.\n\nHmm, but wait, the problem says that when b is R, the output is a Roman numeral. So when b is not R, the output is the number in base b as a string, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for values 10 and above, as per standard base representations.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then we'll output a Roman numeral.\n2. Read c as a string.\n3. Convert c from base a to integer N.\n4. If b is R: convert N to Roman numeral.\n   Else: convert N to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n5. Output the result.\n\nSo now, I need to implement functions to:\n\n- Convert a string in base a to an integer.\n- Convert an integer to a Roman numeral.\n- Convert an integer to a base b string, without leading zeros.\n\nLet me think about each function.\n\nFirst, converting a base a string to integer.\n\nThe string is in base a, so each character represents a digit. For example, in base 10, '123' is 1*100 + 2*10 +3.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, starting from left to right, multiply the current total by a, then add the value of the current digit.\n\nBut wait, for bases higher than 10, the digits beyond 9 are represented by letters A-Z, corresponding to 10, 11, ..., 35, respectively.\n\nSo, for example, in base 16, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n\nSo, to handle the input string, each character must be converted to its corresponding value as a digit.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a string; how are the letters represented? For example, if a is 16, then the string can have characters '0'-'9' and 'A'-'F'.\n\nSo, for each character in the string:\n\n- If it's a digit, convert it to int.\n- If it's a letter, uppercase or lowercase? Well, the problem says 'c' is written in base a, and it's a non-negative integer, so the letters are uppercase or lowercase? Probably, in the input, the letters are uppercase, but perhaps the code should be case-insensitive.\n\nWait, the problem's note shows examples like 'A' in the output. So the input c can have letters (like 'A') in uppercase.\n\nSo, in the function to convert base a string to integer:\n\nWe'll process each character in the string, mapping it to its value:\n\nFor each char c:\n\n- if c is a digit, value = int(c)\n- else, value = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\nWait, but for letters beyond 'Z'? No, because a is up to 25, so the maximum digit needed is 24, which is represented by 'O' (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 24 O). So any letters beyond that are invalid, but the problem says that c is a valid number in base a, so we don't need to handle errors.\n\nSo, the function to convert string to integer:\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    result = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        result = result * base + val\n    return result\n\nWait, but wait: for base 2, the digits allowed are 0 and 1. So the function will correctly interpret '1' as 1, and '0' as 0.\n\nSimilarly, for base 3, digits 0,1,2.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, the function to convert an integer to a Roman numeral.\n\nRoman numerals have specific rules. The basic idea is that you start from the largest possible value and subtract as much as possible, appending the corresponding symbols.\n\nBut also, there's the subtractive notation for certain numbers: IV for 4, IX for 9, XL for 40, etc.\n\nSo, to create a list of pairs (value, symbol) in descending order. For example:\n\n[\n(100, 'C'),\n(90, 'XC'),\n(50, 'L'),\n(40, 'XL'),\n(10, 'X'),\n(9, 'IX'),\n(5, 'V'),\n(4, 'IV'),\n(1, 'I'),\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the symbol each time.\n\nBut wait, for numbers like 3000, which is 'MMM'.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I'),\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nWait, but this works only for numbers up to 3999. But in the problem statement, it says that the maximum number is 300010 when using Roman numerals. Wait, no, the problem says that the number won't exceed 101510 when not using Roman numerals. Wait, the note says that the input is guaranteed to be ≤ 101510 otherwise.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\n\"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\nWait, maybe that's a typo. But regardless, for the int_to_roman function, perhaps the standard approach is sufficient, as the maximum N is 300010, which is way beyond what the standard Roman numerals can handle, but perhaps the problem expects us to handle it.\n\nWait, but Roman numerals traditionally don't go beyond 3999. So perhaps the problem's note is incorrect, or perhaps it's referring to the fact that when using Roman numerals, the number is up to 300010, which is way beyond traditional limits, but the problem expects us to handle it somehow.\n\nHmm, but how? Because the standard Roman numerals can't represent such large numbers. So perhaps the problem expects that when b is R, the number is treated as a regular integer, and we have to write it as a Roman numeral according to the rules, including using additive and subtractive combinations as per the thousands, even beyond 3999.\n\nWait, but the problem's note says that \"the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\" So the function int_to_roman needs to handle numbers up to 300010.\n\nWait, but how do you represent 4000 in Roman numerals? You can't with the traditional system. So perhaps the problem is expecting that we treat the number as a decimal and represent it as a Roman numeral using a different system, perhaps using overlines or something else. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the Roman numeral is generated using the standard rules, but treating each digit as a separate part, but that doesn't make sense for numbers beyond 3999.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the note.\n\nNote: You can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals.\n\nSo, according to Wikipedia, Roman numerals can be extended to represent larger numbers by adding bars or other symbols, but those are not standard. However, the problem seems to expect that we can represent up to 300010.\n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps the approach for the function is to represent the number as a series of thousands, each represented by M, and then the hundreds, tens, units as usual.\n\nWait, for example, 4000 would be MMMM, 5000 would beMMMM, and so on. Similarly, 300010 would be MMMMCMX (but wait, let's see: 300010 is 3*1000 + 0*100 + 0*10 + 1*1, so MMMM (4000?) Wait, no—wait, MMMM is 4000, then CMX would be 900 +10=910, but that adds up to 4000 + 910=4910. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting that the Roman numeral is constructed by treating each digit in the number as a separate part, similar to how it's done for bases. So for example, each digit is represented as a Roman numeral, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function to convert to Roman numerals is simply to break down the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, and represent each part separately, regardless of the standard subtractive rules.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. For example, 1999 is MCMXCIX, which uses the subtractive notation. So how do we handle numbers beyond 3999?\n\nI think that the problem expects that the Roman numeral is built as per the standard rules, but for numbers beyond 3999, we can add as many Ms as needed. So, for 4000, it's MMMM, for 4001 it's MMMMC, etc.\n\nWait, but then 4000 would be represented as MMMM, which is four M's. That makes sense, I guess.\n\nSo, the function int_to_roman can be modified to handle numbers beyond 3999 by allowing as many Ms as needed.\n\nSo, the val list would include (1000, 'M'), and then proceed as before.\n\nSo, updating the val list:\n\nval = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I'),\n]\n\nSo, in the code, the val list starts with 1000, then 900, etc.\n\nWait, let me test this logic.\n\nFor example:\n\nn = 4000: 4000 / 1000 =4 → 'MMMM'\n\nn= 4001: 4000 (MMMM) +1 (I) → 'MMMMI'\n\nn= 1999: 1000 (M) + 900 (CM) + 90 (XC) +9 (IX) → MCMXCIX.\n\nn= 201 → 200 (CC) +1 (I) → 'CCI'.\n\nWait, but 200 is 'CC', which is correct.\n\nYes, this seems to handle numbers beyond 3999 correctly.\n\nSo, the function int_to_roman can be written as:\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I'),\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, it says that the number is guaranteed to be <= 300010 when using Roman numerals. So 300010 is 300 thousand and ten. Let's compute that:\n\n300010 / 1000 = 300 → 'MMM'\nRemaining: 10 → 'X'\n\nSo the Roman numeral is 'MMMXXX'? Wait, no, wait: 300010 is 300,000 + 10. So 'MMM' followed by 'X' → 'MMMX'.\n\nWait, 300000 is 'MMM' (three Ms), plus 10 is X → MMMX.\n\nBut wait, 300010 is 300 thousand and 10, which is MMMX.\n\nBut according to the function, 300010 would be processed as 300,000 + 10, so 'MMM' + 'X' → 'MMMX'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the function can handle that.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement these functions.\n\nNow, the function to convert an integer to a base b string, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, for example, 5 in base 2 is '101', 5 in base 13 is '5' (as a single digit).\n\nHow to implement this:\n\nWe can repeatedly divide the number by the base and collect the remainders, then reverse the list to get the correct order.\n\nBut we have to handle the case when the number is zero. However, the problem states that the input c is non-zero, so the output is never zero.\n\nBut wait, the input c is non-zero, but after conversion, could the integer N be zero? No, because c is non-zero in base a, so N is at least 1.\n\nWait, no: if c is '0' in base a, then N is 0. But the problem says that the input c is not zero. So N is at least 1.\n\nSo, the function to convert N to base b:\n\ndef int_to_str(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # rem is between 10 and base-1. So we need to represent it as a letter.\n            # For example, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n            # Since base can be up to 25, letters go up to 'P' (for 25-1=24 → 'O').\n            # So rem can be 10 to 25-1=24.\n            # So, the character is chr(ord('A') + rem - 10)\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    # Reverse the digits to get the correct order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, let's test this function.\n\nFor n=5, base=2:\n\n5//2=2, rem=1 → digits [1]\n2//2=1, rem=0 → digits [0]\n1//2=0, rem=1 → digits [1]\ndigits are [1,0,1], reversed → '101'.\n\nYes.\n\nn=10, base=13:\n\n10 //13 is 0, rem=10 → 'A' → digits ['A'] → output 'A'.\n\nn=25, base=26: rem is 25 → 'P'.\n\nn=26, base=26: 26//26=1, rem 0 → digits [0], then 1//26=0, rem 1 → digits [0,1] → reversed → '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but for base 16, the digit 10 is 'A', 15 is 'F', etc.\n\nSo the function seems correct.\n\nBut wait, for base 10, n=123:\n\nn//10 = 12, rem 3 → digits [3]\n12//10 =1, rem 2 → digits [2]\n1//10=0, rem 1 → digits [1]\ndigits [3,2,1], reversed → '123'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the function should work.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead a and b from the first line.\n\nCheck if b is 'R':\n\nIf yes, then read c, convert c from base a to integer N, then convert N to Roman numeral and output.\n\nElse, read c, convert c from base a to integer N, then convert N to base b as a string and output.\n\nBut wait, in the first line, the second part is either b or R. So, the first line is a string, split into two parts. For example, in the sample input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', ... ]\n\nThe first line is '10 2' → a=10, b=2.\n\nAnother sample input is '16 R\\n5' → a=16, b='R'.\n\nSo, the code needs to read the first line as two integers, but the second part can be 'R'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\na_b = input().split()\na = int(a_b[0])\nb = a_b[1]\n\nWait, no: because a_b is a list of two elements, which are strings. So for the first sample, a_b[0] is '10', a_b[1] is '2'.\n\nBut for the case where b is 'R', a_b[1] is 'R'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nif b_str == 'R':\n    use_roman = True\nelse:\n    use_roman = False\n\nThen, read the next line as c.\n\nc = input().strip()\n\nNow, convert c from base a to integer N.\n\nBut wait, c could be a very long string, up to 103 digits. So, handling it correctly is important.\n\nImplementing the function str_to_int:\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    result = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            # Assume uppercase\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        result = result * base + val\n    return result\n\nTesting this function.\n\nExample 1: '1' in base 10 → 1.\n\nExample 2: 'A' in base 10 → 10.\n\nExample 3: '10' in base 16 → 16.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, once N is obtained, if use_roman is True, then output int_to_roman(N).\n\nElse, output int_to_str(N, b).\n\nBut wait, in the case where b is not 'R', the output is the number in base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nBut wait, when b is 2, the output is '1' for N=1, which is correct.\n\nBut when the number is zero, but the problem says that the input is not zero.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead a and b from first line.\n\nRead c from second line.\n\nConvert c to integer N in base a.\n\nIf b is 'R', output int_to_roman(N).\n\nElse, output int_to_str(N, b).\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the inputs.\n\nHandle the case where b is 'R'.\n\nImplement the helper functions.\n\nSo, now, writing the code.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros in c?\n\nThe problem says that the output should omit leading zeros.\n\nBut when converting to base b, the function int_to_str will not have leading zeros because it starts from the highest digits.\n\nWait, for example, if N is 5, and base is 2, the function returns '101' which has no leading zeros.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: N=0 → '0', but the problem says N is at least 1.\n\nSo, the code should be safe.\n\nNow, testing with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst case:\n\na=10, b=2.\n\nc is '1' → N=1.\n\nSince b is 2 (not R), output is int_to_str(1, 2) → '1'.\n\nSecond case:\n\na=16, b=R.\n\nc is '5' → N=5.\n\nOutput is int_to_roman(5) → 'V'.\n\nThird case:\n\na=5, b=R.\n\nc is '4' → N=4.\n\nOutput is 'IV'.\n\nFourth case:\n\na=2, b=2.\n\nc is '1111001' → which is binary 1+16+32+64+128 = 241.\n\nOutput is int_to_str(241, 2) → '1111001'.\n\nFifth case:\n\na=12, b=13.\n\nc is 'A' → 10 in base 12.\n\nSo N=10.\n\nSince b is 13, output is int_to_str(10, 13) → 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code should handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first line is given as ['10 2\\n1', ...], but in reality, the code reads from stdin, so the actual code should read via input(), not via a pre-defined list.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    result = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        result = result * base + val\n    return result\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I'),\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef int_to_str(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Read input\nline1 = input().strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nuse_roman = (b_str == 'R')\n\nc = input().strip()\n\n# Convert c to integer\nN = str_to_int(c, a)\n\nif use_roman:\n    print(int_to_roman(N))\nelse:\n    print(int_to_str(N, int(b_str)))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the second line is something like '16 R\\n5'—so when b is R, the code uses the Roman function.\n\nBut in the code above, the line1 is split into a_str and b_str, which are then used to determine a and whether to use Roman numerals.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about when b_str is 'R'? The code sets use_roman to True.\n\nBut in the else case, it uses b_str as the base, which is passed as an integer.\n\nBut wait, in the else case, b_str is a string that may be 'R'? No, because in that case, use_roman is True. So in the else clause, b_str is a valid integer string.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting another example:\n\nInput:\n['2 10\\n10', '3 10\\n33']\n\nSo a=2, b=10.\n\nc is '10' in base 2 → which is 2 in decimal.\n\nSo N is 2.\n\nSince b is 10, output is '2'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 10\\nA']\n\na=3, b=10.\n\nc is 'A' in base 3 → 10 in decimal.\n\nSo output is '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nc is '0' → but the problem says it's not possible.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nWhat about when N is zero? Not possible as per problem statement.\n\nWhat about when c is '0' in base a, but the problem says it's not zero.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to either a Roman numeral or another base `b`. The solution involves reading the input, converting the given number from base `a` to an integer, and then converting this integer to either a Roman numeral or the specified base `b`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the first line to get the bases `a` and `b`. The second part of the first line can be 'R' indicating that the output should be a Roman numeral.\n2. **Convert Base `a` String to Integer:** Convert the given number string from base `a` to an integer using a helper function.\n3. **Convert Integer to Roman Numeral or Base `b`:** Depending on whether `b` is 'R', convert the integer to a Roman numeral using a helper function. Otherwise, convert the integer to the specified base `b` and print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef str_to_int(s, base):\n    result = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        result = result * base + val\n    return result\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I'),\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef int_to_str(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Read input\nline1 = input().strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nuse_roman = (b_str == 'R')\n\nc = input().strip()\n\n# Convert c to integer\nN = str_to_int(c, a)\n\nif use_roman:\n    print(int_to_roman(N))\nelse:\n    print(int_to_str(N, int(b_str)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The first line is split into `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R'. The second line is the number in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion:** The `str_to_int` function converts the base `a` string to an integer by iterating through each character and computing its value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** The `int_to_roman` function converts the integer to a Roman numeral by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values and appending the corresponding Roman symbols.\n4. **Base Conversion:** The `int_to_str` function converts the integer to the specified base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders.\n\nThis approach ensures that the number is correctly converted from base `a` to the desired format, either as a Roman numeral or in another base, efficiently handling both small and large numbers.",
