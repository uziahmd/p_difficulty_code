    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How?\n\nFor each ring, the perimeter is calculated. But since the plate is a grid, the number of cells in a ring is the perimeter minus the corners, but wait, no. Wait, for a rectangle of a certain width and height, the perimeter in terms of cells is (2*(width + height) - 4). Because each side has 'length' cells, but the four corners are counted twice when adding the four sides. So subtracting 4 gives the correct count.\n\nWait, let's take an example. If the rectangle is 3x3, then the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 = 12, but since the corners are counted twice, we subtract 4, giving 8. Which matches the first sample input where 3x3 with k=1 gives 8.\n\nAnother example: 7x9. Let's compute the perimeter:\n\n(7-0)*2 + (9-0)*2 -4 = 14 + 18 -4 = 28. That's the first ring's contribution. Then the second ring would have (7-4)=3 and (9-4)=5. Perimeter is (3*2 +5*2 -4) =6+10-4=12. So total is 28+12=40, which matches the third sample.\n\nSo the approach is to calculate for each ring from 1 to k, the current width and height, compute the perimeter as 2*(w_i + h_i) -4, and sum all these perimeters.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nWe need to loop from i=1 to i=k. For each i, calculate w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1). Then calculate the perimeter as 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Because 2*(w_i + h_i) -4 is the same as 2*(w_i + h_i - 2).\n\nWait, yeah: 2*(w_i + h_i) -4 = 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). So perhaps it's easier to compute 2*(w_i + h_i -2).\n\nBut for each i, we have to make sure that w_i >=3 and h_i >=3, because each ring requires a rectangle of at least 3x3 to form a perimeter. Otherwise, if either w_i or h_i is less than 3, the ring can't be formed, but according to the problem statement, the input ensures that k is such that all rings can be formed. So I don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read w, h, k from input.\n\n2. Initialize total_gilded = 0.\n\n3. For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   b. Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   c. Compute perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   d. Add perimeter to total_gilded.\n\n4. Output total_gilded as the result.\n\nWait, let's test this logic against the samples.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1\n\ni=1: current_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter = 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Total is 8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1\n\ni=1: 7 and ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of successively smaller rectangles inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells on each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is determined by the perimeter of the current rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h - 2)`, which accounts for all the cells along the border.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle, calculate the perimeter, and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the dimensions of the plate (`w` and `h`) and the number of rings (`k`).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height of the rectangle that forms the ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each rectangle, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
