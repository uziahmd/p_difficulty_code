The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. The goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the keys. Each key can unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be unlocked by only one key.\n\nHmm, the condition for a key j to unlock chest i is that a_i + b_j is odd. So that means one must be even and the other odd. Because even plus odd is odd, right?\n\nSo, to rephrase: For a chest to be unlocked by a key, the sum of their values must be odd. That implies that one is even and the other is odd.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because 1 + 2 is 3, which is odd. So yes, a_i and b_j must be of opposite parity.\n\nSo the approach is to match keys and chests where one is even and the other is odd.\n\nBut how do we maximize the number of such pairs?\n\nLet me think about the parities.\n\nFirst, I need to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Similarly, count the number of even and odd keys.\n\nBecause a key can be used on a chest only if their parities are different.\n\nSo for each chest, whether it's even or odd, I can pair it with a key of the opposite parity.\n\nBut since each key can be used once, I need to find the optimal way to assign keys to chests.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to first find the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of even keys, but that might not be enough because maybe some odd chests can be paired with odd keys, but wait no: because a_i and b_j must have opposite parities.\n\nWait no: Wait, if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd. Or if a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\nSo the total possible pairs would be the sum of (number of even a's) * (number of odd b's) plus (number of odd a's) * (number of even b's). But no, because each key can be used only once and each chest can be used only once. So it's more like a bipartite matching problem.\n\nWait, but that's computationally intensive for large n and m. Since n and m can be up to 1e5, we can't use any O(n*m) approach.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two separate cases:\n\nCase 1: Assign even a_i to odd b_j as much as possible.\n\nCase 2: Assign odd a_i to even b_j as much as possible.\n\nThe total maximum is the sum of the minima for each case.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because in each case, the keys used in case 1 cannot be reused in case 2, and vice versa.\n\nSo perhaps the best approach is to calculate for each possible scenario how many pairs we can form, considering the available keys.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nWe have:\n\n- E_a: number of even a_i's.\n\n- O_a: number of odd a_i's.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- E_b: number of even b_j's.\n\n- O_b: number of odd b_j's.\n\nEach even a can be matched with an odd b.\n\nEach odd a can be matched with an even b.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the minimum of E_a and O_b, plus the minimum of O_a and E_b.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the total number of keys used in each category can't exceed the available keys.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSuppose E_a = 3, O_b = 4. So we can take 3 pairs.\n\nSimilarly, O_a=2, E_b=5: we can take 2 pairs.\n\nTotal is 3+2=5.\n\nBut what if E_a is 3, O_b is 2. Then, we can only take 2 from the first part.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to distribute the keys.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the minimum between the sum of E_a + O_a and E_b + O_b, but that seems not directly applicable.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used once, and each chest once.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the minimum between the total number of keys and the total number of chests that can be matched based on parity.\n\nWait, but that's not precise.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a bipartite graph where one set is the chests and the other set is the keys. An edge exists between a chest i and key j if a_i + b_j is odd. We need to find the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut for n and m up",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest only if the sum of the key's value and the chest's value is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd values among the chests and keys.\n2. **Match Even and Odd Values**: For each chest, determine how many keys of the opposite parity are available. The maximum number of chests that can be unlocked is determined by the minimum count of these opposite parity keys.\n3. **Sum of Minimums**: Calculate the total number of chests that can be unlocked by considering both even-to-odd and odd-to-even matches.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, m = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+m]))\n    \n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a += 1\n        else:\n            odd_a += 1\n    \n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_b += 1\n        else:\n            odd_b += 1\n    \n    # Match even_a with odd_b\n    use_even_a = min(even_a, odd_b)\n    remaining_odd_b = odd_b - use_even_a\n    \n    # Match odd_a with even_b\n    use_odd_a = min(odd_a, even_b)\n    \n    total = use_even_a + use_odd_a\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the values on the chests `a`, and the values on the keys `b`.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We count how many even and odd values are present in both the chests and the keys.\n3. **Matching Even and Odd**: We calculate how many chests can be unlocked by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n4. **Output the Result**: The total number of chests that can be unlocked is the sum of the minimum counts from each matching scenario.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
