For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a major and minor triad. \n\nFrom the description:\n- A major triad is when the notes can be ordered such that the distance between the first and second is 4 semitones, and between the second and third is 3 semitones.\n- A minor triad is when the order has distances of 3 and then 4 semitones.\n\nWait, but wait. The distance is measured as from lower to higher in the scale. So for example, C to E is 4 semitones, but E to C would be 8 semitones because you have to go all the way around the cycle.\n\nBut in the problem, when checking for a major or minor triad, we can choose any order of the three notes, not necessarily in the scale's order. So for each possible permutation of the three notes, we need to check if they can form a major or minor triad.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n2. For each permutation (x, y, z), compute the distances between x and y, and y and z.\n3. Check if either of these permutations satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nWait, but the distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher one, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n\nSo first, I need a function to calculate the distance between two notes. How?\n\nEach note can be represented as an index from 0 to 11, since there are 12 notes in total. Let me list them:\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, no, wait: the correct order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Because after H comes C again. So the indexes should be 0 to 11, with H being 11.\n\nWait, let's see: C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F#6, G7, G#8, A9, B10, H11.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nSo for any two notes, say a and b, the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12 if b >=a. Otherwise, it's (12 - (a - b)) % 12. Or another way: the minimal positive difference in the circular arrangement.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the distance is always from the lower to the higher. So for any two distinct notes, the distance is the number of semitones you have to move forward (in the scale) to get from one to the other.\n\nSo for example, the distance between E (4) and C (0) is (0 + 12 -4) = 8? Wait, wait no: because moving forward from E, the next is F, F#, etc., until you reach C. So the distance is 8 semitones.\n\nWait, no: E to C is 8 semitones? Let me count:\n\nE to F: 1\nF to F#: 2\n... up to C: E(4), F(5), F#6, G7, G#8, A9, B10, H11, C0 (but since it's cyclic, it's 12 steps). Wait, but the distance is 8 semitones because from E (4) to C is 8 steps: E (4) → F(5, +1), F#6 (+1), G7 (+1), G#8 (+1), A9 (+1), B10 (+1), H11 (+1), C0 (+1) → total of 8 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the distance between two notes is (b - a) % 12 if a <= b, else (b + 12 - a) % 12. Or more simply, (b - a) % 12, but that might give a negative if a > b. Wait, no, because if a is larger than b, then (b - a) is negative, but mod 12 would wrap it correctly. For example, (0 -4) mod12 is 8.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\ndistance between E (4) and C (0):\n\nE is 4, C is 0. So (0 -4) mod12 is 8. Yes.\n\nBetween C (0) and E (4): 4-0=4 → mod12 is 4.\n\nDistance between C (0) and H (11): 11-0=11 mod12 is 11.\n\nDistance between H (11) and C (0): (0-11) mod12 is 1.\n\nWait, no: H to C is one semitone step, because after H comes C.\n\nSo yes, distance is 1.\n\nSo the function to compute the distance is:\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\nBecause if a < b, it returns the correct forward steps. If a > b, it wraps around.\n\nSo, for each triplet of notes, I need to consider all possible orderings (permutations) and see if any of them satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nLet me think about how to process the input.\n\nThe input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So for example, \"C E G\".\n\nWe can split this into a list of three strings.\n\nThen, for each permutation of this list, compute the distances between the first and second, and second and third.\n\nIf any permutation has the first distance as 4 and the second as 3, then it's a major chord.\n\nIf any permutation has the first distance as 3 and the second as 4, then it's a minor chord.\n\nBut wait, the chord can be arranged in any order, so we need to try all possible orders.\n\nSo for each permutation (x, y, z) in all possible orderings:\n\ncompute d1 = distance(x, y)\n\nd2 = distance(y, z)\n\nif d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies either condition, then we can determine the type.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer will always be unambiguous. So no case where a chord is both major and minor.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n\n2. For each possible permutation of the three notes (all 6 permutations):\n\n   a. Compute d_xy = distance between first and second.\n\n   b. Compute d_yz = distance between second and third.\n\n   c. Check if d_xy is 4 and d_yz is 3 → if so, it's a major chord.\n\n   d. Else, check if d_xy is 3 and d_yz is4 → minor.\n\n3. If any permutation satisfies major → output 'major'.\n\n4. Else, if any permutation satisfies minor → output 'minor'.\n\n5. Else, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, since the chord is unordered, perhaps some permutations could satisfy the major condition and others minor, but according to the problem statement, it's impossible. So once a permutation meets the condition, we can immediately decide.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's better to loop through all permutations, and for each, check if it's major or minor, and keep track of the possible types.\n\nAlternatively, for each permutation, if it's major, we can set a flag and break early, but perhaps it's easier to just collect all possibilities and then decide based on which flags are set.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the answer is always uniquely determined, so only one of the possibilities will be true.\n\nSo perhaps in the code, as soon as a major is found, we can set a variable and break. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut perhaps the code can process all permutations and for each, check if it fits major or minor, and then at the end, see what types were found.\n\nBut the problem says that no chord is both major and minor, so the flags can't both be true.\n\nSo here's the approach:\n\n- For all 6 permutations:\n\n   For each permutation (x,y,z):\n\n      compute d_xy = distance(x,y)\n\n      compute d_yz = distance(y,z)\n\n      if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3 → mark as major.\n\n      elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4 → mark as minor.\n\n- After processing all permutations, see what was marked.\n\nIf any permutation leads to major, output 'major'; else, if any leads to minor, output 'minor'; else, 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code can proceed by:\n\n- Reading the input.\n\n- Create a list of the three notes.\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of this list.\n\n- For each permutation:\n\n   compute d_xy and d_yz.\n\n   check if major condition is met.\n\n   check if minor condition is met.\n\n- Then, after all permutations, decide based on which conditions were met.\n\nNow, the question is, how to represent the notes in a way that the distance function can handle.\n\nSo, first, I'll create a list that maps each note to its index.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the notes include 'H' as the last note. So the list is correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the order is correct.\n\nSo, I can create a dictionary that maps each note to its index, like note_to_index = {'C':0, 'C#':1, ..., 'H':11}.\n\nSo, for each note string, we can look up its index.\n\nOnce I have the indexes, the distance function can compute the distance.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead the input line, split into three notes.\n\nCreate the note_to_index mapping.\n\nConvert each note into their respective indices.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n   d_xy = (y -x) % 12\n\n   d_yz = (z - y) %12\n\n   if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3 → major found.\n\n   elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4 → minor found.\n\nOnce all permutations are checked, determine the output.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, the imports.\n\nWe need itertools.permutations to generate all possible orderings.\n\nSo, import itertools.\n\nThen:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C':0,\n    'C#':1,\n    'D':2,\n    'D#':3,\n    'E':4,\n    'F':5,\n    'F#':6,\n    'G':7,\n    'G#':8,\n    'A':9,\n    'B':10,\n    'H':11\n}\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    d_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3:\n        is_major = True\n    if d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        is_minor = True\n\nThen, after all permutations:\n\nif is_major:\n    print('major')\nelif is_minor:\n    print('minor')\nelse:\n    print('strange')\n\nWait, but this may not be sufficient because in some cases, multiple permutations may trigger the same condition, but since the problem says it's unambiguous, any occurrence is enough.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each permutation, if it satisfies major, is_major is set to True, but remains True even if other permutations also satisfy. But that's fine, because once we find a major, we can break early. But in the current code, the loop doesn't break, so for each permutation, it's checking and setting the flags.\n\nBut wait, the code above is incorrect because it's using a loop that continues to run all permutations, even after is_major is set to True. But the problem is, perhaps some permutation is minor, but another is major. However, the problem says that the answer is unique, so the flags won't be both True.\n\nWait, no. The code sets is_major and is_minor as True if any permutation satisfies the condition. But according to the problem statement, a chord can't be both, so the flags can't both be True.\n\nWait, but suppose that for one permutation, it's major, and for another, minor. But according to the problem, this can't happen.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a chord can have multiple permutations that fit major or minor. For example, maybe the same chord can be ordered in different ways that still satisfy the major condition. But regardless, the code correctly sets the flags.\n\nSo, the code will correctly set is_major to True if any permutation is major, and is_minor to True if any permutation is minor.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, it's impossible for a chord to be both major and minor. So, is_major and is_minor can't both be True.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nLet's process each triplet.\n\nFirst triplet: C, E, G.\n\nIndices:\n\nC:0, E:4, G:7.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nOne permutation is 0,4,7.\n\nd_xy =4-0=4 → 4.\n\nd_yz=7-4=3 →3.\n\nSo this permutation is major. So is_major becomes True.\n\nNo need to check other permutations for this triplet.\n\nSecond triplet: C#, B, F.\n\nWait, the input is C#, B, F.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the second input is \"C# B F\". So the three notes are C#, B, F.\n\nWait, their indices are 1, 10, 5.\n\nLooking for a permutation where the distances are 3 and 4, or 4 and 3.\n\nLet me see.\n\nPossible permutations:\n\n1,10,5: x=1, y=10, z=5.\n\nd_xy = (10-1) mod12 =9 → no.\n\ny to z: (5-10) mod12= (5-10)= -5 mod12=7 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: 1,5,10.\n\nd_xy=5-1=4 →4.\n\nd_yz=10-5=5 → no.\n\nNot major.\n\nAnother permutation: 10,1,5.\n\nd_xy=(1-10) mod12= (1-10)=-9 mod12=3.\n\nd_yz=5-1=4.\n\nSo 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nSo is_minor becomes True.\n\nThird triplet: A, B, H.\n\nIndices: 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck permutations.\n\nPossible permutation: 9,10,11.\n\nd_xy=1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: 9,11,10.\n\nd_xy= (11-9)=2 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: 10,9,11.\n\nd_xy= (9-10) mod12=11 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: 10,11,9.\n\nd_xy=1.\n\nd_yz= (9-11) mod12= 10 → no.\n\nAnother permutation:11,9,10.\n\nd_xy=(9-11)= -2 mod12=10 → no.\n\nAnother permutation:11,10,9.\n\nd_xy=(10-11) mod12=11 → no.\n\nSo none of the permutations for this triplet meet the major or minor condition. So output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n\n- Are all permutations considered correctly? Because in the code, we are using itertools.permutations which generates all possible orderings, including those that start with the same note but in different positions.\n\nWait, but for a set of three notes, the permutations include all possible orderings, including those that have the same elements in different orders.\n\nBut since the code is dealing with indices, it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: what about duplicate notes? Like if two notes are same. But the problem says the input is three notes, but does not specify if they are distinct. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says the input is three notes, but it's a set, meaning that the same note can't appear more than once. Because a set cannot have duplicates.\n\nWait, the problem says: 'unordered set of no less than three notes.' So the input is three distinct notes.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nWhat about when the three notes are same? No, that's not possible, since it's a set.\n\nThus, no issue.\n\nAnother edge case: when the three notes are consecutive, but not forming a major or minor triad.\n\nLike, C, D, E.\n\nBut CDE: the distances are 2 and 2. So not major or minor.\n\nAnother case: C, E, G is major.\n\nAnother case: C, D#, G is a major triad? Well, according to the definition, the distances must be 4 and 3.\n\nC to D# is 2 semitones, D# to G is 5. So no.\n\nWait, C (0), D# (3), G (7).\n\nd_xy=3-0=3, d_yz=7-3=4. So that's 3 and 4, which is minor.\n\nWait, but the ordering matters. So for the notes C, D#, G, the permutation C, D#, G gives d_xy=3, d_yz=4 → minor.\n\nSo this chord is minor.\n\nSo the code correctly identifies it.\n\nAnother test case: E, G, C.\n\nE is 4, G is7, C is0.\n\nIn permutation (4,7,0):\n\nd_xy=3, d_yz= (0-7)=5 mod12=5. No.\n\nBut permutation (7,0,4):\n\nd_xy= (0-7) mod12=5 → no.\n\nWait, no. Wait, permutation (4,7,0):\n\nd_xy =7-4=3.\n\nd_yz =0-7 mod12= (0-7) =-7 mod12=5.\n\nSo 3 and 5: not minor or major.\n\nBut perhaps another permutation.\n\nPermutation (4,0,7):\n\nd_xy=0-4 mod12= 8 → no.\n\nd_yz=7-0=7 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: (0,4,7):\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nSo this chord is major.\n\nSo the code would correctly identify it as major.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the code, the variables is_major and is_minor are initially False, and set to True if any permutation satisfies the condition.\n\nThus, if a chord is major, is_major is set to True, and if any permutation is minor, is_minor is set to True.\n\nBut according to the problem, a chord can't be both major and minor, so at least one of the flags will be True, and the other will be False.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: A major triad is defined by having two specific distances between consecutive notes (4 semitones and 3 semitones), while a minor triad has these distances in reverse order (3 semitones and 4 semitones). The distance between two notes is measured cyclically, meaning after 'H' comes 'C' again.\n\n2. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to an index from 0 to 11 based on its position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distance between notes.\n\n3. **Generating Permutations**: For each set of three notes, generate all possible permutations to check every possible ordering. This ensures that we don't miss any potential major or minor triad.\n\n4. **Checking Triad Conditions**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes. If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, set the corresponding flag.\n\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the flags set during the permutation checks, determine if the chord is major, minor, or neither.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Read the input notes\nnotes = input().split()\n\n# Create a dictionary to map each note to its index\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0, 'C#': 1, 'D': 2, 'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4, 'F': 5, 'F#': 6, 'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8, 'A': 9, 'B': 10, 'H': 11\n}\n\n# Convert each note to its corresponding index\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\n# Flags to check for major and minor triads\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of the three indices\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    # Calculate the distances\n    d_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    d_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    # Check for major triad condition\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3:\n        is_major = True\n    # Check for minor triad condition\n    if d_xy == 3 and d_yz == 4:\n        is_minor = True\n\n# Determine the output based on the flags\nif is_major:\n    print('major')\nelif is_minor:\n    print('minor')\nelse:\n    print('strange')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line containing three space-separated notes.\n2. **Note Index Mapping**: Each note is converted to its corresponding index using a predefined mapping.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three indices.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n5. **Triad Check**: Each permutation is checked against the criteria for major and minor triads, setting the appropriate flags.\n6. **Result Determination**: Based on the flags, the result is printed as 'major', 'minor', or 'strange'.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings are considered, and the correct classification of the triad is determined efficiently.",
