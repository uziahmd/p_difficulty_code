He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or suffix of the original string s. Each string is either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S), and I need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's in the order of the input.\n\nHmm, the input has 2n-2 strings, each of which is either a prefix or a suffix of length 1 to n-1. The goal is to assign each one as P or S correctly.\n\nWait, but how? Because some prefixes might overlap with suffixes, right? So I need to find a way to determine which are prefixes and which are suffixes based on their possible positions in the original string.\n\nLet me think about the structure. For each possible candidate string s, all the prefixes and suffixes must fit into it. But since I don't know s, I have to find a way to group the given strings into prefixes and suffixes such that for some s, all the prefixes are the ones marked as P and suffixes as S.\n\nWait, but the problem says that there exists at least one string s that satisfies the given prefixes and suffixes. So my task is to find any possible assignment of P and S that is consistent with some s.\n\nHow can I approach this?\n\nI remember that in such problems, the key is to build the actual string s by combining the prefixes and suffixes correctly.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to find for each string whether it can be a prefix or a suffix based on overlaps. Like, if two strings are both of the same length, one could be a prefix and the other a suffix, but they must not conflict in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that the original string has certain prefixes and suffixes. So for the entire string, the longest prefix must be the one that is a proper prefix, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nWait, but the problem gives us all the possible prefixes and suffixes except for the full string. So for each possible prefix length k (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings: one is the prefix of length k, and another is a suffix of length k. Or wait, no— because some strings can be both a prefix and a suffix. Like, the string 'aaa' has prefixes like 'a', 'aa' and suffixes 'a', 'aa'. So in this case, the same string is both a prefix and a suffix.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is figure out for each string whether it can be a prefix or a suffix, but considering that a string of length k cannot be a prefix of a longer string if it's also a suffix of a shorter string in a conflicting way.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to find the possible candidates for the original string s.\n\nFor example, consider all possible strings that could satisfy the given prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each such string, mark which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes, and then check if the counts match (since each length from 1 to n-1 must have exactly two strings: one prefix and one suffix). Wait, but the problem statement says that the input has exactly two strings of each length, so that condition is already met.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all possible candidate strings s that can be formed based on the input. Each candidate must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes.\n\nBut how do I generate these candidates? It might be computationally expensive, but given n is up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the candidate s can be built step by step.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for each possible string s_candidate, check whether all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate. If yes, then this is a valid s. Once I find such an s_candidate, I can then assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut with n up to 100, generating all possible s_candidates is impossible because the number of possibilities is 26^100, which is way too big.\n\nSo that approach won't work.\n\nAlternative approach: find the correct grouping by considering the relationships between the strings.\n\nEach string is either a prefix or a suffix. So for each string of length k, it's either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nNow, for the correct s, the prefixes are the ones that are the first k characters of s, and the suffixes are the last k.\n\nMoreover, for any k, the prefix of length k must be a prefix of the string, and the suffix of length k must be a suffix of the string.\n\nAdditionally, for the correct s, the string formed by the maximum possible prefix and the maximum possible suffix must be compatible. That is, the maximum prefix is the longest possible prefix, and the maximum suffix is the longest possible suffix. And these two must not overlap in a way that would make s invalid.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a graph where nodes represent possible prefixes and suffixes, and edges represent overlapping possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to find, for each possible string length k, whether the two strings of length k can be a prefix and a suffix.\n\nWait, but for each k, exactly one of them is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. Or wait, no, because a string could be both a prefix and a suffix. Hmm, but in that case, it's both.\n\nWait, for example, if the original string is 'aaa', then for k=1, the strings are 'a' and 'a' (so both could be considered as either prefix or suffix). For k=2, the strings are 'aa' and 'aa', again same situation.\n\nSo, for each k, the two strings of that length must be compatible with being the prefix and suffix. But how?\n\nWait, let's think about the structure of the original string s.\n\nSuppose s is of length n.\n\nLet’s denote p_k as the prefix of length k, and s_k as the suffix of length k.\n\nThen, p_{k} = s[0..k-1], and s_k = s[n-k..n-1].\n\nFor each k, p_{k} must be a prefix, and s_k must be a suffix.\n\nMoreover, for k < l, p_l must start with p_k. Similarly, s_k must end with s_l.\n\nWait, no. Because if l > k, the prefix of length l is p_k followed by some more characters. Similarly, the suffix of length l is the last l characters, which includes the suffix of length k.\n\nSo, for the entire structure to hold, the p's form a chain where each p_{k+1} starts with p_k, and the s's form a chain where each s_{k+1} ends with s_k.\n\nSo, for each k from 1 to n-1, p_k is the prefix of length k, and s_k is the suffix of length k.\n\nAdditionally, for any k, the suffix s_k must be the suffix of the original string s, which is also the last k characters.\n\nSimilarly, the prefix p_k is the first k characters.\n\nBut how to model this for all k.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to find for each possible k, what the p_k and s_k could be, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but how to do that.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum prefix is p_max, which is the longest possible prefix in the input. Similarly, the maximum suffix is s_max, which is the longest possible suffix in the input.\n\nBut for s to exist, the maximum prefix p_max must be a substring that can be extended to form s, and the maximum suffix s_max must be a substring that can be extended from the beginning.\n\nMoreover, the last character of p_max must equal the first character of s_max, otherwise, it's impossible to combine them into a single string s.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Because the last character of the prefix must be the same as the first character of the suffix.\n\nSo, for example, if the maximum prefix is 'aba' and the maximum suffix is 'bab', then the last character of 'aba' is 'a', and the first character of 'bab' is 'b'. So this is impossible, meaning that the two can't coexist as the maximum prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, the first step is to find for each possible maximum prefix and maximum suffix that can be combined into a single string s.\n\nWait, but how to find the maximum prefix and maximum suffix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible prefix is the longest string among the prefixes, and the maximum possible suffix is the longest string among the suffixes.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum prefix is the string of length (n-1) that is a prefix of s. Similarly for the suffix.\n\nSo, for the given input, among all the strings of length (n-1), one will be the maximum prefix, and the other will be the maximum suffix.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the maximum prefix of s is a string of length n-1, which is a prefix of s. Similarly, the maximum suffix is a string of length n-1, which is a suffix of s.\n\nBut in the input, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. One of them is the maximum prefix, and the other is the maximum suffix.\n\nSo, the first step is to select which of the two n-1-length strings is the maximum prefix and which is the maximum suffix.\n\nWait, but how do I determine which is which.\n\nBecause the maximum prefix and maximum suffix may not be compatible. So perhaps I can try both possibilities and see which leads to a valid solution.\n\nSo, for each of the two possible assignments (prefix_p and suffix_s), check if they can form a valid s.\n\nIf they can, then proceed to build the rest of the structure.\n\nBut how to check if they can form a valid s.\n\nOnce I've assigned the maximum prefix and suffix, the next step is to see if the next level down (length n-2) can be split into prefixes and suffixes that fit into the remaining structure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as building a tree of possible prefixes and suffixes, ensuring that each step aligns correctly.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAn alternative approach is to note that for each possible assignment of P and S, the resulting string s must have the following properties:\n\n- All the P's are prefixes, and all the S's are suffixes.\n- For each k, the P's of length k must be the prefix of the P's of length k+1.\n- Similarly, the S's of length k must be the suffix of the S's of length k+1.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, for k=2, the prefix could be 'ab', and for k=3, the prefix is 'aba'. So the k=2 prefix is the first two characters of the k=3 prefix.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffixes, for k=2, the suffix is 'ba', and for k=3, the suffix is 'aba' — which is the last three characters of the original string, which must end with 'ba'.\n\nSo, the suffix of length 3 must end with the suffix of length 2.\n\nSo, for each k, the suffix of length k+1 must be the suffix of the suffix of length k plus some characters before it.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of length k+1 is the last k+1 characters, which includes the suffix of length k as its last k characters.\n\nSo, the suffix of length k+1 must end with the suffix of length k.\n\nSo, for each possible k, the suffix of length k+1 must be a string that ends with the suffix of length k.\n\nSimilarly, the prefix of length k+1 must start with the prefix of length k.\n\nSo, this gives us a way to build the possible s.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. For each possible pair of maximum prefix (p) and maximum suffix (s), check if the last character of p equals the first character of s.\n\n   - If not, this pair is invalid, skip.\n   - If yes, proceed.\n\n2. Now, for the next lower length (n-2), check the two strings of that length. One will be a prefix, and the other a suffix.\n\n   - The prefix must be a prefix of p, i.e., it must be a prefix of the current maximum prefix.\n   - The suffix must be a suffix of s, i.e., it must be a suffix of the current maximum suffix.\n\n   - Also, the new prefix must start with the previous prefix, and the new suffix must end with the previous suffix.\n\n3. Continue this process recursively for each lower length until all lengths are processed.\n\n4. Once a valid assignment is found, assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThis seems like a recursive problem, but n is up to 100, so recursion might be feasible, but perhaps an iterative approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the possible state as the current maximum prefix and suffix, and for each step, try to find the possible next prefix and suffix that fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to model this as a trie of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by building the string step by step, starting from the maximum prefix and suffix and working our way down.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- For each possible assignment of the two (n-1)-length strings as prefix and suffix (if compatible), proceed.\n\n- For each such assignment, build the possible s by combining the prefix and suffix, ensuring that the next layers (k-1) can be correctly assigned.\n\nLet's take the example from the problem.\n\nIn the first example, n=5.\n\nThe input includes strings of various lengths. Among the 5-1=4-length strings, there are two, say 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nWe need to choose which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nAssume that 'abab' is the prefix. Then the suffix must be 'baba' or something else? Or wait, no—the maximum suffix would have to be a string of length 4, which is a suffix of the original string.\n\nWait, no, the maximum suffix is the longest possible suffix, which is of length 4.\n\nSo, if the maximum suffix is 'baba', then the original string s must end with 'baba', and the maximum prefix 'abab' must start with 'abab'.\n\nThen, the next step is to look at the 3-length strings.\n\nEach 3-length string can be a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut for the prefix, it must be a prefix of 'abab', so it must be either 'aba' or 'aab' or whatever, but in this case, the possible 3-length prefix is 'aba' (since 'abab' is the 4-length prefix).\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the 3-length strings are 'aab', 'aba', etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe another approach is to find for each possible s_candidate, which is built by combining the maximum prefix and suffix, and then check if all other strings fit.\n\nBut again, for n=100, this is impractical.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can construct the s_candidate step by step.\n\nStart with the maximum prefix and maximum suffix.\n\nThen, for each step, take the next lower length and see if the possible prefix is a prefix of the current maximum prefix, and the possible suffix is a suffix of the current maximum suffix.\n\nWait, let's try to outline this.\n\nInitialize:\n\ncurrent_max_prefix = p (the chosen 4-length string)\ncurrent_max_suffix = s (the other 4-length string)\n\nThen, for k = 3 downto 1:\n\n   take the two strings of length k.\n\n   One is the next prefix, the other is the next suffix.\n\n   Check:\n\n      prefix_candidate must be a prefix of current_max_prefix.\n\n      suffix_candidate must be a suffix of current_max_suffix.\n\n   Also, the next prefix must be a prefix of the previous prefix.\n\n   Wait, no. The next prefix (k) must be a prefix of the current_max_prefix (k+1).\n\n   Similarly, the next suffix (k) must be a suffix of the current_max_suffix (k+1).\n\nWait, maybe the process is:\n\nFor each k from (n-1) downto 1:\n\n   Take the two strings of length k.\n\n   Assume that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\n   Check if the prefix is a prefix of the current_max_prefix of length k+1.\n\n   Check if the suffix is a suffix of the current_max_suffix of length k+1.\n\n   Also, the next prefix (for k-1) must be a prefix of the current prefix (k).\n\n   Similarly, the next suffix (k) must be a suffix of the current suffix (k+1).\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting somewhere.\n\nBut the problem is how to choose which of the two strings of length k is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBecause for each k, there are two options: first string is prefix, second is suffix; or vice versa.\n\nSo, for each k, we can try both possibilities and see if they fit with the current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix.\n\nBut this could lead to a lot of branching, but perhaps for small n, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For the two (n-1)-length strings, try each possible assignment as current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix. Check if their last character matches (to form s). If not, skip this assignment.\n\n2. For each valid initial assignment, proceed to the next lower k (n-2), and for each k, try both possible assignments for the two strings of length k, checking if they fit as prefix and suffix of the current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix.\n\n3. Continue this until all k are processed.\n\n4. Once a valid complete assignment is found, mark all the strings as P or S accordingly.\n\n5. Output the corresponding string.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be implemented using backtracking or depth-first search, trying each possible assignment at each step.\n\nBut given that n is up to 100, and for each step there are 2 possibilities (which of the two strings is the prefix), this would result in 2^(n-1) possibilities, which for n=100 is way too large.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: since the structure must form a chain where each step builds upon the previous, perhaps we can greedily assign the prefix and suffix for each k.\n\nAt each step k, the current_max_prefix must start with the current_max_prefix of k-1, and the current_max_suffix must end with the current_max_suffix of k-1.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the key.\n\nSo, for each k, the two strings of length k must be compatible with the current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix.\n\nMoreover, the current_max_prefix for k must be a prefix of the current_max_prefix for k+1, and the current_max_suffix for k must be a suffix of the current_max_suffix for k+1.\n\nSo, for each k from (n-1) down to 1:\n\n   We have two possible strings of length k: A and B.\n\n   We need to assign one as the current_max_prefix and the other as current_max_suffix.\n\n   But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the current_max_prefix for k must be a prefix of the current_max_prefix for k+1.\n\nSimilarly, current_max_suffix for k must be a suffix of current_max_suffix for k+1.\n\nSo, for each k, the current_max_prefix(k) is a prefix of current_max_prefix(k+1).\n\nSimilarly, current_max_suffix(k) is a suffix of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nSo, for each k, the current_max_prefix(k) must be a prefix of the current_max_prefix(k+1), and current_max_suffix(k) must be a suffix of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nSo, given that, perhaps for each k, the two possible strings (A and B) can only be the current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix if one is a prefix of the current_max_prefix(k+1) and the other is a suffix of the current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nWait, but how to determine which is which.\n\nPerhaps for each k, the current_max_prefix(k) is the one that is a prefix of current_max_prefix(k+1), and the current_max_suffix(k) is the one that is a suffix of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nWait, but this may not always hold, as sometimes the two strings may have other relations.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the two strings of length k must be such that one is a prefix of the current_max_prefix(k+1) and the other is a suffix of the current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nBut that's not necessarily true, because for k, the two strings could be different than the ones for k+1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the process as follows:\n\nWe'll build the possible current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix for each k, starting from the highest (n-1) down to 1.\n\nAt each step, for k, we have two possible strings: A and B.\n\nWe need to choose one as the current_max_prefix and the other as the current_max_suffix.\n\nBut these choices must satisfy:\n\n1. The current_max_prefix for k is a prefix of the current_max_prefix for k+1.\n\n2. The current_max_suffix for k is a suffix of the current_max_suffix for k+1.\n\n3. The last character of current_max_prefix(k+1) must equal the first character of current_max_suffix(k+1), because when we combine them into the full string s, the last character of the prefix and the first character of the suffix must match.\n\nWait, yes! Because s is formed by the current_max_prefix(k+1) followed by some string, but the current_max_suffix(k+1) is the suffix. So the last character of the prefix and the first character of the suffix must be the same.\n\nWait, no. Because the current_max_prefix(k+1) is the first (k+1) characters of s, and the current_max_suffix(k+1) is the last (k+1) characters of s. So the last character of the prefix is s[k], and the first character of the suffix is s[n - (k+1)].\n\nBut for these to be compatible, the last character of the prefix must equal the first character of the suffix.\n\nYes, that's a necessary condition.\n\nSo, for each k+1, the last character of current_max_prefix(k+1) must equal the first character of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nTherefore, for each step, when choosing the current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix for k, the following must hold:\n\n- current_max_prefix(k) is a prefix of current_max_prefix(k+1).\n\n- current_max_suffix(k) is a suffix of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\n- The last character of current_max_prefix(k+1) must equal the first character of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nSo, the algorithm can be structured as follows:\n\n- Start with the two (n-1)-length strings. Check which pair (A, B) satisfies that A is a prefix of the full s, B is a suffix of s, and the last character of A equals the first character of B.\n\n   - For example, if A is 'abab' and B is 'baba', does 'abab' end with 'b'? No. So, this pair is invalid.\n\nWait, no: 'abab' ends with 'b', and 'baba' starts with 'b', so yes, it's compatible.\n\nWait, but in this case, the combination would be 'abab' + 'a' (some middle part) + 'baba'? No, because 'abab' is the prefix, and 'baba' is the suffix. So, the full string s would be 'abab...baba', but the last character of the prefix is 'b' and the first of the suffix is 'b', so it's okay.\n\nSo, in the first step, for k+1 = n-1, we have two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\ncurrent_max_prefix = A, current_max_suffix = B, and last char of A == first char of B.\n\nOr:\n\ncurrent_max_prefix = B, current_max_suffix = A, and last char of B == first char of A.\n\nSo, for each possibility, proceed.\n\nOnce a valid pair is found, proceed to k = n-2.\n\nFor k = n-2, we have two strings, C and D.\n\nWe need to assign one as current_max_prefix(k) and the other as current_max_suffix(k).\n\nConstraints:\n\n- current_max_prefix(k) must be a prefix of current_max_prefix(k+1) (A or B, depending on earlier choice).\n\n- current_max_suffix(k) must be a suffix of current_max_suffix(k+1) (B or A, depending on earlier choice).\n\nAdditionally, the last character of current_max_prefix(k+1) must equal the first character of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nWait, but this is already enforced by the earlier step.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment of C and D as current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix, check if:\n\nC is a prefix of current_max_prefix(k+1).\n\nD is a suffix of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nAlso, the last character of current_max_prefix(k+1) must equal the first character of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nWait, but this last condition was already checked in the previous step.\n\nSo, perhaps for each step, the last character condition is already ensured, and we just need to ensure that the current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix fit into the chain.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment at k, check if C is a prefix of the current_max_prefix(k+1) and D is a suffix of the current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\nIf yes, proceed to the next k.\n\nOnce all k are processed, the assignment is valid.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n\n- For each possible initial assignment of the (n-1)-length strings (as current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix):\n\n   - Check if the last character of the current_max_prefix matches the first character of the current_max_suffix.\n\n   - If yes, proceed.\n\n   - For each k from (n-2) downto 1:\n\n      - Take the two strings of length k, say A and B.\n\n      - Try both possibilities:\n\n         - current_max_prefix = A, current_max_suffix = B.\n\n         - Check if A is a prefix of the current_max_prefix(k+1) and B is a suffix of current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\n         - If yes, proceed to next k.\n\n         - Else, try the other possibility.\n\n         - If neither works, backtrack to the previous step and try the other initial assignment.\n\n   - If all k are processed successfully, then this is a valid assignment.\n\nOnce a valid assignment is found, assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut implementing this requires keeping track of the current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix for each k.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be structured as a recursive function, but for n up to 100, recursion may hit stack limits. Alternatively, use memoization or iterative approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved greedily by building the possible s step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: the original string s can be uniquely determined by the intersection of the maximum prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Find the maximum prefix and maximum suffix.\n\n   - For each possible pair of the two (n-1)-length strings, check if they can form a valid s.\n\n2. For the maximum prefix and suffix, attempt to build the string s by matching the next lower prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the original string s can be uniquely determined by the maximum prefix and the maximum suffix, provided they are compatible.\n\nSo, once the maximum prefix and suffix are chosen, the rest can be built accordingly.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- For the two (n-1)-length strings, check both possibilities for maximum prefix and suffix.\n\n- For each, see if they can be extended into a full string s.\n\nOnce s is determined, all the prefixes and suffixes can be marked as P or S.\n\nBut how to find s.\n\nWait, perhaps s can be constructed as follows:\n\ns = current_max_prefix + middle + current_max_suffix.\n\nBut the middle part is unknown.\n\nBut for the other strings of lower lengths, they must be either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to construct s by taking the maximum prefix and suffix, and then ensuring that the other strings fit into s as either prefixes or suffixes.\n\nBut this seems circular.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to construct s is:\n\ns starts with the maximum prefix, ends with the maximum suffix, and for each k, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\nBut how to find s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps s can be built as follows:\n\ns = current_max_prefix + ... + current_max_suffix.\n\nBut the '...' is the part that connects the prefix and suffix, but we don't know.\n\nBut then, for each k, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k.\n\nSo, for example, for k=4, the prefix is the maximum prefix, and the suffix is the maximum suffix.\n\nFor k=3, the prefix must be a substring of the maximum prefix, and the suffix must be a substring of the maximum suffix.\n\nSo, perhaps the process is:\n\nFor each possible initial assignment of maximum prefix and suffix:\n\n   - Check if their last and first characters match.\n\n   - Then, for k = n-2 downto 1:\n\n      - Take the two strings of length k.\n\n      - Check if one is a prefix of the current_max_prefix and the other is a suffix of the current_max_suffix.\n\n      - If yes, proceed.\n\n      - Else, this assignment is invalid.\n\n   - If all k pass, then this is a valid assignment.\n\nOnce such an assignment is found, construct s as follows:\n\ns starts with the maximum prefix, ends with the maximum suffix, and the middle part is determined by the overlapping of the next lower prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be determined by combining the maximum prefix and suffix, and then filling in the middle part by ensuring that the other strings fit as either prefixes or suffixes.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\nSo n=5.\n\nThe 4-length strings are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nAssume that 'abab' is the maximum prefix and 'baba' is the maximum suffix.\n\nCheck if the last character of 'abab' is 'b' and the first character of 'baba' is 'b' → yes.\n\nThen, for k=3:\n\nThe two strings are 'aba' and 'aba'.\n\nWait, but looking at the input, the 3-length strings are 'aab', 'aba', 'aab', 'aba'?\n\nWait, the sample input isn't clear, but assuming that for k=3, the two strings are 'aba' and 'aba'.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the two are the same. So, perhaps for k=3, both are prefixes or suffixes.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, the only possible string is 'ababa'.\n\nSo, the maximum prefix is 'abab' and the maximum suffix is 'baba'.\n\nWait, but 'abab' is the first four characters, and 'baba' is the last four. How can this form 'ababa'?\n\nAh, because the full string is 'ababa', which has length 5.\n\nThe maximum prefix of length 4 is 'abab', and the maximum suffix of length 4 is 'baba' (last four letters).\n\nSo, the full string is 'abab' + 'a' + 'baba'? No, that's 4+1+4=9 letters, which is wrong.\n\nWait, no. The full string is 'ababa' (5 letters). The maximum prefix is 'abab' (first four letters), and the maximum suffix is 'baba' (last four letters). But 'ababa' is five letters. So, the maximum suffix of four letters is the last four letters, which are 'baba' (positions 1-4). So the full string is 'ababa', which is correct.\n\nSo, when processing k=3, the two strings are 'aba' (from the input).\n\nWait, but the two strings of length 3 are 'aba' and 'aba' (but that's not possible, because in the input, each length has two distinct strings. So perhaps the two 3-length strings are 'aba' and 'aba' again? Or maybe 'aab' and 'aba'? I'm not sure.\n\nBut regardless, for k=3, the two strings must be 'aba' and 'aba' (assuming the sample).\n\nWait, but then for k=3, the current_max_prefix(k+1) is 'abab', which starts with 'aba'.\n\nSimilarly, the current_max_suffix(k+1) is 'baba', which ends with 'aba'.\n\nSo, for k=3, the two strings are 'aba' and 'aba'.\n\nSo, in this case, both can be considered as the prefix and suffix.\n\nThus, for k=3, the assignment is straightforward.\n\nProceeding down to k=2.\n\nFor k=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ab'.\n\nAgain, the current_max_prefix(k+1) is 'aba', which starts with 'ab'.\n\nThe current_max_suffix(k+1) is 'aba', which ends with 'ab'.\n\nThus, for k=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ab'.\n\nSo, any assignment is possible.\n\nFinally, for k=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a'.\n\nSame as above.\n\nThus, in this case, the initial assignment of 'abab' as the maximum prefix and 'baba' as the maximum suffix leads to a valid s of 'ababa'.\n\nSo, the algorithm would find this.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Iterate over all possible initial pairs (A, B) for the (n-1)-length strings.\n\n   - For each, check if A's last character is equal to B's first character.\n\n   - If yes, proceed.\n\n   - Then, for each k from (n-2) downto 1:\n\n      - Get the two strings of length k: C and D.\n\n      - Try both possibilities: (C is prefix, D is suffix) and (D is prefix, C is suffix).\n\n      - For each possibility:\n\n         - Check if C is a prefix of the current_max_prefix(k+1).\n\n         - Check if D is a suffix of the current_max_suffix(k+1).\n\n         - If both conditions are met, proceed to next k.\n\n         - Else, try the other possibility.\n\n      - If neither possibility works, backtrack to previous k and try the other initial assignment.\n\n   - If all k are processed, this is a valid assignment.\n\nOnce a valid assignment is found, the rest is straightforward: mark each input string as P or S based on their role.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n1. Read all the input strings, group them by their lengths.\n\n2. For each possible initial assignment of the (n-1)-length strings, check if they can form a valid chain.\n\n3. Once a valid assignment is found, assign P and S accordingly.\n\n4. Output the result.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut for n up to 100, and each step having 2 possibilities, the code must avoid excessive computation.\n\nImplementing this as a recursive function could be feasible, but perhaps an iterative approach is better.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that for each k, the current_max_prefix and current_max_suffix can be stored, and passed along as we go down.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the best approach is:\n\n- Preprocess the input strings into a dictionary mapping length to list of strings.\n\n- For each initial pair (A, B) of the (n-1)-length strings:\n\n   - Check if A[-1] == B[0]. If not, continue.\n\n   - Set current_max_prefix = A, current_max_suffix = B.\n\n   - Proceed to k = n-2.\n\n   - For each k:\n\n      - Get the two strings of length k: str1 and str2.\n\n      - Try both possibilities:\n\n         - Assign str1 as prefix_candidate and str2 as suffix_candidate.\n\n         - Check if prefix_candidate is a prefix of current_max_prefix and suffix_candidate is a suffix of current_max_suffix.\n\n         - If yes, proceed to next k.\n\n         - Else, try the other way around.\n\n         - If neither works, break and try next initial assignment.\n\n   - If all k are processed, then this is a valid assignment.\n\nOnce a valid assignment is found, assign each string in the input as P or S based on whether it is a prefix or suffix in the assignment.\n\nBut how to manage the order of the input strings.\n\nWait, the input is given as 2n-2 lines. For each string in the input, we need to determine whether it is a prefix or suffix in the valid assignment.\n\nSo, during the process of finding the valid assignment, we can keep track of which strings are assigned as prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut perhaps the assignment is built by, for each k, knowing which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nThus, for each k, we can note whether the two strings of that length are prefixes or suffixes.\n\nBut the problem is that the input may not be ordered by length. So, the code needs to process the input strings and group them by their lengths, then process them in decreasing order of length.\n\nSo, steps for code:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read 2n-2 strings, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace (like the '\\n').\n\n   - Store them in a list.\n\n3. Group them by their lengths into a dictionary, say 'by_length', where keys are the lengths and values are lists of strings.\n\n4. For each possible initial assignment of the (n-1)-length strings:\n\n   a. Let A be one, B be the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of the original string.
