For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem:\n\nA triad consists of three notes. The triad is major if, after sorting the notes in some order, the distances between consecutive notes are 4 and 3 semitones. For minor, it's the opposite: 3 and 4 semitones respectively. If neither condition is met, it's strange.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three notes from input.\n2. Convert each note into its corresponding position in the 12-note scale.\n3. Generate all possible orderings (permutations) of these three notes.\n4. For each permutation, check the distances between consecutive notes, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n5. Determine if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n6. Based on that, output the result.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the notes numerically. Since the notes are in a cycle of 12, I can assign each note an index from 0 to 11. For example:\n\nC = 0\nC# = 1\nD = 2\n...\nH = 11\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indices would be:\n\nC → 0\nC# → 1\nD → 2\nD# →3\nE→4\nF→5\nF#→6\nG→7\nG#→8\nA→9\nB→10\nH→11.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, first, I'll create a dictionary to map each note to its index.\n\nOnce I have the indexes, I can generate all possible permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, I'll compute the distances between the first and second, and second and third.\n\nBut since the scale is cyclic, the distance between two notes X and Y (where X is before Y) is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, in the problem statement, it says that the distance is measured from the lower to the higher note. So, for example, the distance from C to H is (11 - 0 + 12) ? No, because adding 12 would make it 11, but the distance is computed as (Y - X) * 1 semitone. Wait, the problem says that between two consecutive notes, there is exactly one semitone. So the distance is (Y - X) in terms of semitones, which is equal to their positions in the list minus each other. But since the scale is cyclic, we have to wrap around.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe distance from note A to note B is the number of semitones you have to move up from A to reach B. So, for example, the distance from C to E is 4 semitones. Because C→C# is 1, C#→D is another, D→D# another, D#→E another. So four steps.\n\nIf we go from E to C, that's 8 semitones because E→F is 1, F→F# is 2, ..., H→C is 8 steps.\n\nSo, the distance is (B_position - A_position) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12.\n\nWait, no. Because if B comes after A in the list, then the distance is (B - A). If B comes before A, then it's (12 - (A - B)).\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to compute (B - A) mod 12, but when calculating the actual distance, since it's from lower to higher, it's always (B - A) if B is after A, else (12 - (A - B)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute (B_pos - A_pos) % 12. Because modulo 12 will give the correct positive distance when considering the circular arrangement.\n\nFor example:\n\nC (0) to E (4): 4-0=4 → 4 semitones.\n\nE (4) to C (0): (0-4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct because E to C is 8 semitones.\n\nSimilarly, H (11) to C (0): (0-11) mod12 is 1? Wait, no. Wait, H is 11, C is 0. The distance from H to C is 1 semitone (since H is followed by C). So, according to the formula, (0-11) mod12 is -11 mod12 = 1. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) % ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither (strange). The solution involves understanding the structure of musical chords and using modular arithmetic to compute distances between notes on a cyclic scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Notes to Indices**: Map each note to its corresponding index in a 12-note cyclic scale.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Consider all possible orderings of the three notes since the triad can be in any order.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Check Conditions**: Determine if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor chord.
