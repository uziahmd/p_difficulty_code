Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters of the guest and host, they should exactly match the pile, without any extra letters left over or missing.\n\nHmm, so the input has three lines. The first line is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile. All are uppercase letters. I need to determine if the pile can be rearranged to form both names together.\n\nSo, the approach here seems clear. We need to count all the letters in the guest and host names combined, and then compare that to the counts in the pile. If they match exactly, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle this in Python? Let's think.\n\nFirst, I'll read the three lines from the input. Then, I'll process each of them by counting the frequency of each character.\n\nFor each line (guest, host, pile), I can convert them into a Counter object. Then, for the guest and host, I'll add their counters together. If this sum equals the counter of the pile, then it's possible.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the three lines: guest, host, pile.\n2. Combine guest and host into a single string.\n3. Count the letters in this combined string.\n4. Count the letters in the pile string.\n5. Compare the two counts. If they are equal, print \"YES\"; else, print \"NO\".\n\nWait, but what about the order? Oh, right, because the order doesn't matterâ€”only the counts of each letter. So using Counter is perfect here.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nEdge cases could include:\n- Both guest and host names are empty? But the problem says each line is not empty.\n- Pile has the exact same letters as guest plus host, but in a different order.\n- Some letters are present in more quantity than required.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nIn Python, I can use the collections.Counter class. So, I'll import Counter from collections.\n\nRead the inputs: Since the input is given via standard input, I can read three lines using input().strip().\n\nSo, code structure would be something like:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, create the combined guest_host string.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nCreate counters:\n\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nThen, check if counter_combined == counter_pile.\n\nIf yes, print \"YES\"; else, print \"NO\".\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the lengths don't match? For example, if the combined length is not equal to the pile's length. Well, the Counters would naturally handle that, because if the lengths differ, some counts would differ. So no separate check is needed.\n\nTesting the example given:\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nGuest: 'SANTACLAUS'\nHost: 'DEDMOROZ'\nPile: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined guest+host: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'\n\nCounting all letters, the total should match the pile.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nGuest and Host combined may have a letter missing, and an extra in the pile. The Counter comparison will catch that.\n\nThird sample: The pile has an extra L, which the Counter will show as a discrepancy.\n\nSo, this approach should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's all. Now, write the code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given pile of letters can be used to exactly form the names of a guest and a host. The goal is to check if the letters in the pile match exactly with the combined letters of the guest's and host's names without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Count Letters**: Use a counter to count the frequency of each letter in the combined string of the guest and host names.\n4. **Compare Pile Letters**: Use another counter to count the frequency of each letter in the pile. Compare this counter with the counter from the combined names.\n5. **Check Equality**: If the two counters are equal, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of letters using their frequencies, which is both concise and effective.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines of input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names into one string\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Create counters for the combined names and the pile\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n# Check if the counters are equal\nif counter_combined == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as three separate strings representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated to form a single string which includes all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Counting Letters**: Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: By comparing the two counters, we can determine if the pile contains exactly the right number of each letter needed to form both names. If they match, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names exactly, otherwise, it cannot.\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
