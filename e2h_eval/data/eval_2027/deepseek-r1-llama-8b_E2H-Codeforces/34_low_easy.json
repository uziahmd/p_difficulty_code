And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is probably not going to work because that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved. For each possible window of size k, I need to sum those k elements, add all those sums together, and then divide by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1). That makes sense.\n\nBut if I do it naively by sliding a window and adding each time, that's O(n*k), which is definitely not feasible when n is 2e5. So I need a smarter way.\n\nOh right! I remember there's a sliding window technique that uses prefix sums to compute these things quickly. Prefix sums allow us to calculate the sum of a subarray in constant time after some initial computation.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array of the given list. This will help in quickly calculating the sum of any k-length window.\n2. Iterate through each possible starting index of the window (from 0 to n-k inclusive), calculate the sum using the prefix array, add it to a total sum.\n3. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nWait, but wait. How do I compute the prefix sums correctly? Let's see: the prefix sum at index i is the sum of the first i elements. Then the sum from j+1 to j+k is prefix[j+k] - prefix[j]. Right.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and k.\n- Read the list of a_i.\n- Compute the prefix sum array.\n- For each start index j from 0 to (n - k), calculate the sum of a[j..j+k-1] using the prefix array.\n- Sum all these window sums into a total.\n- Divide the total by the number of windows (n -k +1) to get the average.\n- Output the average with sufficient precision.\n\nYes, that sounds manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation details.\n\nFirst, handling the prefix sum:\n\nIn Python, the easiest way is to create a list where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. Then for j in 0 to (n -k), the window starts at index j, includes j to j + k -1. So the sum is prefix[j + k] - prefix[j].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the indices might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the original array is 0-based, then the sum from index i to i + k -1 is prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nInitialize total_sum = 0.\n\nFor j in range(0, n - k + 1):\n\n    current_sum = prefix[j + k] - prefix[j]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nThen, output the average with enough decimal places.\n\nBut wait, what about the precision? The output needs to have at least 6 digits after the decimal point. So we need to format the output accordingly.\n\nAlso, considering that the numbers can be large, but in Python, floating points handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the prefix sum correctly. Make sure that the prefix is built correctly, with prefix[0] =0, and each subsequent element adds the next a_i.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether k is equal to n. In that case, there's only one window, so the average is just the sum of all elements divided by 1.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nThe weeks are [3,4], [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11. Total is 18, average is 9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n1 1\n10\n\nOnly one week, sum is 10, average is 10.\n\nSample Input 3:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nn=8, k=2. So n-k+1=7 windows.\n\nEach window is (1,2), (2,4), (4,1e5), (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on given data. Each week is defined as k consecutive days, and we need to consider all such weeks from the given n days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks of k consecutive days. Given the constraints, a direct approach would be inefficient, so we use a more optimized method involving prefix sums.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: We use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time. This helps in quickly computing the sum of each window of k days.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: Using the prefix sum array, we iterate through each possible starting index of the window, compute the sum of each window, and accumulate the total sum of all windows.\n4. **Average Calculation**: After accumulating the total sum of all windows, we compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows, which is \\( n - k + 1 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n\n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\n    total = 0\n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    for j in range(num_windows):\n        end = j + k\n        total += prefix[end] - prefix[j]\n\n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers `n`, `k`, and the list `a` representing sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: A prefix sum array is constructed where each element at index `i` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep times. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Window Sum Calculation**: For each possible starting index of a window of size `k`, the sum is computed using the prefix sum array. These sums are accumulated into a total.\n4. **Average Computation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, which is then printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively, providing the correct result within the required precision.",
