Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The conditions for an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All the other squares (the ones not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to check the diagonals. Then, check the non-diagonal parts.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the grid. Since n is odd, the grid is square with a center point. The two diagonals intersect at the center.\n\nSo for each grid, I need to:\n\n- Check that all the main diagonal elements are the same character. The main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right.\n- Check that all the anti-diagonal elements are the same character. The anti-diagonal goes from top-right to bottom-left.\n- Also, ensure that the main and anti-diagonal characters are different. Because if they were the same, then all letters except the diagonals would have to be another same character, but wait—no, because the condition says the non-diagonal squares must be the same as each other but different from the diagonals. So the diagonals can have the same letter only if the other squares are a different single letter.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first condition says both diagonals are the same letter. So the main and anti-diagonal must have the same character.\n\nThen, all other squares must be the same character, which is different from the diagonals.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Read the input grid.\n2. Extract the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n3. Check that all main diagonal elements are the same. Similarly for the anti-diagonal.\n4. Check that the main and anti-diagonal have the same character. If not, then it's not an X.\n5. Then, check all the non-diagonal elements to see if they are all the same character, which should be different from the diagonal character.\n\nWait, no. Because the non-diagonal elements can't include any of the diagonals. So, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center is part of both diagonals. So for the non-diagonal elements, we need to collect all the elements that are not on either diagonal.\n\nSo, for a grid of size n x n:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j.\n- It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo, any cell that's not on either diagonal is a non-diagonal cell. We need to collect all these cells and check if they are all the same character, and that this character is different from the diagonal characters.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n2. Check the main diagonal:\n   a. Collect all elements where i == j.\n   b. Check if all are the same. Let's call this char 'd'.\n3. Check the anti-diagonal:\n   a. Collect all elements where i + j == n-1.\n   b. Check if all are the same. They must be equal to 'd' (since both diagonals must be the same).\n4. Check that the non-diagonal elements are all the same character, say 'o', and 'o' != 'd'.\n\nSo, if all these conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. Since the input is provided as a string, perhaps split by '\\n' into lines. Each line represents a row.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first case, the input is something like '5\\nxooox\\n...' etc. So each line is a row. So for n=5, there are 5 rows.\n\nSo in code, we can read the grid as follows:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j), we can access grid[i][j].\n\nNext, collect the main diagonal:\n\nmain_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n\nCheck if all characters in main_diag are the same. How? We can get the first character, then compare all others to it.\n\nSimilarly for anti_diag:\n\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nAgain, check if all are same.\n\nThen, check if main_diag[0] == anti_diag[0], because both diagonals must be the same character.\n\nWait, no: the main_diag and anti_diag must each have the same character, but they could be same or different. But according to the problem statement",

The conditions for an \"X\" are that both diagonals must have the same letter, and all other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the grid dimensions and the grid itself.\n2. **Extract Diagonals**: Extract the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n3. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all elements in both diagonals are the same character.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure all non-diagonal elements are the same character and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if all elements in a list are the same\ndef all_same(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return True  # edge case, but shouldn't happen here\n    first = lst[0]\n    for c in lst[1:]:\n        if c != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Check main diagonal\nmain_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\nif not all_same(main_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][j])\nif not all_same(anti_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if main and anti diagonals have the same character\nif main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check the non-diagonal elements\nnon_diag_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue  # skip diagonals\n        if non_diag_char is None:\n            non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n\n# Also, check that non_diag_char is different from the diagonal character\nif non_diag_char == main_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a grid of characters.\n2. **Diagonal Extraction**: We extract the main and anti-diagonals by iterating through specific indices.\n3. **Checking Uniformity**: We use a helper function to ensure all elements in a list are the same.\n4. **Validation**: After ensuring the diagonals are uniform and equal, we check the non-diagonal elements for uniformity and ensure they are different from the diagonal character.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms the letter \"X\".",
