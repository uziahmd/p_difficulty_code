Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0's and '1's, and between adjacent '1's and '2's. So, for example, \"01\" can become \"10\", and \"12\" can become \"21\". But you can't swap '0' and '2' directly; that's not allowed. So the order of '0's and '1's can be rearranged among themselves, but their relative positions to '2's are fixed in some way.\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute. Because we can only swap '0's with '1's and '1's with '2's, but not '0's with '2's. So this means that '0's can't move past '2's. Because if there's a '0' followed by a '2', you can't swap them. Similarly, a '2' can't move past a '0' because they can't swap. So the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. Only within the '0's and '1's can they be rearranged, and within the '1's and '2's as well.\n\nSo, for example, the string \"010210\" can be transformed into \"001120\" by swapping '1's and '2's and '0's and '1's. But the '0's and '2's can't cross each other.\n\nThis implies that the final string must have all '0's before any '2's. Because you can't have a '0' after a '2'. So the first thing I need to do is figure out the positions of all the '0's, '1's, and '2's, but considering that '0's can't move past '2's.\n\nWait, no. Because '2's can't move past '0's either. For example, if a '0' comes before a '2', you can't swap them. So the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed. So all the '0's in the original string must appear before any '2's in the final string, or maybe not? Or perhaps not exactly, because maybe the '0's can be moved around via '1's.\n\nWait, let me think about this. Suppose the string is \"021\". Can I swap anything? Well, the '0' and '2' are adjacent, but I can't swap them because the allowed swaps are only between 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. So in this case, the '0' stays before the '2'.\n\nAnother example: \"012\". Can I swap the '1' and '2'? Yes. So the string becomes \"021\", which is worse lex-wise than \"012\". But if I could swap '0' and '1', but I can't because '0' and '1' are adjacent, right? Wait, \"012\": the '0' and '1' are adjacent, so I can swap them. So the string becomes \"102\", then maybe swap '0' and '2'? No, because that's not allowed. So the minimal string would be \"012\" itself? Or wait, after swapping '0' and '1', it becomes \"102\", but then can I swap '0' and '2'? No, so the string remains as \"102\". Comparing \"012\" and \"102\", the former is smaller. So perhaps the minimal string is \"012\".\n\nHmm, so in this case, the '0's and '2's can't cross each other because swapping is only allowed between certain pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: think of the string as consisting of three separate groups: the '0's, the '1's, and the '2's. The '0's can be reordered among themselves, the '1's can be reordered among themselves, and the '2's can be reordered among themselves. But '0's cannot move past '2's, and '2's cannot move past '0's. So the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. So any '0's in the string must appear before any '2's in the original string, but actually, no—because the '0's can be swapped through '1's. Wait, maybe not. Let me see.\n\nWait, suppose the string is \"201\". Can I rearrange the '0's and '2's? The '2' and '0' are adjacent, so I can't swap them. So the '2' stays before the '0'. So the minimal string is \"012\"? No, because '0' is after '2' in the original string. So the minimal string can't have '0' before '2' unless it's already",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0's and '1's, and between adjacent '1's and '2's. This means that '0's can only move past '1's, and '1's can only move past '2's, but '0's and '2's cannot swap places directly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Groups**: The string can be divided into three groups based on the characters '0', '1', and '2'. The relative order of '0's and '2's cannot change because they cannot swap directly. However, '0's can move among themselves through '1's, and '2's can move among themselves through '1's.\n2. **Reorder Within Groups**: \n   - All '0's can be reordered among themselves to form the smallest possible sequence within their group.\n   - Similarly, all '1's can be reordered among themselves to form the smallest possible sequence.\n   - All '2's can be reordered among themselves as well.\n3. **Merge the Groups**: After reordering each group, merge them back into the final string while maintaining the original order of '0's and '2's relative to each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimal_ternary_string(s):\n    # Count the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n    count0 = s.count('0')\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    count2 = s.count('2')\n    \n    # Create lists for each character, ordered as small as possible\n    zeros = ['0'] * count0\n    ones = ['1'] * count1\n    twos = ['2'] * count2\n    \n    # Now, construct the result by merging these in the correct order\n    # The key is to keep the positions of 0s and 2s as per their occurrence in the original string,\n    # but arrange the 1s in the smallest possible way around them.\n    \n    # To do this, we can iterate through the original string and build the result.\n    result = []\n    i = j = k = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            result.append('0')\n            i += 1\n        elif char == '2':\n            result.append('2')\n            k += 1\n        else:  # char is '1'\n            # Take the next smallest available '1' from the sorted list\n            if ones[j] <= ones[k]:\n                result.append(ones[j])\n                j += 1\n            else:\n                result.append(ones[k])\n                k += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\nprint(minimal_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Count Characters**: First, count the occurrences of '0', '1', and '2' in the input string.\n2. **Create Character Lists**: For each character type ('0', '1', '2'), create a list of that character repeated as many times as it appears in the input.\n3. **Iterate Through Input String**: As we iterate through the input string, we build the result string by choosing the smallest possible character at each position. If the current character is '0' or '2', we add it directly to the result. If it's '1', we choose the smallest available '1' from our list of '1's that hasn't been used yet.\n4. **Construct Result**: The result is constructed by maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's as they appear in the original string while placing '1's in the smallest possible order around them.\n\nThis approach ensures that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible by leveraging the allowed swaps efficiently.",
