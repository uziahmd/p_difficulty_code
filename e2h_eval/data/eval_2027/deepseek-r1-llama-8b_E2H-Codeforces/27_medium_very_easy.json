On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers, each being 1 or 2. Tommy wants to reverse a subarray (a continuous segment) in the original sequence such that after reversing, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the new array is as long as possible. My task is to find the maximum possible length of this LNDS after choosing the best possible subarray to reverse.\n\nHmm, wait. So the input is a sequence of 1s and 2s. The output is the maximum possible LNDS length after reversing exactly one subarray.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the LNDS is. A non-decreasing subsequence can be any increasing or equal elements in order. For example, in [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4 because you can take all four elements if you arrange them correctly. But wait, the original array is [1,2,1,2], which has an LNDS of 3 (like 1,2,2). But when we reverse a subarray, say positions 2-3, the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which has an LNDS of 4.\n\nSo the goal is to find which subarray reversal maximizes this LNDS.\n\nNow, how do I approach this? Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, for each possible subarray [l, r], I can reverse it and then compute the LNDS of the resulting array. Then, among all these possibilities, find the maximum LNDS.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. Reversing every possible subarray would be O(n^2) operations, since l and r each range from 1 to n. For each reversed array, computing the LNDS could take O(n^2) time if done naively, but that's too slow.\n\nWait, but the original array consists of only 1s and 2s. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute the LNDS after each reversal without checking the entire array each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal can be found by considering certain properties of the original array.\n\nLet me think: what's the maximum possible LNDS possible after reversing a subarray?\n\nThe original array has some structure. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is essentially the count of how many 1s appear before 2s. For example, a sequence like 1 1 2 2 has LNDS 4, while 2 1 2 has LNDS 3.\n\nWhen you reverse a subarray, you might be able to arrange more 1s before 2s, thus increasing the LNDS.\n\nWait, but reversing a subarray can change the order of elements in that subarray. So perhaps the key is to find a subarray where, after reversing, it contributes more to the overall LNDS.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach: precompute for each possible subarray [l, r], the effect of reversing it on the array. Then, for each such reversed array, compute the LNDS quickly.\n\nBut with n=2000, the number of subarrays is about 2e6 (since 2000*2000 is 4e6, but since l <= r, it's roughly 2000*2001/2 = around 2e6). For each subarray, computing the LNDS in O(n) time would result in 2e6 * 2e3 = 4e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat won't work. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversing a subarray can be determined without having to reverse each array and compute the LNDS each time. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to model this.\n\nLet me think about what reversing a subarray does. Suppose I have a subarray from position i to j. When I reverse it, the order of elements in that subarray is flipped. So, for example, if the original subarray was a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[j], after reversal, it's a[j], a[j-1], ..., a[i].\n\nBut the rest of the array remains unchanged.\n\nSo, the LNDS of the entire array after reversal depends on how the reversed subarray interacts with the surrounding elements.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal can be found by considering the following:\n\nFor each possible subarray [l, r], after reversing it, the LNDS is the sum of the LNDS of the prefix up to l-1, plus the LNDS of the suffix starting at r+1, plus the contribution from the reversed subarray itself.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because the reversed subarray can create new sequences that connect with the prefix and suffix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal LNDS after reversal is either the original LNDS, or the sum of the LNDS of the reversed subarray plus some overlapping with the prefix and suffix.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAnother angle: since the array consists of 1s and 2s, perhaps the LNDS is determined by the number of transitions from 1 to 2. Because each 1 followed by a 2 contributes to the length, but if they are in the wrong order, it doesn't.\n\nWait, no. For example, in [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3, but if you reverse positions 2-3, it becomes [1,1,2,2], which has LNDS 4.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find a subarray where, after reversal, the number of 1s that can be placed before 2s is maximized.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. What is the maximum possible LNDS possible? Since each element is either 1 or 2, the maximum possible LNDS is n. That occurs when all the 1s come before all the 2s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding whether, after reversing a subarray, the entire array becomes non-decreasing. If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nIf not, then find the next best thing.\n\nBut how often can that happen? It depends on the original array.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input:\n\nOriginal array is [1,2,1,2]. Reversing [2,3] gives [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing. So the LNDS is 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the original array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. Reversing [3,7] turns it into [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1], which isn't non-decreasing because the last element is 1. Wait, wait, no. Wait, after reversing [3,7], the elements from 3 to 7 (which were 2,2,2,2) become 2,2,2,2 again. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, the sample says that after reversing [3,7], the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. Oh right, because positions 3 to 7 are 2,2,2,2, so reversing them doesn't change anything. So maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the original array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. So when we reverse [3,7], which is the 5th to 8th elements. Wait, perhaps I got the indices wrong. Let me see:\n\nWait, the original array is 10 elements. Positions 3 to 7 are the 3rd to 7th elements: 2,2,2,2,1. So reversing them would make 1,2,2,2,2. So the new array would be:\n\n[1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,1]? Wait, maybe I'm not tracking this correctly.\n\nWait, the original array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. So when you reverse positions 3-7 (inclusive), the subarray is [2,2,2,1,1]. Reversing this gives [1,1,2,2,2]. So the new array becomes:\n\npositions 1-2: 1,1\n\npositions 3-7: 1,1,2,2,2\n\npositions 8-10: 2,1.\n\nWait, so the new array is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. Now, the LNDS is the maximum length of a non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nLooking at this array, the longest non-decreasing subsequence would be 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2: that's 9 elements. Then the last element is 1, but it can't extend the subsequence beyond that.\n\nSo the maximum is 9.\n\nSo the idea is that reversing a certain subarray allows us to create a longer sequence of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how do I find such a subarray efficiently?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the problem in terms of the original array's properties.\n\nSuppose that in the original array, the number of 1s is S1 and the number of 2s is S2. Then, the maximum possible LNDS is min(S1 + S2, ... something? No, wait, it's the maximum when all 1s come before 2s. So the maximum possible is S1 + S2 if the array can be rearranged in such a way.\n\nBut in our case, we can only reverse a single continuous subarray. So the question is, after reversing a subarray, can the array be arranged to have as many 1s as possible before 2s.\n\nWait, but even if the array isn't fully sorted, the LNDS can be large.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal solution is to find a subarray to reverse such that, within that subarray, the maximum number of 1s can be placed before 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS can be achieved by finding a subarray where, when reversed, the 1s in the subarray are as far to the left as possible, allowing them to contribute to the LNDS.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible subarray [l, r], we can compute the maximum possible LNDS that can be achieved by reversing [l, r], and then take the maximum over all these.\n\nBut again, for n=2000, this is O(n^2) possibilities, each requiring O(n) time to compute the LNDS, which is 4e6 * 2e3 = 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo that approach is not feasible.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to compute, for each possible subarray, the effect on the LNDS, without having to process the entire array each time.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS can be broken down into parts. The array is divided into three parts: before l, the reversed subarray, and after r.\n\nSo, the LNDS of the entire array after reversal is the maximum of:\n\n- The LNDS of the original array.\n\n- The sum of the LNDS of the prefix (before l), the LNDS of the reversed subarray, and the LNDS of the suffix (after r), plus any possible connections between the prefix and the reversed subarray, and between the reversed subarray and the suffix.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be computed by looking at the prefix, the reversed subarray, and the suffix, and seeing how they can be connected.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nLet me think about what the LNDS looks like after reversing a subarray.\n\nSuppose the original array is A. After reversing subarray [l, r], the array becomes B.\n\nThe LNDS of B is the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence in B.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS of B can be computed based on the LNDS of A, but I don't see a direct relation.\n\nAnother thought: the LNDS after reversal can be at most the LNDS of the entire array when it's possible to arrange all 1s before 2s. So the maximum possible is min(n, S1 + S2), but that's only achievable if the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by reversing a single subarray.\n\nBut in general, that's not always possible.\n\nWait, but for the given problem, the array consists of 1s and 2s. So, if the entire array can be made non-decreasing by reversing a single subarray, then the maximum LNDS is n. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nSo perhaps the first thing to check is whether the entire array is non-decreasing, or can be made so by reversing a subarray. If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, the maximum will be less than n.\n\nBut how to determine whether such a subarray exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem as trying all possible subarrays and for each, compute the LNDS after reversal, but find a way to compute it quickly.\n\nWait, but with n=2000, trying all subarrays is 2e6, and for each, the LNDS can be computed in O(n) time, leading to 4e9 operations, which is way beyond the acceptable time limits.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to model the effect of reversing a subarray on the LNDS.\n\nWait, let's think about the LNDS as the number of elements that can be included in a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nEach 1 can be followed by any number of 1s or 2s, but once a 2 is included, all subsequent elements must be >= 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, a non-decreasing subsequence allows equal or greater elements, but in the case of 1s and 2s, any 1 must come before any 2 in the subsequence.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before 2s.\n\nBut since the array is 1s and 2s, the maximum possible is min(k, m) where k is the number of 1s and m is the number of 2s, but only if the array can be arranged so that all 1s come before 2s.\n\nWait, no. The maximum possible is min(k, m) is not correct. Wait, no. For example, if all 1s are before all 2s, then the LNDS is k + m.\n\nBut in cases where the array is not arranged that way, the LNDS can be as high as the total number of 1s and 2s that can be ordered non-decreasingly.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps the LNDS can be represented by the number of 1s that appear before 2s in the array.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate. Because the LNDS can include any non-decreasing sequence, regardless of their positions.\n\nBut perhaps, the LNDS is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of inversions where a 2 comes before a 1.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think of the first sample:\n\nOriginal array is [1,2,1,2]. The number of 1s is 2, 2s is 2. The number of inversions (where 2 is before 1) is 2. So the LNDS would be 2 + 2 - 2 = 2? Which is not correct. So that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the LNDS is the same as the length of the longest chain of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo, for each 1 in the array, the number of 2s that come after it can be added to the LNDS.\n\nBut that also seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be followed by 2s in the array, considering their order.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position i, the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to i, and then 2s in the suffix from i onwards.\n\nBut that may not capture all possibilities.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps it's better to model the problem differently.\n\nSince the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be computed in O(n) time using a standard DP approach similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem, but tailored for 1s and 2s.\n\nYes! Because for the LIS problem, the standard approach is O(n log n), but for 1s and 2s, perhaps an O(n) solution exists.\n\nLet me think: since the elements are only 1 and 2, the DP can be optimized.\n\nThe standard approach for LIS in O(n) time for this specific case is as follows:\n\nInitialize a variable 'current_ones' and 'current_twos'. For each element in the array:\n\n- If it's a 1:\n   current_ones = max(current_ones, current_twos + 1)\n   current_twos remains as is.\n   Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the DP with two variables: the maximum length of the LNDS ending with a 1, and the maximum ending with a 2.\n\nFor each element a_i:\n\nIf a_i is 1:\n   new_ones = max(ones, twos + 1)\n   new_twos = twos\nElse:\n   new_ones = ones\n   new_twos = max(twos, ones + 1)\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nWait, for a_i=1, the maximum subsequence ending at i can be either adding this 1 to a subsequence ending with 1 (so the length increases by 1), or adding it to a subsequence that ended with a 2 (so now the 1 is the new end). So the new_ones would be max(ones, twos + 1).\n\nSimilarly, for a_i=2, the maximum subsequence ending at i can be either adding it to a subsequence ending with 2, or adding it to a subsequence ending with 1. So new_twos = max(twos, ones + 1).\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo the recurrence relations are:\n\nif a[i] == 1:\n    new_ones = max(ones, twos + 1)\n    new_twos = twos\nelse:\n    new_ones = ones\n    new_twos = max(twos, ones + 1)\n\nThen, for each element, update ones and twos with new_ones and new_twos.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the first sample.\n\nSample 1: [1,2,1,2]\n\nProcessing each element:\n\ni=0 (value 1):\nones = 1\ntwos = 0\n\ni=1 (value 2):\nnew_ones = 1 (unchanged)\nnew_twos = max(0, 1 + 1) = 2\nSo ones=1, twos=2.\n\ni=2 (value 1):\nnew_ones = max(1, 2 + 1) = 3\nnew_twos = 2\nSo ones=3, twos=2.\n\ni=3 (value 2):\nnew_ones = 3\nnew_twos = max(2, 3 + 1) =4\nSo final ones=3, twos=4. So the maximum is 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test: sample 2.\n\nOriginal array: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n\nLet's compute the initial ones and twos.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\ni=0 (1): ones=1, twos=0.\n\ni=1 (1): new_ones = max(1, 0+1)=1, new_twos=0. So remains 1,0.\n\nWait, wait no: for i=1, a[i]=1.\n\nnew_ones = max(ones, twos +1) → max(1, 0+1)=1.\n\nnew_twos = twos → 0.\n\nSo ones remains 1, twos 0.\n\ni=2 (2): new_ones = 1, new_twos = max(0, 1+1)=2.\n\ni=3 (2): new_ones=1, new_twos = max(2, 1+1)=2.\n\ni=4 (2): same as above.\n\ni=5 (1): new_ones = max(1, 2+1)=3; twos remains 2.\n\ni=6 (1): new_ones = max(3, 2+1)=3.\n\ni=7 (2): new_ones=3, new_twos = max(2, 3+1)=4.\n\ni=8 (2): same as above.\n\ni=9 (1): new_ones = max(3,4+1)=5; twos remains 4.\n\nSo the initial ones is 5, twos is 4. So the maximum is 5.\n\nWait, but in the sample, after reversing a subarray, the LNDS becomes 9. So the initial maximum is 5.\n\nSo the initial computation is correct.\n\nSo this method works for computing the LNDS quickly.\n\nSo, for any given array, the LNDS can be computed in O(n) time with this approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible subarray [l, r], reverse it, compute the new array's LNDS, and track the maximum.\n\nBut with n=2000, trying all possible subarrays is 2e6 possibilities, each requiring O(n) time, leading to 4e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nI need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: find out for each possible l and r, how reversing [l, r] affects the LNDS, and find the maximum.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversal is such that in the reversed subarray, all the 1s are moved to the left and 2s to the right. So, the maximum possible is when the reversed subarray consists of a group of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible l, we can find the best r >= l such that the subarray [l, r] when reversed optimizes the LNDS.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the maximum possible LNDS after reversing any subarray is either:\n\na) The original LNDS.\n\nb) The sum of the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before the reversed subarray, plus the maximum number of 2s in the reversed subarray, plus the maximum number of 2s that come after the reversed subarray.\n\nOr something along those lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS after reversing [l, r] is equal to the number of 1s in the prefix [1..l-1], plus the number of 2s in the reversed subarray [l..r], plus the number of 2s in the suffix [r+1..n].\n\nBecause, when you reverse [l..r], any 1s in the prefix can be followed by the 2s in the reversed subarray, and the 2s in the reversed subarray can be followed by the 2s in the suffix.\n\nSo the total LNDS would be the sum of these three components.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps the 1s in the reversed subarray can be placed before the 2s in the suffix, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think with the first sample:\n\nOriginal array: [1,2,1,2].\n\nAfter reversing [2,3] → [1,1,2,2].\n\nThe prefix before 2 is [1], which has 1 1.\n\nThe reversed subarray has 2,1 → after reversal, it's 1,2 → which has 1 1 and 1 2.\n\nThe suffix after 3 is [2], which is 2.\n\nSo the sum is 1 (prefix 1s) + 1 (reversed subarray's 1s) + 1 (suffix's 2s) = 3. But the actual LNDS is 4.\n\nWait, that suggests this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm not accounting for the 2s in the reversed subarray that can be part of the LNDS.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nmax_ones_before_l + max_ones_in_reversed_subarray + max_ones_after_r.\n\nBut that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nnumber of 1s in the prefix [1..l-1] + number of 1s in the reversed subarray [l..r] + number of 2s in the suffix [r+1..n] + number of 2s in the reversed subarray [l..r].\n\nWait, but that would be the sum of all 1s in the prefix, all 1s in the reversed subarray, and all 2s in the suffix and reversed subarray.\n\nNo, that seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS after reversing [l, r] is:\n\nthe maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the prefix [1..l-1], followed by as many 1s as possible from the reversed subarray, followed by as many 2s as possible from the reversed subarray, followed by as many 2s as possible from the suffix [r+1..n].\n\nSo, the total is:\n\ncount_1_prefix + count_1_reversed_subarray + count_2_reversed_subarray + count_2_suffix.\n\nBut in the first sample:\n\nprefix [1..1] has 1 1.\n\nreversed subarray [2,3] is [1,2], which has 1 1 and 1 2.\n\nsuffix [4..4] has 1 2.\n\nSo total is 1 +1 +1 +1 =4, which matches.\n\nAnother example: the second sample.\n\nAfter reversing [3..7], the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1].\n\nThe prefix [1..2] has 2 1s.\n\nThe reversed subarray [3..7] is [2,2,2,1,1] → reversed becomes [1,1,2,2,2], which has 2 1s and 3 2s.\n\nThe suffix [8..10] is [2,2,1], which has 2 2s.\n\nSo the sum is 2 (prefix) + 2 (reversed 1s) + 3 (reversed 2s) + 2 (suffix 2s) = 9, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this formula seems to hold.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nmax_ones_before_l + max_ones_in_reversed_subarray + max_twos_in_reversed_subarray + max_twos_after_r.\n\nWait, but how to compute this for each possible [l, r]?\n\nWe can precompute for each position l, the maximum number of 1s in [1..l-1].\n\nSimilarly, for each position r, the maximum number of 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nAnd for each subarray [l..r], the number of 1s in the subarray and the number of 2s.\n\nWait, but the reversed subarray's 1s and 2s can vary depending on the subarray.\n\nWait, but when you reverse the subarray [l..r], the number of 1s in the subarray remains the same as the original. Similarly for 2s.\n\nSo, for any subarray [l..r], the number of 1s is s1 = count_1(l..r), and the number of 2s is s2 = count_2(l..r).\n\nSo, the formula for the LNDS after reversing [l..r] is:\n\nprefix_ones[l] + s1 + s2 + suffix_twos[r].\n\nWhere prefix_ones[l] is the number of 1s in [1..l-1], and suffix_twos[r] is the number of 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nWait, but in the first sample:\n\nprefix_ones[2] =1 (since [1..1] has one 1).\n\ns1 =1 (reversed subarray [2..3] has one 1).\n\ns2 =1 (reversed subarray has one 2).\n\nsuffix_twos[3] =1 (since [4..4] has one 2).\n\nTotal 1+1+1+1=4.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nprefix_ones[3] is 2 (elements 1 and 2 are 1s).\n\ns1 =2 (subarray [3..7] has two 1s).\n\ns2 =3 (subarray [3..7] has three 2s).\n\nsuffix_twos[7] =2 (elements 8,9,10: 2,2,1 → two 2s).\n\nTotal 2+2+3+2=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is to compute for each possible [l..r], the value prefix_ones[l] + (count_1(l..r)) + (count_2(l..r)) + suffix_twos[r], and find the maximum over all [l..r].\n\nAdditionally, the original array's LNDS is also a candidate, because reversing a subarray might not help.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_ones array, where prefix_ones[i] is the number of 1s in [1..i-1].\n\n   So prefix_ones[1] =0, prefix_ones[2] = count_1 in [1..1], etc.\n\n2. Precompute suffix_twos array, where suffix_twos[i] is the number of 2s in [i+1..n].\n\n   So suffix_twos[n] =0, suffix_twos[n-1] = count_2 in [n], etc.\n\n3. Precompute a 2D array cnt_1 and cnt_2, where cnt_1[l][r] is the number of 1s in [l..r], and similarly cnt_2[l][r] is the number of 2s.\n\n   Since n is 2000, a 2000x2000 array is manageable (about 4 million entries).\n\n4. For each possible subarray [l..r], compute the value:\n\n   value = prefix_ones[l] + cnt_1[l][r] + cnt_2[l][r] + suffix_twos[r].\n\n5. Also consider the original array's LNDS, which is the initial maximum.\n\n6. The maximum of all these values is the answer.\n\nWait, but why does this formula work?\n\nBecause when you reverse [l..r], the 1s in the prefix can be followed by the 1s in the reversed subarray, then the 2s in the reversed subarray, and finally the 2s in the suffix.\n\nSo the total is the sum of all those.\n\nIs this always the maximum possible LNDS after reversing [l..r]?\n\nI think so, because any longer subsequence would require more 1s in the prefix, more 1s in the reversed subarray, more 2s in the reversed subarray, or more 2s in the suffix.\n\nBut is there a scenario where a longer subsequence exists that doesn't follow this structure?\n\nHmm, perhaps not, because the LNDS can't have a 1 after a 2 in the reversed subarray unless it's part of the subsequence.\n\nWait, but the reversed subarray's 1s and 2s are in their own order, but after reversal, the 1s come before the 2s in the subarray.\n\nWait, for example, if the original subarray is [2,1,2], then after reversal it's [2,1,2], which doesn't help. But if the original subarray is [2,1], reversing it gives [1,2], which helps.\n\nSo, the formula should account for the maximum possible contribution from the reversed subarray, which is the count of 1s plus 2s in it.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nCompute all necessary precomputations.\n\nThen iterate over all l and r, compute the value for each [l..r], and keep track of the maximum.\n\nAlso, compute the original LNDS and compare it to the maximum from the subarrays.\n\nFinally, output the maximum between the original and the best subarray.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, compute the original LNDS.\n\nThen, compute the prefix_ones and suffix_twos arrays.\n\nThen, compute the cnt_1 and cnt_2 tables.\n\nThen, for each l from 1 to n:\n\n   for each r from l to n:\n\n      compute value = prefix_ones[l] + (cnt_1[l][r]) + (cnt_2[l][r]) + suffix_twos[r]\n\n      keep track of the maximum value.\n\nFinally, compare this maximum with the original LNDS and choose the larger one.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute the original LNDS.\n\nTo compute the original LNDS, use the DP approach discussed earlier.\n\ndef compute_LNDS(arr):\n    ones = 0\n    twos = 0\n    max_len = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        if num == 1:\n            new_ones = max(ones, twos + 1)\n            new_twos = twos\n        else:\n            new_ones = ones\n            new_twos = max(twos, ones + 1)\n        ones, twos = new_ones, new_twos\n        max_len = max(max_len, ones, twos)\n    return max_len\n\noriginal = compute_LNDS(a)\n\nThen, precompute prefix_ones.\n\nprefix_ones = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (a[i-1] == 1)\n\nPrecompute suffix_twos.\n\nsuffix_twos = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (a[i] == 2)\n\nThen, precompute cnt_1 and cnt_2 tables.\n\ncnt_1 = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\ncnt_2 = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor l in range(1, n+1):\n    for r in range(l, n+1):\n        cnt = 0\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if a[i] == 1:\n                cnt +=1\n        cnt_1[l][r] = cnt\n        cnt_2[l][r] = (r - l +1) - cnt\n\nWait, but for l=1 and r=1, the subarray is just a[0], etc.\n\nBut wait, the code uses 0-based indices, while the problem uses 1-based.\n\nWait, in the code, the array is 0-based. So for l and r in 1-based, the subarray is a[l-1 ... r-1].\n\nSo, for the cnt_1 and cnt_2 tables, for each l and r (1-based, l <= r), the subarray is a[l-1 ... r-1].\n\nThus, to compute cnt_1[l][r], we sum a[i] ==1 for i from l-1 to r-1.\n\nBut for n=2000, this is O(n^3), which is 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible for the time constraints.\n\nWe need a way to compute cnt_1 and cnt_2 efficiently.\n\nAlternative idea: use prefix sums.\n\nCompute a prefix sum array for 1s and 2s.\n\nprefix_1 = [0]*(n+1)\nprefix_2 = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    prefix_1[i] = prefix_1[i-1] + (a[i-1] == 1)\n    prefix_2[i] = prefix_2[i-1] + (a[i-1] == 2)\n\nThen, for any l and r, the number of 1s in [l..r] is prefix_1[r] - prefix_1[l-1].\n\nSimilarly for 2s: prefix_2[r] - prefix_2[l-1].\n\nYes! This is O(1) per query.\n\nSo, we can compute cnt_1[l][r] as prefix_1[r] - prefix_1[l-1].\n\nSimilarly for cnt_2.\n\nSo, no need to precompute a 2D table. We can compute it on the fly.\n\nThus, the revised plan:\n\nCompute prefix_1 and prefix_2.\n\nThen, for each [l, r], compute:\n\nvalue = prefix_ones[l] + (prefix_1[r] - prefix_1[l-1]) + (prefix_2[r] - prefix_2[l-1]) + suffix_twos[r]\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, cnt_1[l][",
