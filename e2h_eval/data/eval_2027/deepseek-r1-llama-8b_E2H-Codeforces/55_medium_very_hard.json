    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. So for example, \"01\" can become \"10\", and \"12\" can become \"21\". But you can't swap '0' and '2' directly or via other steps because that would require moving through a '1'.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the minimum possible string after any number of such swaps. Since the swaps can be done any number of times, I need to figure out how the characters can be rearranged within certain constraints.\n\nLet me think about what the allowed swaps imply. \n\nSwaps between 0 and 1 mean that 0 and 1 can be reordered among themselves. Similarly, 1 and 2 can be reordered. Wait, no—wait, wait. No, the allowed swaps are only between specific pairs. So '0' and '1' can be swapped, but not with '2's unless via a '1'.\n\nWait, no. Because if I have '0', '2' adjacent, I can't swap them. So their relative order cannot be changed unless there's a '1' in between which allows movement. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by grouping the characters into two separate groups: one consisting of '0's and '1's, and another consisting of '2's. Because '2's can't be swapped with '0's directly. Or wait, can they? No, because the allowed swaps are only between '0'-'1' and '1'-'2'. So '2's can only be moved past '1's, but not '0's. So the '0's and '2's are kind of stuck in their relative positions unless a '1' is involved.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem as follows: each character can move past others, but only under certain conditions. For example:\n\n- '0' can only be swapped with '1's adjacent to it. So all '0's can be reordered among themselves and with '1's, but cannot pass through '2's unless there's a way via '1's.\n\nSimilarly, '2's can only be swapped with '1's, so they can be reordered among themselves and past '1's, but not past '0's.\n\nSo this suggests that the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed unless there's a '1' that can act as a bridge. But wait, that's not necessarily true. Because a '0' can move past a '2' if there's a '1' in between. For example, consider \"021\": can the '0' move before the '2'?\n\nLet me see: the initial string is 0,2,1. We can swap 2 and 1 to get 0,1,2. Then, swap 0 and 1 to get 1,0,2. Now, we can't swap 0 and 2, so they are in the order 1,0,2, which is worse than the original. So in this case, the '0' can't get before the '2' unless there's a way to swap around.\n\nHmm, maybe that approach isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the allowed swaps mean that the '0's can be arranged among themselves and among the '1's, and similarly the '2's can be arranged among themselves and among the '1's. But '0's and '2's can't directly swap, so their relative positions are determined by their initial arrangement, but only if there's a '1' in between.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead of trying to model all possible swaps, I should look for an invariant or some way to group the characters such that their relative order can be changed in certain ways.\n\nWait, let's think about the minimal lex string. Lex order is determined from left to right. So for each position, we want the smallest possible character. However, the allowed swaps may restrict which characters can come earlier.\n\nFor example, suppose the string is \"210\". The allowed swaps are between '2' and '1' (since they are adjacent) and between '1' and '0' (if they are adjacent). So initially, the string is 2,1,0. Can we make it lex smaller?\n\nYes: swap 2 and 1 to get 1,2,0. Then, swap 2 and 0? Wait, no, because 2 and 0 are not allowed to be swapped directly. So now the string is 1,2,0. Can we do anything else? Well, 2 and 0 are adjacent, but we can't swap them. So the minimal lex string is \"120\".\n\nBut wait, is that the smallest possible? Because in this case, the '0' is at the end, but perhaps we can't bring it further left because it's stuck behind the '2's.\n\nSo perhaps the key is that '0's can only appear before '1's and '2's if there's a path via '1's. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: since the allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' and between '1' and '2', perhaps all '0's can be moved to the left past '1's, and '2's can be moved to the left past '1's. But '0's and '2's can't directly swap, so their relative order depends on whether they can be reordered via '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the '0's and '2's can be considered as two separate groups, but their relative order can be altered based on the presence of '1's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed unless they can be connected through a '1' chain.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think about the problem as allowing the '0's and '1's to be reordered among themselves, and the '2's and '1's to be reordered among themselves, but '0's and '2's cannot be reordered relative to each other unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal lex string can be constructed by greedily placing the smallest possible character as early as possible, considering the constraints imposed by the allowed swaps.\n\nSo, the strategy is to iterate through the string, and for each position, choose the smallest possible character that can be moved to that position via the allowed swaps.\n\nBut how do the allowed swaps affect what can be moved where?\n\nLet me try to model the allowed movements.\n\nEach '0' can be moved past any '1's to the left or right. Similarly, each '2' can be moved past any '1's to the left or right. But '0's and '2's can't be directly moved past each other, so their relative order is fixed unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, that's probably the key.\n\nSo, for any '0' and '2', if they are separated by a '1', then the '0' can move to the right past the '2' via the '1's. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal lex string can be achieved by arranging all '0's before '1's and '2's, but that's not necessarily the case when '0's and '2's are interleaved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's can be adjusted if there's a '1' between them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the string is \"201\". The allowed swaps are between 2 and 1, and between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, initial string: 2,0,1.\n\nCan we swap 2 and 0? No, because they're not adjacent and can't be swapped directly. But 2 and 1 can be swapped, so first swap 2 and 1 to get 2,1,0.\n\nThen, swap 2 and 1 again? No, because after swapping once, the '2' and '1' are adjacent again. So perhaps the '2' can move to the right past '1's, but that doesn't help in bringing '0' forward.\n\nWait, perhaps the '0' can move left past '1's but can't get past '2's unless via '1's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0's can be moved to the left past any '1's, regardless of '2's. But '2's can also be moved past '1's, but their movement might interfere with '0's.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled.\n\nMaybe an alternative approach is to model the problem as follows: the allowed swaps allow us to sort the '0's among themselves, '1's among themselves, and '2's among themselves, but '0's and '2's cannot cross each other unless they can be linked via a '1' that allows their movement.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two separate problems: the '0's and '1's can be rearranged in any order, and the '2's can be rearranged in any order, but the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed except when a '1' is present between them.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because a '0' can move past '1's, and a '2' can also move past '1's, so if a '0' is to the left of a '2' with some '1's in between, the '0' can potentially overtake the '2' by moving through the '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the '0's and '2's can be considered as separate groups, but their relative order can be modified if there's a '1' in between.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the '0's can be arranged among themselves and among the '1's, but '2's can't be moved past '0's unless there's a '1' in between. So, for example, a '0' can move past a '2' if there's a '1' somewhere in between, allowing the '0' to shift past the '2' by swapping with the '1's.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to realize that the '0's and '2's can be reordered relative to each other only if there's a '1' in between. So the overall ordering can be thought of as a graph where '0's and '2's can switch places if there's a '1' to bridge them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal lex string is formed by greedily placing as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, and then '2's. But that's not always possible, especially when '0's and '2's are interleaved without '1's in between.\n\nWait, let's consider the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input 1: '100210'\n\nSample Output: '001120'\n\nLooking at the input, it's '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nIn the output, it's '0','0','1','1','2','0'.\n\nSo how did that happen?\n\nWell, the two '0's were moved to the front, then the '1's, then '2', and the trailing '0' was moved to the end.\n\nWait, but how? Because the '2' can be moved past '1's, but how does the trailing '0' get pushed to the end?\n\nHmm, perhaps the '0's can be moved past the '1's, but the '2's can also be moved past '1's, which affects their relative positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the string and for each position, determine the earliest possible character that can be placed there, considering the allowed swaps.\n\nBut to do that, I need to model what characters can be placed at each position.\n\nSo, for each position i, I need to find the smallest possible character c such that c can be moved to position i via the allowed swaps.\n\nBut how do I determine if c can be moved there?\n\nLet me think about the allowed movement possibilities.\n\nA '0' can be moved to the left past any '1's. So for example, if a '0' is at position j, and there are k '1's between j and i, then the '0' can be moved to position i - k.\n\nWait, no, because the '0' can only move left by swapping with '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the '0's can be arranged in any order among themselves, and can be moved past any '1's, but cannot be moved past '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nSimilarly, '2's can be moved past any '1's, but cannot be moved past '0's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nThis seems to complicate things.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the problem can be split into three parts:\n\n1. All '0's can be moved to the left as much as possible, past any '1's, but not past '2's.\n\n2. All '2's can be moved to the left as much as possible, past any '1's, but not past '0's.\n\n3. The '1's can be reordered among themselves, but perhaps not directly relevant once the '0's and '2's are handled.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is built by first moving all '0's as far left as possible, then moving the '1's as far left as possible, then the '2's. But this ignores the fact that '2's can't be moved past '0's unless via '1's.\n\nWait, no, because if a '0' is before a '2' and there's a '1' in between, then the '0' can move past the '1's to the right, possibly bypassing the '2' if the '1's allow it.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed unless a '1' is present in between them. So for any pair of '0' and '2', if there's a '1' somewhere between them, their relative order can be swapped. Otherwise, their relative order remains as the initial.\n\nThis would mean that for any '0' and '2' without any '1's in between, their order can't be changed. But if there's a '1' between them, then their order can be altered.\n\nSo the minimal lex string would arrange '0's as early as possible, followed by '2's as late as possible, but this depends on their ability to cross via '1's.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the minimal string is formed by greedily choosing the earliest possible character, considering that '0's can be brought to the front as much as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's.\n\nWait, let's think about the allowed swaps again. Since '0's can be swapped with '1's, any '0' can be moved to the left past any '1's. Similarly, '2's can be moved to the left past any '1's. So the '0's can be collected on the left side, pushing '1's and '2's to the right, but '0's can't directly affect '2's unless via '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is obtained by arranging all '0's as left as possible, then '1's, and then '2's, but in a way that '0's can't pass '2's unless there's a '1' between them.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n1. For each '0' in the string, move it as far left as possible, swapping with '1's.\n\n2. Then, for each '2' in the string, move it as far right as possible, swapping with '1's.\n\n3. Then, for the remaining '1's, arrange them in any order (but perhaps they are already in the correct position).\n\nWait, but this is just a hypothesis. Let's test it against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: '100210' → Output '001120'.\n\nBreaking down the input: '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nStep 1: Move all '0's as far left as possible.\n\nInitially, the '0's are at positions 1 and 2 (0-based?), but in the string, the '0's are at index 1 and 2, and the '1' is at 0.\n\nWait, the initial string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nIf we move the first '0' to the left past the '1's, but in this case, the '0's are after the '1's, so perhaps they can't move further left.\n\nWait, no. Because '0's can only be swapped with '1's. So the first '0' is at position 1. It can be swapped with the '1' at position 0, resulting in '0','1','0','2','1','0'.\n\nThen, the next '0' is at position 2. It can be swapped with the '1' at position 1, leading to '0','0','1','2','1','0'.\n\nNow, can the '0's be moved further left? No, because they are already at the front.\n\nSo after step 1, the string is '0012110'? Wait, no, the initial string is '100210' → after moving the first '0' to the front, it becomes '010210', then the second '0' can be swapped with the '1' at position 1, making it '001210'. Then, the last '0' is at position 5. Can it be moved further left? It's adjacent to '1' at position 4. So it can be swapped with '1', resulting in '0012001'... Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down the process step by step.\n\nOriginal string: 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nLet me index from 0:\n\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5.\n\nAfter first swap (swap 0 and 1): 0 1 0 2 1 0.\n\nThen, the next '0' is at index 2. It can be swapped with '1' at index 1, resulting in 0 0 1 2 1 0.\n\nNow, the third character is '1', which can be swapped with '2' at index 3, leading to 0 0 1 2 1 0 → 0 0 1 2 1 0? Wait, no, because '1' and '2' can be swapped. So after swapping, it becomes 0 0 1 2 1 0 → wait, no, the '1' is at index 2, '2' at 3. Swap them: 0 0 2 1 1 0.\n\nWait, that's not helpful. So perhaps the '0's can be moved as far left as possible, but the '2' is in the way.\n\nSo perhaps after moving '0's, the '2' can't be moved past the '0's because '0's can't be swapped with '2's directly.\n\nSo the '0's are stuck before the '2's, and the '2' can't be moved before the '0's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, but in this case, after the '0's are moved to the front, the '2' is at position 3. Can it be moved past the '0's to the right? Probably not, because '0's can't be swapped with '2's.\n\nSo the '2' remains after the '0's, but then the '1's can be reordered.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the '2' is at position 4, followed by '0's.\n\nHmm, perhaps after the '0's are moved as far left as possible, the '1's can be moved to the left, pushing the '2's to the right.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of the problem differently.\n\nPerhaps the minimal lex string can be achieved by processing the string and, for each position, selecting the smallest possible character that can be placed there, considering the allowed swaps.\n\nTo implement this, I need to know which characters can be moved to the current position.\n\nSo, for each position i, the candidate characters are the '0's that are to the right of i, and the '1's that are to the right of i, and the '2's that are to the right of i. But that's not correct because '0's can only be moved past '1's, and '2's can only be moved past '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the available characters for position i are the '0's that are to the right and can be moved past '1's, and the '1's that are to the right, and the '2's that are to the right and can be moved past '1's.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characters can be divided into two groups:\n\n- Group A: consists of '0's and '1's. These can be reordered arbitrarily among themselves.\n- Group B: consists of '2's. These can be reordered arbitrarily among themselves.\n\nBut this is incorrect because '0's and '2's cannot be reordered unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the string as consisting of '0's, '1's, and '2's, where the '0's can be reordered with the '1's, and the '1's can be reordered with the '2's, but '0's and '2's cannot be reordered unless via '1's.\n\nSo, the '0's and '2's are in their own groups, but their relative order can be changed if there's a '1' in between.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAnother idea: the allowed swaps create a certain equivalence relation. Any '0' can be moved to any position as long as it's allowed to pass through '1's, but '0's can't pass through '2's. Similarly, '2's can't pass through '0's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string can be formed by:\n\n- Arrange all '0's as far left as possible, but respecting that they can't pass through '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\n- Then arrange all '1's as far left as possible.\n\n- Then arrange all '2's as far left as possible.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved unless a '1' is present between them. So, for any '0' and '2', if they are separated by one or more '1's, their relative order can be swapped. Otherwise, their relative order remains as in the original string.\n\nThis would mean that the minimal string can be formed by:\n\nFor each '0' and '2' pair, if there's a '1' between them, we can place the '0' before the '2'; otherwise, their relative order remains the same.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed by treating the '0's and '2's as being able to swap positions if there's a '1' in between. So, the minimal string would have all '0's as far left as possible, followed by '1's and '2's arranged in a way that '0's are as left as possible, and '2's are as right as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the problem as similar to sorting with certain constraints. For example, in a standard sorting problem, you can swap any two elements, but here, the allowed swaps are limited.\n\nBut in this problem, the allowed swaps are adjacent swaps between '0'-'1' and '1'-'2'. So, the allowed swaps can be represented as a graph where edges indicate that two characters can be swapped.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a directed graph where nodes are the characters '0', '1', '2', and edges represent whether one can be swapped with another.\n\nBut in this case, the allowed swaps are '0' <-> '1' and '1' <-> '2'. So, in this graph, '0' can be connected to '1', and '1' can be connected to '2', but '0' cannot be directly connected to '2'.\n\nSo, the connected components are {'0', '1'}, and {'1', '2'}, but since '0' and '2' are in different connected components, they can't be swapped directly.\n\nWait, but this is only considering individual swaps. Perhaps the connectedness is more complex when considering the entire string.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the problem can be viewed as a series of independent subproblems. For instance, the '0's can form one group, the '1's another, and the '2's another. But the interactions between these groups are limited.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string can be found by considering the following steps:\n\n1. For each '0' in the string, move it as far left as possible, passing any '1's.\n\n2. For each '2' in the string, move it as far right as possible, passing any '1's.\n\n3. Then, arrange the '1's in any order.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the sample input 100210.\n\nProcessing step 1: move all '0's as far left as possible.\n\nOriginal string: 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nWe can move the '0's to the left of the '1's.\n\nSo, the first '0' is at position 1, can be swapped with '1' at position 0 → 0 1 0 2 1 0.\n\nThen, the next '0' is at position 2, can be swapped with '1' at position 1 → 0 0 1 2 1 0.\n\nNow, the '0's are at positions 0 and 1. They can't be moved further left because the next character is '1'.\n\nSo, after step 1, the string is 001210.\n\nNow, process step 2: move all '2's as far right as possible, passing '1's.\n\nThe '2' is at position 3. To the right, there are '1's and '0's. '2' can be swapped with '1's, so it can move to the right past '1's.\n\nSo, the '2' can be moved past the '1' at position 4, but that would require multiple swaps. But since '2' can move past '1's, it can be moved further to the right.\n\nWait, but why would moving '2' to the right help in making the string lex smaller? Because '2' is larger than '1's and '0's, so having '2's as far to the right as possible is better for the lex order.\n\nSo, in this case, the '2' is at position 3. To its right, there's a '1' at position 4, and a '0' at position 5.\n\nSo, the '2' can be moved to the right past the '1' and '0'?\n\nWait, no, because '2' can only be swapped with '1's. So, the '2' can be moved past the '1' at position 4, resulting in 0 0 1 1 2 0.\n\nBut the '0' is at position 5. Can the '2' be moved past the '0'? No, because '2' and '0' can't be swapped directly. So the '2' can't move past the '0' unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, in this case, after moving the '2' past the '1' at position 4, the '2' is at position 4. Now, the '0' is at position 5. Can the '2' be swapped with the '0'? No. So the '2' is stuck at position 4, and the '0' remains at 5.\n\nSo the final string is 0 0 1 1 2 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to:\n\n1. Move all '0's as far left as possible, passing any '1's.\n\n2. Then, move all '2's as far right as possible, passing any '1's.\n\n3. Then, arrange the '1's in any order, but perhaps they are already in the correct position.\n\nBut wait, why can we move '0's past '1's but not '2's? Because '0's can swap with '1's, so they can be moved left past '1's.\n\nSimilarly, '2's can swap with '1's, so they can be moved right past '1's.\n\nSo, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n- For each '0' in the string, move it as far left as possible, swapping with '1's.\n\n- For each '2' in the string, move it as far right as possible, swapping with '1's.\n\n- Then, arrange the '1's in any order, but perhaps they are already in the optimal position.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently for large strings (like up to 1e5 characters)?\n\nBecause for each '0' and '2', we need to process their movement, which could be O(n^2) time if done naively, but that's not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nSo we need a more efficient approach.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the movement of '0's and '2's by tracking their positions and then reordering them optimally.\n\nLet's think about the '0's:\n\nAll '0's can be moved to the left past any '1's. So the '0's will end up as far left as possible, but they can't move past '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, no. Because '0's can't be swapped with '2's directly. So '0's can't pass '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nBut in practice, the '0's can move past '1's to get to the left, but if a '2' is blocking the way, the '0' can't go beyond it.\n\nWait, for example, consider the string \"210\". The '0' is at the end. There's a '2' before it. Since '0's can't be swapped with '2's, the '0' can't move past the '2'. So the minimal string is \"210\".\n\nWait, no. Because '2' can be swapped with '1', but in this case, the string is \"210\"—so '2' and '1' can be swapped to get \"120\". Then, '1' and '0' can be swapped to get \"102\". But '2' is still before '0's. So the minimal string is \"102\".\n\nWait, but the '0' is after '2' in the initial string, and can't move before '2' because there's no '1' between them. So the relative order of '0' and '2' is preserved, because there's no '1' between them.\n\nAh! So the key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved unless there's a '1' between them. So, for any '0' and '2' in the string, if there exists a '1' between them, their relative order can be swapped; otherwise, their relative order remains as in the original string.\n\nThus, the minimal lex string is constructed by:\n\n- Collecting all '0's before any '2's, but only if there's a '1' between them. Otherwise, their relative order is fixed.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is built by:\n\n1. For each '0' in the string, move it as far left as possible, passing '1's, but not passing '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\n2. For each '2' in the string, move it as far right as possible, passing '1's, but not passing '0's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nBut this is still unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string can be constructed by:\n\n- All '0's that can be moved before '2's (i.e., those '0's that are originally before '2's and have a path of '1's between them) are moved before the '2's.\n\n- Then, all '2's are moved as far right as possible, passing '1's.\n\n- Finally, the '1's are arranged in any order.\n\nBut again, the implementation is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: think of the string as a sequence of '0's, '1's, and '2's, and for each '0' and '2', determine if they can swap places based on the presence of '1's in between.\n\nThen, the minimal string would arrange all such '0's before '2's, and the '1's in the middle.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string can be constructed by:\n\n- For each '0' in the string, find the earliest position it can be moved to, considering the presence of '1's and '2's.\n\nSimilarly for '2's.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string obtained by first moving all '0's as far left as possible, then moving all '2's as far right as possible.\n\nBut let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: '100210' → Output '001120'.\n\nMoving '0's as far left as possible: yes.\n\nThen moving '2's as far right as possible: yes.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: '20' → output '20'.\n\nBecause '2' is before '0', and there's no '1' between them. So their relative order is fixed. So the minimal string is '20'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: '1210'.\n\nIn this case, the '0' is at the end. The '1's and '2's can be reordered. The '0' can be moved left past the '1's.\n\nSo after moving '0' left:\n\n- '0' moves past '1' at position 2 → '120'.\n\nBut '2' is at position 1. '0' can't move past '2' unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, but in '1210', the '0' is at position 3. The '2' is at position 1, and there's a '1' at position 2 between them.\n\nSo '0' can move past the '1' at position 2, then pass the '2' via the '1'?\n\nWait, perhaps the '0' can move left past '1's, but the '2' is before the '1's, so the '0' can't get past the '2' because the '2' is before the '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the '0' can only move past '1's, but '2's block the path unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nIn '1210', the '0' is at position 3. The '2' is at position 1, and there's a '1' at position 2. So the '0' can move past the '1' at position 2, but can it then move past the '2'?\n\nNo, because the '0' can't be swapped with '2's.\n\nSo after moving the '0' past the '1' at position 2, the string becomes '12010' → wait, no. Let me see:\n\nOriginal string: 1 2 1 0.\n\nThe '0' is at position 3.\n\nIt can be swapped with '1' at position 2 → 1 2 0 1.\n\nThen, the '0' can be swapped with '2' at position 1? No, because '0' and '2' can't be swapped.\n\nSo the '0' can't get past the '2'.\n\nThus, the minimal string would be '12010'.\n\nBut is that the lex smallest possible?\n\nWait, perhaps I can swap '2' and '1' at positions 0 and 1 to get '21010', but that's worse because '2' is at the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0' can be moved to the left of the '2' by using the '1' in between.\n\nWait, in '1210', the '0' is at position 3.\n\nIt can be moved to position 2 by swapping with '1' at position 2 → '12010'.\n\nBut then, the '2' is at position 1, and the '0' is at position 2. Can the '0' move past the '2'? No, because they can't be swapped directly.\n\nSo the '0' is stuck at position 2.\n\nBut wait, is there a way for the '0' to move past the '2' via the '1's?\n\nWait, perhaps the '2' can be moved to the right past the '0' by swapping with '1's.\n\nBut the '2' can't swap with '0's directly, so unless there's a '1' in between, it can't move past.\n\nSo in this case, the '2' can't be moved past the '0' because there's no '1' between them.\n\nThus, the minimal string is '12010'.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the lex smallest possible. Let me see:\n\nIs there a way to arrange the '0' before the '2'?\n\nNo, because '0' is at position 3, and the '2' is at position 1. The '0'",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing adjacent swaps between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The allowed swaps mean that '0's can be reordered with '1's, and '2's can be reordered with '1's, but '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves two main steps:\n1. **Move all '0's as far left as possible**: Since '0's can only be swapped with '1's, we iterate through the string and move each '0' to the left past any '1's it encounters.\n2. **Move all '2's as far right as possible**: Similarly, since '2's can only be swapped with '1's, we iterate through the string from the end and move each '2' to the right past any '1's it encounters.\n\nThis ensures that '0's are moved as far left as possible and '2's are moved as far right as possible, resulting in the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimal_ternary_string(s):\n    # Convert string to list for easy manipulation\n    s = list(s)\n    \n    # Move all '0's to the left, passing '1's\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            # Move '0' to the left as much as possible, swapping with '1's\n            j = i - 1\n            while j >= 0 and s[j] == '1':\n                s[j], s[i] = s[i], s[j]\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Move all '2's to the right, passing '1's\n    i = len(s) - 1\n    while i >= 0:\n        if s[i] == '2':\n            # Move '2' to the right as much as possible, swapping with '1's\n            j = i + 1\n            while j < len(s) and s[j] == '1':\n                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]\n                i -= 1\n                j += 1\n        i -= 1\n    \n    return ''.join(s)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\nprint(minimal_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Moving '0's to the left**: We iterate through the string and for each '0', we swap it to the left past any '1's encountered. This ensures that '0's are as far left as possible, contributing to a smaller lexicographical order.\n2. **Moving '2's to the right**: Similarly, we iterate from the end of the string and move each '2' to the right past any '1's encountered. This ensures that '2's are as far right as possible, also contributing to a smaller lexicographical order.\n\nBy combining these two steps, we ensure that the resulting string is the smallest possible lexicographical order given the constraints of the allowed swaps.",
