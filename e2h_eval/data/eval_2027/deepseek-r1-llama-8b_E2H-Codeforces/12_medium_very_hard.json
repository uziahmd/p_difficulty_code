The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai and has to do all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order matters because each subsequent task depends on being present at a certain point after previous ones.\n\nHmm. So for example, if the tasks are in the order [3,2,3], she first does task 1 (a1=3), then task 2 (a2=2), then task 3 (a3=3). But wait, wait. No, actually, the way the problem describes it is that for the i-th task, she needs to be in ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh right, the description says: \"to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Wait, that's a bit confusing. Or perhaps it's that for each task i, she must be in ai at some point before or when doing i? Or maybe more accurately, the i-th task can only be done after all j < i tasks are done.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to interpret it is that she must process the tasks in order from 1 to m. Because for the i-th task, she must have already completed tasks 1 to i-1. So the sequence is fixed as 1, 2, ..., m. But for each task i, she must be at position a_i at some point before or during handling task i. So the order is sequential.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal time required for her to start at 1, then go to a_1, then a_2, ..., up to a_m, but possibly skipping some steps if possible.\n\nWait, no. Because she can visit a_i multiple times. For example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n4 3\n3 2 3\n\nSo the sequence is 1 → 2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. That's 6 steps. So why does she go to 4 and back? Because the third task is 3 again. Wait, but after the second task, she's at 2. So for the third task, she needs to be at 3 again. So the path is 2 →3, which is 1 step. So total steps would be 1 (from 1→2) + 1 (2→3) + 1 (3→4) + 1 (4→1) + 1 (1→2) + 1 (2→3) = 6 steps.\n\nBut wait, how is that the minimal? Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the positions she needs to visit. She starts at 1. Then, for each task i, she needs to reach a_i, but she might have to do so without having to go all the way around the ring if possible.\n\nBut the key is that the tasks are processed in order. So, for each i, she must have visited a_i in the steps leading up to processing task i.\n\nSo the problem is similar to the traveling salesman problem but in a circular arrangement, where the order of visiting certain points is determined by the task sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to model this as the sum of the distances between consecutive required positions, considering the circular nature.\n\nLet me think about the positions she must visit in order. Starting from position 1, then a_1, then a_2, then a_3, etc. Each time moving to the next a_i from the current position, but since it's a ring, the distance can be computed as min( (b - a) % n, (a - b) % n ), but taking into account the direction.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is one-way, the movement is always clockwise. So the distance between two points is the minimum number of steps in the clockwise direction. So for any two points a and b, the distance is (b - a) mod n, but since movement is clockwise, you can't go the other way. So the distance from a to b is (b - a) if b >= a, else (n - a + b).\n\nWait, no, because the ring is a cycle. So the minimal steps from a to b in the clockwise direction is (b - a) % n if you consider the positions in a circular manner. Wait, for example, if a is 4 and n is 4, then the next position is 1. So the distance from 4 to 1 is 1 step. So for a=4, b=1, (1-4) mod 4 is (-3 mod4)=1, which is correct.\n\nWait, another way: the distance from a to b is (b - a) if b >= a, else (n - a + b). So for a=2, b=3, n=4: 3-2=1. For a=3, b=2: n -3 +2 =4-3+2=3 steps? Wait, that doesn't make sense because moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for any a and b, the clockwise distance from a to b is (b -a) if b >=a, else (b +n -a).\n\nWait, no. Because if a is 4 and b is 1, then (1-4) is -3, which mod 4 is 1. So (b -a) mod n gives the correct distance.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is (b - a) % n.\n\nYes, because for a=4, b=1: (1-4) = -3 mod4 is 1.\n\nFor a=3, b=2: (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4=3. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but for a=2, b=3: (3-2) mod4=1.\n\nSo, yes, the distance from a to b is (b -a) mod n.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the sequence of positions she must visit, which is the initial position (1) followed by each a_i in the given order.\n\n2. For each consecutive pair of positions, compute the distance between them, which is (next - current) mod n.\n\n3. Sum all these distances to get the total time.\n\nWait, but why? Because she moves from current to next, which takes as many steps as the distance.\n\nBut wait, what about when the same position is visited multiple times?\n\nIn the sample input, the sequence is 1 →3 →2 →3. So the distances are:\n\n3-1=2 mod4=2 steps.\n\nThen 2-3= -1 mod4=3 steps.\n\nThen 3-2=1 step.\n\nSo total steps: 2+3+1=6, which matches the sample.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 4 3 with a = [2,3,3].\n\nSo the sequence is 1 →2 →3 →3.\n\nDistances:\n\n2-1=1.\n\n3-2=1.\n\n3-3=0.\n\nTotal steps: 1+1+0=2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to model the problem as the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair in the ordered list of positions [1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_m].\n\nWait, but what if the list is longer? For example, if m is 105, then the list will have 106 elements (including 1). But calculating the sum should be manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list a.\n\n- Create a new list that starts with 1, followed by each element of a.\n\n- For each consecutive pair in this list, compute the distance as (next - current) mod n.\n\n- Sum all these distances and output the sum.\n\nWait, but wait! What about the case where a_i is the same as the previous a_i? Like in the second sample, where a is [2,3,3]. So after 3 comes 3. The distance is zero, which is correct, as she doesn't need to move.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo this seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, the steps would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCreate a list pos, starting with 1, then a[0], a[1], ..., a[m-1].\n\nCompute the sum of (pos[i+1] - pos[i]) mod n for i from 0 to len(pos)-2.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Because pos is 1 followed by a_1, a_2, ... a_m. So the length of pos is m+1.\n\nSo for i in range(len(pos)-1):\n\n   sum += (pos[i+1] - pos[i]) % n\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nWait, but let's test with the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\npos = [1,3,2,3]\n\nCompute each step:\n\n3-1=2 mod4=2.\n\n2-3= -1 mod4=3.\n\n3-2=1 mod4=1.\n\nSum: 2+3+1=6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]\n\npos = [1,2,3,3]\n\nSteps:\n\n2-1=1 mod4=1.\n\n3-2=1.\n\n3-3=0.\n\nSum 1+1+0=2.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: what if all a_i are 1?\n\nLike n=5, m=3, a = [1,1,1].\n\npos = [1,1,1,1]\n\nEach step is 0, sum is 0.\n\nAnother test case: a_i increases beyond n.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 1<= ai <=n, so that's not possible. So we don't have to worry about that.\n\nWhat about when a_i is 1 for the first task?\n\nLike n=5, m=2, a=[1,4].\n\npos is [1,1,4].\n\nDistance from 1 to 1 is 0.\n\nFrom 1 to4: 3 steps (since 4-1=3 mod5=3).\n\nSo total 0+3=3.\n\nSo she goes 1→1→4, which takes 3 steps.\n\nWait, but why can't she just move directly from 1 to4, skipping the intermediate 1? Well, because according to the problem statement, she must be at a_i for each task in the order given. So for the first task, she is at 1, so she doesn't need to move. Then, for the second task, she needs to be at 4, which is 3 steps away.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nSo now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n and m:\n\nFirst line: n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nSecond line: a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, create pos as [1] + a.\n\nThen, compute the sum.\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(pos) - 1):\n\n    current = pos[i]\n\n    next = pos[i+1]\n\n    distance = (next - current) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, that's the code.\n\nTesting it on the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\npos = [1,3,2,3]\n\nsum is (3-1) mod4=2, (2-3) mod4=3, (3-2) mod4=1 → total 6.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, m=3\n\na = [2,3,3]\n\npos = [1,2,3,3]\n\nsum is 1, 1, 0 → total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a = [1,4]\n\npos = [1,1,4]\n\nsum is 0 + (4-1 mod5) = 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,2]\n\npos = [1,2,2]\n\nsum is (2-1) mod2=1, (2-2) mod2=0 → total 1.\n\nWhich is correct. She starts at 1, moves to 2 (1 step), then stays. Total 1 step.\n\nWait, but why isn't it better to go directly from 1 to 2 in one step, which is indeed the case.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nI think this handles all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the given order, and she must be at the specified house when each task is done.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Xenia starts at house 1 and must visit several houses in a specific order to complete her tasks.\n   - The ring road is circular, meaning after the last house, she can only move back to the first house.\n   - The goal is to compute the minimal time required to complete all tasks by summing the distances between consecutive positions she visits.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The sequence of house visits must follow the order of tasks given. Starting from house 1, she must visit each subsequent house as specified.\n   - The distance between two consecutive houses in a circular ring can be computed using modular arithmetic to handle the wrap-around nature of the ring.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Construct a list of positions starting from house 1 followed by each task's target house.\n   - For each consecutive pair of positions in this list, compute the clockwise distance using modular arithmetic.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - The algorithm runs in O(m) time complexity, where m is the number of tasks, as it involves iterating through the list of tasks once to compute the total distance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\npositions = [1] + a\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(positions) - 1):\n    current = positions[i]\n    next_pos = positions[i + 1]\n    distance = (next_pos - current) % n\n    total_time += distance\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of target houses for each task.\n- **Constructing Positions**: We create a list `positions` that starts with house 1 (Xenia's starting point) followed by each target house from the task list.\n- **Computing Distances**: For each consecutive pair of positions in the `positions` list, we compute the clockwise distance using `(next_pos - current) % n`. This handles the wrap-around correctly.\n- **Summing Distances**: The total time is the sum of these individual distances, which gives the minimum time required for Xenia to complete all her tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring road.",
